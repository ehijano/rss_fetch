      <title>Exozodiacal dust as a limitation to exoplanet imaging and spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to planets and other small bodies, stellar systems will likely also host exozodiacal dust, or exozodi. This warm dust primarily resides in or near the habitable zone of a star, and scatters stellar light in visible to NIR wavelengths, possibly acting as a spatially inhomogeneous fog that can impede our ability to detect and characterize Earth-like exoplanets. By improving our knowledge of exozodi in the near term with strategic precursor observations and model development, we may be able to mitigate these effects to support a future search for signs of habitability and life with a direct imaging mission. This white paper introduces exozodi, summarizes its impact on directly imaging Earth-like exoplanets, and outlines several key knowledge gaps and near-term solutions to maximize the science return of future observations.</description>

      <title>A Radio Science Experiment for the Ramses Mission to Apophis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper outlines the Radio Science Experiment (RSE) proposed for the RAMSES mission to asteroid (99942) Apophis, which will undergo a close Earth encounter in April 2029. This event provides a unique opportunity to study the asteroid's physical and dynamical changes under strong tidal forces. The experiment leverages a combination of Earth-based radiometric measurements, optical imaging, and inter-satellite links between the RAMSES mothercraft and deployable subcraft in proximity to Apophis. Using high-precision Doppler and optical navigation data, the RSE aims to estimate the asteroid's mass, gravity field, and spin state with unparalleled accuracy, furthering our understanding of near-Earth asteroid evolution and internal structure. Simulation results show the robustness of the proposed mission scenario, highlighting the critical role of multi-probe configurations and novel inter-satellite link technologies in achieving accurate gravity science results.</description>

      <title>Lossy Compression of Scientific Data: Applications Constrains and Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing data volumes from scientific simulations and instruments (supercomputers, accelerators, telescopes) often exceed network, storage, and analysis capabilities. The scientific community's response to this challenge is scientific data reduction. Reduction can take many forms, such as triggering, sampling, filtering, quantization, and dimensionality reduction. This report focuses on a specific technique: lossy compression. Lossy compression retains all data points, leveraging correlations and controlled reduced accuracy. Quality constraints, especially for quantities of interest, are crucial for preserving scientific discoveries. User requirements also include compression ratio and speed. While many papers have been published on lossy compression techniques and reference datasets are shared by the community, there is a lack of detailed specifications of application needs that can guide lossy compression researchers and developers. This report fills this gap by reporting on the requirements and constraints of nine scientific applications covering a large spectrum of domains (climate, combustion, cosmology, fusion, light sources, molecular dynamics, quantum circuit simulation, seismology, and system logs). The report also details key lossy compression technologies (SZ, ZFP, MGARD, LC, SPERR, DCTZ, TEZip, LibPressio), discussing their history, principles, error control, hardware support, features, and impact. By presenting both application needs and compression technologies, the report aims to inspire new research to fill existing gaps.</description>

      <title>In-orbit Performance of the Soft X-ray Imaging Telescope Xtend aboard XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a summary of the in-orbit performance of the soft X-ray imaging telescope Xtend onboard the XRISM mission, based on in-flight observation data, including first-light celestial objects, calibration sources, and results from the cross-calibration campaign with other currently-operating X-ray observatories. XRISM/Xtend has a large field of view of $38.5'\times38.5'$, covering an energy range of 0.4--13 keV, as demonstrated by the first-light observation of the galaxy cluster Abell 2319. It also features an energy resolution of 170--180 eV at 6 keV, which meets the mission requirement and enables to resolve He-like and H-like Fe K$\alpha$ lines. Throughout the observation during the performance verification phase, we confirm that two issues identified in SXI onboard the previous Hitomi mission -- light leakage and crosstalk events -- are addressed and suppressed in the case of Xtend. A joint cross-calibration observation of the bright quasar 3C273 results in an effective area measured to be $\sim420$ cm$^{2}$@1.5 keV and $\sim310$ cm$^{2}$@6.0 keV, which matches values obtained in ground tests. We also continuously monitor the health of Xtend by analyzing overclocking data, calibration source spectra, and day-Earth observations: the readout noise is stable and low, and contamination is negligible even one year after launch. A low background level compared to other major X-ray instruments onboard satellites, combined with the largest grasp ($\Omega_{\rm eff}\sim60$ ${\rm cm^2~degree^2}$) of Xtend, will not only support Resolve analysis, but also enable significant scientific results on its own. This includes near future follow-up observations and transient searches in the context of time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Toward Optimisation of a Sub-Terahertz Spaceborne VLBI Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) provides the finest angular resolution of all astronomical observation techniques. However, observations with Earth-based instruments are approaching fundamental limits on angular resolution. These can only be overcome by placing at least one interferometric element in space. In this paper, several concepts of spaceborne VLBI systems are discussed, including TeraHertz Exploration and Zooming-in for Astrophysics (THEZA) and the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX). Spaceborne VLBI telescopes have some of the most demanding requirements of any space science mission. The VLBI system as a whole includes globally distributed elements, each with their own functional constraints, limiting when observations can be performed. This necessitates optimisation of the system parameters in order to maximise the scientific return of the mission. Presented is an investigation into how the impact of the functional constraints of a spaceborne VLBI telescope affect the overall system performance. A preliminary analysis of how these constraints can be minimised through optimisation of the spacecraft configuration and operation is also provided. A space-based VLBI simulation tool (spacevlbi) has been developed to model such missions and its capabilities are demonstrated throughout the paper. It is imperative that the functional constraints are considered early in the design of the future space-based VLBI systems in order to generate feasible mission concepts and to identify the key technology developments required to mitigate these limitations.</description>

      <title>To detect strong nugget with an acoustic array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article discusses strong nuggets (SNs) which means strong interaction condensed matter clusters with a mass of about $10^6\,$g. They may originate from the early universe, supernova, pulsar merger event, and so on. Depending on the equation of state, the SNs could be stable and even be one of the candidates for dark matter. In order to detect SNs which hitting the Earth or the Moon at a non-relativistic velocity, a new messenger, the acoustic array, is analysed. The results of the calculations show that the impact signal of an SN can be detected at a distance of about 30 kilometers from the nugget's trajectory. By using microphone boxes, hydrophones or seismographs to construct an array in the bedrock, ocean or on the Moon, it is possible to reconstruct the velocity, mass, and interacting cross section of SNs, and then constrain also the nature of supra-nuclear matter. The acoustic array can also be used for distributed acoustic sensing of meteorites or earthquakes. The sonar localisation system on the proposed High-energy Underwater Neutrino Telescope (HUNT) is suggested as a pathfinder for acoustic array detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have created a new image analysis pipeline to reprocess images taken by the Near Earth Asteroid Tracking survey and have applied it to ten nights of observations. This work is the first large-scale reprocessing of images from an asteroid discovery survey in which thousands of archived images are re-calibrated, searched for minor planets, and resulting observations are reported to the Minor Planet Center. We describe the software used to extract, calibrate, and clean sources from the images, including specific techniques that accommodate the unique features of these archival images. This pipeline is able to find fainter asteroids than the original pipeline.</description>

      <title>Optimising Radial Velocity Detection Limits for Southern Habitable Worlds Observatory Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The planned NASA Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) flagship mission aims to image and spectroscopically characterise 25 Earth-size planets in the habitable zones of their stars. However, one giant planet in the habitable zone can ruin your whole day. Recent work has examined the current state of our knowledge on the presence or absence of such objects in samples of likely HWO targets, and that knowledge has been found wanting; even Saturn-mass planets remain undetectable in many of these systems. In this work, we present simulations assessing the degree to which new campaigns of high-cadence radial velocity observations can ameliorate this woeful state of affairs. In particular, we highlight the value of moderate-precision but highly flexibly-scheduled RV facilities in aiding this necessary HWO precursor science. We find that for a subset of Southern HWO stars, 6 years of new RVs from the Minerva-Australis telescope array in Australia can improve the median detection sensitivity in the habitable zones of 13 likely HWO targets to $\sim$50 Earth masses, an improvement of $\sim$44%.</description>

      <title>Impact of Spectral Resolution on S-index and Its Application to Spectroscopic Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the PHOENIX synthetic spectra, we investigated the impact of spectral resolution on the calculation of $S$-indices. We found that for spectra with a resolution lower than $\approx$30,000, it is crucial to calibrate $S$-indices for accurate estimations. This is especially essential for low-resolution spectral observations. We provided calibrations for several ongoing or upcoming spectroscopic surveys such as the LAMOST low-resolution survey, the SEGUE survey, the SDSS-V/BOSS survey, the DESI survey, the MSE survey, and the MUST survey. Using common targets between the HARPS and MWO observations, we established conversions from spectral $S$-indices to the well-known $S_{\rm MWO}$ values, applicable to stars with [Fe/H] values greater than $-$1. These calibrations offer a reliable approach to convert $S$-indices obtained from various spectroscopic surveys into $S_{\rm{MWO}}$ values and can be widely applied in studies on chromospheric activity.</description>

      <title>The influence of stellar activity on detecting Earth-like planets via nulling interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The direct imaging of Earth-like planets in solar neighbors is challenging. Both transit and radial velocity (RV) methods suffer from noise due to stellar activity. By choosing a typical configuration of an X array interferometer, we used theoretical formulas to calculate the intrinsic Poisson noise and the noise of stellar activities. Assuming a fixed array with no rotation and ignoring other systematic and astrophysical noises, we considered a single active region on a stellar disk, including both spots and flares with different parameters, for instance, the position, size, and temperature of the active regions. Then we simulated the S/N of Earth-like planets in HZ around G dwarf stars (solar-like) and M dwarfs (Proxima-like), with different stellar activities in the mid-infrared (MIR) band ( 7-12 $\mu$m). The noise attributed to stellar activity has much less influence than the Transit and RV method when detecting Earth-like planets around both G and M dwarfs. I.e. Stellar activity can hardly influence the detection of Earth-like planets around G dwarf stars. However, detecting Earth-like planets around M dwarfs, which are usually more active, can be significantly hindered. We also analyzed the uncertainty of the planet's location due to the deduced S/N. Consequently, we have determined the possibility of mistaking a planet in the HZ as being outside the HZ based on an erroneous S/N measurement. Selecting quiescent target stars or monitoring the light curves of stars would be a helpful way to get rid of contaminates associated with violent stellar activities.</description>

      <title>The core software and simulation activities for data analysis at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory, located near the town Malarg\"ue in the province of Mendoza, Argentina, is the largest cosmic-ray detector in existence, covering an area of 3000 km2. The upgraded Observatory, in Phase II of operations, consists of a surface array of 1660 stations combining water Cherenkov, scintillator, and radio detectors. A subset of stations also includes underground muon detectors. Additionally, fluorescence detectors located at four sites overlook the array. The science goals for the enhanced Observatory include the measurement of the properties of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with large statistics and high sensitivity to the primary composition. The Observatory is also sensitive to photons and neutrinos at the highest energies, allowing it to participate in multi-messenger studies. The Auger Offline Framework provides the tools to perform detailed simulations, using the Geant 4 toolkit, of all components of the Observatory and the analysis of both data and simulated events. It proved to have the flexibility needed to evolve during the lifetime of the Observatory, to accommodate new sub-detectors and, recently, changes to the station readout electronics. A new challenge is interfacing the framework with Machine Learning tools for both the development and execution of neural-network-based algorithms. Independent of the framework, CORSIKA 7 is used to simulate particles, fluorescence light, and radio signals produced by air showers. The production of simulations is coordinated centrally to provide standard libraries for analyses and to optimize the use of computing resources. We will describe the evolution and status of the Offline Framework and the tools used to coordinate the simulation efforts. We will also discuss the challenges of the massive simulation efforts and the resources consumed to provide the simulation libraries required by the Collaboration.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Lensing of Galaxy Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate lensing reconstruction using the clustered galaxy distribution as a source field, using both the traditional cosmic microwave background quadratic estimator and a shear-only estimator. We calculate the expected signal-to-noise ratio of the cross power spectrum of such reconstructions with cosmic shear measurements for an LSST-like galaxy survey. Modeling the galaxy field as a Gaussian random field, we find that there is substantial clustering signal in the source field at angular scales substantially smaller than those typically used by CMB reconstructions. The expected signal-to-noise for cross-correlations in LSST from cosmic shear is $\sim$60 in the presence of shape noise, while cross correlating with a sample-variance limited mass map would have signal-to-noise in the hundreds. This type of cross-correlation could be used as a way to identify systematic errors in lensing studies and is just one example of many possible higher order correlations in galaxy surveys that may contain substantial cosmological information.</description>

      <title>HERACLES++: A multidimensional Eulerian code for exascale computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of multidimensional astrophysical fluids present considerable challenges. However, the development of exascale computing has significantly enhanced computational capabilities, motivating the development of new codes that can take full advantage of these resources. In this article, we introduce HERACLES++, a new hydrodynamics code with high portability, optimized for exascale machines with different architectures and running efficiently both on CPUs and GPUs. The code is Eulerian and employs a Godunov finite-volume method to solve the hydrodynamics equations, which ensures accuracy in capturing shocks and discontinuities. It includes different Riemann solvers, equations of state, and gravity solvers. It works in Cartesian and spherical coordinates, either in 1D, 2D, or 3D, and uses passive scalars to handle gases with several species. The code accepts a user-supplied heating or cooling term to treat a variety of astrophysical contexts. In addition to the usual series of benchmarking tests, we use HERACLES++ to simulate the propagation of a supernova shock in a red-supergiant star envelope, from minutes after core collapse until shock emergence. In 1D, the results from HERACLES++ are in agreement with those of V1D for the same configuration. In 3D, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability develops and modifies the 1D picture by introducing density and composition fluctuations as well as turbulence. The focus on a wedge, rather than the full solid angle, and the ability to run HERACLES++ with a large number of GPUs allow for long-term simulations of 3D supernova ejecta with a sub-degree resolution. Future developments will extend HERACLES++ to a radiation-hydrodynamics code.</description>

      <title>Investigating the relationship between bolide entry angle and apparent direction of infrasound signal arrivals</title>

Abstract: Infrasound sensing offers critical capabilities for detecting and geolocating bolide events globally. However, the observed back azimuths, directions from which infrasound signals arrive at stations, often differ from the theoretical expectations based on the bolide's peak brightness location. For objects with shallow entry angles, which traverse longer atmospheric paths, acoustic energy may be emitted from multiple points along the trajectory, leading to substantial variability in back azimuth residuals. This study investigates how the entry angle of energetic bolides affects the back azimuth deviations, independent of extrinsic factors such as atmospheric propagation, station noise, and signal processing methodologies. A theoretical framework, the Bolide Infrasound Back-Azimuth EXplorer Model (BIBEX-M), was developed to compute predicted back azimuths solely from geometric considerations. The model quantifies how these residuals vary as a function of source-to-receiver distance, revealing that bolides entering at shallow angles of 10 degrees can experience average residuals of 20 degrees, with deviations reaching up to 46 degrees at distances below 1000 km, and remaining significant even at 10,000 km. In contrast, bolides with steeper entry angles (greater than 60 degrees) show much smaller deviations, typically under 5 degrees at 1000 km and diminishing to less than 1 deg beyond 5000 km. These findings attest to the need for careful interpretation when evaluating signal detections and estimating bolide locations. This work is not only pertinent to bolides but also to other high-energy, extended-duration atmospheric phenomena such as space debris and reentry events, where similar geometric considerations can influence infrasound arrival directions.</description>

      <title>Characterising the Atmosphere of 55 Cancri e: 1D Forward Model Grid for Current and Future JWST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15844</link>

Abstract: Recent JWST observations with NIRCam and MIRI of the ultra-short-period super-Earth 55 Cancri e indicate a possible volatile atmosphere surrounding the planet. Previous analysis of the NIRCam spectra suggested potential absorption features from CO2 or CO and significant sub-weekly variability. The MIRI low-resolution spectrum does not contain substantial features but was found to be consistent with effective heat redistribution models. In this work, we computed a grid of over 25000 self-consistent 1D forward models incorporating H-N-O-C-S-P-Si-Ti equilibrium chemistry and assessed plausible atmospheric compositions based on the current JWST data. Despite exhaustive analysis, the composition and properties of the atmosphere remain elusive. While our results statistically favour a global, hydrogen-free, nitrogen-dominated atmosphere enriched in PO and CO2, various alternative compositions, including H2O-,CO-, PH3-, or Si-bearing remain viable explanations. Unconstrained heat redistribution efficiency and absolute NIRCam flux are among the largest sources of uncertainty in our analysis. We also find that the heat redistribution factor and surface pressure are highly degenerate with atmospheric composition, and that these parameters cannot be independently constrained using current JWST observations. Furthermore, we show that the observed variability may arise from dynamic interactions between the atmosphere and an underlying magma ocean, driving rapid shifts in atmospheric chemistry and thermal emission. Our results highlight the importance of using self-consistent forward models when analysing novel JWST spectra with limited signal-to-noise ratios -- such as those of 55 Cancri e -- as it allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of potential atmospheric scenarios while also being less sensitive to subtle spectral differences than retrievals...</description>
