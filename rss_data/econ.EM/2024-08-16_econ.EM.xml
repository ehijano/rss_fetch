      <title>Quantile and Distribution Treatment Effects on the Treated with Possibly Non-Continuous Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantile and Distribution Treatment effects on the Treated (QTT/DTT) for non-continuous outcomes are either not identified or inference thereon is infeasible using existing methods. By introducing functional index parallel trends and no anticipation assumptions, this paper identifies and provides uniform inference procedures for QTT/DTT. The inference procedure applies under both the canonical two-group and staggered treatment designs with balanced panels, unbalanced panels, or repeated cross-sections. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate the proposed method's robust and competitive performance, while an empirical application illustrates its practical utility.</description>

      <title>Eliciting ambiguity with mixing bets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07447</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.07447v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preferences for mixing can reveal ambiguity perception and attitude on a single event. The validity of the approach is discussed for multiple preference classes including maxmin, maxmax, variational, and smooth second-order preferences. An experimental implementation suggests that participants perceive almost as much ambiguity for the stock index and actions of other participants as for the Ellsberg urn, indicating the importance of ambiguity in real-world decision-making.</description>

      <title>Spillovers of Program Benefits with Missing Network Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.09614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The issue of missing network links in partially observed networks is frequently neglected in empirical studies. This paper addresses this issue when investigating the spillovers of program benefits in the presence of network interactions. Our method is flexible enough to account for non-i.i.d. missing links. It relies on two network measures that can be easily constructed based on the incoming and outgoing links of the same observed network. The treatment and spillover effects can be point identified and consistently estimated if network degrees are bounded for all units. We also demonstrate the bias reduction property of our method if network degrees of some units are unbounded. Monte Carlo experiments and a naturalistic simulation on real-world network data are implemented to verify the finite-sample performance of our method. We also re-examine the spillover effects of home computer use on children's self-empowered learning.</description>

      <title>Testing homogeneity in dynamic discrete games in finite samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.02297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The literature on dynamic discrete games often assumes that the conditional choice probabilities and the state transition probabilities are homogeneous across markets and over time. We refer to this as the "homogeneity assumption" in dynamic discrete games. This assumption enables empirical studies to estimate the game's structural parameters by pooling data from multiple markets and from many time periods. In this paper, we propose a hypothesis test to evaluate whether the homogeneity assumption holds in the data. Our hypothesis test is the result of an approximate randomization test, implemented via a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. We show that our hypothesis test becomes valid as the (user-defined) number of MCMC draws diverges, for any fixed number of markets, time periods, and players. We apply our test to the empirical study of the U.S.\ Portland cement industry in Ryan (2012).</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Quantile Factor Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10301v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends quantile factor analysis to a probabilistic variant that incorporates regularization and computationally efficient variational approximations. We establish through synthetic and real data experiments that the proposed estimator can, in many cases, achieve better accuracy than a recently proposed loss-based estimator. We contribute to the factor analysis literature by extracting new indexes of \emph{low}, \emph{medium}, and \emph{high} economic policy uncertainty, as well as \emph{loose}, \emph{median}, and \emph{tight} financial conditions. We show that the high uncertainty and tight financial conditions indexes have superior predictive ability for various measures of economic activity. In a high-dimensional exercise involving about 1000 daily financial series, we find that quantile factors also provide superior out-of-sample information compared to mean or median factors.</description>

      <title>Robust Inference for High-Dimensional Panel Data Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a robust estimation and inferential method for high-dimensional panel data models. Specifically, (1) we investigate the case where the number of regressors can grow faster than the sample size, (2) we pay particular attention to non-Gaussian, serially and cross-sectionally correlated and heteroskedastic error processes, and (3) we develop an estimation method for high-dimensional long-run covariance matrix using a thresholded estimator.
  Methodologically and technically, we develop two Nagaev-types of concentration inequalities: one for a partial sum and the other for a quadratic form, subject to a set of easily verifiable conditions. Leveraging these two inequalities, we also derive a non-asymptotic bound for the LASSO estimator, achieve asymptotic normality via the node-wise LASSO regression, and establish a sharp convergence rate for the thresholded heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) estimator.
  Our study thus provides the relevant literature with a complete toolkit for conducting inference about the parameters of interest involved in a high-dimensional panel data framework. We also demonstrate the practical relevance of these theoretical results by investigating a high-dimensional panel data model with interactive fixed effects. Moreover, we conduct extensive numerical studies using simulated and real data examples.</description>
