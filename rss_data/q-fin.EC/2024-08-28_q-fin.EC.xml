      <title>A new approach to the theory of optimal income tax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nobel-price winning Mirrlees' theory of optimal taxation inspired a long sequence of research on its refinement and enhancement. However, an issue of concern has been always the fact that, as was shown in many publications, the optimal schedule in Mirrlees' paradigm of maximising the total utility (constructed from individually optimised individual ones) usually did not lead to progressive taxation (contradicting the ethically supported practice in developed economies), and often even assigned minimal tax rates to the higher paid strata of society. The first objective of this paper is to support this conclusion by proving a theorem on optimal tax schedule in (practically most exploited) piecewise-linear environment under a simplest natural utility function. The second objective is to suggest a new paradigm for optimal taxation, where instead of just total average utility maximization one introduces a standard deviation of utility as a second parameter (in some analogy with Marcowitz portfolio optimization). We show that this approach leads to transparent and easy interpreted optimality criteria for income tax.</description>

      <title>Time is Knowledge: What Response Times Reveal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Response times contain information about economically relevant but unobserved variables like willingness to pay, preference intensity, quality, or happiness. Here, we provide a general characterization of the properties of latent variables that can be detected using response time data. Our characterization generalizes various results in the literature, helps to solve identification problems of binary response models, and paves the way for many new applications. We apply the result to test the hypothesis that marginal happiness is decreasing in income, a principle that is commonly accepted but so far not established empirically.</description>

      <title>From Workplace to Residence: The Spillover Effects of Minimum Wage Policies on Local Housing Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.01791v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent rise of sub-national minimum wage (MW) policies in the US has resulted in significant dispersion of MW levels within urban areas. In this paper, we study the spillover effects of these policies on local rental markets through commuting. To do so, for each USPS ZIP code we construct a "workplace" MW measure based on the location of its resident's jobs, and use it to estimate the effect of MW policies on rents. We use a novel identification strategy that exploits the fine timing of differential changes in the workplace MW across ZIP codes that share the same "residence" MW, defined as the same location's MW. Our baseline results imply that a 10 percent increase in the workplace MW increases rents at residence ZIP codes by 0.69 percent. To illustrate the importance of commuting patterns, we use our estimates and a simple model to simulate the impact of federal and city counterfactual MW policies. The simulations suggest that landlords pocket approximately 10 cents of each dollar generated by the MW across directly and indirectly affected areas, though the incidence on landlords varies systematically across space.</description>

      <title>Temptation: Immediacy and certainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14955v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Is an option especially tempting when it is both immediate and certain? I test the effect of risk on the present-bias factor given quasi-hyperbolic discounting. In my experiment workers allocate about thirty to fifty minutes of real-effort tasks between two weeks. I study dynamic consistency by comparing choices made two days in advance of the workday with choices made when work is imminent. My novel design permits estimation of present bias using a decision with a consequence that is both immediate and certain. I find greater present bias when the consequence is certain. This finding has implications for any economic decision involving a present-biased decision-maker, including labor contracting and consumer good pricing. I offer a methodological remedy for experimental economists.</description>
