      <title>Engineered Zwitterion-Infused Clay Composites with Antibacterial and Antifungal Efficacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microbes and pathogens play a detrimental role in healing wounds, causing infections like impetigo through bodily fluids and skin and entering the bloodstream through the wounds, thereby hindering the healing process and tissue regeneration. Clay, known for its long history of natural therapeutic use, has emerged as one of the most promising candidates for biomedical applications due to its non-toxic nature, porosity, high surface area, ubiquity, and excellent cation exchange capacity. This study demonstrates an innovative approach to engineering an organo-functionalized, infection-resistant, easy-to-use bandage material from clay, an environmentally benign and sustainable material. The hybrid membranes have been developed using clays, zwitterions, silver ions, and terbinafine hydrochloride (TBH) to impart antibacterial and antifungal efficacy. A critical aspect of this study is embedding organic molecules and metal ions with the clays and releasing them to resist the growth and kill the pathogens. The antimicrobial efficacy of the membranes has been tested using a zone of inhibition study against the most common microbes in skin wounds, viz. S. aureus, E. coli, and C. albicans. Results from our studies not only demonstrate the potential of these hybrid clay membranes as a cost-effective, scalable, and effective solution for treating microbial infections but also instill newer avenues for point-of-care wound-healing treatments, offering hope for improved patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Molecular Docking via Weighted Subgraph Isomorphism on Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular docking is an essential step in the drug discovery process involving the detection of three-dimensional poses of a ligand inside the active site of the protein. In this paper, we address the Molecular Docking search phase by formulating the problem in QUBO terms, suitable for an annealing approach. We propose a problem formulation as a weighted subgraph isomorphism between the ligand graph and the grid of the target protein pocket. In particular, we applied a graph representation to the ligand embedding all the geometrical properties of the molecule including its flexibility, and we created a weighted spatial grid to the 3D space region inside the pocket. Results and performance obtained with quantum annealers are compared with classical simulated annealing solvers.</description>
