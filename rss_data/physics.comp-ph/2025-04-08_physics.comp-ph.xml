      <title>Improvement of Clamonds solution of the Colebrook-White equation -- highest accuracy for engineering purposes with one iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Colebrook-White equation is the widely used basis for the calculation of the friction factor lambda for flows in pipes and ducts. Because this equation is implicit in lambda, many solutions have been developed to ease the calculation in order to reduce the effort and to reach a sufficient accuracy. Clamond has proposed in 2008 an iterative solution that requires maximally two iterations to obtain the machine double precision. Here an improvement of this solution is presented, that achieves already with one iteration a maximal error of 2.79E-7, what is more than sufficient for most engineering purposes. This solution is compared in a chart of CPU time versus accuracy with 28 solutions from the literature and in the group of the fastest solutions, that require only two calls of the logarithm function, it proved to be by far the most accurate one.</description>

      <title>Improving the robustness of the immersed interface method through regularized velocity reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust, broadly applicable fluid-structure interaction (FSI) algorithms remain a challenge for computational mechanics. In previous work, we introduced an immersed interface method (IIM) for discrete surfaces and an extension based on an immersed Lagrangia-Eulerian (ILE) coupling strategy for modeling FSI involving complex geometries. The ability of the method to sharply resolve stress discontinuities induced by singular immersed boundary forces in the presence of low-regularity geometrical representations makes it a compelling choice for three-dimensional modeling of complex geometries in diverse engineering applications. Although the IIM we previously introduced offers many desirable advantages, it also imposes a restrictive mesh factor ratio, requiring the surface mesh to be coarser than the fluid grid to ensure stability. This is because when the mesh factor ratio constraint is not satisfied, parts of the structure motion are not controlled by the discrete FSI system. This constraint can significantly increase computational costs, particularly in applications involving multiscale geometries with highly localized complexity or fine-scale features. To address this limitation, we devise a stabilization strategy for the velocity restriction operator inspired by Tikhonov regularization. This study demonstrates that using a stabilized velocity restriction operator in IIM enables a broader range of structure-to-fluid grid-size ratios without compromising accuracy or altering the flow dynamics. This advancement significantly broadens the applicability of the method to real-world FSI problems involving complex geometries and dynamic conditions, offering a robust and computationally efficient solution.</description>

      <title>GPU-based compressible lattice Boltzmann simulations on non-uniform grids using standard C++ parallelism: From best practices to aerodynamics, aeroacoustics and supersonic flow simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite decades of research, designing accurate, robust, and efficient lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) on non-uniform grids with seamless GPU acceleration remains challenging. This work introduces a novel strategy using simple yet effective components: (1) parallel algorithms in modern C++, (2) conservative cell-centered grid refinement, (3) local boundary conditions, and (4) robust collision models. Our framework supports multiple lattices (D2Q9, D2Q13, D2Q21, D2Q37) chosen based on flow conditions. It includes collision models with polynomial and numerical equilibria, a second distribution for polyatomic behavior, a Jameson-like shock sensor, and relies on a generalization of Rohde's refinement strategy. Validation spans diverse benchmarks: lid-driven cavity flows, Aeolian noise, 30P30N airfoil aerodynamics, inviscid Riemann problems, and viscous flows past a NACA airfoil in transonic and supersonic regimes. Beyond its accuracy and stability, the portability of modern C++ leads to GPU-native performance while ensuring high modularity and ease of implementation. On non-uniform grids, weakly compressible LBMs achieve state-of-the-art GPU efficiency, and fully compressible LBMs benefit from GPU acceleration equivalent to thousands of CPU cores in the most compute-intensive cases. On top of this, our advanced performance models incorporate neighbor-list and asynchronous time-stepping effects which provide new insights into the performance decomposition of LB simulations on non-uniform grids. Overall, this study sets a new standard for portable, tree-based LBMs, demonstrating that a combination of simple, well-chosen components can achieve high performance, accuracy, and robustness across a wide range of flow conditions. As a final proof-of-concept, adaptive mesh refinement is proposed for subsonic and supersonic applications.</description>

      <title>asKAN: Active Subspace embedded Kolmogorov-Arnold Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) has emerged as a promising neural network architecture for small-scale AI+Science applications. However, it suffers from inflexibility in modeling ridge functions, which is widely used in representing the relationships in physical systems. This study investigates this inflexibility through the lens of the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem, which starts the representation of multivariate functions from constructing the univariate components rather than combining the independent variables. Our analysis reveals that incorporating linear combinations of independent variables can substantially simplify the network architecture in representing the ridge functions. Inspired by this finding, we propose active subspace embedded KAN (asKAN), a hierarchical framework that synergizes KAN's function representation with active subspace methodology. The architecture strategically embeds active subspace detection between KANs, where the active subspace method is used to identify the primary ridge directions and the independent variables are adaptively projected onto these critical dimensions. The proposed asKAN is implemented in an iterative way without increasing the number of neurons in the original KAN. The proposed method is validated through function fitting, solving the Poisson equation, and reconstructing sound field. Compared with KAN, asKAN significantly reduces the error using the same network architecture. The results suggest that asKAN enhances the capability of KAN in fitting and solving equations with in the form of ridge functions.</description>

      <title>Regression Model for Measurement of Wound Dimensions by Webcam Scanners and Time-of-Flight Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One use of image processing is for medical equipment such as wound identification. This technology is carried out non-invasively by taking images so as to avoid direct touch with the wound thereby reducing the possibility of infection. The images obtained using the RGB camera will be used for color segmentation which will measure the wound dimensions. However, the image data is in the form of a raster, the distance will affect the pixel size. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the distance of the camera measurement to the object. The time-of-flight (ToF) method with a lidar sensor is used to calculate the distance of the camera to the object. It is necessary to calculate the ratio of the distance to the number of pixels obtained so that the value is always consistent. This study analyzed the use of appropriate ratios and regression systems on a webcam and a lidar sensor for measuring wound dimensions. The results of the study show that there is a regression model with a second-order polynomial relationship for the distance and number of pixels obtained consistently with an error value of less than 5% which shows very good results</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in swarm optimization algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural systems often exhibit chaotic behavior in their space-time evolution. Systems transiting between chaos and order manifest a potential to compute, as shown with cellular automata and artificial neural networks. We demonstrate that swarms optimisation algorithms also exhibit transitions from chaos, analogous to motion of gas molecules, when particles explore solution space disorderly, to order, when particles follow a leader, similar to molecules propagating along diffusion gradients in liquid solutions of reagents. We analyse these `phase-like' transitions in swarm optimization algorithms using recurrence quantification analysis and Lempel-Ziv complexity estimation. We demonstrate that converging and non-converging iterations of the optimization algorithms are statistically different in a view of applied chaos, complexity and predictability estimating indicators.</description>

      <title>Ordering transition of the three-dimensional four-state random-field Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin systems exposed to the influence of random magnetic fields are paradigmatic examples for studying the effect of quenched disorder on condensed-matter systems. In this context, previous studies have almost exclusively focused on systems with Ising or continuous symmetries, while the Potts symmetry, albeit being of fundamental importance also for the description of realistic physical systems, has received very little attention. In the present study, we use a recently developed quasi-exact method for determining ground states in the random-field Potts model to study the problem with four states. Extending the protocol applied for the three-state model, we use extensive finite-size scaling analyses of the magnetization, Binder parameter, energy cumulant, specific heat, and the connected as well as disconnected susceptibilities to study the magnetic ordering transition of the model. In contrast to the system in the absence of disorder, we find compelling evidence for a continuous transition, and we precisely determine the critical point as well as the critical exponents, which are found to differ from the exponents of the three-state system as well as from those of the random-field Ising model.</description>

      <title>A posteriori closure of turbulence models: are symmetries preserved ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence modeling remains a longstanding challenge in fluid dynamics. Recent advances in data-driven methods have led to a surge of novel approaches aimed at addressing this problem. This work builds upon our previous study (arXiv:2411.13194), where we introduced a new closure for a shell model of turbulence using an a posteriori (or solver-in-the-loop) approach. Unlike most deep learning-based models, our method explicitly incorporates physical equations into the neural network framework, ensuring that the closure remains constrained by the underlying physics benefiting from enhanced stability and generalizability. In this paper, we further analyze the learned closure, probing its capabilities and limitations. In particular, we look at joint probability density functions to assess whether cross-correlations are well preserved or if just the mean behavior is captured. Additionally, we investigate the scale invariance of multipliers - ratios between adjacent shells - within the inertial range. Although our model excels in reproducing high-order observables such as flatness, it breaks this known symmetry near the cutoff, indicating a fundamental limitation. We discuss the implications of these findings for subgrid-scale modeling in 3D turbulence and outline directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Reactivity in Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Quantum Dots: Charge-Density Asymmetry and Hydrodesulfurization Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum dots (QDs) are nanoscale materials that exhibit unique electronic and optical properties due to quantum confinement effects, making them highly relevant for applications in catalysis, optoelectronics, and energy conversion. While transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) QDs have been extensively studied in their pristine forms, Janus-type TMD QDs -- featuring compositional asymmetry across their atomic layers -- offer an additional degree of tunability through charge-density gradients and curvature effects, yet remain comparatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate the electronic and structural properties of Janus TMD QDs composed of molybdenum (Mo) or tungsten (W) in combination with chalcogen elements (S, Se, Te) and oxygen, exploring three distinct structural classes: pristine, non-oxidized Janus, and oxidized Janus phases. Using first-principles calculations, including static DFT and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, we analyze curvature evolution, electrostatic potential isosurfaces, charge-density asymmetry, and surface formation energies to assess size- and composition-dependent stability. Our findings reveal that oxidation induces significant curvature and charge localization, particularly in W-based systems, enhancing their potential as catalysts for hydrodesulfurization reactions. Additionally, we identify size- and geometry-dependent stability trends, with larger and beta-type QDs exhibiting superior thermodynamic and thermal robustness. These results provide a comprehensive theoretical foundation for the design and synthesis of structurally tunable Janus QDs with tailored properties for catalytic and electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetized ICF implosions: ignition at low laser energy using designs with more ablator mass remaining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is the first work to redesign a spherical ICF implosion to best utilize the benefits of applying an external magnetic field. The sub-ignition experiment N170601 is taken as the baseline design, which used 1.57MJ of laser energy. The optimum magnetized design benefits from increasing the shell thickness by 14$\mu$m and decreasing the ice thickness by 18$\mu$m, resulting in a neutron yield of 8.9$\times$10$^{17}$. This is 34$\times$ greater than the unmagnetized simulation of the same design, and 18.5$\times$ the greatest unmagnetized simulation across all designs simulated. The resultant implosion velocity for the magnetized design is lower, which would also reduce ablation front instability growth. This design was found by using a simplified 1D magnetization model, then validated against full 2D extended-MHD capsule simulations with radiation asymmetries applied to correct the shape.</description>

      <title>Dimensionless learning based on information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dimensional analysis is one of the most fundamental tools for understanding physical systems. However, the construction of dimensionless variables, as guided by the Buckingham-$\pi$ theorem, is not uniquely determined. Here, we introduce IT-$\pi$, a model-free method that combines dimensionless learning with the principles of information theory. Grounded in the irreducible error theorem, IT-$\pi$ identifies dimensionless variables with the highest predictive power by measuring their shared information content. The approach is able to rank variables by predictability, identify distinct physical regimes, uncover self-similar variables, determine the characteristic scales of the problem, and extract its dimensionless parameters. IT-$\pi$ also provides a bound of the minimum predictive error achievable across all possible models, from simple linear regression to advanced deep learning techniques, naturally enabling a definition of model efficiency. We benchmark IT-$\pi$ across different cases and demonstrate that it offers superior performance and capabilities compared to existing tools. The method is also applied to conduct dimensionless learning for supersonic turbulence, aerodynamic drag on both smooth and irregular surfaces, magnetohydrodynamic power generation, and laser-metal interaction.</description>

      <title>Parametric Operator Inference to Simulate the Purging Process in Semiconductor Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the application of parametric Operator Inference (OpInf) -- a nonintrusive reduced-order modeling (ROM) technique that learns a low-dimensional representation of a high-fidelity model -- to the numerical model of the purging process in semiconductor manufacturing. Leveraging the data-driven nature of the OpInf framework, we aim to forecast the flow field within a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) chamber using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation data. Our model simplifies the system by excluding plasma dynamics and chemical reactions, while still capturing the key features of the purging flow behavior. The parametric OpInf framework learns nine ROMs based on varying argon mass flow rates at the inlet and different outlet pressures. It then interpolates these ROMs to predict the system's behavior for 25 parameter combinations, including 16 scenarios that are not seen in training. The parametric OpInf ROMs, trained on 36\% of the data and tested on 64\%, demonstrate accuracy across the entire parameter domain, with a maximum error of 9.32\%. Furthermore, the ROM achieves an approximate 142-fold speedup in online computations compared to the full-order model CFD simulation. These OpInf ROMs may be used for fast and accurate predictions of the purging flow in the PECVD chamber, which could facilitate effective particle contamination control in semiconductor manufacturing.</description>

      <title>TensorSymmetry: a package to get symmetry-adapted tensors disentangling spin-orbit coupling effect and establishing analytical relationship with magnetic order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetry-constrained response tensors on transport, optical, and electromagnetic effects are of central importance in condensed matter physics because they can guide experimental detections and verify theoretical calculations. These tensors encompass various forms, including polar, axial, i-type (time-reversal even), and c-type (time-reversal odd) matrixes. The commonly used magnetic groups, however, fail to describe the phenomena without the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect and cannot build the analytical relationship between magnetic orders with response tensors in magnetic materials. Developing approaches on these two aspects is quite demanding for theory and experiment. In this paper, we use the magnetic group, spin group, and extrinsic parameter method comprehensively to investigate the symmetry-constrained response tensors, then implement the above method in a platform called "TensorSymmetry". With the package, we can get the response tensors disentangling the effect free of SOC and establish the analytical relationship with magnetic order, which provides useful guidance for theoretical and experimental investigation for magnetic materials.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the response of a system of hard spheres to two classes of perturbations over a range of densities spanning the fluid, crystalline, and glassy regimes within a molecular dynamics framework. Firstly, we consider the relaxation of a "thermal inhomogeneity," in which a central region of particles is given a higher temperature than its surroundings and is then allowed to evolve under Newtonian dynamics. In this case, the hot central "core" of particles expands and collides with the cold surrounding material, creating a transient radially-expanding "compression wave," which is rapidly dissipated by particle-particle collisions and interaction with periodic images at the boundary, leading to a rapid relaxation to equilibrium. Secondly, we consider a rapid compression of the spheres into a disordered glassy state at high densities. Such rapidly compressed systems exhibit very slow structural relaxation times, many orders of magnitude longer than thermalization times for simple temperature inhomogeneities. We find that thermal relaxation of the velocity distribution is determined simply by the total collision rate, whereas structural relaxation requires coordinated collective motion, which is strongly suppressed at high density, although some particle rearrangement nevertheless occurs. We further find that collisions propagate significantly faster through glassy systems than through crystalline systems at the same density, which leads to very rapid relaxation of velocity perturbations, although structural relaxation remains very slow. These results extend the validity of previous observations that glassy systems exhibit a hybrid character, sharing features with both equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems. Finally, we introduce the hard sphere causal graph, a network-based characterization of the dynamical history of a hard sphere system, which encapsulates several useful...</description>

      <title>Achieving Altermagnetism in Monolayer Holey Graphyne via Atomic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving altermagnetism (AM) in two-dimensional materials is crucial for advancing the development of novel spintronic devices. This study introduces an innovative strategy to realize AM in monolayer materials by adsorbing non-magnetic $sp$ impurity atoms to construct planar bridges. Using holey graphyne (HGY) as the research object, first-principles calculations reveal that B and S impurity atoms can modulate the local electronic structure and trigger a superexchange mechanism, inducing a collinear compensated antiferromagnetic ground state with pronounced altermagnetic properties. Among these, the B adsorption system exhibits the best magnetic performance, with a N$\rm \acute{e}$el temperature reaching approximately 210 K. This work offers a flexible and effective strategy to achieve AM in single-atomic-layer materials and $p$-electron systems.</description>

      <title>Scalable simulation of random quantum circuits using projected entangled-pair states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical simulation of a programmable quantum processor is crucial in identifying the threshold of a quantum advantage. We use the simple update of projected entangled-pair states (PEPSs) in the Vidal gauge to simulate the states of random quantum circuits (RQCs), which center around recent quantum advantage claims. Applied to square lattices of qubits akin to state-of-the-art superconducting processors, our PEPS simulation is exact for circuit depths less than $D_\mathrm{tr}$ = $\beta\log_2\chi$, where $\chi$ is the maximum bond dimension and $2 \lesssim \beta \lesssim 4$ depends on the choice of two-qubit gates, independent of the qubit number $n$. We find the universal scaling behaviors of the state fidelity by performing large-scale simulations for $n \leq 10^{4}$ or $\chi \leq 128$ on a conventional CPU. Our method has computational cost scaling polynomially with $n$ for circuit depth $D =O(\log n)$ and is more advantageous than matrix product state (MPS) approaches if $n$ is large. This work underscores PEPSs as a scalable tool for benchmarking quantum algorithms, with future potential for sampling applications using advanced contraction techniques.</description>

      <title>The Kratos Framework for Heterogeneous Astrophysical Simulations: Ray Tracing, Reacting Flow and Thermochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermochemistry, ray-tracing radiation, and radiation-matter interactions are important processes which are computationally difficult to model in astrophysical simulations, addressed by introducing novel algorithms optimized for heterogeneous architectures in the Kratos framework. Key innovations include a stoichiometry-compatible reconstruction scheme for consistent chemical species advection, which ensures element conservation while avoiding matrix inversions, and a LU decomposition method specifically designed for multi-thread parallelization in order to solve stiff thermochemical ordinary differential equations with high efficiency. The framework also implements efficient ray-tracing techniques for radiation transport for radiation-matter interactions. Various verification tests, spanning from chemical advection, combustion, Str\"omgren spheres, and detonation dynamics, are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of Kratos, with results closely matching semi-analytic solutions and benchmarks such as Cantera and the Shock and Detonation Toolbox. The modular design and performance optimizations position it as a versatile tool for studying coupled microphysical processes in the diverse environments of contemporary astrophysical studies.</description>

      <title>Machine learning interatomic potential can infer electrical response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling the response of material and chemical systems to electric fields remains a longstanding challenge. Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) offer an efficient and scalable alternative to quantum mechanical methods but do not by themselves incorporate electrical response. Here, we show that polarization and Born effective charge (BEC) tensors can be directly extracted from long-range MLIPs within the Latent Ewald Summation (LES) framework, solely by learning from energy and force data. Using this approach, we predict the infrared spectra of bulk water under zero or finite external electric fields, ionic conductivities of high-pressure superionic ice, and the phase transition and hysteresis in ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ perovskite. This work thus extends the capability of MLIPs to predict electrical response--without training on charges or polarization or BECs--and enables accurate modeling of electric-field-driven processes in diverse systems at scale.</description>

      <title>PINNverse: Accurate parameter estimation in differential equations from noisy data with constrained physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter estimation for differential equations from measured data is an inverse problem prevalent across quantitative sciences. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as effective tools for solving such problems, especially with sparse measurements and incomplete system information. However, PINNs face convergence issues, stability problems, overfitting, and complex loss function design. Here we introduce PINNverse, a training paradigm that addresses these limitations by reformulating the learning process as a constrained differential optimization problem. This approach achieves a dynamic balance between data loss and differential equation residual loss during training while preventing overfitting. PINNverse combines the advantages of PINNs with the Modified Differential Method of Multipliers to enable convergence on any point on the Pareto front. We demonstrate robust and accurate parameter estimation from noisy data in four classical ODE and PDE models from physics and biology. Our method enables accurate parameter inference also when the forward problem is expensive to solve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to expand the territory of density functional theory to strongly correlated electrons by reformulating the Kohn-Sham scheme in the representation of fractionalized particles. We call it the ``KS* scheme.'' Using inhomogeneous $t$-$J$ chains as a test bed, we show that the KS* scheme with simple local density approximation is able to achieve accurate ground-state energy and density distribution comparable to the density matrix renormalization group method, while the computational complexity is much lower.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a data-driven approach to learn a generalized kinetic collision operator directly from molecular dynamics. Unlike the conventional (e.g., Landau) models, the present operator takes an anisotropic form that accounts for a second energy transfer arising from the collective interactions between the pair of collision particles and the environment. Numerical results show that preserving the broadly overlooked anisotropic nature of the collision energy transfer is crucial for predicting the plasma kinetics with non-negligible correlations, where the Landau model shows limitations.</description>

      <title>Learning classical density functionals for ionic fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient theoretical techniques for describing ionic fluids are highly desirable for many applications across the physical, biological and materials sciences. With a rigorous statistical mechanical foundation, classical density functional theory (cDFT) is an appealing approach, but the competition between strong Coulombic interactions and steric repulsion limits the accuracy of current approximate functionals. Here, we extend a recently presented machine learning (ML) approach [Samm\"uller et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 120, e2312484120 (2023)] designed for systems with short-ranged interactions to ionic fluids. By adopting ideas from local molecular field theory, the framework we present amounts to using neural networks to learn the local relationship between the one-body direct correlation functions and inhomogeneous density profiles for a "mimic'' short-ranged system, with effects of long-ranged interactions accounted for in a mean-field, yet well-controlled, manner. By comparing to results from molecular simulations, we show that our approach accurately describes the structure and thermodynamics of prototypical models for electrolyte solutions and ionic liquids, including size-asymmetric and multivalent systems. The framework we present acts as an important step toward extending ML approaches for cDFT to systems with accurate interatomic potentials.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning from first-principles calculations to experiments with chemistry-informed domain transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation-to-Real (Sim2Real) transfer learning, the machine learning technique that efficiently solves a real-world task by leveraging knowledge from computational data, has received increasing attention in materials science as a promising solution to the scarcity of experimental data. We proposed an efficient transfer learning scheme from first-principles calculations to experiments based on the chemistry-informed domain transformation, that integrates the heterogeneous source and target domains by harnessing the underlying physics and chemistry. The proposed method maps the computational data from the simulation space (source domain) into the space of experimental data (target domain). During this process, these qualitatively different domains are efficiently integrated by a couple of prior knowledge of chemistry, (1) the statistical ensemble, and (2) the relationship between source and target quantities. As a proof-of-concept, we predict the catalyst activity for the reverse water-gas shift reaction by using the abundant first-principles data in addition to the experimental data. Through the demonstration, we confirmed that the transfer learning model exhibits positive transfer in accuracy and data efficiency. In particular, a significantly high accuracy was achieved despite using a few (less than ten) target data in domain transformation, whose accuracy is one order of magnitude smaller than that of a full scratch model trained with over 100 target data. This result indicates that the proposed method leverages the high prediction performance with few target data, which helps to save the number of trials in real laboratories.</description>
