      <title>A gradient flow model for ground state calculations in Wigner formalism based on density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a gradient flow model is proposed for conducting ground state calculations in Wigner formalism of many-body system in the framework of density functional theory. More specifically, an energy functional for the ground state in Wigner formalism is proposed to provide a new perspective for ground state calculations of the Wigner function. Employing density functional theory, a gradient flow model is designed based on the energy functional to obtain the ground state Wigner function representing the whole many-body system. Subsequently, an efficient algorithm is developed using the operator splitting method and the Fourier spectral collocation method, whose numerical complexity of single iteration is $O(n_{\rm DoF}\log n_{\rm DoF})$. Numerical experiments demonstrate the anticipated accuracy, encompassing the one-dimensional system with up to $2^{21}$ particles and the three-dimensional system with defect, showcasing the potential of our approach to large-scale simulations and computations of systems with defect.</description>

      <title>A modified recursive transfer matrix algorithm for radiation and scattering computation of multilayer spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discusses the electromagnetic scattering and radiation problems of multilayered spheres, reviewing the historical expansion of the Lorentz-Mie theory and the numerical stability issues encountered in handling multilayered spheres. By combining recursive methods with the transfer matrix method, we propose a modified transfer matrix algorithm designed for the stable and efficient calculation of electromagnetic scattering coefficients of multilayered spheres. The new algorithm simplifies the recursive formulas by introducing Debye potentials and logarithmic derivatives, effectively avoiding numerical overflow issues associated with Bessel functions under large complex variables. Numerical test results demonstrate that this algorithm offers superior stability and applicability when dealing with complex cases such as thin shells and strongly absorbing media.</description>

      <title>Modeling a frustrated Ising square lattice with the D-Wave Quantum Annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ising model with nearest-neighbor interactions on a two-dimensional (2D) square lattice is one of the simplest models for studying ferro-magnetic to para-magnetic transitions. Extensive results are available in the literature for this model, which has become a paradigm for the study of magnetic phase transitions in materials, both theoretically and numerically. After a brief review of the main results obtained with a classical computer, we show how to implement on the D- Wave quantum annealer a more complex Ising model with the addition of competing antiferromagnetic interactions between the diagonal next-to-nearest neighbors with two coupling constants J1 and J2. The dynamics of this system, owing to frustration, are richer than those of the simple Ising model and exhibit a third striped (or antiferromagnetic) phase in addition to the ferro- and para-magnetic phases. In this work, we observed all three phases on the D-Wave hardware, studied the behavior of the solution with different annealing parameters, such as the chain strength and annealing time, and showed how to identify the phase transition by varying the ratio between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings. The same system is studied on a classical computer, with the possibility of taking into account the temperature (fixed on D-Wave) as a free parameter and to explore the full phase diagram: some comparative conclusions with D-Wave are drawn.</description>

      <title>OpenACC offloading of the MFC compressible multiphase flow solver on AMD and NVIDIA GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GPUs are the heart of the latest generations of supercomputers. We efficiently accelerate a compressible multiphase flow solver via OpenACC on NVIDIA and AMD Instinct GPUs. Optimization is accomplished by specifying the directive clauses 'gang vector' and 'collapse'. Further speedups of six and ten times are achieved by packing user-defined types into coalesced multidimensional arrays and manual inlining via metaprogramming. Additional optimizations yield seven-times speedup in array packing and thirty-times speedup of select kernels on Frontier. Weak scaling efficiencies of 97% and 95% are observed when scaling to 50% of Summit and 95% of Frontier. Strong scaling efficiencies of 84% and 81% are observed when increasing the device count by a factor of 8 and 16 on V100 and MI250X hardware. The strong scaling efficiency of AMD's MI250X increases to 92% when increasing the device count by a factor of 16 when GPU-aware MPI is used for communication.</description>

      <title>High-order Accurate Entropy Stable Schemes for Relativistic Hydrodynamics with General Synge-type Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All the existing entropy stable (ES) schemes for relativistic hydrodynamics (RHD) in the literature were restricted to the ideal equation of state (EOS), which however is often a poor approximation for most relativistic flows due to its inconsistency with the relativistic kinetic theory. This paper develops high-order ES finite difference schemes for RHD with general Synge-type EOS, which encompasses a range of special EOSs. We first establish an entropy pair for the RHD equations with general Synge-type EOS in any space dimensions. We rigorously prove that the found entropy function is strictly convex and derive the associated entropy variables, laying the foundation for designing entropy conservative (EC) and ES schemes. Due to relativistic effects, one cannot explicitly express primitive variables, fluxes, and entropy variables in terms of conservative variables. Consequently, this highly complicates the analysis of the entropy structure of the RHD equations, the investigation of entropy convexity, and the construction of EC numerical fluxes. By using a suitable set of parameter variables, we construct novel two-point EC fluxes in a unified form for general Synge-type EOS. We obtain high-order EC schemes through linear combinations of the two-point EC fluxes. Arbitrarily high-order accurate ES schemes are achieved by incorporating dissipation terms into the EC schemes, based on (weighted) essentially non-oscillatory reconstructions. Additionally, we derive the general dissipation matrix for general Synge-type EOS based on the scaled eigenvectors of the RHD system. We also define a suitable average of the dissipation matrix at the cell interfaces to ensure that the resulting ES schemes can resolve stationary contact discontinuities accurately. Several numerical examples are provided to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of our schemes for RHD with four special EOSs.</description>

      <title>A quantum protocol for applying arbitrary phase transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an operator that produces the state $|\phi\rangle=\sum\phi(x)\,|x\rangle$, we propose a quantum protocol that transforms any input state of the form $|\psi\rangle=\sum\psi(x)\,|x\rangle$ to $|\psi'\rangle=\sum\psi(x)\,e^{i\alpha|\phi(x)|^2}\,|x\rangle$. This protocol is thus programmable in the sense that one can use it to apply different phase profiles $e^{i\alpha|\phi(x)|^2}$ by choosing different $|\phi\rangle$ states as the input parameter at each run. Therefore, the problem of applying phases to a signal via a quantum computer is reduced to the problem of initializing a state $|\phi\rangle$ that corresponds to the desired phase profile. Furthermore, we discuss possible applications of this protocol, most importantly in Hamiltonian simulation.</description>

      <title>Computational Electromagnetics Meets Spin Qubits: Controlling Noise Effects in Quantum Sensing and Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solid-state spin qubits have emerged as promising platforms for quantum information. Despite extensive efforts in controlling noise in spin qubit quantum applications, one important but less controlled noise source is near-field electromagnetic fluctuations. Low-frequency (MHz and GHz) electromagnetic fluctuations are significantly enhanced near lossy material components in quantum applications, including metallic/superconducting gates necessary for controlling spin qubits in quantum computing devices and materials/nanostructures to be probed in quantum sensing. Although controlling this low-frequency electromagnetic fluctuation noise is crucial for improving the performance of quantum devices, current efforts are hindered by computational challenges. In this paper, we leverage advanced computational electromagnetics techniques, especially fast and accurate volume integral equation based solvers, to overcome the computational obstacle. We introduce a quantum computational electromagnetics framework to control low-frequency magnetic fluctuation noise and enhance spin qubit device performance. Our framework extends the application of computational electromagnetics to spin qubit quantum devices. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of our framework in realistic quantum devices. Our work paves the way for device engineering to control magnetic fluctuations and improve the performance of spin qubit quantum sensing and computing.</description>

      <title>2500 vibronic eigenstates of the NO$_3$ radical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nitrate radical NO$_3$ plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry, yet many aspects of its coupled and anharmonic vibronic structure remain elusive. Here, using an accurate, coupled full-dimensional diabatic potential that includes five electronic states, we revisit the vibronic spectrum associated with the electronic $\tilde X ^2A_2'$ state. Using recently developed tensor network state methods, we are able to compute more than 2500 vibronic states, thereby increasing the number of computed full-dimensional states by a factor of 50, compared to previous work. While we obtain good agreement with experiment for most of the assigned vibronic levels, for several others, we observe striking disagreement. Further, for the antisymmetric bending motion we find remarkably large symmetry-induced level splittings that are larger than the zero-order reference. We discuss non-negligible nonadiabatic effects and show that the Born-Oppenheimer approximation leads to significant errors in the spectrum.</description>
