      <title>Perfect t-embeddings and the octahedron equation of the two-periodic Aztec diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the connection between perfect t-embeddings and the octahedron equation in the setting of the two-periodic Aztec diamond. In particular, we show that the positions of both the t-embedding and the corresponding origami map can be expressed as sums of density functions arising from solutions to the octahedron equation defined on the two-periodic Aztec diamond.</description>

      <title>Rigged Hilbert Space Formulation of Quantum Thermo Field Dynamics and Mapping to Rigged Liouville Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rigged Hilbert space, a triplet extension of the Hilbert space, provides a mathematically rigorous foundation for quantum mechanics by extending the Hilbert space to accommodate generalized eigenstates. In this paper, we construct a triplet structure for the thermal space arising in Thermo Field Dynamics with the aid of the tensor product formulation of rigged Hilbert spaces, a formalism that reformulates thermal averages as pure-state expectation values in a doubled Hilbert space. We then induce the rigged Liouville space for Liouville space of density operators from the triplet structure for Thermo Field Dynamics; the rigged Liouville space corresponds isomorphically one-to-one with that of Thermo Field Dynamics. This correspondence offers a unified topological foundation for quantum statistical mechanics at finite temperature and establishes a framework for future generalizations to open and non-equilibrium quantum systems.</description>

      <title>From $n$-Leibniz algebras and linear $n$-racks to the solutions of the (higher analogue of) Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first demonstrate that a finite-dimensional $n$-Leibniz algebra naturally gives rise to an $n$-rack structure on the underlying vector space. Given any $n$-Leibniz algebra, we also construct two Yang-Baxter operators on suitable vector spaces and connect them by a homomorphism. Next, we introduce linear $n$-racks as the coalgebraic version of $n$-racks and show that a cocommutative linear $n$-rack yields a linear rack structure and hence a Yang-Baxter operator. An $n$-Leibniz algebra canonically gives rise to a cocommutative linear $n$-rack and thus produces a Yang-Baxter operator.
  In the last part, following the well-known close connections among Leibniz algebras, (linear) racks and Yang-Baxter operators, we consider a higher-ary generalization of Yang-Baxter operators (called $n$-Yang-Baxter operators). In particular, we show that $n$-Leibniz algebras and cocommutative linear $n$-racks naturally provide $n$-Yang-Baxter operators. Finally, we consider a set-theoretical variant of $n$-Yang-Baxter operators and propose some problems.</description>

      <title>Conditional splitting probabilities for hidden-state inference in drift-diffusive processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Splitting probabilities quantify the likelihood of particular outcomes out of a set of mutually-exclusive possibilities for stochastic processes and play a central role in first-passage problems. For two-dimensional Markov processes $\{X(t),Y(t)\}_{t\in T}$, a joint analogue of the splitting probabilities can be defined, which captures the likelihood that the variable $X(t)$, having been initialised at $x_0 \in \mathbb{L}$, exits $\mathbb{L}$ for the first time via either of the interval boundaries \emph{and} that the variable $Y(t)$, initialised at $y_0$, is given by $y_{\rm exit}$ at the time of exit. We compute such joint splitting probabilities for two classes of processes: processes where $X(t)$ is Brownian motion and $Y(t)$ is a decoupled internal state, and unidirectionally coupled processes where $X(t)$ is drift-diffusive and depends on $Y(t)$, while $Y(t)$ evolves independently. For the first class we obtain generic expressions in terms of the eigensystem of the Fokker-Planck operator for the $Y$ dynamics, while for the second we carry out explicit derivations for three paradigmatic cases (run-and-tumble motion, diffusion in an intermittent piecewise-linear potential and diffusion with stochastic resetting). Drawing on Bayes' theorem, we subsequently introduce the related notion of conditional splitting probabilities, defined as the posterior likelihoods of the internal state $Y$ \emph{given} that the observable degree of freedom $X$ has undergone a specific exit event. After computing these conditional splitting probabilities, we propose a simple scheme that leverages them to partially infer the assumedly hidden state $Y(t)$ from point-wise detection events.</description>

      <title>Riesz-means bounds for functional-difference operators for mirror curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let \( P \) and \( Q \) be the quantum-mechanical momentum and position operators on \( L^2(\R) \). Let $\zeta&gt;0.$ We provide estimates for the {\it Riesz means} $\varkappa(\lambda)$ associated with the system of eigenvalues of the operator
  \begin{align} H(\zeta) = \e^{-bP} + \e^{bP} + \e^{2\pi b Q} + \zeta \e^{-2\pi b Q} = U + U^{-1} + V + \zeta V^{-1}, \end{align} when $\lambda\rightarrow\infty.$ This operator arises in the quantisation of the local {\it del Pezzo Calabi-Yau threefold}, defined as the total space of the anti-canonical bundle over the {\it Hirzebruch surface} \( S = \mathbb{P}^{1} \times \mathbb{P}^{1} \). Our approach is motivated by the spectral analysis of $\varkappa(\lambda)$ in the framework developed by Laptev, Schimmer and Takhtajan in [13].</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium steady state in Lindblad dynamics for infinite quantum spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Lindblad dynamics of quantum spin systems on infinite lattices and define a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) and a time-averaged nonequilibrium steady state (TANESS) on the basis of $C^*$-algebraic formalism. Generically, the NESS on an infinite system does not equal the thermodynamic limit of NESSs on finite systems. We give a sufficient condition that they coincide with each other, in terms of both a condition number, which quantifies the normality of a Liouvillian, and some spectral gaps on finite subsystems. To appreciate the importance of the condition number, we provide an example in which the spectral gaps have nonzero lower bounds uniformly for any finite subsystems but a thermodynamic limit and a long-time limit (or a long-time average) do not commute with each other.</description>

      <title>Diffeology and Arithmetic of Irrational Tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The irrational torus, $\mathrm{T}_\alpha$, originally introduced as a geometric model for quasicrystals, is a foundational object in the theory of diffeology. This paper, after recalling its main algebraic properties, provides a comprehensive analysis of a new geometric invariant for this singular space: the group of flows, $\mathbf{Fl}(\mathrm{T}_\alpha, \mathbf{R})$. This invariant, which is trivial for all manifolds, arises as the core of the obstruction to the de Rham theorem in the diffeological setting. We provide a complete computation and geometric interpretation of this group, proving the isomorphism $\mathbf{Fl}(\mathrm{T}_\alpha, \mathbf{R}) \simeq \mathbf{R} \times \coker(\Delta_\alpha)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of long range percolations on lattices and on hierarchical lattices are related through the use of three intermediate geometries: a 1-parameter deformation based on the power mean function, relating lattice percolation to a percolation model governed by the toric volume form; the adelic product formula for a function field, relating the hierarchical lattice model to an adelic percolation model; and the adelic product formula for number fields that relates the toric percolation model on the lattice given by the ring of integers in the Minkowski embedding to another adelic percolation model.</description>

      <title>The Spectral Renormalization Flow Based on the Smooth Feshbach--Schur Map: The Introduction of the Semi-Group Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral renormalization method is a powerful mathematical tool that is prominently used in spectral theory in the context of low-energy quantum field theory and its original introduction in [5, 6] constituted a milestone in the field. Inspired by physics, this method is usually called renormalization group, even though it is not a group nor a semigroup (or, more properly, a flow). It was only in 2015 in [1] when a flow (or semigroup) structure was first introduced using an innovative definition of the renormalization of spectral parameters. The spectral renormalization flow in [1], however, is not compatible with the smooth Feshbach--Schur map (this is stated as an open problem in [1]), which is a lamentable weakness because its smoothness is a key feature that significantly simplifies the proofs and makes it the preferred tool in most of the literature. In this paper we solve this open problem introducing a spectral renormalization flow based on the smooth Feshbach--Schur map.</description>

      <title>v-representability on a one-dimensional torus at elevated temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend a previous result [Sutter et al., J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57, 475202 (2024)] to give an explicit form of the set of $v$-representable densities on the one-dimensional torus with any fixed number of particles in contact with a heat bath at finite temperature. The particle interaction has to satisfy some mild assumptions but is kept entirely general otherwise. For densities, we consider the Sobolev space $H^1$ and exploit the convexity of the functionals. This leads to a broader set of potentials than the usual $L^p$ spaces and encompasses distributions. By including temperature and thus considering all excited states in the Gibbs ensemble, G\^ateaux differentiability of the thermal universal functional is guaranteed. This yields $v$-representability and it is demonstrated that the given set of $v$-representable densities is even maximal.</description>

      <title>Algebraic approach to a $d$-dimensional matrix Hamiltonian with so($d+1)$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel spin-extended so($d+1$,1) algebra is introduced and shown to provide an interesting framework for discussing the properties of a $d$-dimensional matrix Hamiltonian with spin 1/2 and so($d+1$) symmetry. With some $d+2$ additional operators, spanning a basis of an so($d+1$,1) irreducible representation, the so($d+1$,1) generators provide a very easy way for deriving the integrals of motion of the matrix Hamiltonian in Sturm representation. Such integrals of motion are then transformed into those of the matrix Hamiltonian in Schr\"odinger representation, including a Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector with spin. This leads to a derivation of the latter, as well as its properties in a more extended algebraic framework.</description>

      <title>Defect Networks for Topological Phases Protected By Modulated Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modulated symmetries are internal symmetries which do not commute with spatial symmetries; dipolar symmetries are a prime example. We give a general recipe for constructing topological phases protected by modulated symmetries via a defect network construction, generalizing the crystalline equivalence principle to modulated symmetries. We demonstrate that modulated symmetries can be treated identically to unmodulated symmetries in the absence of spatial symmetries, but in the presence of spatial symmetries, some defect networks which are non-anomalous for unmodulated symmetries become anomalous for modulated symmetries. We apply this understanding to classify symmetry-protected topological phases protected by translation symmetry plus either discrete or continuous dipolar symmetries in (1+1)D and (2+1)D and obtain a number of other (1+1)D classification results for modulated symmetry-protected topological phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using spectral flow, we provide a proof of [9, Theorem 9.17] on unitarity of Ramond twisted non-extremal representations of minimal $W$-algebras that does not rely on the still conjectural exactness of the twisted quantum reduction functor (see Conjecture 9.11 of [9]). When $\mathfrak g=spo(2|2n)$, $F(4)$, $D(2,1;\frac{m}{n})$, it is also proven that the unitarity of extremal (=massless) representations of the minimal $W$-algebra $W^k_{\min}(\mathfrak g)$ in the Ramond sector is equivalent to the unitarity of extremal representations in the Neveu-Schwarz sector.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Controlled Freezing and Revival of Bell Nonlocality through Environmental Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the distance between two qubits coupled to a structured reservoir acts as a single geometric control that can store, revive, or suppress Bell nonlocality. In a mirror-terminated guide, quantum correlations lost to the bath return at discrete recurrence times, turning a product state into a Bell-violating one without any entangling drive (only local basis rotations/readout). In the continuum limit, we derive closed-form criteria for the emergence of nonlocality from backflow, and introduce a Bell-based analogue of the BLP measure to quantify this effect. We also show how subwavelength displacements away from a decoherence-free node quadratically reduce the lifetime of a dark state or bright state, enabling highly sensitive interferometric detection. All results rely on analytically solvable models and are compatible with current superconducting and nanophotonic platforms, offering a practical route to passive, geometry-controlled non-Markovian devices.</description>

      <title>Representations of conformal nets associated with infinite-dimensional groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relation between representations of certain infinite-dimensional Lie groups and those of the associated conformal nets. For a chiral conformal net extending the net generated by the vacuum representation of a loop group or diffeomorphism group of the circle, we show that any conformal net representation induces a positive-energy representation of the corresponding group. Consequently, we prove that any representation of such a conformal net is automatically diffeomorphism covariant. Moreover, we show that the covariance cocycles of conformal net representations satisfy naturality with respect to the action of diffeomorphisms, i.e. the diffeomorphisms act equivariantly on the category of conformal net representations.</description>

      <title>Scattering for the Klein-Gordon-Zakharov system in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Klein-Gordon-Zakharov system in two spatial dimensions, an important model in plasma physics. For small, smooth, and spatially localized initial data, we establish the global existence of solutions and characterize their sharp long-time behavior, including sharp time decay and scattering properties. A particularly interesting phenomenon is that the Klein-Gordon component exhibits modified scattering for certain initial data, while for others it undergoes linear scattering-a dichotomy highlighting delicate long-range interaction effects.
  The major obstacles are lack of symmetry and weak decay of the solution in two dimensions. To overcome these, we introduce a novel nonlinear transformation of the wave component and reinterpret the nonlinear coupling as a perturbation of the mass term in the Klein-Gordon equation. The proof employs a combination of physical space and frequency space methods.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative creation operators for symmetric polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reconsider in modern terms the old discovery by A. Kirillov and M. Noumi, who devised peculiar operators adding columns to Young diagrams enumerating the Schur, Jack and Macdonald polynomials. In this sense, these are a kind of ``creation'' operators, representing Pieri rules in a maximally simple form, when boxes are added to Young diagrams in a regular way and not to arbitrary ``empty places'' around the diagram. Instead the operators do not commute, and one should add columns of different lengths one after another. We consider this construction in different contexts. In particular, we build up the creation operators $\hat B_m$ in the matrix and Fock representations of the $W_{1+\infty}$ algebra, and in the Fock representation of the affine Yangian algebra $Y(\widehat{gl}_1)$.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Zermelo navigation with tacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the time- and position-dependent Zermelo navigation problem within the framework of Lorentz-Finsler geometry. Since the initial work of E. Zermelo, the task is to find the time-minimizing trajectory between two regions for a moving object whose speed profile depends on time, position and direction. We give a step-by-step review of the classical formulation of the problem, where the geometric shape generated by the velocity vectors -- the speed profile indicatrix -- is strongly convex at each point. We derive new global results for the cases where the indicatrix field is only time-dependent. In such (meso-scale realistic) cases, Zermelo navigation exhibits particularly favorable properties that have not been previously explored, making them especially appealing for both theoretical and numerical investigations. Moreover, motivated by real-world phenomena and examples, we obtain novel results for non-convex (or multi-convex) navigation, i.e. when the indicatrices fail to be convex. In this new setting -- which is not unlike the corresponding Finsler setting for Snell's law -- optimal paths may involve so-called tacking, which stems from discontinuous shifts of direction of motion. The tacking behaviour thus results in zig-zag trajectories, as observed in time-optimal sailboat navigation and surprisingly also in the flight paths of far-ranging seabirds. Finally, we provide new efficient computational algorithms and illustrate the use of them to solve the Zermelo navigation (boundary value) problem, i.e. to find numerically the time-minimizing trajectory between two fixed points in the general non-convex setting.</description>

      <title>The two--component discrete KP hierarchy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrete KP hierarchy is also known as the $(l-l')$--th modified KP hierarchy. Here in this paper, we consider the corresponding two--component generalization, called the two--component discrete KP (2dKP) hierarchy. Firstly, starting from the bilinear equation of the 2dKP hierarchy, we derive the corresponding Lax equation by the Shiota method, this is using scalar Lax operators involving two difference operators $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$. Then starting from the 2dKP Lax equation, we obtain the corresponding bilinear equation, including the existence of the tau function. From above discussions, we can determine which are essential in the 2dKP Lax formulation. Finally, we discuss the reduction of the 2dKP hierarchy corresponding to the loop algebra $\widehat{sl}_{M+N}=sl_{M+N}[\lambda,\lambda^{-1}]\oplus\mathbb{C}c \ (M,N\geq1)$.</description>

      <title>Dilations of non-Markovian dynamical systems on graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To generalise evolutions families we consider systems of contractions $\{\varphi(u, v)\}_{(u, v) \in E}$ defined on the edges of a graph $\mathcal{G} = (\Omega, E)$. In this setup the Markov property, or \emph{divisibility}, can be modelled via $\varphi(u, v)\varphi(v, w) = \varphi(u, w)$ for edges $(u, v), (v, w), (u, w) \in E$. We obtain results in three settings: 1) contractive Banach space operators; 2) positive unital maps on $C^{\ast}$-algebras}; and 3) CPTP-maps on trace class operators on a Hilbert space. In the discrete setting we are able to dilate possibly indivisible families of contractions to divisible families of operators with 'nice' properties (viz. surjective isometries resp. $C^{\ast}$-algebraic automorphisms resp. unitary representations). In the special case of linearly ordered graphs equipped with the order topology, we establish sufficient conditions for strongly continuous dilations of possibly indivisible families in the Banach space and $C^{\ast}$-algebra contexts. To achieve these results we work with string-rewriting systems, and make use of and extend dilation theorems of Stroescu [42], Kraus [23, 24], and vom Ende--Dirr [46].</description>

      <title>Interior instability of naked singularities of a scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the $k$-self-similar naked singularity solutions of the spherically symmetric Einstein--Scalar field system are unstable to black hole formation under perturbations that are totally supported in the interior region, in all regularities strictly below the threshold. The instability below the threshold is also established for exterior perturbations. We also show that general naked singularity solutions are unstable under interior BV perturbations, which provides a new insight into understanding the weak cosmic censorship conjecture for this model. In contrast to all previous results on the exterior instability of naked singularities (and even trapped surface formation), where only a single incoming null cone is considered, the novel approach to proving the interior instability is analyzing a family of incoming null cones becoming more and more singular.</description>

Abstract: We consider the infinite volume $\Phi^4_3$ dynamic and show that it is globally well-posed in a suitable weighted Besov space of distributions. At high temperatures / small coupling, we furthermore show that the difference between any two solutions driven by the same realisation of the noise converges to zero exponentially fast. This allows us to characterise the infinite-volume $\Phi^4_3$ measure at high temperature as the unique invariant measure of the dynamic, and to prove that it satisfies all Osterwalder--Schrader axioms, including invariance under translations, rotations, and reflections, as well as exponential decay of correlations.</description>

      <title>Quantized Quiver Varieties and the Quantum Spin Ruijsenaars-Schneider Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles the long-standing problem of quantizing the rational spin Ruijsenaars--Schneider model originating in the work of Krichever and Zabrodin. We make use of the technique of quantum Hamiltonian reduction to construct a quantized quiver variety $\mathfrak{A}_{N,\ell}$ associated to the framed Jordan quiver. This quantized quiver variety is simultaneously the algebra of quantum observables of the rational spin Ruijsenaars--Schneider model of $N$ particles with $\ell$ spin polarizations. Inside this algebra, we find a loop algebra and Yangian of $\mathfrak{gl}_\ell$ and conjecture that in the limit of infinitely many particles, the algebra $\mathfrak{A}_{N,\ell}$ becomes a shifted affine Yangian. We also exhibit a difference equation for eigenstates of the lowest Hamiltonian that reduces to the spinless case when $\ell=1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many important quantities in quantum information science, such as entropy and entanglement, are non-linear functions of the density matrix and cannot be expressed as operator observables. Standard open-system approaches evolve only a single copy of the density matrix, making it impossible to track the dynamics of such quantities. A formalism proposed by some of the present authors addressed this challenge by evolving multiple virtual replicas, but was limited to the weak-coupling regime. Here, we extend this approach to strong coupling between a quantum system and classical environments. The resulting multi-replica master equation enables direct evaluation of entropy flow and related metrics in strongly hybridized quantum-classical systems. Our results show that quantum coherence and hybridization jointly suppress net entropy transfer, creating a thermodynamic bottleneck. This framework provides a general tool for studying entropy dynamics and guiding the design of more robust, resource-efficient quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Applications of Weak Metric Structures to Non-Symmetrical Gravitational Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear connections satisfying the Einstein metricity condition are important in the study of generalized Riemannian manifolds $(M,G=g+F)$, where the symmetric part $g$ of $G$ is a non-degenerate $(0,2)$-tensor, and $F$ is the skew-symmetric part. Such structures naturally arise in spacetime models in theoretical physics, where $F$ can be defined as an almost complex or almost contact metric (a.c.m.) structure. In the paper, we first study more general models, where $F$ has constant rank and is based on weak metric structures (introduced by the second author and R.~Wolak), which generalize almost complex and a.c.m. structures. We consider linear connections with totally skew-symmetric torsion that satisfy both the Einstein metricity condition and the $A$-torsion condition, where $A$ is a skew-symmetric (1,1)-tensor adjoint to~$F$. In the almost Hermitian case, we prove that the manifold with such a connection is weak nearly K\" ahler, the torsion is completely determined by the exterior derivative of the fundamental 2-form and the Nijenhuis tensor, and the structure tensors are parallel, while in the weak a.c.m. case, the contact distribution is involutive, the Reeb vector field is Levi-Civita parallel, and the structure tensors are also parallel with respect to both connections.
  For rank$(F)=\dim M$, we apply weak almost Hermitian structures to fundamental results (by the first author and S. Ivanov) on generalized Riemannian manifolds and prove that the manifold equipped with an Einstein's connection is a weighted product of several nearly K\"ahler manifolds.
  For~rank$(F)&lt;\dim M$ we apply weak almost Hermitian and weak a.c.m. structures and obtain splitting results for generalized Riemannian manifolds equipped with Einstein's connections.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Complexity of Matrix-Product Unitaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix-product unitaries (MPUs) are many-body unitary operators that, as a consequence of their tensor-network structure, preserve the entanglement area law in 1D systems. However, it is unknown how to implement an MPU as a quantum circuit since the individual tensors describing the MPU are not unitary. In this paper, we show that a large class of MPUs can be implemented with a polynomial-depth quantum circuit. For an $N$-site MPU built from a repeated bulk tensor with open boundary, we explicitly construct a quantum circuit of polynomial depth $T = O(N^{\alpha})$ realizing the MPU, where the constant $\alpha$ depends only on the bulk and boundary tensor and not the system size $N$. We show that this class includes nontrivial unitaries that generate long-range entanglement and, in particular, contains a large class of unitaries constructed from representations of $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras. Furthermore, we also adapt our construction to nonuniform translationally-varying MPUs and show that they can be implemented by a circuit of depth $O(N^{\beta} \, \mathrm{poly}\, D)$ where $\beta \le 1 + \log_2 \sqrt{D}/ s_{\min}$, with $D$ being the bond dimension and $s_{\min}$ is the smallest nonzero Schmidt value of the normalized Choi state corresponding to the MPU.</description>

      <title>Average Contraction Coefficients of Quantum Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The data-processing inequality ensures quantum channels reduce state distinguishability, with contraction coefficients quantifying optimal bounds. However, these can be overly optimistic and not representative of the usual behavior. We study how noise contracts distinguishability of `typical' states, beyond the worst-case. To that end, we introduce and study a family of moments of contraction for quantum divergences, which interpolate between the worst-case contraction coefficient of a channel and its average behavior under a chosen ensemble of input states. We establish general properties of these moments, relate moments for different divergences, and derive bounds in terms of channel parameters like the entropy or purity of its Choi state.
  Focusing on the trace distance, we obtain upper and lower bounds on its average contraction under tensor-product noise channels, and prove that, depending on the local noise strength, there is a phase transition in the limit of many channel uses: below a critical error rate the average contraction remains near unity, whereas above it decays exponentially with system size. We extend these phase-transition phenomena to random quantum circuits with unital noise, showing that constant-depth noisy circuits do not shrink the trace distance on average, even when given highly entangled states as input. In contrast, even at $\log\log n$ depth, the average trace distance can become superpolynomially small.
  Finally, we explore moments of contraction for f-divergences and discuss applications to local differential privacy, demonstrating that noise regimes ensuring privacy can render outputs essentially indistinguishable on average. Thus, our results provide a fine-grained framework to quantify typical channel noise in quantum information and computation and unveil new phenomena in contraction coefficients, such as phase transitions for average contraction.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Enriched Topological Phases and Their Gauging: A String-Net Model Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework for constructing exactly-solvable lattice models of symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases based on an enlarged version of the string-net model. We also gauge the global symmetries of our SET models to obtain string-net models of pure topological phases. Without invoking externally imposed onsite symmetry actions, our approach promotes the string-net model of a pure topological order, specified by an input unitary fusion category $\mathscr{F}$, to an SET model, specified by a multifusion category together with a set of isomorphisms. Two complementary construction strategies are developed in the main text: (i) promotion via outer automorphisms of $\mathscr{F}$ and (ii) promotion via the Frobenius algebras of $\mathscr{F}$. The global symmetries derived via these two strategies are intrinsic to topological phases and are thus termed blood symmetries, as opposed to adopted symmetries, which can be arbitrarily imposed on topological phases. We propose the concept of symmetry-gauging family of topological phases, which are related by gauging their blood symmetries. With our approach, we construct the first explicit lattice realization of a nonabelian-symmetry-enriched topological phase -- the $S_3$ symmetry-enriched $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum-double phase. The approach further reveals the role of local excitations in SET phases and establishes their symmetry constraints.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of correlators of sparse bipartite random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.10580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study asymptotic behaviour of the correlation functions of bipartite sparse random $N\times N$ matrices. We assume that the graphs have $N$ vertices, the ratio of parts is $\displaystyle\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}$ and the average number of edges attached to one vertex is $\alpha\cdot p$ or $(1-\alpha)\cdot p$. To each edge of the graph $e_{ij}$ we assign a weight given by a random variable $a_{ij}$ with all moments finite. It is shown that the main term of the correlation function of $k$-th and $m$-th moments of the integrated density of states is $N^{-1}n_{k,m}$. The closed system of recurrent relations for coefficients $\{n_{k,m}\}_{k,m=1}^\infty$ was obtained.</description>

      <title>The Canonical Forms of Matrix Product States in Infinite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we prove that any element in the tensor product of separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces can be expressed as a matrix product state (MPS) of possibly infinite bond dimension. The proof is based on the singular value decomposition of compact operators and the connection between tensor products and Hilbert-Schmidt operators via the Schmidt decomposition in infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert spaces. The construction of infinite-dimensional MPS (idMPS) is analogous to the well-known finite-dimensional construction in terms of singular value decompositions of matrices. The infinite matrices in idMPS give rise to operators acting on (possibly infinite-dimensional) auxiliary Hilbert spaces. As an example we explicitly construct an MPS representation for certain eigenstates of a chain of three coupled harmonic oscillators.</description>

      <title>Rigidity and positivity of Hawking quasi-local energy on area-constrained critical surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key test for any quasi-local energy in general relativity is that it be nonnegative and satisfy a rigidity property; if it vanishes, the region enclosed is flat. We show that the Hawking energy, when evaluated on its natural area-constrained critical surfaces, henceforth called "Hawking surfaces", satisfies both properties under the dominant energy condition. In the time-symmetric case, where Hawking surfaces coincide with area-constrained Willmore surfaces, we extend positivity and rigidity to include electric charge, a nonzero cosmological constant, and higher dimensions. In the fully dynamical (non-time-symmetric) case, we establish the first nonnegativity and rigidity theorems for the Hawking energy in this general setting. These results confirm the Hawking energy consistency with basic physical principles and address several longstanding ambiguities and criticisms.</description>

      <title>Fractal Dimension in Nonlinear Wave Dynamics Governed by a Nonlinear Partial Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a detailed analytical and geometrical investigation of the (2+1)-dimensional Boiti-Leon-Pempinelli system, a nonlinear dispersive model arising in the context of fluid and plasma dynamics. By employing a projective Riccati-based ansatz, a new class of exact solutions is systematically derived. These solutions, when visualized, exhibit intricate geometrical features that evolve across multiple spatial scales. To quantify this complexity, a voxel-based box-counting dimension analysis is conducted on the corresponding surface profiles. The analysis reveals non-integer fractal dimensions that vary with magnification, confirming the self-affine nature of the patterns and highlighting the multiscale structure inherent in the system. Such fractal character is not only of theoretical interest but also reflects real-world behaviors in turbulent plasma flows and fine-scale fluid instabilities. The study thus bridges exact analytical solutions with computational fractal geometry, providing a deeper understanding of the BLP system and its relevance in describing natural phenomena characterized by spatial complexity and multiscale interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the matrix-resolvent method and a formula of the second-named author on the $n$-point function for a KP tau-function, we show that the tau-function of an arbitrary solution to the Toda lattice hierarchy is a KP tau-function. We then generalize this result to tau-functions for the extended Toda hierarchy (ETH) by developing the matrix-resolvent method for the ETH. As an example the partition function of Gromov-Witten invariants of the complex projective line is a KP tau-function, and an application on irreducible representations of the symmetric group is obtained.</description>

      <title>Computing almost commuting bases of ODOs and Gelfand-Dickey hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Almost commuting operators were introduced in 1985 by George Wilson to present generalizations of the Korteweg-de Vries hierarchy, nowadays known as Gelfand-Dickey (GD) hierarchies. In this paper, we review the formal construction of the vector space of almost commuting operators with a given ordinary differential operator (ODO), with the ultimate goal of obtaining a basis by computational routines, using the language of differential polynomials. We use Wilson's results on weighted ODOs to guarantee the solvability of the triangular system that allows to compute the homogeneous almost commuting operator of a given order in the ring of ODOs. As a consequence, the computation of the equations of the GD hierarchies is achieved without using pseudo-differential operators. A new package in SageMath called \texttt{dalgebra} has been designed to perform symbolic calculations in differential domains. The algorithms to calculate the almost commuting basis and the GD hierarchies in the ring of ODOs are implemented in SageMath, and explicit examples are provided.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional fluids via matrix hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14282v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2-D) incompressible, inviscid fluids produce fascinating patterns of swirling motion. How and why the patterns emerge are long-standing questions, first addressed in the 19th century by Helmholtz, Kirchhoff, and Kelvin. Countless researchers have since contributed to innovative techniques and results. Yet, the overarching problem of swirling 2-D motion and its long-time behavior remains largely open. Here we shed light on this problem via a link to isospectral matrix flows. The link is established through V. Zeitlin's beautiful model for the numerical discretization of Euler's equations in 2-D. When considered on the sphere, Zeitlin's model offers deep connections between 2-D hydrodynamics and unitary representations of the rotation group. Consequently, it provides a dictionary that maps hydrodynamical concepts to matrix Lie theory, which in turn gives connections to matrix factorizations, random matrices, and integrability theory, for example. Results about finite-dimensional matrices can then be transferred to infinite-dimensional fluids via quantization theory, which is here used as an analysis tool (albeit traditionally describing the limit between quantum and classical physics). We demonstrate how the dictionary is constructed and how it unveils techniques for 2-D hydrodynamics. We also give accompanying convergence results for Zeitlin's model on the sphere.</description>

      <title>Regularity and temperature of stationary black hole event horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Available proofs of the regularity of stationary black hole event horizons rely on certain assumptions on the existence of sections that imply a $C^1$ differentiability assumption. By using a quotient bundle approach, we remedy this problem by proving directly that, indeed, under the null energy condition event horizons of stationary black holes are totally geodesic null hypersurfaces as regular as the metric. Only later, by using this result, we show that the cross-sections, whose existence was postulated in previous works, indeed exist.These results hold true under weak causality conditions. Subsequently, we prove that under the dominant energy condition stationary black hole event horizons indeed admit constant surface gravity, a result that does not require any non-degeneracy assumption, requirements on existence of cross-sections or a priori smoothness conditions. We are able to make sense of the angular velocity and of the value (not just sign) of surface gravity as quantities related to the horizon, without the need of assuming Einstein's vacuum equations and the Killing extension. Physically, this implies that under very general conditions every stationary black hole has indeed a constant temperature (the zeroth law of black hole thermodynamics).</description>

      <title>On the inadequacy of nudging data assimilation algorithms for non-dissipative systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the applicability of the Azouani-Olson-Titi (AOT) nudging algorithm for continuous data assimilation to evolutionary dynamical systems that are not dissipative. Specifically, we apply the AOT algorithm a partially dissipative variant of the Lorenz 1963 system, the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) in 1D, and the 2D incompressible Euler equations. Our analysis reveals that both the Euler and KdV equations lack the finitely many determining modes property, leading to the construction of infinitely many solutions with exactly the same sparse observational data, which data assimilation methods cannot distinguish between. Simultaneously, we numerically verify that the AOT algorithm successfully recovers these counterexamples for the damped and driven KdV equation, which is dissipative. Additionally, to further support our argument, we present numerical evidence showing that the AOT algorithm is ineffective at accurately recovering solutions for a partially dissipative variant of the Lorenz 1963 system.</description>

      <title>Sample-based Hamiltonian and Lindbladian simulation: Non-asymptotic analysis of sample complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density matrix exponentiation (DME) is a quantum algorithm that processes multiple copies of a program state $\sigma$ to realize the Hamiltonian evolution $e^{-i \sigma t}$. Wave matrix Lindbladization (WML) similarly processes multiple copies of a program state $\psi_L$ in order to realize a Lindbladian evolution. Both algorithms are prototypical sample-based quantum algorithms and can be used for various quantum information processing tasks, including quantum principal component analysis, Hamiltonian simulation, and Lindbladian simulation. In this work, we present detailed sample complexity analyses for DME and sample-based Hamiltonian simulation, as well as for WML and sample-based Lindbladian simulation. In particular, we prove that the sample complexity of DME is no larger than $4t^2/\varepsilon$ for evolution time $t$ and imprecision level $\varepsilon$ quantified by the normalized diamond distance. We also establish a fundamental lower bound on the sample complexity of sample-based Hamiltonian simulation, which matches our DME sample complexity bound up to a constant multiplicative factor. Additionally, we prove that the sample complexity of WML is no larger than $3t^2d^2/\varepsilon$, where $d$ is the dimension of the space on which the Lindblad operator acts nontrivially, and we prove a lower bound of $10^{-4} t^2/\varepsilon$ on the sample complexity of sample-based Lindbladian simulation. These results prove that WML is optimal for sample-based Lindbladian simulation whenever the Lindblad operator acts nontrivially on a constant-sized system. Finally, we point out that the DME sample complexity analysis in [Kimmel et al., npj Quantum Information 3, 13 (2017)] and the WML sample complexity analysis in [Patel and Wilde, Open Systems \&amp; Information Dynamics 30, 2350010 (2023)] appear to be incomplete, highlighting the need for the results presented here.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the directed landscape from the KPZ fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the directed landscape is the unique coupling of the KPZ fixed point from all initial conditions satisfying three natural properties: independent increments, monotonicity, and shift commutativity. Equivalently, we show that the directed landscape is the unique directed metric on $\mathbb R^2$ with independent increments and KPZ fixed point marginals. This unifies the two central objects in the KPZ universality class.
  Our main theorem also provides a general framework for proving convergence to the directed landscape given convergence to the KPZ fixed point. We apply this framework to prove landscape convergence in a range of models: exotic couplings of ASEP and TASEP, the random walk and Brownian web distances, and a class of non-integrable asymmetric exclusion processes with the basic coupling that perturb off of TASEP (this final class requires random initial data). All of our convergence theorems are new except for colored TASEP, where we provide a short alternative proof.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cluster State Model with Haagerup Fusion Category Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a (1+1)D lattice model, inspired by a weak Hopf algebra generalization of the cluster state model, which realizes Haagerup fusion category symmetry and features a tensor product Hilbert space. The construction begins with a reconstruction of the Haagerup weak Hopf algebra $H_3$ from the Haagerup fusion category, ensuring that the representation category of $H_3$ is equivalent to Haagerup fusion category. Utilizing the framework of symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), we develop an ultra-thin weak Hopf quantum double model, characterized by a smooth topological boundary condition. We show that this model supports Haagerup fusion category symmetry. Finally, we solve the ground state of the model in terms of a weak Hopf matrix product state, which serves as a natural generalization of the cluster state, embodying Haagerup fusion category symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The correspondence between commutative rings of ordinary differential operators and algebraic curves has been extensively and deeply studied since the seminal works of Burchnall-Chaundy in 1923. This paper is an overview of recent developments to make this correspondence computationally effective, by means of differential algebra and symbolic computation.
  The centralizer of an ordinary differential operator $L$ is a maximal commutative ring, the affine ring of a spectral curve $\Gamma$. The defining ideal of $\Gamma$ is described, assuming that a finite set of generators of the centralizer is known. In addition, the factorization problem of $L-\lambda$ over a new coefficient field, defined by the coefficient field of $L$ and $\Gamma$, allows the computation of spectral sheaves on $\Gamma$. The ultimate goal is to develop Picard-Vessiot theory for spectral problems $L(y)=\lambda y$, for a generic $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Definition of Space via Dynamical Evolution and Observational Acts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a constructive and dynamical redefinition of spatial structure, grounded in the interplay between mechanical evolution and observational acts. Rather than presupposing space as a static background, we interpret space as an emergent entity that arises through observational acts. Using the framework of pre-topologies, measurable structures, and the GNS construction, we analyze how the choice of observables and the system's time evolution dynamically determine the topological and measure-theoretic features of space. This approach highlights the observer-dependent and context-sensitive nature of spatial concepts in both classical and quantum domains.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids: I. Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids is proposed. Different regimes of yield-stress fluid flow in porous media can be categorised based on the Bingham number (i.e. the ratio of the yield stress to the characteristic viscous stress). In a recent study (Chaparian, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 980, A14, 2024), we addressed the yield/plastic limit (infinitely large Bingham number), namely, the onset of flow when the applied pressure gradient is just sufficient to overcome the yield stress resistance and initiate the flow. A purely geometrical universal scale was derived for the non-dimensional critical pressure gradient, which was thoroughly validated against computational data. In the present work, we investigate the Newtonian limit (infinitely large pressure difference compared to the yield stress of the fluid - ultra low Bingham number) both theoretically and computationally. We then propose a Darcy-type law applicable across the entire range of Bingham numbers by combining the mathematical models of the yield/plastic and Newtonian limits. Exhaustive computational data generated in this study (using augmented Lagrangian method coupled with anisotropic adaptive mesh at the pore scale) confirm the validity of the theoretical proposed law.</description>

      <title>New superparticle models in AdS superspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, new superparticle models have been proposed in the $\mathcal{N}$-extended four and five-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) superspaces, AdS$^{4|4\mathcal{N}}$ and AdS$^{5|8\mathcal{N}}$, making use of a unique quadratic deformation to the AdS supersymmetric interval. In this paper we extend these considerations to the three and two-dimensional cases, and propose new two-derivative models for superparticles propagating in these AdS superspaces.</description>

      <title>Holography on Biregular Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a discrete model of holography on biregular trees, which are discrete symmetric spaces associated with the bulk isometry group SU(3) over the unramified quadratic extension of a nonarchimedean field. For a scalar field theory on biregular trees, the bulk-to-bulk and bulk-to-boundary propagators exhibit distinct features absent on the regular tree or continuum AdS spaces, arising from the semihomogeneous nature of the bulk space. We compute the two- and three-point correlators of the putative boundary dual. The three-point correlator exhibits a nontrivial "tensor structure" via dependence on the homogeneity degree of a unique bulk point specified in terms of boundary insertion points. The computed OPE coefficients show dependence on zeta functions associated with the unramified quadratic extension of a nonarchimedean field. This work initiates the formulation of holography on a family of discrete holographic spaces that exhibit features of both flat space and negatively curved space.</description>

      <title>Volume-distance-ratio asymptote and spacetime inextendibility for spatially flat and hyperbolic FLRW spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the volume-distance-ratio (VDR) asymptote at the past timelike boundary point for spatially flat FLRW spacetime with scale factor $a(t) = t^{\alpha}$, and spatially hyperbolic FLRW spacetime with scale factor $a(t) = a_0 t^{\alpha}$. We employ the spacetime inextendibility criteria via the volume-distance-ratio asymptote to deduce their inextendibility. We show that for spatial dimensions greater than $2$, there exists at least one critical exponent $\alpha \in (0,1)$ for which the VDR asymptote along the $\Sigma_t$-orthogonal geodesic equals the Minkowski value.</description>

      <title>Generalization of anomaly formula for time reversal symmetry in (2+1)D abelian bosonic TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study time-reversal symmetry in (2+1)-dimensional abelian bosonic topological phases. Z_2 x Z_2 classifies the time-reversal anomalies in such systems symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in (3+1) dimensions and can be diagnosed via partition functions on manifolds such as RP^4 and CP^2. These partition functions are related by an anomaly formula of the form Z(RP^4) * Z(CP^2) = theta_M, where theta_M is the Dehn twist phase associated with the crosscap state.
  Meanwhile, the existence of gapped boundaries is constrained by so-called higher central charges, denoted xi_n, which serve as computable invariants encoding obstruction data. Motivated by the known relation Z(CP^2) = xi_1, we propose a generalization of the anomaly formula involving both the higher central charges xi_n and a new time-reversal invariant eta_n. By introducing a distinguished subset M^n of the set A of anyons, we establish the relation
  eta_n * xi_n = (sum of theta(a)^n over a in M^n) divided by its absolute value.
  This generalizes the known anomaly formula. We analyze the algebraic structure of the subset M^n, derive consistency relations it satisfies, and clarify its connection to the original anomaly formula.</description>
