      <title>Can AI be Consentful?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of generative AI systems exposes the challenges of traditional legal and ethical frameworks built around consent. This chapter examines how the conventional notion of consent, while fundamental to data protection and privacy rights, proves insufficient in addressing the implications of AI-generated content derived from personal data. Through legal and ethical analysis, we show that while individuals can consent to the initial use of their data for AI training, they cannot meaningfully consent to the numerous potential outputs their data might enable or the extent to which the output is used or distributed. We identify three fundamental challenges: the scope problem, the temporality problem, and the autonomy trap, which collectively create what we term a ''consent gap'' in AI systems and their surrounding ecosystem. We argue that current legal frameworks inadequately address these emerging challenges, particularly regarding individual autonomy, identity rights, and social responsibility, especially in cases where AI-generated content creates new forms of personal representation beyond the scope of the original consent. By examining how these consent limitations intersect with broader principles of responsible AI (including fairness, transparency, accountability, and autonomy) we demonstrate the need to evolve ethical and legal approaches to consent.</description>

      <title>Epitome: Pioneering an Experimental Platform for AI-Social Science Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into social science experiments represents a transformative approach to understanding human-AI interactions and their societal impacts. We introduce Epitome, the world's first open experimental platform dedicated to the deep integration of artificial intelligence and social science. Rooted in theoretical foundations from management, communication studies, sociology, psychology, and ethics, Epitome focuses on the interactive impacts of AI on individuals, organizations, and society during its real-world deployment. It constructs a theoretical support system through cross-disciplinary experiments. The platform offers a one-stop comprehensive experimental solution spanning "foundation models-complex application development-user feedback" through seven core modules, while embedding the classical "control-comparison-comparative causal logic" of social science experiments into multilevel human-computer interaction environments, including dialogues, group chats, and multi-agent virtual scenarios. With its canvas-style, user-friendly interface, Epitome enables researchers to easily design and run complex experimental scenarios, facilitating systematic investigations into the social impacts of AI and exploration of integrated solutions.To demonstrate its capabilities, we replicated three seminal social science experiments involving LLMs, showcasing Epitome's potential to streamline complex experimental designs and produce robust results, suitable for publishing in the top selective journals. Our findings highlight the platform's utility in enhancing the efficiency and quality of human-AI interactions, providing valuable insights into the societal implications of AI technologies. Epitome thus offers a powerful tool for advancing interdisciplinary research at the intersection of AI and social science, with potential applications in policy-making, ...</description>

      <title>Quantifying Student Success with Generative AI: A Monte Carlo Simulation Informed by Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies like ChatGPT has raised increasing curiosity about their use in higher education, specifically with respect to how students view them, make use of them, and the implications for learning outcomes. This paper employs a hybrid methodological approach involving a systematic literature review and simulation-based modeling to explore student perceptions of GenAI use in the context of higher education. A total of nineteen empirical articles from 2023 through 2025 were selected from the PRISMA-based search targeting the Scopus database. Synthesis of emerging patterns from the literature was achieved by thematic categorization. Six of these had enough quantitative information, i.e., item-level means and standard deviations, to permit probabilistic modeling. One dataset, from the resulting subset, was itself selected as a representative case with which to illustrate inverse-variance weighting by Monte Carlo simulation, by virtue of its well-designed Likert scale format and thematic alignment with the use of computing systems by the researcher.
  The simulation provided a composite "Success Score" forecasting the strength of the relationship between student perceptions and learning achievements. Findings reveal that attitude factors concerned with usability and real-world usefulness are significantly better predictors of positive learning achievement than affective or trust-based factors. Such an interdisciplinary perspective provides a unique means of linking thematic results with predictive modelling, resonating with longstanding controversies about the proper use of GenAI tools within the university.</description>

      <title>A Practical SAFE-AI Framework for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Developing Medical Artificial Intelligence Ethics Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) offers incredible possibilities for patient care, but raises significant ethical issues, such as the potential for bias. Powerful ethical frameworks exist to minimize these issues, but are often developed for academic or regulatory environments and tend to be comprehensive but overly prescriptive, making them difficult to operationalize within fast-paced, resource-constrained environments. We introduce the Scalable Agile Framework for Execution in AI (SAFE-AI) designed to balance ethical rigor with business priorities by embedding ethical oversight into standard Agile-based product development workflows. The framework emphasizes the early establishment of testable acceptance criteria, fairness metrics, and transparency metrics to manage model uncertainty, while also promoting continuous monitoring and re-evaluation of these metrics across the AI lifecycle. A core component of this framework are responsibility metrics using scenario-based probability analogy mapping designed to enhance transparency and stakeholder trust. This ensures that retraining or tuning activities are subject to lightweight but meaningful ethical review. By focusing on the minimum necessary requirements for responsible development, our framework offers a scalable, business-aligned approach to ethical AI suitable for organizations without dedicated ethics teams.</description>

      <title>Penalizing Transparency? How AI Disclosure and Author Demographics Shape Human and AI Judgments About Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI integrates in various types of human writing, calls for transparency around AI assistance are growing. However, if transparency operates on uneven ground and certain identity groups bear a heavier cost for being honest, then the burden of openness becomes asymmetrical. This study investigates how AI disclosure statement affects perceptions of writing quality, and whether these effects vary by the author's race and gender. Through a large-scale controlled experiment, both human raters (n = 1,970) and LLM raters (n = 2,520) evaluated a single human-written news article while disclosure statements and author demographics were systematically varied. This approach reflects how both human and algorithmic decisions now influence access to opportunities (e.g., hiring, promotion) and social recognition (e.g., content recommendation algorithms). We find that both human and LLM raters consistently penalize disclosed AI use. However, only LLM raters exhibit demographic interaction effects: they favor articles attributed to women or Black authors when no disclosure is present. But these advantages disappear when AI assistance is revealed. These findings illuminate the complex relationships between AI disclosure and author identity, highlighting disparities between machine and human evaluation patterns.</description>

      <title>AI and Remote Sensing for Resilient and Sustainable Built Environments: A Review of Current Methods, Open Data and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical infrastructure, such as transport networks, underpins economic growth by enabling mobility and trade. However, ageing assets, climate change impacts (e.g., extreme weather, rising sea levels), and hybrid threats ranging from natural disasters to cyber attacks and conflicts pose growing risks to their resilience and functionality. This review paper explores how emerging digital technologies, specifically Artificial Intelligence (AI), can enhance damage assessment and monitoring of transport infrastructure. A systematic literature review examines existing AI models and datasets for assessing damage in roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure impacted by natural disasters. Special focus is given to the unique challenges and opportunities associated with bridge damage detection due to their structural complexity and critical role in connectivity. The integration of SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data with AI models is also discussed, with the review revealing a critical research gap: a scarcity of studies applying AI models to SAR data for comprehensive bridge damage assessment. Therefore, this review aims to identify the research gaps and provide foundations for AI-driven solutions for assessing and monitoring critical transport infrastructures.</description>

      <title>From Reports to Reality: Testing Consistency in Instagram's Digital Services Act Compliance Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Digital Services Act (DSA) introduces harmonized rules for content moderation and platform governance in the European Union, mandating robust compliance mechanisms, particularly for very large online platforms and search engines. This study examined compliance with DSA requirements, focusing on Instagram as a case study. We develop and apply a multi-level consistency framework to evaluate DSA compliance. Our findings contribute to the broader discussion on empirically-based regulation, providing insight into how researchers, regulators, auditors and platforms can better utilize DSA mechanisms to improve reporting and enforcement quality and accountability. This work underscores that consistency can help detect potential compliance failures. It also demonstrates that platforms should be evaluated as part of an interconnected ecosystem rather than through isolated processes, which is crucial for effective compliance evaluation under the DSA.</description>

      <title>MALIBU Benchmark: Multi-Agent LLM Implicit Bias Uncovered</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems, which consist of multiple AI models interacting within a shared environment, are increasingly used for persona-based interactions. However, if not carefully designed, these systems can reinforce implicit biases in large language models (LLMs), raising concerns about fairness and equitable representation. We present MALIBU, a novel benchmark developed to assess the degree to which LLM-based multi-agent systems implicitly reinforce social biases and stereotypes. MALIBU evaluates bias in LLM-based multi-agent systems through scenario-based assessments. AI models complete tasks within predefined contexts, and their responses undergo evaluation by an LLM-based multi-agent judging system in two phases. In the first phase, judges score responses labeled with specific demographic personas (e.g., gender, race, religion) across four metrics. In the second phase, judges compare paired responses assigned to different personas, scoring them and selecting the superior response. Our study quantifies biases in LLM-generated outputs, revealing that bias mitigation may favor marginalized personas over true neutrality, emphasizing the need for nuanced detection, balanced fairness strategies, and transparent evaluation benchmarks in multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>From Literature to ReWA: Discussing Reproductive Well-being in HCI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reproductive well-being is shaped by intersecting cultural, religious, gendered, and political contexts, yet current technologies often reflect narrow, Western-centric assumptions. In this literature review, we synthesize findings from 147 peer-reviewed papers published between 2015 and 2025 across HCI, CSCW and social computing, ICTD, digital and public health, and AI for well-being scholarship to map the evolving reproductive well-being landscape. We identify three thematic waves that focused on early access and education, cultural sensitivity and privacy, and AI integration with policy-aware design, and highlight how technologies support or constrain diverse reproductive experiences. Our analysis reveals critical gaps in inclusivity, with persistent exclusions of men and non-binary users, migrants, and users in the Global South. Additionally, we surfaced the significant absence of literature on the role of stakeholders (e.g., husband and family members, household maids and cleaning helping hands, midwife, etc.) in the reproductive well-being space. Drawing on the findings from the literature, we propose the ReWA framework to support reproductive well-being for all agendas through six design orientations associated with: location, culture, and history; polyvocality and agency; rationality, temporality, distributive roles, and methodology.</description>

      <title>Epistemic Scarcity: The Economics of Unresolvable Unknowns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a praxeological analysis of artificial intelligence and algorithmic governance, challenging assumptions about the capacity of machine systems to sustain economic and epistemic order. Drawing on Misesian a priori reasoning and Austrian theories of entrepreneurship, we argue that AI systems are incapable of performing the core functions of economic coordination: interpreting ends, discovering means, and communicating subjective value through prices. Where neoclassical and behavioural models treat decisions as optimisation under constraint, we frame them as purposive actions under uncertainty.
  We critique dominant ethical AI frameworks such as Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAT) as extensions of constructivist rationalism, which conflict with a liberal order grounded in voluntary action and property rights. Attempts to encode moral reasoning in algorithms reflect a misunderstanding of ethics and economics. However complex, AI systems cannot originate norms, interpret institutions, or bear responsibility. They remain opaque, misaligned, and inert.
  Using the concept of epistemic scarcity, we explore how information abundance degrades truth discernment, enabling both entrepreneurial insight and soft totalitarianism. Our analysis ends with a civilisational claim: the debate over AI concerns the future of human autonomy, institutional evolution, and reasoned choice. The Austrian tradition, focused on action, subjectivity, and spontaneous order, offers the only coherent alternative to rising computational social control.</description>

      <title>The Thin Line Between Comprehension and Persuasion in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are excellent at maintaining high-level, convincing dialogues. They are being fast deployed as chatbots and evaluators in sensitive areas, such as peer review and mental health applications. This, along with the disparate accounts on their reasoning capabilities, calls for a closer examination of LLMs and their comprehension of dialogue. In this work we begin by evaluating LLMs' ability to maintain a debate--one of the purest yet most complex forms of human communication. Then we measure how this capability relates to their understanding of what is being talked about, namely, their comprehension of dialogical structures and the pragmatic context. We find that LLMs are capable of maintaining coherent, persuasive debates, often swaying the beliefs of participants and audiences alike. We also note that awareness or suspicion of AI involvement encourage people to be more critical of the arguments made. When polling LLMs on their comprehension of deeper structures of dialogue, however, they cannot demonstrate said understanding. Our findings tie the shortcomings of LLMs-as-evaluators to their (in)ability to understand the context. More broadly, for the field of argumentation theory we posit that, if an agent can convincingly maintain a dialogue, it is not necessary for it to know what it is talking about. Hence, the modelling of pragmatic context and coherence are secondary to effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models, and LLM-Based Agents, Should Be Used to Enhance the Digital Public Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper argues that large language model-based recommenders can displace today's attention-allocation machinery. LLM-based recommenders would ingest open-web content, infer a user's natural-language goals, and present information that matches their reflective preferences. Properly designed, they could deliver personalization without industrial-scale data hoarding, return control to individuals, optimize for genuine ends rather than click-through proxies, and support autonomous attention management. Synthesizing evidence of current systems' harms with recent work on LLM-driven pipelines, we identify four key research hurdles: generating candidates without centralized data, maintaining computational efficiency, modeling preferences robustly, and defending against prompt-injection. None looks prohibitive; surmounting them would steer the digital public sphere toward democratic, human-centered values.</description>

      <title>Regulating Algorithmic Management: A Multi-Stakeholder Study of Challenges in Aligning Software and the Law for Workplace Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algorithmic management (AM)'s impact on worker well-being has led to calls for regulation. However, little is known about the effectiveness and challenges in real-world AM regulation across the regulatory process -- rule operationalization, software use, and enforcement. Our multi-stakeholder study addresses this gap within workplace scheduling, one of the few AM domains with implemented regulations. We interviewed 38 stakeholders across the regulatory process: regulators, defense attorneys, worker advocates, managers, and workers. Our findings suggest that the efficacy of AM regulation is influenced by: (i) institutional constraints that challenge efforts to encode law into AM software, (ii) on-the-ground use of AM software that shapes its ability to facilitate compliance, (iii) mismatches between software and regulatory contexts that hinder enforcement, and (iv) unique concerns that software introduces when used to regulate AM. These findings underscore the importance of a sociotechnical approach to AM regulation, which considers organizational and collaborative contexts alongside the inherent attributes of software. We offer future research directions and implications for technology policy and design.</description>

      <title>Vehicle-group-based Crash Risk Prediction and Interpretation on Highways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12415v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous studies in predicting crash risks primarily associated the number or likelihood of crashes on a road segment with traffic parameters or geometric characteristics, usually neglecting the impact of vehicles' continuous movement and interactions with nearby vehicles. Recent technology advances, such as Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are able to collect high-resolution trajectory data, which enables trajectory-based risk analysis. This study investigates a new vehicle group (VG) based risk analysis method and explores risk evolution mechanisms considering VG features. An impact-based vehicle grouping method is proposed to cluster vehicles into VGs by evaluating their responses to the erratic behaviors of nearby vehicles. The risk of a VG is aggregated based on the risk between each vehicle pair in the VG, measured by inverse Time-to-Collision (iTTC). A Logistic Regression and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) are then employed to predict VG risks using aggregated and disaggregated VG information. Both methods achieve excellent performance with AUC values exceeding 0.93. For the GNN model, GNNExplainer with feature perturbation is applied to identify critical individual vehicle features and their directional impact on VG risks. Overall, this research contributes a new perspective for identifying, predicting, and interpreting traffic risks.</description>

      <title>Adapting Probabilistic Risk Assessment for AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18536</link>

Abstract: Modern general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems present an urgent risk management challenge, as their rapidly evolving capabilities and potential for catastrophic harm outpace our ability to reliably assess their risks. Current methods often rely on selective testing and undocumented assumptions about risk priorities, frequently failing to make a serious attempt at assessing the set of pathways through which AI systems pose direct or indirect risks to society and the biosphere. This paper introduces the probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) for AI framework, adapting established PRA techniques from high-reliability industries (e.g., nuclear power, aerospace) for the new challenges of advanced AI. The framework guides assessors in identifying potential risks, estimating likelihood and severity bands, and explicitly documenting evidence, underlying assumptions, and analyses at appropriate granularities. The framework's implementation tool synthesizes the results into a risk report card with aggregated risk estimates from all assessed risks. It introduces three methodological advances: (1) Aspect-oriented hazard analysis provides systematic hazard coverage guided by a first-principles taxonomy of AI system aspects (e.g. capabilities, domain knowledge, affordances); (2) Risk pathway modeling analyzes causal chains from system aspects to societal impacts using bidirectional analysis and incorporating prospective techniques; and (3) Uncertainty management employs scenario decomposition, reference scales, and explicit tracing protocols to structure credible projections with novelty or limited data. Additionally, the framework harmonizes diverse assessment methods by integrating evidence into comparable, quantified absolute risk estimates for lifecycle decisions. We have implemented this as a workbook tool for AI developers, evaluators, and regulators.</description>

      <title>Exploring Privacy and Security as Drivers for Environmental Sustainability in Cloud-Based Office Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the intersection of privacy, security, and environmental sustainability in cloud-based office solutions, focusing on quantifying user- and network-side energy use and associated carbon emissions. We hypothesise that privacy-focused services are typically more energy-efficient than those funded through data collection and advertising. To evaluate this, we propose a framework that systematically measures environmental costs based on energy usage and network data traffic during well-defined, automated usage scenarios. To test our hypothesis, we first analyse how underlying architectures and business models, such as monetisation through personalised advertising, contribute to the environmental footprint of these services. We then explore existing methodologies and tools for software environmental impact assessment. We apply our framework to three mainstream email services selected to reflect different privacy policies, from ad-supported tracking-intensive models to privacy-focused designs: Microsoft Outlook, Google Mail (Gmail), and Proton Mail. We extend this comparison to a self-hosted email solution, evaluated with and without end-to-end encryption. We show that the self-hosted solution, even with 14% of device energy and 15% of emissions overheads from PGP encryption, remains the most energy-efficient, saving up to 33% of emissions per session compared to Gmail. Among commercial providers, Proton Mail is the most efficient, saving up to 0.1 gCO2 e per session compared to Outlook, whose emissions can be further reduced by 2% through ad-blocking.</description>
