      <title>Symbol Detection in a MIMO Wireless Communication System Using a FeFET-coupled CMOS Ring Oscillator Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbol decoding in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems requires the deployment of fast, energy-efficient computing hardware deployable at the edge. The brute-force, exact maximum likelihood (ML) decoder, solved on conventional classical digital hardware, has exponential time complexity. Approximate classical solvers implemented on the same hardware have polynomial time complexity at the best. In this article, we design an alternative ring-oscillator-based coupled oscillator array to act as an oscillator Ising machine (OIM) and heuristically solve the ML-based MIMO detection problem. Complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology is used to design the ring oscillators, and ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET) technology is chosen as the coupling element (X) between the oscillators in this CMOS + X OIM design. For this purpose, we experimentally report high linear range of conductance variation (1 micro-S to 60 micro-S) in a FeFET device fabricated at 28 nm high-K/ metal gate (HKMG) CMOS technology node. We incorporate the conductance modulation characteristic in SPICE simulation of the ring oscillators connected in an all-to-all fashion through a crossbar array of these FeFET devices. We show that the above range of conductance variation of the FeFET device is suitable to obtain optimum OIM performance with no significant performance drop up to a MIMO size of 100 transmitting and 100 receiving antennas, thereby making FeFET a suitable device for this application. Our simulations and associated analysis using the Kuramoto model of oscillators also predict that this designed classical analog OIM, if implemented experimentally, will offer logarithmic scaling of computation time with MIMO size, thereby offering a huge improvement (in terms of computation speed) over aforementioned MIMO decoders run on conventional digital hardware.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical properties of solid oxide fuel cells under the coupling effect of airflow pattern and airflow velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the dual background of deep adjustment of global energy pattern and severe challenges of environmental problems, solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) has become the focus of research on efficient and clean energy conversion technology due to its many excellent characteristics. The electrochemical performance of SOFC is affected by various factors such as gas flow pattern (co-flow, counter-flow, cross-flow), flow rate (cathode and anode channel gases), and operating voltage. Accurately analysing the variation of electrochemical indexes with each factor is the basis for proposing the design scheme of high efficiency reaction of the cell. Therefore, a three-dimensional multi-field coupling model of SOFC is established in this study, and the model parameters and boundary conditions covering electrochemistry, gas flow, substance diffusion, etc. are set to study the influence of the coupling between factors on the electrochemical performance of the cell. These results show that with the decrease of operating voltage, the electrochemical reaction rate of the cell increases significantly, the gas mole fraction gradient increases, and the inhomogeneity of the electrolyte current density distribution is enhanced. Under low-voltage operating conditions, the cross-flow flow pattern shows better electrochemical performance advantages, and its power density profile takes the lead in different current density intervals. With the increase of the flow rate of the flow channel gas, the output power density curve of the cell shows an overall upward trend, and then the driving effect of the flow rate increase on the power density increase is gradually weakened due to the saturated cathodic reaction. This study reveals the influence of the coupling of flow pattern, flow rate and voltage on the electrochemical performance of SOFC, and provides guidance for the commercial application of SOFC.</description>

      <title>Row Hammer Effect and Floating Body Effect of Monolithic 3D Stackable 1T1C DRAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolithic 3D stackable 1T1C DRAM technology is on the rise, with initial prototypes reported by the industry. This work presents a comprehensive reliability study focusing on the intricate interplay between the row hammer effect and the floating body effect. First, using a TCAD model of a 3D DRAM mini-array, we categorize different cases of adjacent cells and show that the notorious row hammer effect induced by charge migration is significantly mitigated compared to 2D DRAM. However, we found that when incorporating an impact ionization model to account for the floating body characteristics of the silicon access transistor, the capacitive coupling between vertically stacked cells is severely exacerbated. Second, we conduct an in-depth investigation into the floating body effect itself. We systematically examine the dependence of this effect on key device parameters, including body thickness, doping concentration, and gate work function.</description>

      <title>Thermoelastic wave-based logic for mechanically cognitive materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in metamaterials and fabrication techniques have revived interest in mechanical computing. Contrary to techniques relying on static deformations of buckling beams or origami-based lattices, the integration of wave scattering and mechanical memory presents a promising path toward efficient, low-latency elastoacoustic computing. This work introduces a novel class of multifunctional mechanical computing circuits that leverage the rich dynamics of phononic and locally resonant materials. These circuits incorporate memory-integrated components, realized here via metamaterial cells infused with shape memory alloys which recall stored elastic profiles and trigger specific actions upon thermal activation. A critical advantage of this realization is its synergistic interaction with incident vibroacoustic loads and the inherited high speed of waves, giving it a notable performance edge over recent adaptations of mechanically intelligent systems that employ innately slower mechanisms such as elastomeric shape changes and snap-through bistabilities. Through a proof-of-concept physical implementation, the efficacy and reconfigurability of the wave-based gates are demonstrated via output probes and measured wavefields. Furthermore, the modular design of the fundamental gates can be used as building blocks to construct complex combinational logic circuits, paving the way for sequential logic in wave-based analog computing systems.</description>

      <title>Polarization-sensitive GeSn Mid-Infrared Membrane Photodetectors with Integrated Plasmonic Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Germanium-Tin (GeSn) semiconductors are promising for mid-infrared optoelectronics owing to their silicon compatibility, tunable bandgap, and potential for room-temperature operation. Released GeSn membranes provide an additional degree of freedom to extend the operation wavelength through epitaxial strain relaxation, while their transferability expands design flexibility. On the other hand, metasurfaces have become an effective strategy to engineer light--matter interaction, and their integration with photodetectors can enhance performance and introduce new functionalities. Here, we demonstrate a mid-infrared photodetector consisting of a transfer-printed Ge$_{0.89}$Sn$_{0.11}$ membrane integrated with an Au plasmonic metasurface. The photodetector exhibits a wavelength cutoff exceeding 3.0~$\mu$m with nearly fourfold increase in responsivity at 2.5~$\mu$m as compared to unreleased films, attributed to Fabry--P\'erot resonance. Furthermore, the integration with an anisotropic metasurface yields detectors with strong polarization sensitivity, achieving a measured contrast ratio of $\sim$4:1 between orthogonal polarizations. Moreover, the operation wavelength of the photodetector can be selectively tuned by varying the geometric scale of the metasurface. The experimental results show excellent agreement with simulations, confirming the effectiveness and versatility of this integrated metasurface--membrane design.</description>

      <title>Experimental Investigation of Acoustic Kerker Effect in Labyrinthine Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the directionality of the acoustic scattering with single acoustic metaatoms has a key importance for reaching spatial routing of sound with acoustic metamaterials. In this paper, we present the experimental demonstration of the acoustic analogue of the Kerker effect realized in a two-dimensional coiled-space metaatom. By engineering the interference between monopolar and dipolar resonances within a high-index acoustic metaatom, we achieve directional scattering with suppressed backward or forward response at the first and second Kerker conditions respectively. Experimental measurements of the scattered pressure field, in a parallel-plate waveguide environment, show good agreement with the full-wave simulations. Our results validate the feasibility of Kerker-inspired wave control in acoustic systems and open new opportunities for directional sound manipulation.</description>

      <title>Ar$\chi$i-Textile Composites: Drapable Hybrid Woven Composites for Lightning Strike Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRPs) have been extensively used in the aerospace and wind energy industries due to their superior specific mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. However, their higher electrical resistivity makes them susceptible to lightning strike damage, which necessitates the addition of a surface lightning strike protection (LSP) layer. Traditional LSP systems, such as copper mesh or expanded foil, reduce lightning strike damage, but are not easily drapable around complex geometries and may introduce delamination-prone regions within the composite. Here, we propose a novel manufacturing strategy for architected hybrid composites as drapable LSP by weaving stainless steel yarns within the woven carbon fiber composites. We varied the metal-to-carbon yarn ratio and stacking configuration to assess damage evolution under quasi-static arc exposures and simulated lightning strikes. Our results elucidate that incorporating hybrid layers into composites significantly reduced surface temperatures, through-thickness damage, and mass loss under both electric arc impacts. The composites with the proposed LSP layers also exhibited higher retention of flexural modulus and strength compared to the reference CFRP. Advanced air mobility (AAM) vehicles, which operate at lower altitudes, face significant safety challenges due to their high susceptibility to lightning strikes. Therefore, the proposed hybridized composites can be used as an efficient and drapable LSP around complex shapes in AAM vehicles, offering enhanced safety and protection.</description>

      <title>Large spin signal and spin rectification in folded-bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene is an exceptional platform for spin-based non-volatile memory, logic, and neuromorphic computing by combining long-distance spin transport with electrical tunability at room temperature. However, advancing beyond passive spin channels requires devices capable of generating large spin signals with efficient rectification capabilities, which are essential for active spintronic components. Here, we demonstrate a folded-bilayer graphene spin-valve device with giant non-local spin signals in the several mV range with pronounced spin-rectification effects. The efficient spin injection creates a giant spin accumulation of 20 meV, and generates a spin-diode effect with an asymmetry of over an order of magnitude between forward and reverse bias conditions. This spin-diode effect arises from the nonlinear coupling between large spin accumulation and the applied electric field. These large spin signals, together with the spin-diode effect, are achieved with folded-bilayer graphene, offering a promising platform for developing active ultrathin two-dimensional spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Path-Optimized Fast Quasi-Adiabatic Driving in Coupled Elastic Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast quasi-adiabatic driving (FAQUAD) is a central technique in shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA), enabling accelerated adiabatic evolution by optimizing the rate of change of a single control parameter. However, many realistic systems are governed by multiple coupled parameters, where the adiabatic condition depends not only on the local rate of change but also on the path through parameter space. Here, we introduce an enhanced FAQUAD framework that incorporates path optimization in addition to conventional velocity optimization, extending STA control to two-dimensional parameter spaces. We implement this concept in a coupled elastic-waveguide system, where the synthetic parameters-detuning and coupling-are controlled by the thicknesses of the waveguides and connecting bridges. Using scanning laser Doppler vibrometry, we directly map the flexural-wave field and observe adiabatic energy transfer along the optimized path in parameter space. This elastic-wave platform provides a versatile classical analogue for exploring multidimensional adiabatic control, demonstrating efficient and compact implementation of shortcut-to-adiabaticity protocols.</description>

      <title>A Compact Model for Polar Multiple-Channel Field Effect Transistors: A Case Study in III-V Nitride Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A compact analytical model is developed for the mobile charge density of polar multiple channel field effect transistors. Two dimensional electron and hole gases can be potentially induced by spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization in polar heterostructures. Focusing on the active region of devices that employ a multiple quantum-well layout, the total electron and hole populations are estimated from fundamental electrostatic and quantum mechanical principles. Hole gas depletion techniques, revolving around intentional donor doping, are modeled and evaluated, culminating in a generalized closed-form equation for the mobile carrier density across the doping schemes examined. The utility of this model is illustrated for the III-Nitride material system, exploring AlGaN/GaN, AlInN/GaN and AlScN/GaN heterostructures. The compact framework provided herein considerably elucidates and enhances the efficiency of multi-layered transistor design.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning discovery of molecular modulators for perovskite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of effective molecular modulators is essential for advancing perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but the research process is hindered by the vastness of chemical space and the time-consuming and expensive trial-and-error experimental screening. Concurrently, machine learning (ML) offers significant potential for accelerating materials discovery. However, applying ML to PSCs remains a major challenge due to data scarcity and limitations of traditional quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models. Here, we apply a chemical informed transfer learning framework based on pre-trained deep neural networks, which achieves high accuracy in predicting the molecular modulator's effect on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs. This framework is established through systematical benchmarking of diverse molecular representations, enabling lowcost and high-throughput virtual screening over 79,043 commercially available molecules. Furthermore, we leverage interpretability techniques to visualize the learned chemical representation and experimentally characterize the resulting modulator-perovskite interactions. The top molecular modulators identified by the framework are subsequently validated experimentally, delivering a remarkably improved champion PCE of 26.91% in PSCs.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Materials for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various coils for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are widely available for clinical and research use. These coils are almost all designed as air coils, which require large levels of energy to achieve a given magnetic flux density and in turn electric field strength, whereas in other sectors, such as power electronics or electrical machines, magnetic materials have been used for a long time to achieve higher efficiencies. We tested the impact on the electric and magnetic properties of different soft magnetic materials, including various ferrite cores, laminated sheet materials of nonisotropic corn-oriented silicon-steel, non-oriented silicon-steel, as well as cobalt-iron, and soft magnetic compound powder cores with insulated particles. Every material led to a reduction in coil current and voltage for the same target electric field strength. For the same field energy, every material yielded lower losses. Most common materials saturated already at very low currents. More material in thicker layers could shift the saturation point but at the cost of high weight. Due to their low saturation flux density, ferrites appear unsuitable for the high amplitude requirements of TMS. Laminated sheet materials and powder cores reduce the pulse energy, but the laminated sheet material adds more weight for the same effect than powder cores. Thus, appropriate magnetic materials can reduce the required pulse energy. Saturation flux density is the most relevant parameter, whereas the permeability beyond a certain base level is practically irrelevant. Most importantly, the weight of a magnetic-core coil may always be increased compared to an air coil for the same target field.</description>

      <title>Characterising Atomic-Scale Surface Disorder on 2D Materials Using Neutral Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoS2, have the potential to be widely used in electronic devices and sensors due to their high carrier mobility and tunable band structure. In 2D TMD devices, surface and interface cleanness can critically impact the performance and reproducibility. Even sample surfaces prepared under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) can be contaminated, causing disorder. On such samples, trace levels of submonolayer contamination remain largely overlooked, and conventional surface characterisation techniques have limited capability in detecting such adsorbates. Here, we apply scanning helium microscopy (SHeM), a non-destructive and ultra-sensitive technique, to investigate the surface cleanness of 2D MoS2. Our measurements reveal that even minute amounts of adventitious carbon induce atomic-scale disorder across MoS2 surfaces, leading to the disappearance of helium diffraction. By tracking helium reflectivity over time, we quantify the decay of surface order across different microscopic regions and find that flat areas are more susceptible to contamination than regions near edges. These findings highlight the fragility of surface order in 2D materials, even under UHV, and establish SHeM as a powerful tool for non-damaging microscopic 2D material cleanness characterisation. The approach offers a new route to wafer-scale characterisation of 2D material quality.</description>

      <title>Gate Dielectric Engineering with an Ultrathin Silicon-oxide Interfacial Dipole Layer for Low-Leakage Oxide-Semiconductor Memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a gate dielectric engineering approach leveraging an ultrathin, atomic layer deposited (ALD) silicon oxide interfacial layer (SiL) between the amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) channel and the high-k gate dielectric. SiL positively shifts the threshold voltage (V$_T$) of AOS transistors, providing at least four distinct $V_T$ levels with a maximum increase of 500 mV. It achieves stable $V_T$ control without significantly degrading critical device parameters such as mobility, on-state current, all while keeping the process temperature below 225 $^{\circ}$C and requiring no additional heat treatment to activate the dipole. Positive-bias temperature instability tests at 85 $^{\circ}$C indicate a significant reduction in negative $V_{T}$ shifts for SiL-integrated devices, highlighting enhanced reliability. Incorporating this SiL gate stack into two-transistor gain-cell (GC) memory maintains a more stable storage node voltage ($V_{SN}$) (reduces $V_{SN}$ drop by 67\%), by limiting unwanted charge losses. SiL-engineered GCs also reach retention times up to 10,000 s at room temperature and reduce standby leakage current by three orders of magnitude relative to baseline device, substantially lowering refresh energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Integrated photonic multigrid solver for partial differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations is crucial to analysing and predicting complex, large-scale physical systems but pushes conventional high-performance computers to their limits. Application specific photonic processors are an exciting computing paradigm for building efficient, ultrafast hardware accelerators. Here, we investigate the synergy between multigrid based partial differential equations solvers and low latency photonic matrix vector multipliers. We propose a mixed-precision photonic multigrid solver, that offloads the computationally demanding smoothening procedure to the optical domain. We test our approach on an integrated photonic accelerator operating at 2 GSPS solving a Poisson and Schr\"odinger equation. By offloading the smoothening operation to the photonic system, we can reduce the digital operation by more than 80%. Finally, we show that the photonic multigrid solver potentially reduces digital operations by up to 97 % in lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) calculations, enabling an order-of-magnitude gain in computational speed and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Domain Morphology, Electrocaloric Response, and Negative Capacitance States of Ferroelectric Nanowires Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyzed the domain morphology, electrocaloric response, and negative capacitance states in a one-dimensional array of uniformly oriented, radial symmetric ferroelectric nanowires, whose spontaneous polarization is normal to their symmetry axis. The wires are densely packed between flat electrodes. Using finite element modeling based on the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach, electrostatics, and elasticity theory, we calculated the distributions of spontaneous polarization, domain structures, electric potential, electric field, dielectric permittivity, and electrocaloric response in the nanowires. Due to size and depolarization effects, the paraelectric and ferroelectric (poly-domain or single-domain) states of the wires can be stable, depending on their radius and the dielectric permittivity of the surrounding medium. It is demonstrated that dipole-dipole interaction between the nanowires determines the stability of the polar (or anti-polar) state in the array when the wire radius is significantly smaller than the critical size of the paraelectric transition in an isolated wire. We reveal that a large region of a mixed state, characterized by poly-domain ferroelectric states with nonzero average polarization inside each wire and zero average polarization of the whole array, can be stable. By selecting the dielectric permittivity of the surrounding medium and the nanowire radius, one can maximize the negative capacitance effect in the capacitor with densely packed wires. It is also possible to achieve maximal enhancement of the electrocaloric response due to size effects in the wires. The underlying physics of the predicted enhancement is the combined action of size effects and the long-range electrostatic interactions between the ferroelectric dipoles in the nanowires and the image charges in the electrodes</description>

      <title>Strong coupling between coherent ferrons and cavity acoustic phonons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent ferrons, the quanta of polarization waves, can potentially be hybridized with many other quasiparticles for achieving novel control modalities in quantum communication, computing, and sensing. Here, we theoretically demonstrate a new hybridized state resulting from the strong coupling between fundamental-mode (wavenumber is zero) coherent ferrons and cavity bulk acoustic phonons. Using a van der Waals ferroelectric CuInP2S6 membrane as an example, we predict an ultra-strong ferron-phonon coupling at room temperature, where the coupling strength g_c reaches over 10% of the resonant frequency {\omega}_0. We also predict an in-situ electric-field-driven bistable control of mode-specific ferron-phonon hybridization via ferroelectric switching. We further show that, CuInP2S6 allows for reaching the fundamentally intriguing but challenging deep strong coupling regime (i.e., g_c/{\omega}_0&gt;1) near the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition. Our findings establish the theoretical basis for exploiting coherent ferrons as a new contender for hybrid quantum system with strong and highly tunable coherent coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal charge transport in superconductors enables rectification but is usually limited to the longitudinal direction. In this work, we show that a direct current bias injected off principal axes in two-dimensional anisotropic superconductors converts anisotropy into transverse nonreciprocity, enabling supercurrent diode effect measurement. This is demonstrated within both a Ginzburg-Landau framework and self-consistent mean-field calculations. When the control bias exceeds its critical value, the transverse dissipationless currents can only flow unidirectionally. This mechanism motivates the design of a multi-terminal current-gated orthogonal superconducting transistor (CGOST) and yields simple, bias direction angle-dependent design rules for device optimization. As direct applications, we propose a tunable supercurrent range controller and a half-wave rectifier based on the CGOST. Our findings open new avenues for developing nonreciprocal superconducting electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Defining Energy Indicators for Impact Identification on Aerospace Composites: A Physics-Informed Machine Learning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy estimation is critical to impact identification on aerospace composites, where low-velocity impacts can induce internal damage that is undetectable at the surface. Current methodologies for energy prediction are often constrained by data sparsity, signal noise, complex feature interdependencies, non-linear dynamics, massive design spaces, and the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem. This study introduces a physics-informed framework that embeds domain knowledge into machine learning through a dedicated input space. The approach combines observational biases, which guide the design of physics-motivated features, with targeted feature selection to retain only the most informative indicators. Features are extracted from time, frequency, and time-frequency domains to capture complementary aspects of the structural response. A structured feature selection process integrating statistical significance, correlation filtering, dimensionality reduction, and noise robustness ensures physical relevance and interpretability. Exploratory data analysis further reveals domain-specific trends, yielding a reduced feature set that captures essential dynamic phenomena such as amplitude scaling, spectral redistribution, and transient signal behaviour. Together, these steps produce a compact set of energy-sensitive indicators with both statistical robustness and physical significance, resulting in impact energy predictions that remain interpretable and traceable to measurable structural responses. Using this optimised input space, a fully-connected neural network is trained and validated with experimental data from multiple impact scenarios, including pristine and damaged states. The resulting model demonstrates significantly improved impact energy prediction accuracy, reducing errors by a factor of three compared to conventional time-series techniques and purely data-driven models.</description>

      <title>Comparison between first-principles supercell calculations of polarons and the ab initio polaron equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarons are composite quasiparticles formed by excess charges and the accompanying lattice distortions in solids, and play a critical role in transport, optical, and catalytic properties of semiconductors and insulators. The standard approach for calculating polarons from first principles relies on density functional theory and periodic supercells. An alternative approach consists of recasting the calculation of polaron wavefunction, lattice distortion, and energy as a coupled nonlinear eigenvalue problem, using the band structure, phonon dispersions, and the electron-phonon matrix elements as obtained from density functional perturbation theory. Here, we revisit the formal connection between these two approaches, with an emphasis on the handling of self-interaction correction, and we establish a compact formal link between them. We perform a quantitative comparison of these methods for the case of small polarons in the prototypical insulators TiO2, MgO, and LiF. We find that the polaron wavefunctions and lattice distortions obtained from these methods are nearly indistinguishable in all cases, and the formation energies are in good (TiO2) to fair (MgO) agreement. We show that the residual deviations can be ascribed to the neglect of higher-order electron-phonon couplings in the density functional perturbation theory approach.</description>

      <title>2D-to-3D transformation of ring origami via snap-folding instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ring origami, consisting of closed-loop rods, is a class of shape-morphing structures that undergo shape transformation through folding enabled by snap-buckling instabilities, referred to as snap-folding instabilities. Previous studies have shown that 2D ring origami composed of rod segments with in-plane natural curvature (i.e., the stress-free curved state lies in the plane of the planar ring) can achieve diverse and intriguing 2D-to-2D shape transformations. Here, we propose a 2D-to-3D shape transformation strategy for ring origami by introducing out-of-plane natural curvature (i.e., the stress-free curved state lies in a plane perpendicular to the planar ring) into the rod segments. Due to natural curvature-induced out-of-plane bending moments, a 2D elastic ring spontaneously snaps out-of-plane and reaches equilibrium in a 3D configuration. These snapping-induced out-of-plane shape transitions not only enable self-guided, spontaneous shape morphing, but also allow the construction of complex structures from simple geometries, making them promising for the design of functional deployable and foldable structures. By combining a multi-segment Kirchhoff rod model with finite element simulations and experiments, we systematically investigate the 3D equilibrium states and transition behavior of these systems. Using square and hexagonal rings as representative examples, we demonstrate that by rationally designing the out-of-plane natural curvature of rod segments, 2D rings can exhibit a range of functional behaviors, including spontaneous 2D-to-3D shape transformation (e.g., planar square to sphere) via snap-folding, multistability with various 3D configurations, and monostability with a compact zero-energy 3D configuration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07626v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wavefront shaping enables precise control of light propagation through multimode fibers (MMFs), facilitating diffraction-limited focusing for applications such as high-resolution single-fiber imaging and high-power fiber amplifiers. While the theoretical intensity enhancement at the focal point is dictated by the number of input degrees of freedom, practical constraints-such as phase-only modulation and experimental noise-impose significant limitations. Despite its importance, the upper bounds of enhancement under these constraints remain largely unexplored. In this work, we establish a theoretical framework to predict the fundamental limits of intensity enhancement with phase-only modulation in the presence of noise-induced phase errors, and we experimentally demonstrate wavefront shaping that approaches these limits. Our experimental results confirm an enhancement factor of 5000 in a large-core MMF, approaching the theoretical upper bound, enabled by noise-tolerant wavefront shaping. These findings provide key insights into the limits of phase-only control in MMFs, with profound implications for single-fiber imaging, optical communication, high-power broad-area fiber amplification, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliable Characterization of Materials' Plasmonic Properties using Fabry-Perot Resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of plasmonic materials' dispersion and efficiency remains a key challenge for next-generation nanophotonic devices. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that the plasmon dispersion relation at a metal-dielectric interface can be reconstructed from the resonance peaks of transmission spectra obtained in a series of extraordinary optical transmission (EOT) experiments on plasmonic gratings. A proof-of-concept of direct E-k dispersion mapping is numerically implemented by systematically varying the grating's unit cell size, with each grating serving as a discrete probe in momentum space. The resulting plasmon dispersion curves are derived from the frequencies of Fabry-Perot (FP) resonances localized within subwavelength apertures, scaled by a correction factor that accounts for the interplay between the resonant mechanisms driving enhanced transmission. This factor highlights the aperture's role in mode confinement and resonance shifting, which we examine in both idealized perfect electric conductor (PEC) and realistic dispersive metal regimes. To elucidate eigenstates of the plasmonic system and quantify the modal hybridization within its apertures, we perform a non-Hermitian modal decomposition using the finite element method (FEM) and corroborate it with finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. The proposed framework enables an angle-insensitive, real-time, and in-situ characterization platform suitable for wafer-scale evaluation of established and emerging plasmonic materials.</description>

      <title>Phased-Array Laser Power Beaming from Cislunar Space to the Lunar Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a time-dependent, end-to-end framework for laser power beaming from cislunar orbits to the lunar surface. The model links on-orbit generation (solar arrays and wall-plug to optical), terrain-masked visibility and range, beam propagation with realistic divergence and jitter, and surface conversion with thermal and dust limits, returning delivered daily energy. Baseline loads for early polar activities (habitat survival, mobility, comm/nav, pilot ISRU) set target Wh\,day$^{-1}$ and are used consistently in scaling laws and design maps. A near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) to a Shackleton-rim site provides a worked example: for a 2\,m-class phased array at 1064\,nm the reference geometry yields $\sim$0.6--0.8\,kWh\,day$^{-1}$ to a 1\,m$^2$ receiver (about 28\,W averaged over the day). We place this result in context by comparing on the same daily-energy metric to surface photovoltaics (PV) with storage and to compact fission, and by showing how delivered energy scales nearly linearly with transmit power and as $D_{\rm eff}^{2}$ via encircled-energy capture, with a multiplicative gain from visibility (constellations). The same framework indicates practical regimes already within reach: e.g., a 10\,m effective-aperture optical phased array at $P_{\rm tx}=100$\,kW delivers $\sim$30--50\,kWh\,day$^{-1}$ at polar sites with typical single-orbiter visibility, as quantified by the delivered-energy and sizing maps. Thus, laser beaming is mass-competitive where darkness or permanent shadow forces deep storage for PV, or where distributed and duty-cycled users can amortize a shared transmitter; compact fission retains advantage for continuous multi-kW baseload at fixed sites.</description>

Abstract: Crashworthiness assessment is a critical aspect of automotive design, traditionally relying on high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulations that are computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents an exploratory comparative study on developing machine learning-based surrogate models for efficient prediction of structural deformation in crash scenarios using the NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework. Given the limited prior work applying machine learning to structural crash dynamics, the primary contribution lies in demonstrating the feasibility and engineering utility of the various modeling approaches explored in this work. We investigate two state-of-the-art neural network architectures for modeling crash dynamics: MeshGraphNet, and Transolver. Additionally, we examine three strategies for modeling transient dynamics: time-conditional, the standard Autoregressive approach, and a stability-enhanced Autoregressive scheme incorporating rollout-based training. The models are evaluated on a comprehensive Body-in-White (BIW) crash dataset comprising 150 detailed FE simulations using LS-DYNA. The dataset represents a structurally rich vehicle assembly with over 200 components, including 38 key components featuring variable thickness distributions to capture realistic manufacturing variability. Each model utilizes the undeformed mesh geometry and component characteristics as inputs to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Evaluation results show that the models capture the overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity, demonstrating the feasibility of applying machine learning to structural crash dynamics. Although not yet matching full FE accuracy, the models achieve orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.</description>

      <title>Electric Field-Induced Kerr Rotation on Metallic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a combination of density functional theory calculations and optical modeling to establish that the electric field-induced Kerr rotation in metallic thin films has contributions from both non-equilibrium orbital moment accumulation (arising from the orbital Edelstein effect) and a heretofore overlooked surface Pockels effect. The Kerr rotation associated with orbital accumulation has been studied in previous works and is largely due to the dc electric field-induced change of the electron distribution function. In contrast, the surface Pockels effect is largely due to the dc field-induced change to the wave functions. Both of these contributions arise from the dual mirror symmetry breaking from the surface and from the dc applied field. Our calculations show that the resulting Kerr rotation is due to the dc electric field modification of the optical conductivity within a couple of nanometers from the surface, consistent with the dependence on the local mirror symmetry breaking at the surface. For thin films of Pt, our calculations show that the relative contributions of the orbital Edelstein and surface Pockels effects are comparable, and that they have different effects on Kerr rotation of $s$ and $p$ polarized light, $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$. The orbital Edelstein effect yields similar values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$, while the surface Pockels effect leads to opposing values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$.</description>
