      <title>Scaling and Distilling Transformer Models for sEMG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) signals offer a promising avenue for developing innovative human-computer interfaces by providing insights into muscular activity. However, the limited volume of training data and computational constraints during deployment have restricted the investigation of scaling up the model size for solving sEMG tasks. In this paper, we demonstrate that vanilla transformer models can be effectively scaled up on sEMG data and yield improved cross-user performance up to 110M parameters, surpassing the model size regime investigated in other sEMG research (usually &lt;10M parameters). We show that &gt;100M-parameter models can be effectively distilled into models 50x smaller with minimal loss of performance (&lt;1.5% absolute). This results in efficient and expressive models suitable for complex real-time sEMG tasks in real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Tiny Noise-Robust Voice Activity Detector for Voice Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voice Activity Detection (VAD) in the presence of background noise remains a challenging problem in speech processing. Accurate VAD is essential in automatic speech recognition, voice-to-text, conversational agents, etc, where noise can severely degrade the performance. A modern application includes the voice assistant, specially mounted on Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) devices such as cell phones, smart glasses, earbuds, etc, where the voice signal includes background noise. Therefore, VAD modules must remain light-weight due to their practical on-device limitation. The existing models often struggle with low signal-to-noise ratios across diverse acoustic environments. A simple VAD often detects human voice in a clean environment, but struggles to detect the human voice in noisy conditions. We propose a noise-robust VAD that comprises a light-weight VAD, with data pre-processing and post-processing added modules to handle the background noise. This approach significantly enhances the VAD accuracy in noisy environments and requires neither a larger model, nor fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a notable improvement compared to baselines, particularly in environments with high background noise interference. This modified VAD additionally improving clean speech detection.</description>

      <title>The Risks and Detection of Overestimated Privacy Protection in Voice Anonymisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voice anonymisation aims to conceal the voice identity of speakers in speech recordings. Privacy protection is usually estimated from the difficulty of using a speaker verification system to re-identify the speaker post-anonymisation. Performance assessments are therefore dependent on the verification model as well as the anonymisation system. There is hence potential for privacy protection to be overestimated when the verification system is poorly trained, perhaps with mismatched data. In this paper, we demonstrate the insidious risk of overestimating anonymisation performance and show examples of exaggerated performance reported in the literature. For the worst case we identified, performance is overestimated by 74% relative. We then introduce a means to detect when performance assessment might be untrustworthy and show that it can identify all overestimation scenarios presented in the paper. Our solution is openly available as a fork of the 2024 VoicePrivacy Challenge evaluation toolkit.</description>

      <title>Modeling Multi-Level Hearing Loss for Speech Intelligibility Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diverse perceptual consequences of hearing loss severely impede speech communication, but standard clinical audiometry, which is focused on threshold-based frequency sensitivity, does not adequately capture deficits in frequency and temporal resolution. To address this limitation, we propose a speech intelligibility prediction method that explicitly simulates auditory degradations according to hearing loss severity by broadening cochlear filters and applying low-pass modulation filtering to temporal envelopes. Speech signals are subsequently analyzed using the spectro-temporal modulation (STM) representations, which reflect how auditory resolution loss alters the underlying modulation structure. In addition, normalized cross-correlation (NCC) matrices quantify the similarity between the STM representations of clean speech and speech in noise. These auditory-informed features are utilized to train a Vision Transformer-based regression model that integrates the STM maps and NCC embeddings to estimate speech intelligibility scores. Evaluations on the Clarity Prediction Challenge corpus show that the proposed method outperforms the Hearing-Aid Speech Perception Index v2 (HASPI v2) in both mild and moderate-to-severe hearing loss groups, with a relative root mean squared error reduction of 16.5% for the mild group and a 6.1% reduction for the moderate-to-severe group. These results highlight the importance of explicitly modeling listener-specific frequency and temporal resolution degradations to improve speech intelligibility prediction and provide interpretability in auditory distortions.</description>

      <title>A k-space approach to modeling multi-channel parametric array loudspeaker systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-channel parametric array loudspeaker (MCPAL) systems offer enhanced flexibility and promise for generating highly directional audio beams in real-world applications. However, efficient and accurate prediction of their generated sound fields remains a major challenge due to the complex nonlinear behavior and multi-channel signal processing involved. To overcome this obstacle, we propose a k-space approach for modeling arbitrary MCPAL systems arranged on a baffled planar surface. In our method, the linear ultrasound field is first solved using the angular spectrum approach, and the quasilinear audio sound field is subsequently computed efficiently in k-space. By leveraging three-dimensional fast Fourier transforms, our approach not only achieves high computational and memory efficiency but also maintains accuracy without relying on the paraxial approximation. For typical configurations studied, the proposed method demonstrates a speed-up of more than four orders of magnitude compared to the direct integration method. Our proposed approach paved the way for simulating and designing advanced MCPAL systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Audio Unlearning: Towards Privacy-Preserving Voice Biometrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of voice-enabled authentication and audio biometric systems have significantly increased privacy vulnerabilities associated with sensitive speech data. Compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR's right to be forgotten and India's DPDP Act necessitates targeted and efficient erasure of individual-specific voice signatures from already-trained biometric models. Existing unlearning methods designed for visual data inadequately handle the sequential, temporal, and high-dimensional nature of audio signals, leading to ineffective or incomplete speaker and accent erasure. To address this, we introduce QPAudioEraser, a quantum-inspired audio unlearning framework. Our our-phase approach involves: (1) weight initialization using destructive interference to nullify target features, (2) superposition-based label transformations that obscure class identity, (3) an uncertainty-maximizing quantum loss function, and (4) entanglement-inspired mixing of correlated weights to retain model knowledge. Comprehensive evaluations with ResNet18, ViT, and CNN architectures across AudioMNIST, Speech Commands, LibriSpeech, and Speech Accent Archive datasets validate QPAudioEraser's superior performance. The framework achieves complete erasure of target data (0% Forget Accuracy) while incurring minimal impact on model utility, with a performance degradation on retained data as low as 0.05%. QPAudioEraser consistently surpasses conventional baselines across single-class, multi-class, sequential, and accent-level erasure scenarios, establishing the proposed approach as a robust privacy-preserving solution.</description>

      <title>A Two-Step Learning Framework for Enhancing Sound Event Localization and Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) is crucial in spatial audio processing, enabling systems to detect sound events and estimate their 3D directions. Existing SELD methods use single- or dual-branch architectures: single-branch models share SED and DoA representations, causing optimization conflicts, while dual-branch models separate tasks but limit information exchange. To address this, we propose a two-step learning framework. First, we introduce a tracwise reordering format to maintain temporal consistency, preventing event reassignments across tracks. Next, we train SED and DoA networks to prevent interference and ensure task-specific feature learning. Finally, we effectively fuse DoA and SED features to enhance SELD performance with better spatial and event representation. Experiments on the 2023 DCASE challenge Task 3 dataset validate our framework, showing its ability to overcome single- and dual-branch limitations and improve event classification and localization.</description>

      <title>Prediction of acoustic field in 1-D uniform duct with varying mean flow and temperature using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks constrained by the physical laws emerged as an alternate numerical tool. In this paper, the governing equation that represents the propagation of sound inside a one-dimensional duct carrying a heterogeneous medium is derived. The problem is converted into an unconstrained optimization problem and solved using neural networks. Both the acoustic state variables: acoustic pressure and particle velocity are predicted and validated with the traditional Runge-Kutta solver. The effect of the temperature gradient on the acoustic field is studied. Utilization of machine learning techniques such as transfer learning and automatic differentiation for acoustic applications is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Duration Model for Text Speech Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech-to-text alignment is a critical component of neural text to-speech (TTS) models. Autoregressive TTS models typically use an attention mechanism to learn these alignments on-line. However, these alignments tend to be brittle and often fail to generalize to long utterances and out-of-domain text, leading to missing or repeating words. Most non-autoregressive end to-end TTS models rely on durations extracted from external sources, using additional duration models for alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel duration prediction framework that can give compromising phoneme-level duration distribution with given text. In our experiments, the proposed duration model has more precise prediction and condition adaptation ability compared to previous baseline models. Numerically, it has roughly a 11.3 percents immprovement on alignment accuracy, and makes the performance of zero-shot TTS models more robust to the mismatch between prompt audio and input audio.</description>

      <title>Next Tokens Denoising for Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While diffusion and autoregressive (AR) models have significantly advanced generative modeling, they each present distinct limitations. AR models, which rely on causal attention, cannot exploit future context and suffer from slow generation speeds. Conversely, diffusion models struggle with key-value (KV) caching. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dragon-FM, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) design that unifies AR and flow-matching. This model processes 48 kHz audio codec tokens in chunks at a compact 12.5 tokens per second rate. This design enables AR modeling across chunks, ensuring global coherence, while parallel flow-matching within chunks facilitates fast iterative denoising. Consequently, the proposed model can utilize KV-cache across chunks and incorporate future context within each chunk. Furthermore, it bridges continuous and discrete feature modeling, demonstrating that continuous AR flow-matching can predict discrete tokens with finite scalar quantizers. This efficient codec and fast chunk-autoregressive architecture also makes the proposed model particularly effective for generating extended content. Experiment for demos of our work} on podcast datasets demonstrate its capability to efficiently generate high-quality zero-shot podcasts.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the role of semantic and acoustic cues in normal and dichotic listening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech comprehension is an involuntary task for the healthy human brain, yet the understanding of the mechanisms underlying this brain functionality remains obscure. In this paper, we aim to quantify the role of acoustic and semantic information streams in complex listening conditions. We propose a paradigm to understand the encoding of the speech cues in electroencephalogram (EEG) data, by designing a match-mismatch (MM) classification task. The MM task involves identifying whether the stimulus (speech) and response (EEG) correspond to each other. We build a multimodal deep-learning based sequence model STEM, which is input with acoustic stimulus (speech envelope), semantic stimulus (textual representations of speech), and the neural response (EEG data).
  We perform extensive experiments on two separate conditions, i) natural passive listening and, ii) a dichotic listening requiring auditory attention. Using the MM task as the analysis framework, we observe that - a) speech perception is fragmented based on word boundaries, b) acoustic and semantic cues offer similar levels of MM task performance in natural listening conditions, and c) semantic cues offer significantly improved MM classification over acoustic cues in dichotic listening task. The comparison of the STEM with previously proposed MM models shows significant performance improvements for the proposed approach. The analysis and understanding from this study allows the quantification of the roles played by acoustic and semantic cues in diverse listening tasks and in providing further evidences of right-ear advantage in dichotic listening.</description>

      <title>CleanMel: Mel-Spectrogram Enhancement for Improving Both Speech Quality and ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose CleanMel, a single-channel Mel-spectrogram denoising and dereverberation network for improving both speech quality and automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance. The proposed network takes as input the noisy and reverberant microphone recording and predicts the corresponding clean Mel-spectrogram. The enhanced Mel-spectrogram can be either transformed to the speech waveform with a neural vocoder or directly used for ASR. The proposed network is composed of interleaved cross-band and narrow-band processing in the Mel-frequency domain, for learning the full-band spectral pattern and the narrow-band properties of signals, respectively. Compared to linear-frequency domain or time-domain speech enhancement, the key advantage of Mel-spectrogram enhancement is that Mel-frequency presents speech in a more compact way and thus is easier to learn, which will benefit both speech quality and ASR. Experimental results on five English and one Chinese datasets demonstrate a significant improvement in both speech quality and ASR performance achieved by the proposed model.Code and audio examples of our model are available online.</description>

      <title>MAVFlow: Preserving Paralinguistic Elements with Conditional Flow Matching for Zero-Shot AV2AV Multilingual Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-speech (TTS) models, audio-visual-to-audio-visual (AV2AV) translation still faces a critical challenge: maintaining speaker consistency between the original and translated vocal and facial features. To address this issue, we propose a conditional flow matching (CFM) zero-shot audio-visual renderer that utilizes strong dual guidance from both audio and visual modalities. By leveraging multimodal guidance with CFM, our model robustly preserves speaker-specific characteristics and enhances zero-shot AV2AV translation abilities. For the audio modality, we enhance the CFM process by integrating robust speaker embeddings with x-vectors, which serve to bolster speaker consistency. Additionally, we convey emotional nuances to the face rendering module. The guidance provided by both audio and visual cues remains independent of semantic or linguistic content, allowing our renderer to effectively handle zero-shot translation tasks for monolingual speakers in different languages. We empirically demonstrate that the inclusion of high-quality mel-spectrograms conditioned on facial information not only enhances the quality of the synthesized speech but also positively influences facial generation, leading to overall performance improvements in LSE and FID score.

      <title>Controllable joint noise reduction and hearing loss compensation using a differentiable auditory model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning-based hearing loss compensation (HLC) seeks to enhance speech intelligibility and quality for hearing impaired listeners using neural networks. One major challenge of HLC is the lack of a ground-truth target. Recent works have used neural networks to emulate non-differentiable auditory peripheral models in closed-loop frameworks, but this approach lacks flexibility. Alternatively, differentiable auditory models allow direct optimization, yet previous studies focused on individual listener profiles, or joint noise reduction (NR) and HLC without balancing each task. This work formulates NR and HLC as a multi-task learning problem, training a system to simultaneously predict denoised and compensated signals from noisy speech and audiograms using a differentiable auditory model. Results show the system achieves similar objective metric performance to systems trained for each task separately, while being able to adjust the balance between NR and HLC during inference.</description>

Abstract: Acoustic context effects, where surrounding changes in pitch, rate or timbre influence the perception of a sound, are well documented in speech perception, but how they interact with language background remains unclear. Using a reverse-correlation approach, we systematically varied the pitch and speech rate in phrases around different pairs of vowels for second language (L2) speakers of English (/i/-/I/) and French (/u/-/y/), thus reconstructing, in a data-driven manner, the prosodic profiles that bias their perception. Testing English and French speakers (n=25), we showed that vowel perception is in fact influenced by conflicting effects from the surrounding pitch and speech rate: a congruent proximal effect 0.2s pre-target and a distal contrastive effect up to 1s before; and found that L1 and L2 speakers exhibited strikingly similar prosodic profiles in perception. We provide a novel method to investigate acoustic context effects across stimuli, timescales, and acoustic domain.</description>

      <title>Addressing Representation Collapse in Vector Quantized Models with One Linear Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is essential for discretizing continuous representations in unsupervised learning but suffers from representation collapse, causing low codebook utilization and limiting scalability. Existing solutions often rely on complex optimizations or reduce latent dimensionality, which compromises model capacity and fails to fully solve the problem. We identify the root cause as disjoint codebook optimization, where only a few code vectors are updated via gradient descent. To fix this, we propose \textbf{Sim}ple\textbf{VQ}, which reparameterizes code vectors through a learnable linear transformation layer over a latent basis, optimizing the \textit{entire linear space} rather than nearest \textit{individual code vectors}. Although the multiplication of two linear matrices is equivalent to applying a single linear layer, this simple approach effectively prevents collapse. Extensive experiments on image and audio tasks demonstrate that SimVQ improves codebook usage, is easy to implement, and generalizes well across modalities and architectures.</description>

      <title>Text-Driven Voice Conversion via Latent State-Space Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-driven voice conversion allows customization of speaker characteristics and prosodic elements using textual descriptions. However, most existing methods rely heavily on direct text-to-speech training, limiting their flexibility in controlling nuanced style elements or timbral features. In this paper, we propose a novel \textbf{Latent State-Space} approach for text-driven voice conversion (\textbf{LSS-VC}). Our method treats each utterance as an evolving dynamical system in a continuous latent space. Drawing inspiration from mamba, which introduced a state-space model for efficient text-driven \emph{image} style transfer, we adapt a loosely related methodology for \emph{voice} style transformation. Specifically, we learn a voice latent manifold where style and content can be manipulated independently by textual style prompts. We propose an adaptive cross-modal fusion mechanism to inject style information into the voice latent representation, enabling interpretable and fine-grained control over speaker identity, speaking rate, and emphasis. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms recent baselines in both subjective and objective quality metrics, while offering smoother transitions between styles, reduced artifacts, and more precise text-based style control.</description>

      <title>BERSting at the Screams: A Benchmark for Distanced, Emotional and Shouted Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some speech recognition tasks, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), are approaching or have reached human performance in many reported metrics. Yet, they continue to struggle in complex, real-world, situations, such as with distanced speech. Previous challenges have released datasets to address the issue of distanced ASR, however, the focus remains primarily on distance, specifically relying on multi-microphone array systems. Here we present the B(asic) E(motion) R(andom phrase) S(hou)t(s) (BERSt) dataset. The dataset contains almost 4 hours of English speech from 98 actors with varying regional and non-native accents. The data was collected on smartphones in the actors homes and therefore includes at least 98 different acoustic environments. The data also includes 7 different emotion prompts and both shouted and spoken utterances. The smartphones were places in 19 different positions, including obstructions and being in a different room than the actor. This data is publicly available for use and can be used to evaluate a variety of speech recognition tasks, including: ASR, shout detection, and speech emotion recognition (SER). We provide initial benchmarks for ASR and SER tasks, and find that ASR degrades both with an increase in distance and shout level and shows varied performance depending on the intended emotion. Our results show that the BERSt dataset is challenging for both ASR and SER tasks and continued work is needed to improve the robustness of such systems for more accurate real-world use.</description>

      <title>I Know You're Listening: Adaptive Voice for HRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the use of social robots for language teaching has been explored, there remains limited work on a task-specific synthesized voices for language teaching robots. Given that language is a verbal task, this gap may have severe consequences for the effectiveness of robots for language teaching tasks. We address this lack of L2 teaching robot voices through three contributions: 1. We address the need for a lightweight and expressive robot voice. Using a fine-tuned version of Matcha-TTS, we use emoji prompting to create an expressive voice that shows a range of expressivity over time. The voice can run in real time with limited compute resources. Through case studies, we found this voice more expressive, socially appropriate, and suitable for long periods of expressive speech, such as storytelling. 2. We explore how to adapt a robot's voice to physical and social ambient environments to deploy our voices in various locations. We found that increasing pitch and pitch rate in noisy and high-energy environments makes the robot's voice appear more appropriate and makes it seem more aware of its current environment. 3. We create an English TTS system with improved clarity for L2 listeners using known linguistic properties of vowels that are difficult for these listeners. We used a data-driven, perception-based approach to understand how L2 speakers use duration cues to interpret challenging words with minimal tense (long) and lax (short) vowels in English. We found that the duration of vowels strongly influences the perception for L2 listeners and created an "L2 clarity mode" for Matcha-TTS that applies a lengthening to tense vowels while leaving lax vowels unchanged. Our clarity mode was found to be more respectful, intelligible, and encouraging than base Matcha-TTS while reducing transcription errors in these challenging tense/lax minimal pairs.</description>

      <title>BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1: A Bilingual English-to-Yoruba Direct Speech-to-Speech Translation Corpus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09342v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a major shortage of Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST) datasets for high resource-to-low resource language pairs such as English-to-Yoruba. Thus, in this study, we curated the Bilingual English-to-Yoruba Speech-to-Speech Translation Corpus Version 1 (BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1). The corpus is based on a hybrid architecture we developed for large-scale direct S2ST corpus creation at reduced cost. To achieve this, we leveraged non speech-to-speech Standard Yoruba (SY) real-time audios and transcripts in the YORULECT Corpus as well as the corresponding Standard English (SE) transcripts. YORULECT Corpus is small scale(1,504) samples, and it does not have paired English audios. Therefore, we generated the SE audios using pre-trained AI models (i.e. Facebook MMS). We also developed an audio augmentation algorithm named AcoustAug based on three latent acoustic features to generate augmented audios from the raw audios of the two languages. BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1 has 12,032 audio samples per language, which gives a total of 24,064 sample size. The total audio duration for the two languages is 41.20 hours. This size is quite significant. Beyond building S2ST models, BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1 can be used to build pretrained models or improve existing ones. The created corpus and Coqui framework were used to build a pretrained Yoruba TTS model (named YoruTTS-1.5) as a proof of concept. The YoruTTS-1.5 gave a F0 RMSE value of 63.54 after 1,000 epochs, which indicates moderate fundamental pitch similarity with the reference real-time audio. Ultimately, the corpus architecture in this study can be leveraged by researchers and developers to curate datasets for multilingual high-resource-to-low-resource African languages. This will bridge the huge digital divides in translations among high and low-resource language pairs. BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1 and YoruTTS-1.5 are publicly available at (https://bit.ly/40bGMwi).</description>
