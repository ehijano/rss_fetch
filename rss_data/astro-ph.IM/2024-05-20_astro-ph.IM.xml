      <title>Using physics-based simulation towards eliminating empiricism in extraterrestrial terramechanics applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of international interest in extraterrestrial exploration targeting the Moon, Mars, the moons of Mars, and various asteroids. This contribution discusses how current state-of-the-art Earth-based testing for designing rovers and landers for these missions currently leads to overly optimistic conclusions about the behavior of these devices upon deployment on the targeted celestial bodies. The key misconception is that gravitational offset is necessary during the \textit{terramechanics} testing of rover and lander prototypes on Earth. The body of evidence supporting our argument is tied to a small number of studies conducted during parabolic flights and insights derived from newly revised scaling laws. We argue that what has prevented the community from fully diagnosing the problem at hand is the absence of effective physics-based models capable of simulating terramechanics under low gravity conditions. We developed such a physics-based simulator and utilized it to gauge the mobility of early prototypes of the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER), which is slated to depart for the Moon in November 2024. This contribution discusses the results generated by this simulator, how they correlate with physical test results from the NASA-Glenn SLOPE lab, and the fallacy of the gravitational offset in rover and lander testing. The simulator developed is open sourced and made publicly available for unfettered use; it can support principled studies that extend beyond trafficability analysis to provide insights into in-situ resource utilization activities, e.g., digging, bulldozing, and berming in low gravity.</description>

      <title>H.E.S.S.: The High Energy Stereoscopic System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The High Energy Stereoscopic System H.E.S.S. is an array of Cherenkov Telescopes located in the Khomas Highlands in Namibia. H.E.S.S. started operations in 2003 and has been operated very successfully since then. With its location in the Southern hemisphere, the system provides a privileged view of the Milky Way and the Galactic center region. With H.E.S.S., a large variety of new TeV emitters has been discovered, both in our Galaxy and in extragalactic space. We provide a description of the individual telescopes and of the system as a whole, and review the scientific highlights that have been achieved with the instrument.</description>

      <title>Detection and Prediction of Future Massive Black Hole Mergers with Machine Learning and Truncated Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel machine learning framework tailored to detect massive black hole binaries observed by spaceborne gravitational wave detectors like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and predict their future merger times. The detection is performed via convolutional neural networks that analyze time-evolving Time-Delay Interferometry (TDI) spectrograms and utilize variations in signal power to trigger alerts. The prediction of future merger times is accomplished with reinforcement learning. Here, the proposed algorithm dynamically refines time-to-merger predictions by assimilating new data as it becomes available. Deep Q-learning serves as the core technique of the approach, utilizing a neural network to estimate Q-values throughout the observational state space. To enhance robust learning in a noisy environment, we integrate an actor-critic mechanism that segregates action proposals from their evaluation, thus harnessing the advantages of policy-based and value-based learning paradigms. We leverage merger estimation obtained via template matching with truncated waveforms to generate rewards for the reinforcement learning agent. These estimations come with uncertainties, which magnify as the merger event stretches further into the future. The reinforcement learning setup is shown to adapt to these uncertainties by employing a policy fine-tuning approach, ensuring the reliability of predictions despite the varying degrees of template-matching precision. The algorithm denotes a first step toward a low-latency model that provides early warnings for impending transient phenomena. By delivering timely and accurate forecasts of merger events, the framework supports the coordination of gravitational wave observations with accompanied electromagnetic counterparts, thus enhancing the prospects of multi-messenger astronomy. We use the LISA Spritz data challenge for validation.</description>

      <title>Toward an auditory Virtual Observatory (preprint)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of the universe is experiencing a huge development thanks to the success and possibilities of today's major space telescope missions which can generate measurements and images with a resolution 100 times higher than their precedents. This big ecosystem of observations, aimed at expanding the limits of known science, can be analyzed using personal computers thanks to the implementation of interoperable Virtual Observatory (VO) technologies and massive portals of stellar catalogs and databases. In this context of global analysis of astronomical big data, sonification has the potential of adding a complementary dimension to visualization, enhancing the accessibility of the archives, and offering an alternative strategy to be used when overlapping issues and masking effects are found in purely graphical representations. This article presents a collection of sonification and musification prototypes that explore the case studies of the MILES and STELIB stellar libraries from the Spanish Virtual Observatory (SVO), and the Kepler Objects of Interest light curve database from the Space Telescope Science Institute archive (STScI). The work makes use of automation, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms to offer a palette of resources that could be used in future developments oriented towards an auditory virtual observatory proposal. It includes a user study that provides qualitative and quantitative feedback from specialized and non-specialized users in the fields of Music and Astronomy.</description>

      <title>Solar image quality assessment: a proof of concept using Variance of Laplacian method and its application to optical atmospheric condition monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present a proof of concept for the application of the Variance of Laplacian (VL) method in quantifying the sharpness of optical solar images. We conducted a comprehensive study using over 65,000 individual solar images acquired on more than 160 days. Each image underwent processing using a VL image processing algorithm, which assigns a 'score' based on the sharpness of the solar disk's edges. We studied the scores obtained from images acquired at different conditions. Our findings demonstrate that the sharpness of the images exhibits daily trends that are closely linked to the altitude of the Sun at the observation site. We observed a significant degradation in image quality only below a certain altitude threshold. Furthermore, we compared airmass formulae from the literature with our sharpness observations and concluded that the degradation could be modeled as an Image Sharpness Function (ISF), which exhibits similarities to airmass variations. In addition to assessing image quality, our method has the potential to evaluate the optical atmospheric conditions during daytime observations. Moreover, this technique can be easily and cost-effectively applied to archival or real-time images of other celestial bodies, such as the Moon, bright planets and defocused stars. Given that ISF is unique to each location and sensitive to sky conditions, the development of an ISF is not only beneficial for routine observation preparation but also essential for long-term site monitoring.</description>

      <title>The Brightness of Starlink Mini Satellites During Orbit-Raising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of Starlink V2 Mini satellites during orbit-raising suggest that SpaceX applies brightness mitigation when they reach a height of 357 km. The mean apparent magnitudes for objects below that height threshold is 2.68 while the mean for those above is 6.46. When magnitudes are adjusted to a uniform distance of 1000 km the means are 4.58 and 7.52, respectively. The difference of 2.94 between distance-adjusted magnitudes above and below threshold implies that mitigation is 93% effective in reducing the brightness of orbit-raising spacecraft. Orbit-raising Mini spacecraft have a smaller impact on astronomical observations than higher altitude on-station spacecraft because they are relatively few in number. They also spend less time traversing the sky and spend longer in the Earth's shadow. These low-altitude objects will be more out-of-focus in large telescopes such as the LSST which reduces their impact, too. However, they attract considerable public attention and airline pilots have reported them as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena.</description>

      <title>Naming the SMD Bridge Program--A White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) has initiated a program to enhance the participation of historically underrepresented institutions and communities in NASA's mission. Currently known as the NASA SMD Bridge Program, its goal is to establish enduring partnerships among these institutions, research-intensive universities, and NASA centers. There are concerns about using "Bridge" in the program's name, with stakeholders suggesting that it might stigmatize students and mislead applicants about its focus. In this white paper, we address these concerns and conclude that a name change that better reflects the mission of this SMD effort is necessary to address these concerns.</description>

      <title>Forced Measurement of Astronomical Sources at Low Signal to Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a modified moment matching algorithm to avoid catastrophic failures for sources with a low signal to noise ratio (SNR). The proposed modifications include a method to eliminate non-physical negative pixel values and a forced single iteration with an initial guess derived from co-add measurements when iterative methods are unstable. We correct for all biases in measurements introduced by the method. We find that the proposed modifications allow the algorithm to avoid catastrophic failures in nearly 100\% of the cases, especially at low signal to noise ratio. Additionally, with a reasonable guess from co-add measurements, the algorithm measures the flux, centroid, size, shape and ellipticity with bias statistically consistent with zero. We show the proposed method allows us to measure sources seven times fainter than traditional methods when applied to images obtained from WIYN-ODI. We also present a scheme to find uncertainties in measurements when using the new method to measure astronomical sources.</description>

      <title>The daily modulations and broadband strategy in axion searches. An application with CAST-CAPP detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been previously advocated that the presence of the daily and annual modulations of the axion flux on the Earth's surface may dramatically change the strategy of the axion searches. The arguments were based on the so-called Axion Quark Nugget (AQN) dark matter model which was originally put forward to explain the similarity of the dark and visible cosmological matter densities $\Omega_{\rm dark}\sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$. In this framework, the population of galactic axions with mass $ 10^{-6} {\rm eV}\lesssim m_a\lesssim 10^{-3}{\rm eV}$ and velocity $\langle v_a\rangle\sim 10^{-3} c$ will be accompanied by axions with typical velocities $\langle v_a\rangle\sim 0.6 c$ emitted by AQNs. Furthermore, in this framework, it has also been argued that the AQN-induced axion daily modulation (in contrast with the conventional WIMP paradigm) could be as large as $(10-20)\%$, which represents the main motivation for the present investigation. We argue that the daily modulations along with the broadband detection strategy can be very useful tools for the discovery of such relativistic axions. The data from the CAST-CAPP detector have been used following such arguments. Unfortunately, due to the dependence of the amplifier chain on temperature-dependent gain drifts and other factors, we could not conclusively show the presence or absence of a dark sector-originated daily modulation. However, this proof of principle analysis procedure can serve as a reference for future studies.</description>

      <title>Spectral Difference method with a posteriori limiting: II- Application to low Mach number flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar convection poses two main gargantuan challenges for astrophysical fluid solvers: low-Mach number flows and minuscule perturbations over steeply stratified hydrostatic equilibria. Most methods exhibit excessive numerical diffusion and are unable to capture the correct solution due to large truncation errors. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the Spectral Difference (SD) method under these extreme conditions using an arbitrarily high-order shock capturing scheme with a posteriori limiting. We include both a modification to the HLLC Riemann solver adapted to low Mach number flows (L-HLLC) and a well-balanced scheme to properly evolve perturbations over steep equilibrium solutions. We evaluate the performance of our method using a series of test tailored specifically for stellar convection. We observe that our high-order SD method is capable of dealing with very subsonic flows without necessarily using the modified Riemann solver. We find however that the well-balanced framework is unavoidable if one wants to capture accurately small amplitude convective and acoustic modes. Analyzing the temporal and spatial evolution of the turbulent kinetic energy, we show that our fourth-order SD scheme seems to emerge as an optimal variant to solve this difficult numerical problem.</description>

      <title>Bioverse: GMT and ELT Direct Imaging and High-Resolution Spectroscopy Assessment $\unicode{x2013}$ Surveying Exo-Earth O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ and Testing the Habitable Zone Oxygen Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biosignature detection in the atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets is one of the most significant and ambitious goals for astronomy, astrobiology, and humanity. Molecular oxygen is among the strongest indicators of life on Earth, but it will be extremely difficult to detect via transmission spectroscopy. We used the Bioverse statistical framework to assess the ability to probe Earth-like O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ levels on hypothetical nearby habitable zone exoplanets (EECs) using direct imaging and high-resolution spectroscopy on the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) and the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). We found that O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ could be probed on up to $\sim$5 and $\sim$15 EECs orbiting bright M dwarfs within 20 pc in a 10-year survey on the GMT and ELT, respectively. Earth-like O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ levels could be probed on four known super-Earth candidates, including Proxima Centauri b, within about one week on the ELT and a few months on the GMT. We also assessed the ability of the ELT to test the habitable zone oxygen hypothesis $\unicode{x2013}$ that habitable zone Earth-sized planets are more likely to have O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ $\unicode{x2013}$ within a 10-year survey using Bioverse. Testing this hypothesis requires either $\sim$1/2 of the EECs to have O$_{\mathrm{2}}$ or $\sim$1/3 if $\eta_{\oplus}$ is large. A northern hemisphere large-aperture telescope, such as the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), would expand the target star pool by about 25%, reduce the time to probe biosignatures on individual targets, and provide an additional independent check on potential biosignature detections.</description>

      <title>TEGLIE: Transformer encoders as strong gravitational lens finders in KiDS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply a state-of-the-art transformer algorithm to 221 deg$^2$ of the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) to search for new strong gravitational lenses (SGL). We test four transformer encoders trained on simulated data from the Strong Lens Finding Challenge on KiDS survey data. The best performing model is fine-tuned on real images of SGL candidates identified in previous searches. To expand the dataset for fine-tuning, data augmentation techniques are employed, including rotation, flipping, transposition, and white noise injection. The network fine-tuned with rotated, flipped, and transposed images exhibited the best performance and is used to hunt for SGL in the overlapping region of the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) and KiDS surveys on galaxies up to $z$=0.8. Candidate SGLs are matched with those from other surveys and examined using GAMA data to identify blended spectra resulting from the signal from multiple objects in a fiber. We observe that fine-tuning the transformer encoder to the KiDS data reduces the number of false positives by 70%. Additionally, applying the fine-tuned model to a sample of $\sim$ 5,000,000 galaxies results in a list of $\sim$ 51,000 SGL candidates. Upon visual inspection, this list is narrowed down to 231 candidates. Combined with the SGL candidates identified in the model testing, our final sample includes 264 candidates, with 71 high-confidence SGLs of which 44 are new discoveries. We propose fine-tuning via real augmented images as a viable approach to mitigating false positives when transitioning from simulated lenses to real surveys. Additionally, we provide a list of 121 false positives that exhibit features similar to lensed objects, which can benefit the training of future machine learning models in this field.</description>

      <title>Absolute reference for microwave polarization experiments -- The COSMOCal project and its proof of concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB), a remnant of the Big Bang, provides unparalleled insights into the primordial universe, its energy content, and the origin of cosmic structures. The success of forthcoming terrestrial and space experiments hinges on meticulously calibrated data. Specifically, the ability to achieve an absolute calibration of the polarization angles with a precision of &lt; 0.1 deg is crucial to identify the signatures of primordial gravitational waves and cosmic birefringence within the CMB polarization. We introduce the COSMOCal project, designed to deploy a polarized source in space for calibrating microwave frequency observations. The project aims to integrate microwave polarization observations from small and large telescopes, ground-based and in space, into a unified scale, enhancing the effectiveness of each observatory and allowing robust combination of data. To demonstrate the feasibility and confirm the observational approach of our project, we developed a prototype instrument that operates in the atmospheric window centered at 260 GHz, specifically tailored for use with the NIKA2 camera at the IRAM 30 m telescope. We present the instrument components and their laboratory characterization. The results of tests performed with the fully assembled prototype using a KIDs-based instrument, similar concept of NIKA2, are also reported. This study paves the way for an observing campaign using the IRAM 30m telescope and contributes to the development of a space-based instrument.</description>

      <title>Beyond Earthly Limits: Protection against Cosmic Radiation through Biological Response Pathways</title>

Abstract: The upcoming phase of space exploration not only includes trips to Mars and beyond, but also holds great promise for human progress. However, the vulnerability of space habitats to cosmic radiation, which consists of Galactic Cosmic Rays and Solar Particle Events, raises important safety concerns for astronauts and other living things that will accompany them. Research exploring the biological effects of cosmic radiation consists of experiments conducted in space itself and in simulated space environments on Earth. Notably, NASA's Space Radiation Laboratory has taken significant steps forward in simulating cosmic radiation by using particle accelerators, marking a notable advancement in this field. Intriguingly, much of the research emphasis thus far has been on understanding how cosmic radiation impacts living organisms, instead of finding ways to help them resist the radiation. In this paper, we briefly talk about current research on the biological effects of cosmic radiation and propose possible protective measures through biological interventions. In our opinion, biological pathways responsible for coping with stressors on Earth offer potential solutions for protection against the stress caused by cosmic radiation. Additionally, we recommend assessing the effectiveness of these pathways through experiments using particle accelerators to simulate the effects of cosmic radiation.</description>

      <title>Exploring Large-Volume GAGG Scintillators for use in MeV Gamma-Ray Astrophysics</title>

Abstract: Gamma-ray astrophysics in the MeV band is an exciting field in astronomy due to its potential for multi-messenger astrophysics. It has, however, remained under-explored when compared to other wavelengths. One reason for this observational gap is the difficulties with measuring these high-energy photons and the requirement of large amounts of detection material. In this work, we investigate the usage of large-volume GAGG scintillators for use as a calorimeter in future MeV telescopes. We developed a $5\times5$ array calorimeter utilizing $1\times1\times6 \ \mathrm{cm}^3$ GAGG crystals with C-series SiPM readout. The calorimeter was tested at the High Intensity Gamma-ray Facility (HIGS) with monoenergetic beams ranging from $2-25 \ \mathrm{MeV}$. Finally, we also investigated larger $1\times1\times8 \ \mathrm{cm}^3$ crystals and characterized their response across their depth when their surface treatment is either polished or frosted.</description>

      <title>Differentiable and accelerated spherical harmonic and Wigner transforms</title>

Abstract: Many areas of science and engineering encounter data defined on spherical manifolds. Modelling and analysis of spherical data often necessitates spherical harmonic transforms, at high degrees, and increasingly requires efficient computation of gradients for machine learning or other differentiable programming tasks. We develop novel algorithmic structures for accelerated and differentiable computation of generalised Fourier transforms on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$ and rotation group $\text{SO}(3)$, i.e. spherical harmonic and Wigner transforms, respectively. We present a recursive algorithm for the calculation of Wigner $d$-functions that is both stable to high harmonic degrees and extremely parallelisable. By tightly coupling this with separable spherical transforms, we obtain algorithms that exhibit an extremely parallelisable structure that is well-suited for the high throughput computing of modern hardware accelerators (e.g. GPUs). We also develop a hybrid automatic and manual differentiation approach so that gradients can be computed efficiently. Our algorithms are implemented within the JAX differentiable programming framework in the S2FFT software code. Numerous samplings of the sphere are supported, including equiangular and HEALPix sampling. Computational errors are at the order of machine precision for spherical samplings that admit a sampling theorem. When benchmarked against alternative C codes we observe up to a 400-fold acceleration. Furthermore, when distributing over multiple GPUs we achieve very close to optimal linear scaling with increasing number of GPUs due to the highly parallelised and balanced nature of our algorithms. Provided access to sufficiently many GPUs our transforms thus exhibit an unprecedented effective linear time complexity.</description>

      <title>Calibrating gravitational-wave search algorithms with conformal prediction</title>

Abstract: In astronomy, we frequently face the decision problem: does this data contain a signal? Typically, a statistical approach is used, which requires a threshold. The choice of threshold presents a common challenge in settings where signals and noise must be delineated, but their distributions overlap. Gravitational-wave astronomy, which has gone from the first discovery to catalogues of hundreds of events in less than a decade, presents a fascinating case study. For signals from colliding compact objects, the field has evolved from a frequentist to a Bayesian methodology. However, the issue of choosing a threshold and validating noise contamination in a catalogue persists. Confusion and debate often arise due to the misapplication of statistical concepts, the complicated nature of the detection statistics, and the inclusion of astrophysical background models. We introduce Conformal Prediction (CP), a framework developed in Machine Learning to provide distribution-free uncertainty quantification to point predictors. We show that CP can be viewed as an extension of the traditional statistical frameworks whereby thresholds are calibrated such that the uncertainty intervals are statistically rigorous and the error rate can be validated. Moreover, we discuss how CP offers a framework to optimally build a meta-pipeline combining the outputs from multiple independent searches. We introduce CP with a toy cosmic-ray detector, which captures the salient features of most astrophysical search problems and allows us to demonstrate the features of CP in a simple context. We then apply the approach to a recent gravitational-wave Mock Data Challenge using multiple search algorithms for compact binary coalescence signals in interferometric gravitational-wave data. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on the future potential of the method for gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Improved source classification and performance analysis using Gaia DR3</title>

Abstract: The Discrete Source Classifier (DSC) provides probabilistic classification of sources in Gaia Data Release 3 using a Bayesian framework and a global prior. The DSC Combmod classifier in GDR3 achieved for the extragalactic classes (quasars and galaxies) a high completeness of 92%, but a low purity of 22% due to contamination from the far larger star class. However, these single metrics mask significant variation in performance with magnitude and sky position. Furthermore, a better combination of the individual classifiers is possible. Here we compute two-dimensional representations of the completeness and the purity as function of Galactic latitude and source brightness, and also exclude the Magellanic Clouds where stellar contamination significantly reduces the purity. Reevaluated on a cleaner validation set and without introducing changes to the published GDR3 DSC probabilities themselves, we achieve for Combmod average 2D completenesses of 92% and 95% and average 2D purities of 55% and 89% for the quasar and galaxy classes, respectively. Since the relative proportions of extragalactic objects to stars in Gaia is expected to vary significantly with brightness and latitude, we introduce a new prior as a continuous function of brightness and latitude, and compute new class probabilities. This variable prior only improves the performance by a few percentage points, mostly at the faint end. Significant improvement, however, is obtained by a new additive combination of Specmod and Allosmod. This classifier, Combmod-$\alpha$, achieves average 2D completenesses of 82% and 93% and average 2D purities of 79% and 93% for the quasar and galaxy classes, respectively, when using the global prior. Thus, we achieve a significant improvement in purity for a small loss of completeness. The improvement is most significant for faint quasars where the purity rises from 20% to 62%.</description>
