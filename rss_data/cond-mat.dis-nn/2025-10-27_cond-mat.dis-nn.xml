      <title>Phase diagram of amorphous quantum spin Hall insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of recent progress in the study of amorphous topological phases, we investigate the effects of structural disorder on the topological properties of a two-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulator modeled by the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang Hamiltonian. Using a real-space formulation of the Z2 invariant for Dirac-type Hamiltonian, we map out the phase diagram as a function of disorder strength and the mass parameter. Our results reveal that under the influence of structural disorder, a system can either undergo a phase transition from a topologically non-trivial to a topologically trivial phase or from a trivial to non-trivial phase. Remarkably, in certain parameter regimes, the system exhibits a re-entrant behaviour: a topologically non-trivial phase in the perfect lattice undergoes a transition to a trivial state under the influence of weak disorder but re-emerges as the disorder strength is further increased. We corroborate these findings through analysis of the bulk-boundary correspondence and transport calculations.</description>

      <title>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Transition and Multifractal Critical Phase in Two-Dimensional Quantum Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical study of the two-dimensional quantum percolation model, revealing that a critical region with multifractal eigenstates mediates the transition from localized to delocalized states. By analyzing the mean level ratio and participation entropy, we identify two distinct transitions: a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition at the classical percolation threshold, separating the localized and critical phases, and a power-law-type transition at a larger concentration, marking the onset of full delocalization. The critical phase is characterized by multifractal eigenstates, as evidenced by the generalized fractal dimension and multifractal spectrum. Altogether, our results establish that in the marginal two-dimensional case, the Anderson impurity model and the quantum percolation model belong to different universality classes.</description>

      <title>Exploring high-dimensional random landscapes: from spin glasses to random matrices, passing through simple chaotic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional random landscapes underlie phenomena as diverse as glassy physics and optimization in machine learning, and even their simplest toy models already display extraordinarily rich behavior. This thesis aims to deepen our understanding of that behavior, by combining landscape-based approaches, via the Kac-Rice formalism, with dynamical approaches, paying special attention to both systems with reciprocal and with non-reciprocal interactions. After surveying core techniques and results through the spherical p-spin model, this thesis delivers three main advances: (i) exact dynamic-static comparison in a solvable class of models with non-reciprocal interactions, pinpointing differences and similarities of the two approaches; (ii) a stability-based calculation of the mean number of fixed points (i.e., annealed complexity) of the Sompolinsky-Crisanti-Sommers random neural network, for any level of non-reciprocity; (iii) two approaches to probe the barriers and the distribution of deep local minima in the landscape of the p-spin model; (iv) some results on the overlaps among eigenvectors of spiked, correlated random matrices, which are useful to explore the geometry of energy landscapes. Together, these results sharpen our understanding of these systems, while providing new tools and opening new doors for future research directions.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Computing Optimization of Complex Spin-Glass Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin glass systems as lattices of disordered magnets with random interactions have important implications within the theory of magnetization and applications to a wide-range of hard combinatorial optimization problems. Nevertheless, despite sustained efforts, algorithms that attain both high accuracy and efficiency remain elusive. Due to their topologies being low-$k$-partite such systems are well suited to a probabilistic computing (PC) approach using probabilistic bits (P-bits). Here we present complex spin glass topologies solved on a simulated PC realization of an Ising machine. First, we considered a number of three dimensional Edwards-Anderson cubic spin-glasses randomly generated as well as found in the literature as a benchmark. Second, biclique topologies were identified as a likely candidate for a comparative advantage compared to other state-of-the-art techniques, with a range of sizes simulated. We find that the number of iterations necessary to find solutions of a given quality has constant scaling with system size past a saturation point if one assumes perfect parallelization of the hardware. Therefore a PC architecture can trade the computational depth of other methods for parallelized width by connecting a number of P-bits that scales linearly in system size. This constant scaling is shown to persist across a number of solution qualities, up to a certain limit beyond which resource constraints limited further investigation. The saturation point varies between topologies and qualities and becomes exponentially hard in the limit of finding the ground truth. Furthermore we demonstrate that our PC architecture can solve spin-glass topologies to the same quality as the most advanced quantum annealer in minutes, making modest assumptions about their implementation on hardware.</description>

      <title>Statistics of correlations in nonlinear recurrent neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The statistics of correlations are central quantities characterizing the collective dynamics of recurrent neural networks. We derive exact expressions for the statistics of correlations of nonlinear recurrent networks in the limit of a large number N of neurons, including systematic 1/N corrections. Our approach uses a path-integral representation of the network's stochastic dynamics, which reduces the description to a few collective variables and enables efficient computation. This generalizes previous results on linear networks to include a wide family of nonlinear activation functions, which enter as interaction terms in the path integral. These interactions can resolve the instability of the linear theory and yield a strictly positive participation dimension. We present explicit results for power-law activations, revealing scaling behavior controlled by the network coupling. In addition, we introduce a class of activation functions based on Pade approximants and provide analytic predictions for their correlation statistics. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical results with excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Suppression of quantized heat flow by the dielectric response of a compressible strip at the quantum Hall edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified perturbative framework for energy transport along a chiral quantum Hall (QH) edge coupled to a disordered, compressible strip. Treating the strip as a generic linear response environment characterized by its retarded susceptibility $\chi_q^R(k,\omega)$, we derive leading-order interaction corrections to both the edge heat flux and the plasmon spectrum. Two complementary regimes are analyzed: (i) a gapped, local dielectric response with finite-range coupling, which yields a universal negative $T^4$ correction to the quantized heat flux and a corresponding convex cubic term in the plasmon dispersion; and (ii) a hydrodynamic (diffusive) response with relaxation, producing a crossover from $T^4$ to $T^{3/2}$ scaling and a change of sign in the correction. The resulting backaction reduces the plasmon group velocity and can suppress the apparent thermal conductance by an amount consistent with experiment. Importantly, the total heat flux remains quantized: the apparent deficit in the plasmon contribution corresponds to an induced energy flow within the compressible strip, representing a form of heat drag between chiral and nonchiral modes. The framework thus provides a microscopic and quantitatively plausible explanation of the ``missing heat flux'' anomaly observed at QH edges and links its transport signature to the nonlinearity of the plasmon spectrum.</description>

      <title>DeFecT-FF: Accelerated Modeling of Defects in Cd-Zn--Te-Se-S Compounds Combining High-Throughput DFT and Machine Learning Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed DeFecT-FF, a framework for predicting the energies and ground-state configurations of native point defects, extrinsic dopants, impurities, and defect complexes in zincblende-phase Cd/Zn-Te/Se/S compounds relevant to CdTe-based solar cells. The framework combines high-throughput DFT data with crystal graph-based machine learning force fields (MLFFs) trained to reproduce DFT energies and forces. Alloying at Cd or Te sites offers a route to tune the electronic and defect properties of CdTe absorbers for improved solar efficiency. Given the vast number of possible defect types, charge states, and symmetry-breaking configurations, traditional DFT approaches are computationally prohibitive. Our dataset includes GGA-PBE and HSE06-optimized structures for bulk, alloyed, interface, and grain-boundary systems. Using active learning, we expanded the dataset and trained MLFFs to accurately predict energies across charge states. The model enabled rapid screening and discovery of new low-energy defect configurations, validated through HSE06 calculations with spin-orbit coupling. The DeFecT-FF framework is publicly available as a nanoHUB tool, allowing users to upload crystallographic files, automatically generate defects, and compute defect formation energies versus Fermi level and chemical potentials, greatly reducing the need for expensive DFT simulations.</description>

      <title>General Two-Parameter Model of Alpha-Relaxation in Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the vicinity of the glass transition, the characteristic relaxation time (e.g., the alpha-relaxation time in dielectric spectroscopy) of a glass-former exhibits a strongly super-Arrhenius temperature dependence, as compared to the classical Arrhenius behavior at high temperatures. A comprehensive description of both regions thus requires five parameters. Here, we demonstrate that many glass-formers exhibit a universal scaling, with only two material-specific parameters setting the timescale and the temperature scale; the other three being universal constants. Furthermore, we show that the master curve can be described by the recently developed two-state, two-(time) scale (TS2) theory (Soft Matter 2020, 16, 810) and regress the universal TS2 parameters. We also show the connection between the TS2 model and the Hall-Wolynes elastic relaxation theory.</description>

      <title>The geometry and dynamics of annealed optimization in the coherent Ising machine with hidden and planted solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coherent Ising machine (CIM) is a nonconventional hardware architecture for finding approximate solutions to large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. It operates by annealing a laser gain parameter to adiabatically deform a high-dimensional energy landscape over a set of soft spins, going from a simple convex landscape to the more complex optimization landscape of interest. We address how the evolving energy landscapes guides the optimization dynamics against problems with hidden planted solutions. We study the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass with ferromagnetic couplings that favor a hidden configuration by combining the replica method, random matrix theory, the Kac-Rice method and dynamical mean field theory. We characterize energy, number, location, and Hessian eigenspectra of global minima, local minima, and critical points as the landscape evolves. We find that low energy global minima develop soft-modes which the optimization dynamics can exploit to descend the energy landscape. Even when these global minima are aligned to the hidden configuration, there can be exponentially many higher energy local minima that are all unaligned with the hidden solution. Nevertheless, the annealed optimization dynamics can evade this cloud of unaligned high energy local minima and descend near to aligned lower energy global minima. Eventually, as the landscape is further annealed, these global minima become rigid, terminating any further optimization gains from annealing. We further consider a second optimization problem, the Wishart planted ensemble, which contains a hidden planted solution in a landscape with tunable ruggedness. We describe CIM phase transitions between recoverability and non-recoverability of the hidden solution. Overall, we find intriguing relations between high-dimensional geometry and dynamics in analog machines for combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Yielding in amorphous solids reveals an age-dependent intrinsic lengthscale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how amorphous solids yield under shear is central to predicting material failure, yet prescribing reliable local yielding criteria remains a fundamental challenge. Here, through a mesoscale analysis of localized yielding, we reveal an intrinsic length scale (\zeta) that governs local failure, and demonstrate that \zeta grows with the age of the system. The age dependence shows up not only in the features of the distribution of local yield stress but also in the pseudogap exponent \theta, which provides a measure of marginal stability of the amorphous solids. These insights are made possible by a new method, termed the soft matrix approach, that allows local regions of an amorphous solid to yield within a minimally constrained, elastically coupled environment. By overcoming key limitations of earlier techniques, our approach provides a robust platform for probing failure mechanisms, particularly in soft disordered materials and paves the way for improved elastoplastic modeling of disordered solids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studies of the dynamics of nonlinear recurrent neural networks often assume independent and identically distributed couplings, but large-scale connectomics data indicate that biological neural circuits exhibit markedly different connectivity properties. These include rapidly decaying singular-value spectra and structured singular-vector overlaps. Here, we develop a theory to analyze how these forms of structure shape high-dimensional collective activity in nonlinear recurrent neural networks. We first introduce the random-mode model, a random-matrix ensemble related to the singular-value decomposition that enables control over the spectrum and right-left mode overlaps. Then, using a novel path-integral calculation, we derive analytical expressions that reveal how connectivity structure affects features of collective dynamics: the dimension of activity, which quantifies the number of high-variance collective-activity fluctuations, and the temporal correlations that characterize the timescales of these fluctuations. We show that connectivity structure can be invisible in single-neuron activities while dramatically shaping collective activity. Furthermore, despite the nonlinear, high-dimensional nature of these networks, the dimension of activity depends on just two connectivity parameters -- the variance of the couplings and the effective rank of the coupling matrix, which quantifies the number of dominant rank-one connectivity components. We contrast the effects of single-neuron heterogeneity and low dimensional connectivity, making predictions about how z-scoring data affects the dimension of activity. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of structured overlaps between left and right modes in the Drosophila connectome, incorporate them into the theory, and show how they further shape collective dynamics.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanical mapping and maximum-likelihood thresholds for the surface code under generic single-qubit coherent errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The surface code, one of the leading candidates for quantum error correction, is known to protect encoded quantum information against stochastic, i.e., incoherent errors. The protection against coherent errors, such as from unwanted gate rotations, is however understood only for special cases, such as rotations about the $X$ or $Z$ axes. Here we consider generic single-qubit coherent errors in the surface code, i.e., rotations by angle $\alpha$ about an axis that can be chosen arbitrarily. We develop a statistical mechanical mapping for such errors and perform entanglement analysis in transfer matrix space to numerically establish the existence of an error-correcting phase, which we chart in a subspace of rotation axes to estimate the corresponding maximum-likelihood thresholds $\alpha_\mathrm{th}$. The classical statistical mechanics model we derive is a random-bond Ising model with complex couplings and four-spin interactions (i.e., a complex-coupled Ashkin-Teller model). The error correcting phase, $\alpha&lt;\alpha_\mathrm{th}$, where the logical error rate decreases exponentially with code distance, is shown to correspond in transfer matrix space to a gapped one-dimensional quantum Hamiltonian exhibiting spontaneous breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Our numerical results rest on two key ingredients: (i) we show that the state evolution under the transfer matrix -- a non-unitary (1+1)-dimensional quantum circuit -- can be efficiently numerically simulated using matrix product states. Based on this approach, (ii) we also develop an algorithm to (approximately) sample syndromes based on their Born probability. The $\alpha_\mathrm{th}$ values we find show that the maximum likelihood thresholds for coherent errors are larger than those for the corresponding incoherent errors (from the Pauli twirl), and significantly exceed the values found using minimum weight perfect matching.</description>

      <title>Memristive Nanowire Network for Energy Efficient Audio Classification: Pre-Processing-Free Reservoir Computing with Reduced Latency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient audio feature extraction is critical for low-latency, resource-constrained speech recognition. Conventional preprocessing techniques, such as Mel Spectrogram, Perceptual Linear Prediction (PLP), and Learnable Spectrogram, achieve high classification accuracy but require large feature sets and significant computation. The low-latency and power efficiency benefits of neuromorphic computing offer a strong potential for audio classification. Here, we introduce memristive nanowire networks as a neuromorphic hardware preprocessing layer for spoken-digit classification, a capability not previously demonstrated. Nanowire networks extract compact, informative features directly from raw audio, achieving a favorable trade-off between accuracy, dimensionality reduction from the original audio size (data compression) , and training time efficiency. Compared with state-of-the-art software techniques, nanowire features reach 98.95% accuracy with 66 times data compression (XGBoost) and 97.9% accuracy with 255 times compression (Random Forest) in sub-second training latency. Across multiple classifiers nanowire features consistently achieve more than 90% accuracy with more than 62.5 times compression, outperforming features extracted by conventional state-of-the-art techniques such as MFCC in efficiency without loss of performance. Moreover, nanowire features achieve 96.5% accuracy classifying multispeaker audios, outperforming all state-of-the-art feature accuracies while achieving the highest data compression and lowest training time. Nanowire network preprocessing also enhances linear separability of audio data, improving simple classifier performance and generalizing across speakers. These results demonstrate that memristive nanowire networks provide a novel, low-latency, and data-efficient feature extraction approach, enabling high-performance neuromorphic audio classification.</description>

      <title>No Free Lunch From Random Feature Ensembles: Scaling Laws and Near-Optimality Conditions</title>

Abstract: Given a fixed budget for total model size, one must choose between training a single large model or combining the predictions of multiple smaller models. We investigate this trade-off for ensembles of random-feature ridge regression models in both the overparameterized and underparameterized regimes. Using deterministic equivalent risk estimates, we prove that when a fixed number of parameters is distributed among $K$ independently trained models, the ridge-optimized test risk increases with $K$. Consequently, a single large model achieves optimal performance. We then ask when ensembles can achieve \textit{near}-optimal performance. In the overparameterized regime, we show that, to leading order, the test error depends on ensemble size and model size only through the total feature count, so that overparameterized ensembles consistently achieve near-optimal performance. To understand underparameterized ensembles, we derive scaling laws for the test risk as a function of total parameter count when the ensemble size and parameters per ensemble member are jointly scaled according to a ``growth exponent'' $\ell$. While the optimal error scaling is always achieved by increasing model size with a fixed ensemble size, our analysis identifies conditions on the kernel and task eigenstructure under which near-optimal scaling laws can be obtained by joint scaling of ensemble size and model size.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced L\'evy flights of quantum information</title>

Abstract: We explore a model of free fermions in one dimension, subject to frustrated (non-commuting) local measurements across adjacent sites, which resolves the fermions into non-orthogonal orbitals, misaligned from the underlying lattice. For maximal misalignment, superdiffusive behavior emerges from the vanishing of the measurement-induced quasiparticle decay rate at one point in the Brillouin zone, which generates fractal-scaling entanglement entropy $S \propto \ell^{1/3}$ for a subsystem of length $\ell$. We derive an effective non-linear sigma model with long-range couplings responsible for L\'evy flights in entanglement propagation, which we confirm with large-scale numerical simulations. When the misalignment is reduced, the entanglement exhibits, with increasing $\ell$, consecutive regimes of superdiffusive, $S\propto \ell^{1/3}$, diffusive, $S\propto \ln \ell$, and localized, $S = \rm{const}$, behavior. Our findings show how intricate fractal-scaling entanglement can be produced for local Hamiltonians and measurements.</description>

      <title>From time crystals to time quasicrystals: Exploring quasiperiodic phases in transverse field Ising chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time quasicrystals (TQCs) represent a compelling extension of the concept of time crystals (TCs). While TCs break discrete time-translation symmetry by exhibiting a periodic response at a subharmonic of the driving frequency, TQCs display a more complex temporal order. They respond at multiple incommensurate frequencies, values that are not integer multiples of the fundamental driving frequency, resulting in quasiperiodic dynamics. In this work, we investigate the emergence of a TQC in a disordered quantum Ising chain subjected to a quasiperiodic transverse field. Using exact diagonalization, we find that the transverse magnetization exhibits quasiperiodic oscillations which persist over extended prethermal timescales before eventual decay. This indicates that the TQC exists as a long-lived, prethermal dynamical phase rather than a true equilibrium state. We further assess the robustness of this prethermal TQC against interactions and driving imperfections, confirming its stability under realistic experimental conditions. Finite-size analysis reveals that the prethermal TQC lifetime exhibits minimal dependence on system size. Additionally, we explore the emergence of TQCs in the same chain under symmetric sampling of exchange couplings. Our results demonstrate that the TQC phase is highly sensitive to both the choice of coupling distribution and the values of the driving frequencies. These findings highlight promising experimental prospects for realizing TQCs in cold atomic systems and quantum simulators, providing valuable insights into their stability, dynamical properties, and potential for exploring novel non-equilibrium quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Design principles of deep translationally-symmetric neural quantum states for frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03466</link>

Abstract: Deep neural network quantum states have emerged as a leading method for studying the ground states of quantum magnets. Successful architectures exploit translational symmetry, but the root of their effectiveness and differences between architectures remain unclear. Here, we apply the ConvNext architecture, designed to incorporate elements of transformers into convolutional networks, to quantum many-body ground states. We find that it is remarkably similar to the factored vision transformer, which has been employed successfully for several frustrated spin systems, allowing us to relate this architecture to more conventional convolutional networks. Through a series of numerical experiments we design the ConvNext to achieve greatest performance at lowest computational cost, then apply this network to the Shastry-Sutherland and J1-J2 models, obtaining variational energies comparable to the state of the art, providing a blueprint for network design choices of translationally-symmetric architectures to tackle challenging ground-state problems in frustrated magnetism.</description>
