      <title>Deep Learning Option Pricing with Market Implied Volatility Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a deep learning framework for pricing options based on market-implied volatility surfaces. Using end-of-day S\&amp;P 500 index options quotes from 2018-2023, we construct arbitrage-free volatility surfaces and generate training data for American puts and arithmetic Asian options using QuantLib. To address the high dimensionality of volatility surfaces, we employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) that compresses volatility surfaces across maturities and strikes into a 10-dimensional latent representation. We feed these latent variables, combined with option-specific inputs such as strike and maturity, into a multilayer perceptron to predict option prices. Our model is trained in stages: first to train the VAE for volatility surface compression and reconstruction, then options pricing mapping, and finally fine-tune the entire network end-to-end. The trained pricer achieves high accuracy across American and Asian options, with prediction errors concentrated primarily near long maturities and at-the-money strikes, where absolute bid-ask price differences are known to be large. Our method offers an efficient and scalable approach requiring only a single neural network forward pass and naturally improve with additional data. By bridging volatility surface modeling and option pricing in a unified framework, it provides a fast and flexible alternative to traditional numerical approaches for exotic options.</description>

      <title>Design and hedging of unit linked life insurance with environmental factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of designing and hedging unit-linked life policies whose benefits depend on an investment fund that incorporates environmental criteria in its selection process. Offering these products poses two key challenges: constructing a green investment fund and developing a hedging strategy for policies written on that fund. We address these two problems separately. First, we design a portfolio selection rule driven by firms' carbon intensity that endogenously selects assets and avoids ad hoc pre-screens based on ESG scores. The effectiveness of our new portfolio selection method is tested using real market data. Second, we adopt the perspective of an insurance company issuing unit-linked policies written on this fund. Such contracts are exposed to market, carbon, and mortality risk, which the insurer seeks to hedge. Due to market incompleteness, we address the hedging problem via a quadratic approach aimed at minimizing the tracking error. We also make a numerical analysis to assess the performance of the hedging strategy. For our simulation study, we use an efficient weak second-order scheme that allows for variance reduction.</description>

      <title>Nested Optimal Transport Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating realistic financial time series is essential for stress testing, scenario generation, and decision-making under uncertainty. Despite advances in deep generative models, there is no consensus metric for their evaluation. We focus on generative AI for financial time series in decision-making applications and employ the nested optimal transport distance, a time-causal variant of optimal transport distance, which is robust to tasks such as hedging, optimal stopping, and reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a statistically consistent, naturally parallelizable algorithm for its computation, achieving substantial speedups over existing approaches.</description>
