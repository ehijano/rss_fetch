      <title>Orbital Dynamics of the Solar Basin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the solar basin -- the accumulated population of weakly-interacting particles on bound orbits in the Solar System. We focus on particles starting off on Sun-crossing orbits, corresponding to initial conditions of production inside the Sun, and investigate their evolution over the age of the Solar System. A combination of analytic methods, secular perturbation theory, and direct numerical integration of orbits sheds light on the long- and short-term evolution of a population of test particles orbiting the Sun and perturbed by the planets. Our main results are that the effective lifetime of a solar basin at Earth's location is $\tau_{\rm eff} = 1.20\pm 0.09 \,\mathrm{Gyr}$, and that there is annual (semi-annual) modulation of the basin density with known phase and amplitude at the fractional level of 6.5% (2.2%). These results have important implications for direct detection searches of solar basin particles, and the strong temporal modulation signature yields a robust discovery channel. Our simulations can also be interpreted in the context of gravitational capture of dark matter in the Solar System, with consequences for any dark-matter phenomenon that may occur below the local escape velocity.</description>

      <title>The Application of Machine Learning in Tidal Evolution Simulation of Star-Planet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the release of a large amount of astronomical data, an increasing number of close-in hot Jupiters have been discovered. Calculating their evolutionary curves using star-planet interaction models presents a challenge. To expedite the generation of evolutionary curves for these close-in hot Jupiter systems, we utilized tidal interaction models established on MESA to create 15,745 samples of star-planet systems and 7,500 samples of stars. Additionally, we employed a neural network (Multi-Layer Perceptron - MLP) to predict the evolutionary curves of the systems, including stellar effective temperature, radius, stellar rotation period, and planetary orbital period. The median relative errors of the predicted evolutionary curves were found to be 0.15%, 0.43%, 2.61%, and 0.57%, respectively. Furthermore, the speed at which we generate evolutionary curves exceeds that of model-generated curves by more than four orders of magnitude. We also extracted features of planetary migration states and utilized lightGBM to classify the samples into 6 categories for prediction. We found that by combining three types that undergo long-term double synchronization into one label, the classifier effectively recognized these features. Apart from systems experiencing long-term double synchronization, the median relative errors of the predicted evolutionary curves were all below 4%. Our work provides an efficient method to save significant computational resources and time with minimal loss in accuracy. This research also lays the foundation for analyzing the evolutionary characteristics of systems under different migration states, aiding in the understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms of such systems. Finally, to a large extent, our approach could replace the calculations of theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Dust mineralogy and variability of the inner PDS 70 disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inner disk of the young star PDS 70 may be a site of rocky planet formation, with two giant planets detected further out. Solids in the inner disk may inform us about the origin of this inner disk water and nature of the dust in the rocky planet-forming regions. We aim to constrain the chemical composition, lattice structure, and grain sizes of small silicate grains in the inner disk of PDS 70, observed both in JWST/MIRI MRS and Spitzer IRS. We use a dust fitting model, called DuCK, based on a two-layer disk model. We use Gaussian Random Field and Distribution of Hollow Spheres models to obtain two sets of dust opacities. The third set of opacities is obtained from aerosol spectroscopy. We use stoichiometric amorphous silicates, forsterite, and enstatite in our analysis. We also used iron-rich and magnesium-rich amorphous silicate and fayalite dust species to study the iron content. The Gaussian Random Field opacity agrees well with the observed spectrum. In both MIRI and Spitzer spectra, amorphous silicates are the dominant dust species. Crystalline silicates are dominated by iron-poor olivine. We do not find strong evidence for enstatite. Moreover, the MIRI spectrum indicates larger grain sizes than the Spitzer spectrum, indicating a time-variable small grain reservoir. The inner PDS 70 disk is dominated by a variable reservoir of optically thin warm amorphous silicates. We suggest that the small grains detected in the inner PDS 70 disk are likely transported inward from the outer disk as a result of filtration and fragmentation at the ice line. In addition, the variation between MIRI and Spitzer data can be explained by the grain growth over 15 years and a dynamical inner disk where opacity changes occur resulting from the highly variable hot innermost dust reservoir.</description>

      <title>Boundary Layers of Circumplanetary Disks around Spinning Planets II. Global Modes with Azimuthal Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accretion of material from disks onto weakly magnetized objects invariably involves its traversal through a material surface, known as the boundary layer (BL). Our prior studies have revealed two distinct global wave modes for circumplanetary disks (CPDs) with BLs exhibit opposite behaviors in spin modulation.We perform a detailed analysis about the effect of magnetic fields on these global modes, highlighting how magnetic resonances and turning points could complicate the wave dynamics. The angular momentum flux becomes positive near the BL with increasing magnetic field strength. We also examine the perturbation profile to demonstrate the amplification of magnetic fields within the BL. The dependence of growth rates on the magnetic field strength, and the spin rate are systematically investigated. We find that stronger magnetic fields tend to result in lower terminal spin rates. We stress the potential possibility for the formation of angular momentum belts and pressure bumps. The implication for the spin evolution and quasi-period oscillations observed in compact objects are also briefly discussed. Our calculations advance the understanding of magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) accretion processes and lays a foundation for observational studies and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Can gap-edge illumination excite spirals in protoplanetary disks? Three-temperature radiation hydrodynamics and NIR image modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of high-resolution, near-infrared instruments such as VLT/SPHERE and Gemini/GPI has helped uncover a wealth of substructure in planet-forming disks, including large, prominent spiral arms in MWC 758, SAO 206462, and V1247 Ori among others. In the classical theory of disk-planet interaction, these arms are consistent with Lindblad-resonance driving by multi-Jupiter-mass companions. Despite improving detection limits, evidence for such massive bodies in connection with spiral substructure has been inconclusive. In search of an alternative explanation, we use the PLUTO code to run 3D hydrodynamical simulations with two comparatively low planet masses (Saturn-mass, Jupiter-mass) and two thermodynamic prescriptions (three-temperature radiation hydrodynamics, and the more traditional $\beta$-cooling) in a low-mass disk. In the radiative cases, an $m = 2$ mode, potentially attributable to the interaction of stellar radiation with gap-edge asymmetries, creates an azimuthal pressure gradient, which in turn gives rise to prominent spiral arms in the upper layers of the disk. Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) post-processing with RADMC3D reveals that in near-infrared scattered light, these gap-edge spirals are significantly more prominent than the traditional Lindblad spirals for planets in the mass range tested. Our results demonstrate that even intermediate-mass protoplanets -- less detectable, but more ubiquitous, than super-Jupiters -- are capable of indirectly inducing large-scale spiral disk features, and underscore the importance of including radiation physics in efforts to reproduce observations.</description>

      <title>Impact of oxygen fugacity on atmospheric structure and emission spectra of ultra hot rocky exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheres above lava-ocean planets (LOPs) hold clues as to the properties of their interiors, owing to the expectation that the two reservoirs are in chemical equilibrium. Here we consider `mineral' atmospheres produced in equilibrium with silicate liquids. We treat oxygen fugacity ($f$O$_2$) as an independent variable, together with temperature ($T$) and composition ($X$), to compute equilibrium partial pressures ($p$) of stable gas species at the liquid-gas interface. Above this boundary, the atmospheric speciation and the pressure-temperature structure are computed self-consistently to yield emission spectra. We explore a wide array of plausible compositions, oxygen fugacities (between 6 log$_{10}$ units below- and above the iron-w\"ustite buffer, IW) and irradiation temperatures (2000, 2500, 3000 and 3500 K) relevant to LOPs. We find that SiO(g), Fe(g) and Mg(g) are the major species below $\sim$IW, ceding to O$_2$(g) and O(g) in more oxidised atmospheres. The transition between the two regimes demarcates a minimum in total pressure ($P$). Because $p$ scales linearly with $X$, emission spectra are only modest functions of composition. By contrast, $f$O$_2$ can vary over orders of magnitude, thus causing commensurate changes in $p$. Reducing atmospheres show intense SiO emission, creating a temperature inversion in the upper atmosphere. Conversely, oxidised atmospheres have lower $p$SiO and lack thermal inversions, with resulting emission spectra that mimic that of a black body. Consequently, the intensity of SiO emission relative to the background, generated by MgO(g), can be used to quantify the $f$O$_2$ of the atmosphere. Depending on the emission spectroscopy metric of the target, deriving the $f$O$_2$ of known nearby LOPs is possible with a few secondary occultations observed by JWST.</description>

      <title>Assessing the capability of a model-based stellar XUV estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar XUV (X-ray and extreme ultraviolet) emission drives the heating and chemical reactions in planetary atmospheres and protoplanetary disks, and therefore, a proper estimation of a stellar XUV spectrum is required for their studies. One proposed solution is to estimate stellar atmospheric heating using numerical models, although the validation was restricted to the Sun over a limited parameter range. In this study, we extend the validation of the model by testing it with the Sun and three young, nearby solar-type stars with available XUV observational data. We first test the model with the solar observations, examining its accuracy in activity minimum and maximum phases, its dependence on loop length, the effect of loop length superposition, and its sensitivity to elemental abundance. We confirm that the model spectrum is mostly accurate both in activity minimum and maximum, although the high-energy X-rays (&lt; 1 nm) are underestimated in the activity maximum. Applying the model to young solar-type stars, we find that it can reproduce the observed XUV spectra within a factor of 3 in the range of 1-30 nm for stars with magnetic flux up to 100 times that of the Sun. For a star with 300 times the solar magnetic flux, although the raw numerical data show a systematically lower spectrum than observed, the spectra are in good agreement once corrected for the effect of insufficient resolution in the transition region. For all young solar-type stars, high-energy X-rays (&lt; 1 nm) are significantly underestimated, with the deviation increasing with stellar magnetic activity. Our findings indicate that the stellar XUV spectrum can be reasonably estimated through a numerical model, given that the essential input parameters (surface magnetic flux and elemental abundance) are known.</description>

      <title>Discs are born eccentric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations have begun probing the early phases of disc formation, but little data yet exists on disc structure and morphology of Class 0 objects. Using simulations, we are able to lay out predictions of disc morphologies expected in future surveys of young discs. Based on detailed simulations of ab initio star formation by core collapse, we predict that early discs must be eccentric. In this letter, we study the morphology and, in particular, the eccentricity of discs formed in non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) collapse simulations. We attempt to show that discs formed by cloud collapse are likely to be eccentric. We ran non-ideal MHD collapse simulations in the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES with radiative transfer. We used state-of-the-art analysis methods to measure the disc eccentricity. We find that despite no asymmetry in the initial conditions, the discs formed are eccentric, with eccentricities on the order of 0.1. These results may have important implications for protoplanetary disc dynamics and planet formation. The presence of eccentricity in young discs that is not seen at later stages of disc evolution is in tension with current viscous eccentricity damping models. This implies that there may be an as-yet undiscovered circularisation mechanism in circumstellar discs.</description>

      <title>Low abundances of TiO and VO on the Dayside of KELT-9 b: Insights from Ground-Based Photometric Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present ground-based photometric observations of secondary eclipses of the hottest known planet KELT-9b using MuSCAT2 and Sinistro. We detect secondary eclipse signals in $i$ and $z_{\rm s}$ with eclipse depths of $373^{+74}_{-75}$ ppm and $638^{+199}_{-178}$, respectively. We perform an atmospheric retrieval on the emission spectrum combined with the data from HST/WFC3, Spitzer, TESS, and CHEOPS to obtain the temperature profile and chemical abundances, including TiO and VO, which have been thought to produce temperature inversion structures in the dayside of ultra-hot Jupiters. While we confirm a strong temperature inversion structure, we find low abundances of TiO and VO with mixing ratios of $\rm{log(TiO)}=-7.80^{+0.15}_{-0.30}$ and $\rm{log(VO)}=-9.60^{+0.64}_{-0.57}$, respectively. The low abundances of TiO and VO are consistent with theoretical predictions for such an ultra-hot atmosphere. In such low abundances, TiO and VO have little effect on the temperature structure of the atmosphere. The abundance of ${\rm e}^{-}$, which serves as a proxy for ${\rm H}^{-}$ ions in this study, is found to be high, with $\rm{log(e^-)}=-4.89\pm{0.06}$. These results indicate that the temperature inversion in KELT-9 b's dayside atmosphere is likely not caused by TiO/VO, but rather by the significant abundance of ${\rm H}^{-}$ ions. The best-fit model cannot fully explain the observed spectrum, and chemical species not included in the retrieval may introduce modeling biases. Future observations with broader wavelength coverage and higher spectral resolution are expected to provide more accurate diagnostics on the presence and abundances of TiO/VO. These advanced observations will overcome the limitations of current data from HST and photometric facilities, which are constrained by narrow wavelength coverage and instrumental systematics.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology of the Nearby K-Dwarf $\sigma$ Draconis using the Keck Planet Finder and TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asteroseismology of dwarf stars cooler than the Sun is very challenging due to the low amplitudes and rapid timescales of oscillations. Here, we present the asteroseismic detection of solar-like oscillations at 4-minute timescales ($\nu_{\mathrm{max}}\sim4300\mu$Hz) in the nearby K-dwarf $\sigma$ Draconis using extreme precision Doppler velocity observations from the Keck Planet Finder and 20-second cadence photometry from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. The star is the coolest dwarf star to date with both velocity and luminosity observations of solar-like oscillations, having amplitudes of $5.9\pm0.8\,$cm$\,\text{s}^{-1}$ and $0.8\pm0.2$ ppm, respectively. These measured values are in excellent agreement with established luminosity-velocity amplitude relations for oscillations and provide further evidence that mode amplitudes for stars with $T_{\mathrm{eff}}&lt;\,5500\,$K diminish in scale following a $(L/M)^{1.5}$ relation. By modeling the star's oscillation frequencies from photometric data, we measure an asteroseismic age of $4.5\pm0.9\,\rm{(ran)} \pm 1.2\,\rm{(sys)}$ Gyr. The observations demonstrate the capability of next-generation spectrographs and precise space-based photometry to extend observational asteroseismology to nearby cool dwarfs, which are benchmarks for stellar astrophysics and prime targets for directly imaging planets using future space-based telescopes.</description>

      <title>Casting Light on Degeneracies: A Comprehensive Study of Lightcurve Variations in Microlensing Events OGLE-2017-BLG-0103 and OGLE-2017-BLG-0192</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates orbital parallax in gravitational microlensing events, focusing on OGLE-2017-BLG-0103 and OGLE-2017-BLG-0192. For events with timescales $\leq$ 60 days, a Jerk Parallax degeneracy arises due to high Jerk velocity ($\tilde{v_{j}}$), causing a four-fold continuous parallax degeneracy. OGLE-2017-BLG-0103, after incorporating orbital parallax, reveals four discrete degenerate parallax solutions, while OGLE-2017-BLG-0192 exhibits four discrete solutions without degeneracy. {The asymmetric light curve of OGLE-2017-BLG-0103 suggests a more probable model where xallarap is added to the parallax model, introducing tension. The galactic model analysis predicts a very low mass stellar lens for OGLE-2017-BLG-0192. For OGLE-2017-BLG-0103, degenerate solutions suggest a low-mass star or a darker lens in the disc, while the Xallarap+Parallax model also predicts a stellar lens in the bulge, with the source being a solar-type star orbited by a dwarf star.} This study presents five degenerate solutions for OGLE-2017-BLG-0103, emphasizing the potential for confirmation through high-resolution Adaptive Optics (AO) observations with Extremely Large Telescopes in the future. The complexities of degenerate scenarios in these microlensing events underscore the need to analyze special single-lens events in the Roman Telescope Era.</description>
