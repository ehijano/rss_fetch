      <title>Stability of mathematical quasicrystals under statistical convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we prove that if a uniformly separated sequence in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is uniformly quasicrystalline and converges rapidly enough to a discrete set $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ having the same separation radius as the sequence, then $X$ is also a quasicrystal. The convergence is addressed for a distance that quantifies the statistical closeness between two uniformly discrete point sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Furthermore, motivated by the robustness of quasicrystals under random perturbations, we establish the continuity, for this distance, of the Fourier Transform of quasicrystals. This continuity result, in turn, allows us to rigorously demonstrate that established robustness properties of quasicrystals against random errors remain stable under the statistical convergence considered.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Eversion Buckling for Ideal Omnidirectional Energy Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing materials that can effectively and repeatedly absorb energy from unpredictable directions represents a grand challenge in modern engineering, crucial for applications from vehicle crashworthiness systems to personal protective equipment. While bistable structures offer a promising pathway towards reusable energy absorbers, their functionality is almost universally constrained to a single loading axis, rendering them vulnerable and ineffective against off axis or oblique impacts. Here, we report the discovery and harnessing of eversion buckling, a distinct pitchfork bifurcation phenomenon in axisymmetric shells, to overcome this fundamental limitation. By strategically designing shell geometries to leverage this mechanism, we have engineered structural units with robust, inplane omnidirectional bistability. This property is characterized by a massive and rapid volumetric contraction upon snapping, which is key to its exceptional performance. When assembled, these structures exhibit an ideal, extended stress plateau, leading to a near perfect energy absorption efficiency dramatically outperforming typical energy absorbing materials. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the system's damping capacity far exceeds its constituent material, and highly tunable, spanning a sixfold range of loss factors which enables load adaptive properties. This design strategy, elucidates a clear mechanism rooted in enhanced friction and sequential stress release, paving the way for a new class of robust, reusable, and load adaptive energy absorbing systems.</description>

      <title>From Walking to Tunneling: An Investigation of Generalized Pilot-Wave Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ability of millimetric walking droplets to tunnel between spatially-structured cavities. By synthesizing experimental and theoretical analysis, we provide a comprehensive framework for droplet tunneling mechanics in three spatial dimensions. We define a generalized Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator that enables explicit characterization of droplet and wave-field dynamics under highly intricate variable-topography systems. This formalism enables a reduced, three-dimensional description of the pilot-wave field, facilitating high-fidelity numerical simulations of tunneling probabilities and long-time macroscopic dynamics with significantly improved accuracy over existing quasi-two-dimensional models. Moreover, we demonstrate experimental droplet tunneling in complex cavity geometries and discuss many-droplet coupling in the context of tunneling observations.</description>

      <title>Group-Theoretical Origin of the Sectoral-Tesseral-Zonal Trichotomy in Spherical Harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spherical harmonics $Y_\ell^m$ fall into three families -- sectoral ($\ell = |m|$), tesseral ($\ell &gt; |m| &gt; 0$), and zonal ($m = 0$) -- which exhibit fundamentally different behaviour under analytic continuation to non-integer parameters. We demonstrate that this trichotomy has a natural explanation in the representation theory of SO(3). Sectoral harmonics correspond to highest-weight vectors annihilated by the raising operator $L_+$; this annihilation condition reduces to a first-order differential equation admitting solutions for any real $m &gt; 0$, independent of representation-theoretic constraints. Tesseral harmonics arise from the full ladder algebra acting on highest-weight states; for non-integer $m$, this construction yields tesseral modes at $\nu = m + k$ for positive integer $k$, with the hypergeometric series terminating when $\nu - m$ is a non-negative integer. Zonal harmonics with $m = 0$ require integer $\nu$ on the full sphere, but TE-polarised zonal modes survive in wedge geometries because their electric field components automatically satisfy the conducting boundary conditions. Numerical simulations of electromagnetic cavities with conducting wedges confirm these predictions quantitatively: both sectoral modes ($\nu = m$) and tesseral modes ($\nu = m + k$) are observed with sub-percent frequency agreement, validating the extended framework for non-integer azimuthal index.</description>

      <title>Localization of the eigenfunctions of a Bloch-Torrey operator on the half-plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a non-self adjoint operator of the form $-h^2 \Delta + i(V(x) + \alpha(x)y)$ on the upper half plane $y &gt; 0$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions on $\{y = 0\}$ with $V \geq 0$, $V$ admitting a non-degenerate minimum at $x = 0$ and $\alpha'(0) = 0$. We study its eigenfunctions associated to the smallest eigenvalues in magnitude in the semiclassical limit $h \to 0$. Elementary variational estimates show that these eigenfunctions are localized near the point $(0,0)$ at the scales $O(h^{1/3})$ in $x$ and $O(h^{2/3})$ in $y$. In this paper, we show that the $O(h^{1/3})$ localization in $x$ is not optimal; more precisely, we establish that the eigenfunctions are concentrated in a neighborhood of size $O(h^{1/2})$ of the axis $\{x = 0\}$, and this scale is shown to be sharp. The proof relies on the symbolic calculus of operator-valued pseudodifferential operators.</description>

      <title>Critical Hermitian matrix model with external source and Boussinesq hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the random Hermitian matrix model of dimension $2n$, with external source, defined by the probability density function \begin{equation*}
  \frac{1}{Z_{2n}} \lvert \det(M) \rvert^{\alpha} e^{-2n\mathrm{Tr} (V(M) - AM)}, \quad V(x) = \frac{x^4}{4} - t\frac{x^2}{2}, \end{equation*} where the external source $A$ has two eigenvalues $\pm a$ of equal multiplicity. We investigate the limiting local statistics of the eigenvalues of $M$ around $0$ in certain critical regimes as $n \to \infty$. When the parameters $t$ and $a$ lie on a critical curve along which the limiting mean eigenvalue density vanishes as $|x|^{1/3}$, the double scaling limit of the correlation kernel is constructed from functions associated with the Boussinesq equation. This new limiting kernel reduces to the classical Pearcey kernel when $\alpha = 0$. Furthermore, in the multi-critical case where the limiting mean eigenvalue density vanishes as $|x|^{5/3}$, the limiting kernel is built from the second member of the Boussinesq hierarchy. We derive the results by transforming the random matrix model into biorthogonal ensembles that are analogous to the Muttalib-Borodin ensemble, and then analyzing its asymptotic behavior via a vector Riemann-Hilbert problem.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility and randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make precise sense of the idea of "molecular chaos" through algorithmic randomness of microscopic trajectories, and ground macroscopic irreversibility in the lack of symmetry under time reversal of this property. This concept of randomness is defined relative to an underlying probability measure P on the space of trajectories. In deterministic models like Newtonian N-particle flow in dilute gases of hard spheres (as considered by Boltzmann) or the Kac ring model these may be reduced to their initial conditions, in which case P makes the particles i.i.d. at t=0. In the (stochastic) Ehrenfest urn model, on the other hand, the importance of trajectories as the decisive random objects comes out more clearly. We consider each of these models from this point of view, including a conceptual analysis of the recent (post-Lanford) microscopic derivation of the full Boltzmann equation for long times. We also show to which extent algorithmic randomness is stronger than necessary for the derivation of Boltzmann-like equations, in giving rise to an infinite number of other macroscopic properties. In the light of Chaitin's incompleteness theorems for algorithmic randomness, the price for this scenario is the impossibility of explicitly displaying algorithmically random microscopic trajectories.</description>

      <title>Second-species dynamics in the restricted planar circular three body problem: chaos, final motions and periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the Restricted Planar Circular Three Body Problem (RPC3BP), which models the motion of a massless particle (Asteroid) under the gravitational influence of two massive bodies (the primaries) moving on circular orbits. By considering the ratio between the masses of the primaries to be arbitrarily small, we construct orbits with close encounters with the smaller primary (Jupiter) that realize any combination of past and future final motions (in the sense of Chazy's), including oscillatory motions. We also obtain arbitrarily large ejection-collision orbits with Jupiter and ejection-collision orbits between the two primaries (Sun and Jupiter), as well as arbitrarily large periodic orbits that pass arbitrarily close to Jupiter. Our approach combines singular perturbation theory and Levi-Civita regularization near Jupiter, and McGehee regularization near infinity and near the Sun, together with a global analysis that leads to transverse intersections of invariant manifolds.</description>

      <title>On the Hartree-Fock phase diagram for the two-dimensional Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an analytical method for the construction of Hartree-Fock phase diagrams for the (fermion) Hubbard model and various generalizations thereof. Such phase diagrams are traditionally constructed numerically, but we argue that, by using asymptotic techniques, it is possible to obtain analytic formulas approximating the curves separating the different phases to very high accuracy. To illustrate the new method, we apply it to the two-dimensional Hubbard model on the square lattice at zero temperature. This yields formulas for the Hartree-Fock phase boundaries that agree with, but also improve on, earlier numerical results. In particular, our results provide the first rigorous proof of the existence of mixed phases in this model.</description>

Our estimate shows that the probability for the particle, starting in a convex set $X\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ at $t=0$, to reach a convex set $Y\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ at a time $t&gt;0$, is bounded by $e^{-2\delta}$ where $\delta$ is the distance from $Y$ to the section at time $t$ of the light cone generated by $X$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Brioschi-Halphen equation (BHE) is a second order complex differential equation obtained by a two step transformation of the Lam\'e equation. The Lam\'e equation is an equation in Astronomical physics used in the study of motion of planetary bodies. In this seminar, the radial part of the BHE for sufficiently large $r$ and the argument limit $2\pi$ is obtained. The asymptotic radial wave function associated with BHE is obtained in terms of canonical polynomials $\mathscr{P}_{n+1},$ and spherical function in $L^{2}(G,{\rm d}\mu), G=SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ using point canonical transformation and distributional solution in $\mathscr{C}_{c}^{\infty}(\Omega)$ using Fourier transform method are obtained.</description>

      <title>The mechanics of anisotropic active plates with applications to cell alignment on curved substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general continuum mechanics framework for active anisotropic plates within the F\"oppl-von K\'arm\'an limit, incorporating a preferential direction and inelastic active contractions in geometrically nonlinear plate theory. Through asymptotic expansion, we derive coupled equilibrium equations for plates with transversely isotropic and possibly inhomogeneous reinforcement undergoing spatially varying active contractions through their thickness. The framework highlights the coupling between material anisotropy and active deformations, with target curvatures that compete with imposed geometric constraints. To demonstrate its capabilities, we apply the model to curvature-induced cell alignment, where substrate geometry, cytoskeletal anisotropy, and contractility interact to determine orientation. For cylindrical substrates, the model predicts a supercritical bifurcation in preferred orientation, from perpendicular to parallel, through an oblique orientation governed by the ratio of active contractility to substrate curvature and modulated by material stiffness. For ellipsoidal geometries, we capture stable parallel, perpendicular, and oblique configurations depending on principal curvatures, whereas spherical substrates do not show preferred alignments. These predictions qualitatively reproduce experimental observations across cell types, explaining divergent behaviors between contractile epithelial cells and stiffer fibroblasts in a rigorous context. Beyond cellular mechanics, this framework applies broadly to thin fiber-reinforced active structures in soft robotics, morphogenesis, and tissue engineering.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics on Lie Groups: I. Noncommutative Fourier Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from square-integrable wave functions on a Lie group, we build an invertible Fourier transform mapping them on wave functions on the dual of the Lie algebra. This is a group-theoretic version of the map from position space to momentum space, with generally noncommuting momenta owing to the group structure. As a result, the multiplication of momentum-dependent functions involves star products, which makes the construction of noncommutative Fourier series much more involved than that of their commutative cousin. We show that our formalism provides an isometry of Hilbert spaces, and use it to derive a noncommutative Poisson summation formula for any compact Lie group. This is a key preliminary for the computation of Wigner functions and path integrals for quantum systems on group manifolds.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic preserving methods for the low mach limit in discrete velocity models approximating kinetic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a Lattice Boltzmann type discrete velocity model in the low Mach number scaling and develop a corresponding numerical scheme that remains uniformly valid across all regimes of the mean free path, from the kinetic to the hydrodynamic scale. The proposed framework ensures high order temporal accuracy through the use of Implicit Explicit Runge Kutta methods, which provide stability and efficiency in stiff regimes, while spatial resolution is enhanced by combining finite difference WENO reconstructions with high order central difference approximations. In the appropriate asymptotic limit, the scheme reduces to a high order finite difference formulation of the incompressible Navier Stokes equations, thereby guaranteeing physical consistency of the numerical approximation with the limit model. To corroborate the theoretical findings, a set of numerical experiments is performed on two dimensional benchmark problems, which confirm the accuracy, stability, and versatility of the method across different flow regimes.</description>

      <title>Entanglement cohomology for GHZ and W states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement cohomology assigns a graded cohomology ring to a multipartite pure state, providing homological invariants that are stable under local unitaries and characterize inequivalent patterns of entanglement. In this work we derive exact expressions for the dimensions of these cohomology groups in two canonical entanglement classes, generalized GHZ and W states on an arbitrary number of parties and local Hilbert space dimensions, thus proving conjectures of arXiv:1901.02011. Using the additional structure of the Hodge star and wedge product operations, we propose two new classes of local unitary invariants: the spectrum of the natural Laplacian acting on entanglement $k$-forms, and the intersection numbers obtained from wedge products of representatives for cohomology classes.

      <title>On the convoy of the ASEP speed process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the size of the convoy in the speed process in the multi-species asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP). Through a coupling argument, we obtain an exact formula for the expected convoy size by relating it to a combinatorial structure. We prove that the asymptotic expected convoy size is universal for all fixed jump rates $q \in [0,1)$. In the special case $q=0$, we upgrade this to full convergence in distribution. We further establish a critical scaling $q = 1 - \gamma/\sqrt{n}$ that yields a nontrivial limiting regime. Our analysis builds on Martin's construction of the convoy and makes use of an orthogonal-polynomial representation of random-walk transition probabilities.</description>

      <title>An introduction to monitored quantum systems and quantum trajectories: spectrum, typicality, and phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thanks to recent experimental advances in simulating and detecting quantum dynamics with high precision and controllability, our understanding of the physics of monitored quantum systems has considerably deepened over the past decades. In this article, we provide an introductory theoretical review on the basic formalisms governing open quantum dynamics under measurement, along with recent developments in their spectral and typical aspects. After reviewing quantum measurement theory, we introduce the concept of quantum trajectories, which are the conditional dynamics of monitored states shaped by a set of measurement outcomes. We then discuss the spectral properties of the dynamical map describing the evolution averaged over measurement outcomes. As has recently been recognized, these spectral features are intimately connected to whether quantum trajectories exhibit typical behaviors, such as the ergodicity and purification. Moreover, we introduce Lyapunov exponents of typical quantum trajectories and discuss how these quantities serve as indicators of measurement-induced phase transitions in monitored quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Stress analysis of dilute particle suspensions in non-Newtonian fluids with efficient evaluation in the weakly non-Newtonian limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a semi-analytical framework to compute the suspension stress in dilute particle-laden non-Newtonian fluids, separating Newtonian and non-Newtonian contributions. The ensemble-averaged stress includes both the particle-induced non-Newtonian stress (PINNS) and an interaction stresslet arising from surface tractions due to the non-Newtonian stress and its induced Newtonian flow. Using a generalized reciprocal theorem, we express this interaction stresslet entirely in terms of the non-Newtonian stress, for a general constitutive model. For weakly non-Newtonian fluids, a regular perturbation expansion combined with the method of characteristics yields all leading-order stress contributions from the Newtonian velocity field alone, avoiding the need to solve coupled partial differential equations. This generalizes the method of Koch et al. (Phys. Rev. Fluids 1, 013301 (2016)) beyond polymeric fluids to any weakly non-Newtonian medium driven by velocity and its gradients. We apply the method to two systems: (i) spheres suspended in a fluid of smaller spheroids, where the interaction stress becomes negative for sufficiently anisotropic shapes due to orientation misalignment of the spheroids; and (ii) suspensions in weakly anisotropic nematic liquid crystals. In the latter, assuming a uniform director field fixed by an external field, PINNS vanishes while interaction stresslets remain, either opposing or enhancing background anisotropic stress. These results demonstrate the utility of our framework in capturing first-order particle-microstructure interactions across a broad class of non-Newtonian fluids.</description>

      <title>An energy- and helicity-conserving enriched galerkin method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an enriched Galerkin (EG) method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations that conserves both kinetic energy and helicity in the inviscid limit without introducing any additional projection variables. The method employs an EG velocity space, which is the first-order continuous Galerkin space enriched with piecewise constants defined on mesh faces, together with piecewise-constant pressure. Two numerical schemes based on the rotational form of the convective term are proposed: a nonlinear scheme and a linear variant. Both schemes exactly preserve the discrete helicity and kinetic energy, and the Picard iteration maintains the conservation properties of the nonlinear scheme. We prove the conservation properties of both the methods, and establish stability and rigorous error estimates for the nonlinear scheme. Numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and conservation of the proposed linear scheme.</description>

      <title>Poisson structure on bi-graded spaces and Koszul duality, I. The classical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb R^{m|n}$ be the usual super space. It is known that the algebraic functions on $\mathbb R^{m|n}$ is a Koszul algebra, whose Koszul dual algebra, however, is not the set of functions on $\mathbb R^{n|m}$, due to the anti-commutativity of the corresponding variables. In this paper, we show that these two algebras are isomorphic to the algebraic functions of two $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$-graded spaces. We then study the Poisson structures of these two spaces, and show that the quadratic Poisson structures are preserved under Koszul duality. Based on it, we obtain two isomorphic differential calculus structures, and if furthermore the Poisson structures are unimodular, then the associated Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra structures that arise on the Poisson cohomologies of these two $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$-graded spaces are isomorphic as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Often it is possible to equip the space of all cone geodesics of a strongly convex cone structure with the structure of a smooth contact manifold. This generalizes the analogous notions for the space of light rays of a Lorentzian spacetime. After reviewing these constructions on the space of cone geodesics, with a focus on the natural contact structure, we establish a correspondence between positive paths of contactomorphisms in spherical cotangent bundles and certain globally hyperbolic cone structures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometric Tensor in the Wild: Resolving Stokes Phenomena via Floquet-Monodromy Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard topological invariants, such as the Chern number and Berry phase, form the bedrock of modern quantum matter classification. However, we demonstrate that this framework undergoes a \textbf{catastrophic failure} in the presence of essential singularities -- ubiquitous in open, driven, and non-Hermitian systems ("Wild" regime). In these settings, the local geometric tensor diverges, rendering standard invariants ill-defined and causing perturbative predictions to deviate from reality by order unity ($\sim 100\%$). We resolve this crisis by introducing the \textbf{Floquet-Monodromy Spectroscopy (FMS)} protocol, a pulse-level control sequence, which experimentally extracts the hidden \textit{Stokes Phenomenon} -- the "missing" geometric data that completes the topological description. By mapping the singularity's Stokes multipliers to time-domain observables, FMS provides a rigorous experimental bridge to \textbf{Resurgence Theory}, allowing for the exact reconstruction of non-perturbative physics from divergent asymptotic series. We validate this framework on a superconducting qudit model, demonstrating that the "Stokes Invariant" serves as the next-generation quantum number for classifying phases of matter beyond the reach of conventional topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the teleparallel Robertson--Walker (TRW) $F(T)$-gravity solutions for a cosmological electromagnetic source in the current paper. We use and solve the TRW $F(T)$-gravity field equations (FEs) for each value of the $k$-parameter $(-1,\,0,\,+1)$ and the electromagnetic equivalent of the equation of state (EoS), leading to new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. For the $k=0$ cosmological case, we find new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions for any scale factor $n$. For $k=\pm 1$ cosmological cases, we find exact and far-future approximated new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions for slow, linear, fast and infinitely fast universe expansion summarized by analytical functions. All the new solutions are relevant for future cosmological applications, implying any electromagnetic source processes, such as the cosmological plasma models.</description>

      <title>Field-Space Attention for Structure-Preserving Earth System Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and physically consistent modeling of Earth system dynamics requires machine-learning architectures that operate directly on continuous geophysical fields and preserve their underlying geometric structure. Here we introduce Field-Space attention, a mechanism for Earth system Transformers that computes attention in the physical domain rather than in a learned latent space. By maintaining all intermediate representations as continuous fields on the sphere, the architecture enables interpretable internal states and facilitates the enforcement of scientific constraints. The model employs a fixed, non-learned multiscale decomposition and learns structure-preserving deformations of the input field, allowing coherent integration of coarse and fine-scale information while avoiding the optimization instabilities characteristic of standard single-scale Vision Transformers. Applied to global temperature super-resolution on a HEALPix grid, Field-Space Transformers converge more rapidly and stably than conventional Vision Transformers and U-Net baselines, while requiring substantially fewer parameters. The explicit preservation of field structure throughout the network allows physical and statistical priors to be embedded directly into the architecture, yielding improved fidelity and reliability in data-driven Earth system modeling. These results position Field-Space Attention as a compact, interpretable, and physically grounded building block for next-generation Earth system prediction and generative modeling frameworks.</description>

      <title>From the planar Ising model to quasiconformal mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify the scaling limit of full-plane Kadanoff-Ceva fermions on generic, non-degenerate $s$-embeddings. In this broad setting, the scaling limits are described in terms of solutions to conjugate Beltrami equations with prescribed singularities. For the underlying Ising model, this leads to the scaling limit of the energy-energy correlations and reveals a connection between the scaling limits of (near-)critical planar Ising models and quasiconformal mappings. For grids approximating bounded domains in the complex plane, we establish, in the scaling regime, the conformal covariance of the energy density on critical doubly periodic graphs. We complement this result with an analogous statement in the case where the limiting conformal structure generates a maximal surface $(z,\vartheta)$ in Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{(2,1)}$. All scaling factors obtained are local and expressed in terms of the geometry of the embedding, even in situations where they vary drastically from one region to another.
  These results confirm the predictions of Chelkak and highlight that the scaling limits of generic (near-)critical Ising models naturally live on a substantially richer conformal structure than the classical Euclidean one.</description>

      <title>Topological resolution of conical intersection seams and the coupled cluster bifurcation via mixed Hodge modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rigorous description of Conical Intersections (CIs) remains the central challenge of non-adiabatic quantum chemistry. While the ``Yarkony Seam'' -- the $(3N-8)$-dimensional manifold of degeneracy -- is well-understood geometrically, its accurate characterization by high-level electronic structure methods is plagued by numerical instabilities. Specifically, standard Coupled Cluster (CC) theory suffers from root bifurcations near Ground State CIs, rendering the ``Gold Standard'' of chemistry inapplicable where it is needed most. Here, we present \textbf{QuMorpheus}, an open-source computational package that resolves these singularities by implementing a topological framework based on Dissipative Mixed Hodge Modules (DMHM) [P. Saurabh, arXiv:2512.19487 (2025)]. By algorithmically mapping the CC polynomial equations to a spectral sheaf, we compute the exact Monodromy ($\mu$) invariants of the intersection. We demonstrate that this automated algebraic geometry approach correctly identifies the physical ground state topology in the K\"{o}hn-Tajti model and resolves the intersection seams of realistic chemical systems, including Ethylene and the Chloronium ion ($\mathrm{H_2Cl^+}$). Furthermore, we apply QuMorpheus to the photoisomerization of Previtamin D, proving that the experimentally observed Woodward-Hoffmann selection rules are a direct consequence of a topological ``Monodromy Wall'' ($\mu=1, \gamma=\pi$) rather than purely energetic barriers. This establishes a general software solution to the ``Yarkony Problem,'' enabling the robust, automated mapping of global intersection seams in complex molecular systems. The topological stability of these intersections allows for the control protocols discussed in Ref.[P. Saurabh, Submitted to Phys. Rev. X (2025)].</description>

Abstract: We study the push-forward of Hopf--Galois extensions as the algebraic counterpart of the pullback of principal bundles. We apply the theory of twisted tensor product algebras to endow covariant extensions of modules along a map $\mathsf{F}$ with an algebra structure, under compatibility conditions between $\mathsf{F}$ and the twisting map. The push-forward of an $H$-Galois extension $B \subset A$ along a map $\mathsf{F} : B \to C$ is an $H$-Galois extension of $C$. The corresponding Ehresmann--Schauenburg algebroids are compared.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study Laplacians on a finite metric graph endowed with generalized densities, that is, measures of finite mass. One important motivation is that this setting provides a common framework for several interesting classes of operators: discrete graph Laplacians, Kirchhoff Laplacians and Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators on graphs. Our main interest lies in spectral optimization with respect to the underlying measure. In contrast to the setting of domains and manifolds, we prove that a minimal $k$-th eigenvalue exists, whereas the corresponding maximization problem has no meaning. We then establish connections between these optimal eigenvalues and the geometry of the metric graph, including a transparent geometric characterization of the first optimal eigenvalue via the resistance metric, and a Weyl law for the higher optimal eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Macroscopically distinguishable superposition in infinitely many degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the concept of macroscopically distinguishable superpositions within an infinite array of boson sites. Our approach is rigorous within the frame of Hilbert space theory. In this context, it is natural to differentiate between states -- and corresponding dynamics -- that involve only finitely many degrees of freedom, referred to as local, and those that are inherently nonlocal. Previous studies have shown that such systems can support nonlocal coherent states (NCS). In this work, we demonstrate that NCS can dynamically evolve into nonlocal cat states under the influence of a nonlocal Hamiltonian -- specifically, the square of the total number operator. Crucially, the resulting dynamics cannot be decomposed into local factors. Furthermore, we explore broader mathematical implications of these phenomena within the framework of generalized bosons. Our findings highlight that the concepts of coherent states and nonlocal cat states are not inherently bound together; rather, their fusion is a distinctive feature of standard bosons. Finally, we propose that if the generalized boson framework can be physically realized in engineered quantum systems, the phenomena described here may hold significant relevance for both physics and materials science.</description>

      <title>Uniform spanning trees and random matrix statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a uniform spanning tree in a $\delta$-square grid approximation of a planar domain $\Omega$. For given integer $n\ge 2$, we condition the tree on the following $n$-arm event: we pick $n$ branches, emanating from $n$ points microscopically close to a given interior point, and condition them to connect to the boundary $\partial \Omega$ without intersecting. What can be said about the geometry of these branches?
  We derive an exact formula for the characteristic function of the total winding of the branches. A surprising consequence of this formula is that in the scaling limit, the behaviour of this function depends on the total number of branches $n$ only through its parity.
  We also describe the scaling limit of the branches. If $\Omega $ is the unit disc, then they hit the boundary (i.e., the unit circle) at random positions which coincide exactly with the eigenvalues of a random matrix of size $n$ drawn from the Circular Orthogonal Ensemble (COE, also called C$\beta$E with $\beta =1$). Furthermore, the branches converge to Loewner evolution driven by the circular Dyson Brownian motion with parameter $\beta = 4$ (i.e., $n$-sided radial SLE$_\kappa$ with $\kappa=2$). We thus verify a prediction made by Cardy in this setting.
  Along the way, we develop a flow-line (imaginary geometry) coupling of $n$-sided radial SLE$_\kappa$ with the Gaussian free field, which may be of independent interest. Surprisingly, we find that the variance of the corresponding field near the singularity also does not depend on the number $n\ge 2$ of curves. In contrast, the variance of the the winding of the curves behaves as $\kappa/n^2$, which agrees with the predictions from the physics literature made by Wieland and Wilson numerically, and by Duplantier and Binder using Coulomb gas methods -- but disagrees with a result of Kenyon.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gates from Wolfram Model Multiway Rewriting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how representations of finite-dimensional quantum operators can be constructed using nondeterministic rewriting systems. In particular, we investigate Wolfram model multiway rewriting systems based on string substitutions. Multiway systems were proposed by S. Wolfram as generic model systems for multicomputational processes, emphasizing their significance as a foundation for modeling complexity, nondeterminism, and branching structures of measurement outcomes. Here, we investigate a specific class of multiway systems based on cyclic character strings with a neighborhood constraint - the latter called Leibnizian strings. We show that such strings exhibit a Fermi-Dirac distribution for expectation values of occupation numbers of character neighborhoods. A Leibnizian string serves as an abstraction of a $N$-fermion system. A multiway system of these strings encodes causal relations between rewriting events in a nondeterministic manner. The collection of character strings realizes a $\mathbb{Z}$-module with a symmetric $\mathbb{Z}$-bilinear form. For discrete spaces, this generalizes the notion of an inner product over a vector field. This admits a discrete analogue of the path integral and a $S$-matrix for multiway systems of Leibnizian strings. The elements of this $S$-matrix yield transition amplitudes between states of the multiway system based on an action defined over a sequence of Leibnizian strings. We then show that these $S$-matrices give explicit representations of quantum gates for qubits and qudits, and also circuits composed of such gates. We find that, as formal models of nondeterministic computation, rewriting systems of Leibnizian strings with causal structure encode representations of the CNOT, $\pi/8$, and Hadamard gates. Hence, using multiway systems one can represent quantum circuits for qubits.</description>

Abstract: We analyse the symmetries of tensionless and tensile branes moving in a target space with a possibly degenerate metric, with the worldvolume metric remaining nondegenerate. We recover known results about symmetries of strings and branes as well as new results in the tensionless and degenerate-metric cases.

      <description>arXiv:2512.20593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Airy wanderer line ensembles are infinite-parameter generalizations of the classical Airy line ensemble that arise naturally as scaling limits of inhomogeneous (spiked) models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. In this paper, we establish several structural properties of these ensembles. Our results show their laws depend continuously on the parameters, which encode the asymptotic slopes of the ensemble's curves near positive and negative infinity. We further prove that these ensembles admit multiple monotone couplings with respect to their parameters. Finally, we show that the Airy wanderer line ensembles are extreme points in the space of all Brownian Gibbsian line ensembles on the real line.</description>

      <title>Random Stinespring superchannel: converting channel queries into dilation isometry queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently introduced random purification channel, which converts $n$ copies of an arbitrary mixed quantum state into $n$ copies of the same uniformly random purification, has emerged as a powerful tool in quantum information theory. Motivated by this development, we introduce a channel-level analogue, which we call the random Stinespring superchannel. This consists in a procedure to transform $n$ parallel queries of an arbitrary quantum channel into $n$ parallel queries of the same uniformly random Stinespring isometry, via universal encoding and decoding operations that are efficiently implementable. When the channel is promised to have Choi rank at most $r$, the procedure can be tailored to yield a Stinespring environment of dimension $r$. As a consequence, quantum channel learning reduces to isometry learning, yielding a simple channel learning algorithm, based on existing isometry learning protocols, that matches the performance of the two recently proposed channel tomography algorithms. Complementarily, whereas the optimality of these algorithms had previously been established only up to a logarithmic factor in the dimension, we close this gap by removing this logarithmic factor from the lower bound. Taken together, our results fully establish the optimality of these recently introduced channel learning algorithms, showing that the optimal query complexity of learning a quantum channel with input dimension $d_A$, output dimension $d_B$, and Choi rank $r$ is $\Theta(d_A d_B r)$.</description>

      <title>Equations of motion for dynamical systems with angular momentum on Finsler geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article aims to derive equations of motion for dynamical systems with angular momentum on Finsler geometries. To this end, we apply Souriau's Principle of General Covariance, which is a geometrical framework to derive diffeomorphism invariant equations of motion. The equations we obtain are the generalization of that of Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) on Finsler geometries, and we give their conserved quantities which turn out to be formally identical to the Riemannian case.
  These equations share the same properties as the MPD equations, and we mention different choices possible for supplementary conditions to close this system of equations. These equations have an additional requirement, which is the choice of what defines the tangent direction of the Finsler manifold, since the velocity and momentum are not parallel in general. After choosing the momentum as the Finsler direction and to define the center of mass, we give the complete equations of motion in 3 spatial dimensions, which we find coincide to previously known equations for Finsler spinoptics, and novel equations in 4 dimensions for massive and massless dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Finsler geometry in anisotropic superconductivity: a Ginzburg-Landau approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19720v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a rigorous generalization of the classical Ginzburg--Landau model to smooth, compact Finsler manifolds without boundary. This framework provides a natural analytic setting for describing anisotropic superconductivity within Finsler geometry. The model is constructed via the Finsler--Laplacian, defined through the Legendre transform associated with the fundamental function F, and by employing canonical Finsler measures such as the Busemann--Hausdorff and Holmes--Thompson volume forms. We introduce an anisotropic Ginzburg--Landau functional for complex scalar fields coupled to gauge potentials and establish the existence of minimizers in the appropriate Finsler--Sobolev spaces by the direct method in the calculus of variations. Furthermore, we analyze the asymptotic regime as the Ginzburg--Landau parameter epsilon to 0 and prove a precise Gamma--convergence result: the rescaled energies converge to the Finslerian length functional associated with the limiting vortex filaments. In particular, the limiting vortex energy is shown to equal $\pi$ times the Finslerian length of the corresponding current, thereby extending the classical Bethuel--Brezis--He'lein result to anisotropic settings. These findings demonstrate that Finsler geometry unifies metric anisotropy and variational principles in gauge-field models, broadening the geometric scope of the Ginzburg--Landau theory beyond the Riemannian framework.</description>

      <title>Enumerative geometry via the moduli space of super Riemann surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2005.04378v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we relate volumes of moduli spaces of super Riemann surfaces to integrals over the moduli space of stable Riemann surfaces $\overline{\cal M}_{g,n}$. This allows us to prove via algebraic geometry a recursion between the volumes of moduli spaces of super hyperbolic surfaces previously proven via super geometry techniques by Stanford and Witten. The recursion between the volumes of moduli spaces of super hyperbolic surfaces is proven to be equivalent to the fact that a generating function for the intersection numbers of a natural collection of cohomology classes $\Theta_{g,n}$ with tautological classes on $\overline{\cal M}_{g,n}$ is a KdV tau function. This is analogous to Mirzakhani's proof of the Kontsevich-Witten theorem regarding a generating function for the intersection numbers of tautological classes on $\overline{\cal M}_{g,n}$ using volumes of moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Boundary Toda Conformal Field Theory from the path integral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Toda Conformal Field Theories (CFTs hereafter) are generalizations of Liouville CFT where the underlying field is no longer scalar but takes values in a finite-dimensional vector space induced by a complex simple Lie algebra. The goal of this document is to provide a probabilistic construction of such models on all compact hyperbolic Riemann surfaces with or without boundary. To do so, we rely on a probabilistic framework based on Gaussian Free Fields and Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos.
  In the presence of a boundary, one major difference with Liouville CFT is the existence of non-trivial outer automorphisms of the underlying Lie algebra. The main novelty of our construction is to associate to such an outer automorphism a type of boundary conditions for the field of the theory, leading to the definition of two different classes of models, with either Neumann or Cardy boundary conditions. This in turn has implications on the algebra of symmetry of the models, which are given by $W$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Approach to Hyperuniformity in the One-Dimensional Facilitated Exclusion Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the one-dimensional Facilitated Exclusion Process with initial state a product measure of density $\rho=1/2-\delta$, $\delta\ge0$, there exists an infinite-time limiting state $\nu_\rho$ in which all particles are isolated and hence cannot move. We study the variance $V(L)$, under $\nu_\rho$, of the number of particles in an interval of $L$ sites. Under $\nu_{1/2}$ either all odd or all even sites are occupied, so that $V(L)=0$ for $L$ even and $V(L)=1/4$ for $L$ odd: the state is hyperuniform, since $V(L)$ grows more slowly than $L$. We prove that for densities approaching 1/2 from below there exist three regimes in $L$, in which the variance grows at different rates: for $L\gg\delta^{-2}$, $V(L)\simeq\rho(1-\rho)L$, just as in the initial state; for $A(\delta)\ll L\ll\delta^{-2}$, with $A(\delta)=\delta^{-2/3}$ for $L$ odd and $A(\delta)=1$ for $L$ even, $V(L)\simeq CL^{3/2}$ with $C=2\sqrt{2/\pi}/3$; and for $L\ll\delta^{-2/3}$ with $L$ odd, $V(L)\simeq1/4$. The analysis is based on a careful study of a renewal process with a long tail. Our study is motivated by simulation results showing similar behavior in higher dimensions; we discuss this background briefly.</description>

Abstract: We formulate a family of algebras, twisted Yangians (of simply-laced quasi-split type) in Drinfeld type current generators and defining relations. These new algebras admit PBW type bases and are shown to be a deformation of twisted current algebras. For all quasi-split type excluding the even rank case in type AIII, we show that the twisted Yangians can be realized via a degeneration on the Drinfeld type presentation of affine $\imath$quantum groups. For both even and odd rank cases in type AIII, we use the Gauss decomposition method to show that these new algebras are isomorphic to Molev-Ragoucy's reflection algebras defined in the R-matrix presentation.</description>

Abstract: We explore and extend the application of homological algebra to describe quantum entanglement, initiated in arXiv:1901.02011, focusing on the Hodge-theoretic structure of entanglement cohomology in finite-dimensional quantum systems. We construct analogues of the Hodge star operator, inner product, codifferential, and Laplacian for entanglement $k$-forms. We also prove that such $k$-forms obey versions of the Hodge isomorphism theorem and Hodge decomposition, and that they exhibit Hodge duality. As a corollary, we conclude that the dimensions of the $k$-th and $(n-k)$-th cohomologies coincide for entanglement in $n$-partite pure states, which explains a symmetry property ("Poincare duality") of the associated Poincare polynomials.</description>

      <title>Bethe algebras for unitarizable modules over classical Lie (super)algebras and a duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{g}$ denote the classical Lie algebra $\mathfrak{gl}_d$, $\mathfrak{sp}_{2d}$, or $\mathfrak{so}_{2d}$ with a fixed $*$-structure $\sigma$. Let $M_1, \ldots, M_\ell$ be unitarizable $\mathfrak{g}$-modules (with respect to $\sigma$), and let ${\bf z}=(z_1, \ldots, z_\ell) \in \mathbb{C}^\ell$. We investigate the action of the Bethe algebra $\mathcal{B}_{\mathfrak{g}}^\mu$ for $\mathfrak{g}$ with respect to $\mu \in \mathfrak{g}^*$ on the tensor product $\underline{M}({\bf z}):=M_1(z_1) \otimes \cdots \otimes M_\ell(z_\ell)$ of evaluation $\mathfrak{g}[t]$-modules. We show that if $\mu \circ \sigma$ equals the complex conjugation of $\mu$, then $\mathcal{B}_{\mathfrak{g}}^\mu$ is diagonalizable on any finite-dimensional $\mathcal{B}_{\mathfrak{g}}^\mu$-submodule of $\underline{M}({\bf z})$ for ${\bf z} \in \mathbb{R}^\ell$. This, together with the result derived from the duality of Bethe algebras (see below), suggests that a simple spectrum conjecture for $\mathcal{B}_{\mathfrak{g}}^\mu$ should hold.
  We establish a duality of Bethe algebras for the general linear Lie (super)algebras $\mathfrak{gl}_d$ and $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n}$. As an application, we show that under a generic condition, the Bethe algebra for $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n}$ with respect to ${\bf z} \in \mathbb{C}^{p+q+m+n}$ is diagonalizable with a simple spectrum on any weight space of $L_1(w_1) \otimes \cdots \otimes L_d(w_d)$, where the $L_i$ are (infinite-dimensional) unitarizable highest weight $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n}$-modules corresponding to generalized partitions of depth 1, and $w_1, \ldots, w_d \in \mathbb{C}$. We also obtain the corresponding result for $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m}$ by setting $q=n=0$.</description>

      <title>Implementation and representation of qudit multi-controlled unitaries and hypergraph states by N-body angular momentum couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a representation of qudit multi-controlled unitary operators in terms of N-body angular momentum interactions. The representation is particularly convenient for odd-dimensional systems, with interesting connections to the Pegg-Barnett phase formalism. We illustrate the main points in the special case of qutrits, where simplifications and connections to dipole-quadrupole and quadrupole-quadrupole interactions can be established. We describe the representation of the closely related set of qudit hypergraph states, identifying possible realizations and their main obstacles. Qutrit tripartite controlled unitaries are decomposed in terms of more familiar two-body angular momentum couplings, enabling their implementation in a variety of physical systems. We give then a concrete example of implementation of qutrit unitaries and hypergraph states in optical systems that employs single-photon sources, two-mode cross-Kerr interactions and linear optical operations. Moreover, we define a new set of states, called angular momentum hypergraph states, which are more directly related to the angular momentum representation.</description>

      <title>A Thermodynamically Consistent Free Boundary Model for Two-Phase Flows in an Evolving Domain with Bulk-Surface Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a thermodynamically consistent model, which describes the time evolution of a two-phase flow in an evolving domain. The movement of the free boundary of the domain is driven by the velocity field of the mixture in the bulk, which is determined by a Navier--Stokes equation. In order to take interactions between bulk and boundary into account, we further consider two materials on the boundary, which may be the same or different materials as those in the bulk. The bulk and the surface materials are represented by respective phase-fields, whose time evolution is described by a bulk-surface convective Cahn--Hilliard equation. This approach allows for a transfer of material between bulk and surface as well as variable contact angles between the diffuse interface in the bulk and the boundary of the domain. To provide a more accurate description of the corresponding contact line motion, we include a generalized Navier slip boundary condition on the velocity field. We derive our model from scratch by considering local mass balance and energy dissipation laws. Finally, the derivation is completed via the Langrange multiplier approach. We further show that our model generalizes previous models from the literature, which can be recovered from our system by either dropping the dynamic boundary conditions or assuming a static boundary of the domain.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates with Rabi frequency (I): The De Giorgi conjecture for the local problem in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this series of papers, we investigate coupled systems arising in the study of two-component Bose--Einstein condensates, and we establish classification results for solutions of De Giorgi conjecture type. In the first paper of the series, we focus on the local problem of the form $\Delta u = u(u^2+v^2-1) + v(\alpha uv - \omega)$, $\Delta v = v(u^2+v^2-1) + u(\alpha uv - \omega)$, and prove that positive global solutions in $\mathbb{R}^3$ satisfying $\partial u/\partial x_3 &gt; 0 &gt; \partial v/\partial x_3$ must be one-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Covariance of Scattering Amplitudes from Counting Carefully</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Invariance of on-shell scattering amplitudes under field redefinitions is a well known property in field theory that corresponds to covariance of on-shell amputated connected functions. In recent years there have been great efforts to define a formalism in which the covariance is manifest at all stages of calculation, mainly resorting to geometrical interpretations. In this work covariance is analysed using combinatorial methods relying only on the properties of the tree level effective action, without referring to specific formulations of the Lagrangian. We provide an explicit proof of covariance of on-shell connected functions and of the existence of covariant Feynman rules and we derive an explicitly covariant closed formula for tree level on-shell connected functions with any number of external legs.</description>

      <title>Generalizing quantum dimensions: Symmetry-based classification of local pseudo-Hermitian systems and the corresponding domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study conformal field theories (CFTs) and their classifications from a modern perspective based on the abstract algebraic formalism of symmetries or conserved charges, known as symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs). By studying the algebraic structure of the SymTFTs in detail, we found a natural generalization of the quantum dimensions associated with (pseudo-)Hermitian systems and (non)-unitary CFTs. These generalized data of SymTFTs provide classifications of massless and massive renormalization group flows, which will describe the quantum phase transitions of the corresponding pseudo-Hermitian systems. Moreover, our discussions straightforwardly enable one to relate a general class of coset constructions or level-rank dualities to domain wall problems between topological quantum field theories (or a series of corresponding quantum phase transitions related to the Higgs mechanism). Our work provides a systematic reduction and classification of algebraic data, symmetries, for pseudo-Hermitian systems based on ideas from established mathematical fields, linear algebra and ring theory.</description>

      <title>Bright and dark breathers on an elliptic wave in the defocusing mKdV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Breathers on an elliptic wave background consist of nonlinear superpositions of a soliton and a periodic wave, both traveling with different wave speeds and interacting periodically in the space-time. For the defocusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation, the construction of general breathers has been an open problem since the elliptic wave is related to the elliptic degeneration of the hyperelliptic solutions of genus two. We have found the new representation of eigenfunctions of the Lax operator associated with the elliptic wave, which enables us to solve this open problem and to construct two families of breathers with bright (elevation) and dark (depression) profiles.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Quantum Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the traditional ways of introducing bosons and fermions is through creation-annihilation algebras. Historically, these have been associated with emission and absorption processes at the quantum level and are characteristic of the language of second quantization. In this work, we formulate the transition from first to second quantization by taking quotients of the state spaces of distinguishable particles, so that the resulting equivalence classes identify states that contain no information capable of distinguishing between particles, thereby generalising the usual symmetrisation procedure. Assuming that the resulting indistinguishable-particle space (i) admits an ordered basis compatible with how an observer may label the accessible modes, (ii) is invariant under unitary transformations of those modes, and (iii) supports particle counting as a mode-wise local operation, we derive a new class of creation-annihilation algebras. These algebras reproduce the partition functions of transtatistics, the maximal generalisations of bosons and fermions consistent with these operational principles.</description>

      <title>Continuum canonical purifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and characterize canonical purifications for general algebraic states, extending prior constructions by Woronowicz and by Dutta/Faulkner to general quantum theories. Given a state on a $*$-algebra, the canonical purification is a state on a "doubled" algebra that admits an interpretation in terms of CRT reflection. This interpretation holds for all quantum theories, even in the absence of gravity. We then identify conditions under which canonical purifications are "pure" in the technical sense, compute their modular conjugations, and relate them to GNS and natural-cone purifications in certain settings. In an appendix, we develop a general theory of von Neumann algebras generated by unbounded $*$-algebras. In a forthcoming paper with Caminiti and Capeccia, we provide an application of this general theory to the problem of excitability in quantum field theory.</description>
