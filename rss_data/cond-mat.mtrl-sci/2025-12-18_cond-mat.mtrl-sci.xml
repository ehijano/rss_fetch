      <title>On the relation between microstructure and impact toughness of 17-4__PH stainless steel produced by powder bed fusion laser beam (PBF-LB)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigated the effects of aging heat treatments on the microstructure and, consequently, the quasi-static (tensile properties) and dynamic (impact toughness) mechanical behaviour of a 17-4 PH stainless steel produced by powder bed fusion laser beam (PBF-LB). Multiscale microstructural characterization, using X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction, was conducted to establish quantitative correlations between microstructural evolution and mechanical performance, providing insight into the mechanisms governing plasticity and fracture. The PBF-LB specimens exhibited tensile strengths comparable to or exceeding those of conventionally manufactured counterparts but consistently showed significantly lower impact toughness, regardless of heat treatment conditions. Within the complex microstructure, strain-induced transformation of reversed austenite was found to enhance ductility and impact toughness. SiO2 inclusions, originating from the starting powder, were identified as nucleation sites for micro-cavities and proved detrimental to impact toughness. Meanwhile, the distribution of Cu-rich nanoprecipitates could be tailored to favour either tensile strength through Orowan strengthening or impact toughness by enhancing local plasticity, but not both simultaneously. This work highlights the pronounced strength-toughness trade-off inherent in PBF-LB-produced 17-4 PH alloys and reveals the interplay between strength, ductility, and toughness. These findings underscore the need for further research into dynamic loading mechanical properties, especially for demanding applications such as those in the nuclear sector.</description>

      <title>Be and Be-related impurities in diamond: density functional theory study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principles density functional simulations were employed to investigate the geometries, electrical properties, and hyperfine structures of various beryllium-doped diamond configurations, including interstitial (Be$_i$), substitutional (Be$_s$), and beryllium-nitrogen (Be-N) complexes. The incorporation of Be into the diamond lattice is more favorable as a substitutional dopant than as an interstitial dopant, although both processes are endothermic. Interstitial Be could potentially exhibit motional averaging from planar to axial symmetry with an activation energy of 0.1 eV. The most stable Be$_s$ configuration has $T_{d}$ symmetry with a spin state of $S=1$. Co-doping with nitrogen reduces the formation energy of Be$_s$-N$_{n}$ $(n=1-4)$ complexes, which further decreases as the number of nitrogen atoms increases. This is attributed to the smaller covalent radius of nitrogen compared to carbon, resulting in reduced lattice distortion. Be$_s$-N$_3$ and Be$_s$-N$_4$ co-doping introduces shallow donors, while Be$_s$ exhibits $n$-type semiconductivity, but the deep donor level renders it impractical for room-temperature applications. These findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of beryllium as a dopant in diamond and highlight the potential of beryllium-nitrogen co-doping for achieving $n$-type diamond semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Investigation of density of states and charge carrier mobility in amorphous semiconductors via time-of-flight photocurrent analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study examines the electronic transport characteristics of amorphous semiconductors through TOF measurements and numerical simulations. The primary objective is to determine the DOS in amorphous selenium (a-Se) and to assess the temperature and electric field dependence of the hole mobility. A comprehensive investigation of localized states within the mobility gap is performed using Laplace transform analysis of ToF photocurrent transients, combined with the multiple trapping model. This approach enables accurate reconstruction of the DOS across a wide temperature range, allowing clear identification of shallow and deep trap levels and revealing thermally activated transport mechanisms. Simulated ToF currents are also used to evaluate the hole drift mobility under various thermal and field conditions. Activation energies are extracted from Arrhenius plots of the mobility data. The results support a physically consistent description of the electronic structure in a-Se and validate the applicability of Laplace-based techniques for probing charge transport in disordered semiconductors.</description>

      <title>A computational study of thermoelectric conversion in the PbSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$ semiconductor alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present theoretical study focuses on the structural, electronic and thermoelectric properties of PbTe, PbSe and their ternary alloys PbSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$, using the density functional theory (DFT) by the full potential linearised augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method implemented in Wien2k code. Structural properties were performed by using the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew Burke and Ernzenhof (GGA-PBE) scheme. The results show that the calculated lattice parameters are in good agreement with theoretical data previously obtained. For electronic properties, we noticed that for all the compounds of PbSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$, we have a direct band gap in L point. For thermoelectric properties, we used BoltzTraP2 code and Gibbs2 code. Our results show that the PbSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$ compounds have reached a value of 2.55 for the figure of merit, which indicates that our material is a good thermoelectric candidate.</description>

      <title>Kagome Topology in Two-Dimensional Noble-Metal Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) metallic lattices with kagome topology provide a unique platform for exploring the interplay between geometric frustration, reduced coordination, and lattice stability in elemental systems. Motivated by the recent experimental realization of atomically thin gold layers and kagome goldene, we present a first-principles investigation of free-standing kagome monolayers of Cu, Ag, and Au. Using density functional theory combined with lattice dynamics and ab initio molecular dynamics, we systematically assess their structural, mechanical, dynamical, and thermal stability. All kagome monolayers satisfy the 2D Born criteria and exhibit relatively low in-plane stiffness compared to graphene and hexagonal goldene, reflecting the porous nature of the kagome lattice and its metallic bonding. Among the three systems, the Au-based lattice displays the highest in-plane Young's modulus. Phonon calculations reveal that the unstrained kagome phase is dynamically unstable for all metals. However, a moderate biaxial tensile strain of 5% stabilizes the Ag and Au monolayers, while Cu retains residual unstable modes. Finite-temperature simulations further show that Cu rapidly reconstructs toward a trigonal lattice, Ag remains metastable at low temperature but collapses at room temperature, and Au exhibits competing kagome and trigonal motifs at 300 K, indicating near-degeneracy between these phases. These results establish that strain engineering and atomic size are key determinants of the stability of metallic kagome monolayers and provide guidance for future substrate-supported realizations.</description>

      <title>Quadrene: A Novel Quasi-2D Carbon Allotrope with High Carrier Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of a novel carbon allotrope characterized by quasi-tetragonal atomic motifs and quasi-two-dimensional structural behavior. Structural analysis reveals an open framework composed of alternating diamond-like and square units, while thermodynamic assessments indicate a negative formation energy, suggesting high intrinsic stability. Phonon spectra confirm dynamical robustness, and \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations at 1000~K validate its thermal resilience. Furthermore, the system exhibits an indirect bandgap of 1.58 eV at the HSE06 level, anisotropic mechanical behavior, and a broadband optical response, reinforcing its potential for nanoelectronic and optoelectronic applications. The highly anisotropic mechanical behavior is characterized by an in-plane Young's modulus ranging from 80 to 550 GPa, depending on crystallographic direction. Additionally, the electronic transport properties exhibit pronounced anisotropy, with hole mobilities reaching up to 5.83 x 10^6 cm^2/V . s and electron mobilities up to 6.40 x 10^6 cm^2/V . s along different crystallographic directions, highlighting the material's potential for directionally selective nanoelectronic device applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient Nudged Elastic Band Method using Neural Network Bayesian Algorithm Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of a minimum energy pathway (MEP) between metastable states is crucial for scientific tasks including catalyst and biomolecular design. However, the standard nudged elastic band (NEB) algorithm requires hundreds to tens of thousands of compute-intensive simulations, making applications to complex systems prohibitively expensive. We introduce Neural Network Bayesian Algorithm Execution (NN-BAX), a framework that jointly learns the energy landscape and the MEP. NN-BAX sequentially fine-tunes a foundation model by actively selecting samples targeted at improving the MEP. Tested on Lennard-Jones and Embedded Atom Method systems, our approach achieves a one to two order of magnitude reduction in energy and force evaluations with negligible loss in MEP accuracy and demonstrates scalability to &gt;100-dimensional systems. This work is therefore a promising step towards removing the computational barrier for MEP discovery in scientifically relevant systems, suggesting that weeks-long calculations may be achieved in hours or days with minimal loss in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Dependence of Radiation Induced Segregation of Cr on Sink Dimensionality and Morphology in Fe-Cr Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation-induced segregation (RIS) and chemical redistribution in structural alloys can significantly degrade material performance, ultimately leading to failure. In this study, building on previous work by the authors [1], we investigate how the dimensional characteristics of sinks influence solute concentration distributions and segregation behavior. Specifically, we utilize a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model to simulate atomic-scale diffusion and analyze segregation processes in an Fe-3Cr alloy. Our analysis includes three representative sink geometries: one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) planar sinks to capture the effects of sink dimensionality on Cr segregation at grain boundaries (GBs). We also found solutions of concentration and segregation profiles in these cases as well as for a 3D spherical sink. KMC simulations are performed over a range of temperatures to assess thermal effects on Cr redistribution. The results reveal distinct segregation profiles and concentration gradients, although the dependence with sink density seems to remain linear in all cases with planar sinks. The analytical results show that this is not the case in spherical domains, with a more complex dependence of segregation on sink density. Our finite difference solutions for domains including 2D and 3D planer sinks show agreement with corresponding KMC results.</description>

      <title>Site-selective enhancement of Eu emission in delta-doped GaN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Europium-doped gallium nitride (GaN:Eu) is a promising platform for classical and quantum optoelectronic applications. When grown using organometallic vapor-phase epitaxy, the dominant red emission from Eu exhibits an inhomogeneous photoluminescence (PL) spectrum due to contributions from several non-equivalent incorporation sites that can be distinguished with combined excitation emission spectroscopy. Energy transfer from the GaN bandgap to the majority site is inefficient, limiting the performance of GaN:Eu LEDs and resulting in an inhomogeneous emission spectrum dominated by disproportionate contributions from minority sites. In this work, we use site-selective spectroscopy to characterize the photoluminescence properties of delta-doped structures with alternating doped and undoped layers of varying thicknesses and demonstrate that they selectively enhance emission from the majority site when compared to uniformly-doped samples. Samples with 2-nm and 10-nm doped layers show much greater PL intensity per Eu concentration as well as more efficient energy transfer to the majority site, which are both highly desirable for creating power-efficient LEDs. Meanwhile, a sample with 1-nm doped layers shows emission only from the majority site, resulting in a narrow, homogeneous emission spectrum that is desirable for quantum technologies. This utilization of delta-doping has the potential to be broadly applicable for engineering desirable defect properties in rare-earth doped semiconductors.</description>

      <title>X-ray detected ferromagnetic resonance spectrometer with an out-of-vacuum photodetector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray detected ferromagnetic resonance (XFMR) spectroscopy is an experimental technique for element-specific spin dynamics in the GHz regime and has been utilized to study spintronic materials. The XFMR signal is usually obtained by detecting X-ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL) emitted from a sample substrate. Here, we report the development of an XFMR spectrometer that is designed to place a photodetector for XEOL detection outside an ultra-high-vacuum chamber. This configuration allows for the easy replacement of detectors, such as photodiodes, CCD cameras, and spectrometers, depending on the experimental requirements. We demonstrated the measurement of XEOL spectra from MgO using a visible light spectrometer as well as the detection of XFMR signals originating from the spin precession of a permalloy (Ni80Fe20) thin film using a photodiode detector. The XFMR spectrometer with an out-of-vacuum photodetector expands possibilities for advanced measurements such as XFMR microscopy.</description>

      <title>Surface-mediated reduction of radiation damage in tungsten revealed by advanced ion channeling analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tungsten is a leading candidate material for plasma-facing components in future fusion reactors. Extensive studies have been performed to better understand its behavior under irradiation. Recent experiments of Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in channeling mode indicated a marked reduction in radiation damage in single-crystal tungsten samples irradiated by self-ions when the irradiation temperature was increased from room temperature to 800 K. However, the underlying mechanism for this damage reduction remains unclear. In this work, by combining Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in channeling mode and molecular dynamics simulations, we identify a pronounced surface effect at elevated temperatures, characterized by a significant reduction of dislocation density near the surface. We demonstrate how our unique analysis method can clearly resolve a dislocation-free zone and a transition region with suppressed defect density before reaching the bulk value. The strong surface effect at elevated temperatures is explained by considering the coherent drift motion of dislocation loops towards the surface, highlighting alternative perspectives on mitigating radiation damage by increasing dislocation mobility.</description>

      <title>Green and Sustainable Hydrogen-Anchored Solvent Enabling Stable Aqueous Zn Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries provide many benefits, including high theoretical capacity, a low redox potential, and the abundance of Zn in Earth's crust. However, the benefits are often compromised by severe side reactions and dendrite growth, limiting their practical application. To mitigate these drawbacks, many studies have focused on high-concentration electrolytes to desolvate the Zn2+ solvation shell from water and to reduce the amount of free water. In this study, a methodology is proposed to achieve the benefits of highly concentrated electrolytes while using low salt concentrations. 5-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (5MP) was introduced as a safe and polar cosolvent capable of anchoring free water molecules through hydrogen bonding, enabled by its carbonyl and secondary amine groups. Additionally, by adding a co-salt containing a chaotropic ion, it is possible to disrupt the water network, enabling the development of high-performance aqueous Zn batteries. The synergy between anchoring water molecules and disrupting the overall water network proved to be an effective strategy for enhancing the overall Zn battery performance in a symmetric Zn cell, with lifetimes exceeding 2000 hours and 1400 hours at 1 C and 5 C, respectively. Analysis of the recovered Zn anode confirmed that the combination of 5MP and chaotropic ions enabled Zn deposition along the energetically favorable (002) plane, with no signs of surface dehydration observed by in situ Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, long-term stability tests using a carbonyl-rich COF- and NaVO-based cathodes at various current densities further demonstrated the benefits of this approach. This work showcases the universality of a diluted electrolyte in combination with 5MP and chaotropic ions, bridging the gap between laboratory research and real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Topological charge and bulk-surface correspondence for quad-helicoid surface states in topological semimetals with two glide-time-reversal symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quad-helicoid surface states (QHSSs) are unique surface states with two pairs of helicoid surface states in topological semimetals such as Dirac semimetals. So far, topologically protected QHSSs are shown to appear in spinless systems with two $\mathcal{GT}$ symmetries and $\mathcal{T}$ symmetry ($\mathcal{G}$: glide, $\mathcal{T}$: time-reversal). In this paper, we show that topologically protected QHSSs also appear in spinful/spinless systems with only two $\mathcal{GT}$ symmetries by defining new topological charges and establishing the bulk-surface correspondence. We first define a local $Z_2\times Z_2$ monopole charge for gapless nodes at $\mathcal{GT}$-invariant high-symmetry points and a global $Z_2$ charge reflecting the global topological feature of $\mathcal{GT}$-symmetric topological semimetals. Next, we show that the latter $Z_2$ classification corresponds to the presence or absence of QHSSs on the surface with two $\mathcal{GT}$ symmetries. In addition, we provide simplified formulas of the $Z_2$ charge under additional symmetries, and clarify some symmetry conditions where QHSSs are filling-enforced.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of electronic transport across the topological-trivial phase transition in ${\rm In}_{x}({\rm Bi}_{0.3}{\rm Sb}_{0.7})_{2-x}{\rm Te}_3$ thin films by systematically tuning the indium concentration $x$. Increasing $x$ reduces the effective spin-orbit coupling, driving a topological quantum phase transition near $x \approx 7\%$, and at higher disorder a crossover from diffusive to strongly localized transport around $x \approx 15\%$. In the diffusive regime, the magnetoconductance is well described by the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka formalism, with the evolution of the WAL prefactor $\alpha$ correlating with the band-inversion transition. Beyond the diffusive limit, transport crosses into variable-range hopping, accompanied by a striking reversal of magnetoconductance from negative to positive. The observed positive low-field magnetoconductance, its pronounced anisotropy, and its temperature evolution point to an orbital origin of the response. These features are naturally captured by incorporating the incoherent hopping mechanism of Raikh \textit{et al.} together with wavefunction shrinkage, rather than by conventional quantum-correction frameworks. Our results provide a unified picture of how topology, spin-orbit coupling, and disorder collectively determine the full field-temperature magnetotransport landscape in this material class, establishing a clear experimental link between the topological phase transition and the onset of incoherent hopping-dominated conduction.</description>

      <title>CO on a Rh/Fe3O4 single-atom catalyst: high-resolution infrared spectroscopy and near-ambient-pressure scanning tunnelling microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) offers a powerful route to bridging the materials and pressure gaps between surface science and powder catalysis. Using a newly developed IRAS setup optimised for dielectric single crystals, we investigate CO adsorption on the model single-atom catalyst Rh/Fe3O4(001). IRAS resolves three species: monocarbonyls at twofold coordinated Rh1 sites, monocarbonyls at fivefold coordinated Rh sites, and gem-dicarbonyls at twofold coordinated Rh1 sites. Under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, Rh1CO monocarbonyl species dominate. Rh1(CO)2 gem-dicarbonyl formation is kinetically hindered and occurs predominantly through CO-induced dissociation of Rh2 dimers rather than sequential CO adsorption. The sequential-adsorption pathway to Rh1(CO)2 becomes accessible at millibar CO pressures as evidenced by near-ambient-pressure scanning tunnelling microscopy (NAP-STM). These findings validate the kinetic picture inferred from UHV measurements and computational modelling and link the UHV behaviour to that expected under realistic reaction conditions. Assignments of the vibrational frequencies to individual species rely on isotopic labelling, thermal treatments, and a review of previous SPM, XPS, and TPD data, supported by density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations. While theory provides qualitative insight, such as the instability of dicarbonyls on fivefold coordinated Rh atoms, it does not yet reproduce experimental frequencies quantitatively and is sensitive to the computational parameters, highlighting the need for robust experimental benchmarks. The spectroscopic fingerprints established here provide a reliable foundation for identifying Rh coordination environments in oxide-supported single-atom catalysts.</description>

      <title>Defect Tolerance and Local Structural Response to 3d Transition-Metal Substitution in CsPbI3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic first-principles study of substitutional 3d transition-metal (TM) defects in CsPbI3 using the spin-polarized GGA+U framework. TM incorporation is generally energetically favorable and induces lattice distortions that are strongly localized around the defect site, preserving the overall structural integrity of the host. Analysis of defect formation energies and electronic structure shows that, with the exception of Sc and Ti, CsPbI3 exhibits a strong resistance to deep trap formation. Most TM substitutions instead introduce resonant states that hybridize with the band edges, consistent with the defect-tolerant nature of the material. While these states can modify the band gap, they do not generate isolated mid-gap traps. The observed distortions arise from strain-driven Van Vleck modes governed by ionic-radius mismatch, electronegativity differences, and TM-I orbital overlap, with amplitudes that decay rapidly away from the defect. Spin-polarized calculations reveal significant TM-induced spin polarization on the ligands and, in some cases, on neighboring Pb atoms, reflecting variations in covalency and hybridization across the 3d series. Together, these results establish a unified picture in which local structural response, electronic hybridization, and spin polarization jointly control the stability and electronic impact of TM defects in CsPbI3 , identifying dopants that are electronically benign or detrimental.</description>

      <title>Automatic generation of input files with optimised k-point meshes for Quantum Espresso self-consistent field single point total energy calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations requires a careful choice of computational parameters to ensure convergence and obtain meaningful results. This represents a particularly important problem for high-throughput and agentic workflows, where due to computational cost, any additional convergence studies are preferably to be avoided. So, there is a need for tools and models which are able to predict DFT parameters from basic input information, such as a structure. In this work, we develop a machine learning approach to predict the appropriate k-point sampling in DFT calculations and generate the input files for Quantum Espresso self-consistent field calculations. To achieve this, we first generated a training dataset comprising over 20,000 materials, each with an energy convergence threshold of 1 meV/atom. Several ML models were evaluated for their ability to predict k-points distance, and uncertainty estimation was incorporated to guarantee that, for at least 85-95% of compounds, the predicted k-distance lies within the convergence region. The best-performing models are made publicly available through an open-access web application.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Strongly Anisotropic Valleytronics in SnSe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Valleytronics aims to control electrons in a valley-specific manner for quantum information manipulation. Due to their strong in-plane anisotropy, which enables polarization-controlled optical transitions to distinct nondegenerate valleys, group-IV monochalcogenides have been recently proposed as promising candidates for next-generation valleytronic materials. However, ultrafast nonequilibrium dynamics following optical preparation of valley-polarized states remain completely unexplored in these systems. Combining time- and angle-resolved extreme-ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy with time-dependent Boltzmann equation simulations, we investigate ultrafast valley polarization dynamics following polarization-controlled photoexcitation in SnSe. We show that selective excitation to valleys at global conduction minima yields nearly unity and time-independent valley polarization. In contrast, photoexcitation to the other valley channel leads to ultrafast decay and reversal of valley polarization on sub-picosecond timescales due to intervalley scattering mediated by strong electron-phonon coupling with an optical phonon mode. Our findings reveal strongly anisotropic and radically different nonequilibrium valley physics than in most common two-dimensional valleytronics materials.</description>

      <title>Lithium-ion battery degradation: Introducing the concept of reservoirs to design for lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing lithium-ion batteries for long service life remains a challenge, as most cells are optimized for beginning-of-life metrics such as energy density, often overlooking how design and operating conditions shape degradation. This work introduces a degradation-aware design framework built around finite, interacting reservoirs (lithium, porosity, and electrolyte) that are depleted over time by coupled degradation processes.
  We extend a physics-based Doyle-Fuller-Newman model to include validated mechanisms such as SEI growth, lithium plating, cracking, and solvent dry-out, and simulate how small design changes impact lifetime. Across more than 1,000 cycles, we find that increasing electrolyte volume by just 1% or porosity by 5% can extend service life by over 30% without significantly affecting cell energy density. However, lithium excess, while boosting initial capacity, can accelerate failure if not supported by sufficient structural or ionic buffers.
  Importantly, we show that interaction between reservoirs is crucial to optimal design: multi-reservoir tuning yields either synergistic benefits or compound failures, depending on operating conditions. We also quantify how C-rate and operating temperature influence degradation pathways, emphasizing the need for co-optimized design and usage profiles.
  By reframing degradation as a problem of managing finite internal reservoirs, this work offers a predictive and mechanistic foundation for designing lithium-ion batteries that balance energy, durability, and application-specific needs.</description>

      <title>Thermal Stabilization of Defect Charge States and Finite-Temperature Charge Transition Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point defects introduce localized electronic states that critically affect carrier trapping, recombination, and transport in functional materials. The associated charge transition levels (CTLs) can depend on temperature, requiring accurate treatment of vibrational and electronic free-energy contributions. In this work, we use machine-learned interatomic potentials to efficiently compute temperature-dependent CTLs for vacancies in MgO, LiF, and CsSnBr3. Using thermodynamic integration, we quantify free-energy differences between charge states and calculate the vibrational entropy contributions at finite temperatures. We find that CTLs shift with temperature in MgO, LiF and CsSnBr3 from both entropy and electronic contributions. Notably, in CsSnBr3 a neutral charge state becomes thermodynamically stable above 60 K, introducing a temperature-dependent Fermi-level window absent at 0 K. We show that the widely used static, zero-kelvin defect formalism can miss both quantitative CTL shifts and the qualitative emergence of new stable charge states.</description>

      <title>Electromechanical properties of the 180{\deg} domain wall in PbTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the electromechanical response of the 180 degree ferroelectric domain wall in tetragonal PbTiO3 by combining first-principles calculations with a Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) description. Using regular multidomain structures with varying domain-wall density, we extract polarization profiles and lattice distortions and map them onto the continuum model to determine conventional (homogeneous) and gradient (inhomogeneous) electrostriction. Conventional electrostriction yields only a small negative length change of the sample, whereas gradient electrostriction--arising from the coupling between strain and polarization gradients--produces a positive contribution nearly an order of magnitude larger and localized at the wall core. Our results demonstrate that gradient electrostriction dominates the electromechanical response of 180 degree walls in PbTiO3, supporting its inclusion in LGD models that stabilize Bloch-type domain wall structures.</description>

      <title>Machine-learned accelerated discovery of oxidation-resistant NiCoCrAl high-entropy alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of oxidation-resistant high-entropy alloy (HEA) bond coats is restricted by the limited understanding of how multi-principal element interactions govern scale formation across temperatures. This study uncovers new oxidation trends in NiCoCrAl HEAs using a data-driven analysis of high-fidelity experimental oxidation data. The results reveal a clear temperature-dependent transition between alumina- and chromia-dominated protection, identifying the compositional regimes where alloys rich in Al dominate at $\ge1150$ {\deg}C, mixed Al-Cr chemistries are optimal at intermediate temperatures, and, unexpectedly, Cr-rich low-Al alloys perform best at 850 {\deg}C-challenging the assumption that high Al is universally required. The effects of Hf and Y are shown to be strongly composition-dependent with Hf producing the largest global reduction in oxidation rate, while Y becomes effective primarily in NiCo-lean alloys. Y-Hf co-doping offers consistent improvement but exhibits site-saturation behavior. These insights identify new high-performing HEA bond-coat families, including $\mathrm{Ni_{17}Co_{23}Cr_{30}Al_{30}}$ as a substitute for conventional mutlilayer thermal barrier coatings.</description>

      <title>Atomically-precise synthesis and simultaneous integration of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides enabled by nano-confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and hBN, exhibit intriguing properties that are sensitive to their atomic-scale structures and can be further enriched through van der Waals (vdW) integration. However, the precise synthesis and clean integration of 2D materials remain challenging. Here, using graphene or hBN as a vdW capping layer, we create a nano-confined environment that directs the growth kinetics of 2D TMDs (e.g., NbSe2 and MoS2), enabling precise formation of TMD monolayers with tailored morphologies, from isolated monolayer domains to large-scale continuous films and intrinsically-patterned rings. Moreover, Janus S-Mo-Se monolayers are synthesized with atomic precision via vdW-protected bottom-plane chalcogen substitution. Importantly, our approach simultaneously produces ultraclean vdW interfaces. This in situ encapsulation reliably preserves air-sensitive materials, as evidenced by the enhanced superconductivity of nano-confined NbSe2 monolayers. Altogether, our study establishes a versatile platform for the controlled synthesis and integration of 2D TMDs for advanced applications.</description>

      <title>Exciton radiative lifetimes in hexagonal diamond Ge and Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$ alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent reports of strong room-temperature photoluminescence in hexagonal diamond (2H) germanium stand in marked contrast to theoretical predictions of very weak band-edge optical transitions. Here we address radiative emission in 2H-Ge and related materials through a comprehensive investigation of their excitonic properties and radiative lifetimes, performing Bethe-Salpeter calculations on pristine and uniaxially strained 2H-Ge, 2H-Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$ alloys with $x=\frac{1}{6},\,\frac{1}{4},\,\frac{1}{2}$, and wurtzite GaN as a reference. Pristine 2H-Ge features sizable exciton binding energies ($\sim\!30$ meV) but extremely small dipole moments, yielding radiative lifetimes above $10^{-4}$ s. Alloying with Si reduces the lifetime by nearly two orders of magnitude, whereas a 2% uniaxial strain along the $c$ axis induces a band crossover that strongly enhances the in-plane dipole moment of the lowest-energy exciton and drives the lifetime down to the nanosecond scale. Although strained 2H-Ge approaches the radiative efficiency of GaN, its much lower exciton energy prevents a full match. These results provide the missing excitonic description of 2H-Ge and 2H-Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$, demonstrating that, even when excitonic effects are fully accounted for, the strong photoluminescence reported experimentally cannot originate from the ideal crystal.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of (In,Ga)N pseudo-substrates by a three-step growth protocol without ex-situ processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We fabricate (In,Ga)N pseudo-substrates with a total thickness of ~1 um grown on GaN templates using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. In a three-step process, we change growth conditions from N-rich to metal-rich in order to sequentially form a roughened GaN layer, relaxed (In,Ga)N nanostructures, and a coalesced, smooth (In,Ga)N layer. Samples are analyzed by scanning electron and atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction, as well as photo- and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy. Compared to a reference layer grown directly on GaN, the pseudo-substrate exhibits a higher In content (~0.3), strain relaxation degree (~80%), narrower photoluminescence linewidth, and larger area fraction of bright regions in cathodoluminescence maps, showing the benefits of the three-step growth protocol. This straightforward approach does not necessitate any ex-situ processing and could enable the scalable fabrication of (In,Ga)N pseudo-substrates for high-efficiency red-emitting (In,Ga)N devices.</description>

      <title>First-principles simulation of spin diffusion in static solids using dynamic mean-field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of disordered nuclear spin ensembles are the subject of nuclear magnetic resonance studies. Due to the through-space long-range dipolar interaction generically many spins are involved in the time evolution, so that exact brute force calculations are impossible. The recently established spin dynamic mean-field theory (spinDMFT) represents an efficient and unbiased alternative to overcome this challenge. The approach only requires the dipolar couplings as input and the only prerequisite for its applicability is that each spin interacts with a large number of other spins. In this article, we show that spinDMFT can be used to describe spectral spin diffusion in static samples and to simulate zero-quantum line shapes which eluded an efficient quantitative simulation so far to the best of our knowledge. We perform benchmarks for two test substances that establish an excellent match with published experimental data. As spinDMFT combines low computational effort with high accuracy, we strongly suggest to use it for large-scale simulations of spin diffusion, which are important in various areas of magnetic resonance.</description>

      <title>From Complex Magnetic Ground States to Magnetocaloric Effects: A Review of Rare Earth R$_2$In Intermetallic Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: R2In (R = rare earth) intermetallics exhibit unusual magnetic and magnetocaloric properties, driven by subtle electronic effects, lattice distortions, and spin-lattice coupling. Most of these binary compounds adopt the hexagonal Ni2In-type structure at room temperature, with Eu2In and Yb2In stabilizing in the orthorhombic Co2Si-type lattice. Lighter lanthanide compounds Eu2In, Nd2In, and Pr2In undergo first-order magnetic transitions with negligible hysteresis and minimal lattice volume change and exhibit giant cryogenic magnetocaloric effects, while heavy lanthanide R2In compounds including Gd2In show second-order transitions with moderate magnetocaloric effect. No lanthanide-based R2In compound exhibits symmetry-breaking structural transition, while Y2In transforms from hexagonal to orthorhombic structure near 250 K. Secondary low-temperature transitions, including spin reorientation or antiferromagnetic ordering, further enrich the magnetic phase landscape in these compounds. Integrating theoretical descriptors such as charge-induced strain and electronic structure provides predictive insight into phase stability and magnetocaloric performance, guiding the design of rare-earth intermetallics with tunable magnetic properties for cryogenic applications</description>

      <title>Polaritonic Bloch's Theorem beyond the Long-Wavelength Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics offers a powerful route to manipulate material properties. However, it is unclear whether and how quantized fields affect crystals periodicity. Here, we extend Bloch's theorem to crystals under the strong light-matter coupling, showing that polariton quasiparticles preserve lattice periodicity. We formulate a general framework to incorporate the effect of multimode cavity fields in a simple and tractable way. We find that the additional modes contribute to the system's energy by small modifications that become noticeable only at low frequencies. Within the single-photon approximation the multimode contribution manifests as a spatially uniform effective field in the crystal's plane. This provides a formal justification for the single-mode and long-wavelength approximations commonly used in molecular polaritonics. This work establishes a rigorous theoretical framework that clarifies how polaritonic states in crystalline solids should be described.</description>

      <title>Understanding the effect of drying time in process-structure-performance relationships for PM6-Y6 organic solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Making solution-cast organic solar cells industrially available generally comes at the cost of significant performance losses compared to device prototypes manufactured under laboratory conditions. Adjusting solvent evaporation kinetics is postulated to recover efficiency. Yet, a comprehensive characterization of their effect, independently of other property-defining parameters, is lacking. Thus, the present objective is to isolate the influence of the solvent drying rate on solution-deposited organic active layer nanomorphologies and performances. To this end, a specially designed gas quenching technique is employed to fabricate PM6:Y6 donor-acceptor films under systematic variations of evaporation conditions. Using an extensive investigation protocol that combines insights from numerical simulations and experimental measurements, process-structure-performance relationships are unraveled. It is found that higher drying rates imply finer and more dispersed nanomorphologies with increased fractions of amorphous material. This enhances electric charge generation, thereby improving short-circuit current density and overall cell performance. The open-circuit voltage is also boosted under accelerated evaporation due to changes in the aggregation mode of the Y6 small molecule that induce higher effective bandgaps. The results demonstrate that the developed gas-quenching technique is a valuable tool for optimizing the performance of upscaled organic photovoltaics, as it is readily compatible with high-throughput equipment, such as roll-to-roll coating machines.</description>

      <title>A High-Flux and High-Efficiency Setup for Magneto-Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the design and implementation of a high-flux, high-efficiency magneto-infrared spectroscopy system optimized for broadband measurements in high magnetic fields. The setup integrates a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, a 12 T cryogen-free superconducting magnet, precision-polished and gold-plated light tubes, custom-designed reflective focusing modules for Faraday and Voigt geometries, and an external multi-detector chamber with motorized selection. Optical throughput is maximized by reducing light tube loss from 65.5%/m to 22.0%/m via abrasive flow and mechanical polishing followed by gold electroplating, and by adopting a single-on-axis parabolic-mirror Faraday module that increases the effective numerical aperture from 0.14 to 0.36, enhancing collection efficiency by nearly an order of magnitude. An eight-position motorized sample stage and fully automated control over magnetic field, temperature, optical path, and detector choice enable high-throughput measurements without repeated warm-ups. The optimized configuration achieves a root-mean-square noise level of 0.0061% in a 2-minute integration for a 40% reflectivity sample, corresponding to a signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 16000. System capabilities are demonstrated by resolving weak replica bands in EuCd2As2 and faint Landau level transitions in LaAlSi.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Band-Split Magnetism in Magnetostrictive CoFe$_2$O$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single crystal spinel CoFe$_2$O$_4$ exhibits the largest room-temperature saturation magnetostriction among non-rare-earth compounds and a high Curie temperature ($T_c \sim 780$ K), properties that are critical to a wide range of industrial and medical applications. Neutron spectroscopy reveals a large band splitting ($\sim$ 60 meV) between two ferrimagnetic magnon branches, which is driven by site mixing between Co$^{2+}$ and Fe$^{3+}$ cations, and a significantly weaker magnetocrystalline anisotropy ($\sim$ 3 meV). Central to this behavior is the competition between extremely large mismatched molecular fields on the tetrahedral $A$-site and octahedral $B$-site sublattices and the single-ion anisotropy on the $B$-site. This creates a strong energetic anisotropy that locks the magnetic moment within each structural domain in place. As a result of these differing energy scales, switching structural domains is energetically favored over a global spin reorientation under applied magnetic fields, and this is what amplifies the magnetostrictive nature of CoFe$_2$O$_4$.</description>

      <title>On the applicability of the cumulant expansion method for the calculation of transport properties in electron-phonon systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess the accuracy of the cumulant expansion (CE) method, combined with the independent-particle approximation (IPA), for calculating charge mobility in electron-phonon systems. As representative testbeds, we consider the Peierls and Fr\"ohlich models, which serve as simplified frameworks where accurate or numerically exact benchmarks are available. These are used to compare the CE results with those obtained using the Boltzmann formalism, the Migdal approximation, and its self consistent extension-approaches that are presently the most commonly employed alternatives for transport calculations. Supported by analytical arguments based on spectral sum rules and by our previous results for the Holstein model, we argue that, for weak to moderate coupling strengths and not-too-low temperatures, the CE within the IPA framework yields accurate results. In the case of the Peierls model, the role of vertex corrections is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Roadmap: 2D Materials for Quantum Technologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as a versatile and powerful platform for quantum technologies, offering atomic-scale control, strong quantum confinement, and seamless integration into heterogeneous device architectures. Their reduced dimensionality enables unique quantum phenomena, including optically addressable spin defects, tunable single-photon emitters, low-dimensional magnetism, gate-controlled superconductivity, and correlated states in Moir\'e superlattices. This Roadmap provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress and future directions in exploiting 2D materials for quantum sensing, computation, communication, and simulation. We survey advances spanning spin defects and quantum sensing, quantum emitters and nonlinear photonics, computational theory and data-driven discovery of quantum defects, spintronic and magnonic devices, cavity-engineered quantum materials, superconducting and hybrid quantum circuits, quantum dots, Moir\'e quantum simulators, and quantum communication platforms. Across these themes, we identify common challenges in defect control, coherence preservation, interfacial engineering, and scalable integration, alongside emerging opportunities driven by machine$-$learning$-$assisted design and integrated experiment$-$theory feedback loops. By connecting microscopic quantum states to mesoscopic excitations and macroscopic device architectures, this Roadmap outlines a materials-centric framework for integrating coherent quantum functionalities and positions 2D materials as foundational building blocks for next-generation quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Canted ferromagnetic order in a distorted triangular-lattice magnet Na$_2$SrCo(VO$_4$)$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triangular-lattice cobaltates with glaserite-type $X_2Y$Co($T$O$_4)_2$ structure provide an ideal platform to investigate intriguing quantum magnetism. Here we report a comprehensive study of the structural and magnetic properties of a triangular-lattice cobalt vanadate $\rm Na_2SrCo(VO_4)_2$. Room-temperature x-ray and neutron powder diffraction confirm that $\rm Na_2SrCo(VO_4)_2$ crystallizes in the monoclinic $P2_1/c$ space group with slightly distorted triangular layers of $\rm Co^{2+}$ ions. Magnetization measurements reveal a ferromagnetic transition at $T\rm_C \approx 3.4~{\rm K}$, where a sharp $\lambda$-type anomaly is observed in the specific heat. The magnetic entropy recovered up to 55 K approaches 90$\%$ of $R{\rm ln}2$, supporting an effective spin-1/2 state of Co$^{2+}$ ions at low temperature. Neutron diffraction at 2.3 K (below $T_{\rm C}$) further confirms a long-range canted ferromagnetic order with the Co$^{2+}$ moments aligned in the $ac$ plane and the ordered moment size of $\sim$ 2.6 $\mu\rm_{B}$. Comparing with its sister compounds with a trigonal symmetry, $\rm Na_2BaCo(VO_4)_2$ with a collinear ferromagnetic structure and the recently discovered spin supersolid candidate $\rm Na_2BaCo(PO_4)_2$ with a distinct Y-like antiferromagnetic ground state, this study indicates the decisive role of the $T{\rm O_4}$ tetrahedra in tuning exchange interactions and contrasting magnetic behaviors of these glaserite-structure compounds.</description>

      <title>Buckling of knitted fabric wrapped around a rigid cylinder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knitted fabrics exhibit high flexibility due to their periodic loop structures formed by bent yarns. Under compressive loading, they develop three-dimensional (3D) wrinkling patterns that reflect nonlinear interactions between yarn elasticity and local loop deformations, as observed when the sleeves of a sweater are rolled up. Despite their widespread use in garments and medical textiles, the relationship between loop-level geometry and macroscopic buckling remains less understood. Here, we investigate the 3D deformation of knitted fabrics wrapped around a rigid cylinder under uniaxial compression. Circumferential and axial stitch numbers are systematically varied to determine how loop geometry affects the evolution of wrinkle patterns. Samples with a small number of circumferential stitches exhibit sequential wrinkle formation from the compressed end, leading to an accordion-like wrinkle pattern, whereas those with a larger number of stitches form helical wrinkles simultaneously across the surface. Wrinkle morphology changes progressively with stitch geometry, accompanied by systematic variations in compressive force, loop deformation, and helical wrinkle angle. The development of helical wrinkles originates from subtle structural asymmetries introduced during manufacturing processes, including the tension applied during knitting and the direction of sample assembly. These results demonstrate that small variations in local loop deformation can lead to substantial differences in wrinkle morphology, highlighting the sensitivity of macroscopic buckling to microscopic structural features. The study establishes a direct link between loop-level mechanics and global deformation behavior, providing a basis for the predictive design of knitted structures with tailored mechanical responses and complex 3D patterns.</description>

      <title>Ab initio insights into plasmonic and strong-field contributions to H$_2$ dissociation on silver nanoshells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling plasmonic catalysis by applying femtosecond laser pulses of high intensity ($10^{13}-10^{15}$ W cm$^{-2}$), although justified by the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) time-scale limitations, can lead to a dissociation mechanism that is completely unrelated to the plasmon excitation created under low-intensity continuous light in experiments (on the order of 1 W cm$^{-2}$). In this study, we examine the dissociation of H$_2$ on a large octahedral Ag nanoshell under varying field intensity, frequency, and duration, and we explore the possibility of identifying optimal modeling conditions accessible with current TDDFT simulations. We show that using this large nanoshell that consists in the outer layer of the Ag$_{231}$ cluster, it is still possible to disentangle the role of the plasmon from strong-field effects at applied field intensities as high as $(2-8) \times 10^{13}$ W cm$^{-2}$. In particular, although strong-field effects are always present at these intensities, we find that the excited plasmon dominates the dissociation process at the lowest applied intensity of $2 \times 10^{13}$ W cm$^{-2}$. Furthermore, at the highest intensity, at which strong-field effects become dominant, the plasmon contributes to accelerating the dissociation of the molecule. Overall, our simulations pave the way to bridge the intensity gap between TDDFT modeling and experiments in plasmonic catalysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalable photonic quantum information technologies require a platform combining quantum light sources, waveguides, and detectors on a single chip. Here, we introduce a van der Waals platform comprising strain-engineered bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters, integrated on multimode WS$_2$ waveguides with optimized grating couplers, enabling efficient on-chip quantum light sources. The emitters exhibit bright, highly polarized emission that couples efficiently into WS$_2$ waveguides. Under resonant p-shell excitation, we observe high-purity, waveguide-coupled single-photon emission, measured using both an off-chip Hanbury Brown-Twiss configuration ($g^{(2)}(0) = 0.003^{+0.030}_{-0.003}$) and an on-chip configuration ($g^{(2)}(0) = 0.076\pm0.023$). For a single output, the out-coupled single-photon count rate at the first lens reaches approximately 320 kHz under continuous-wave p-shell excitation, corresponding to an estimated waveguide-coupled rate of 1.7 MHz. These results demonstrate an efficient, integrated single-photon source and establish a pathway toward scalable photonic quantum information processing centered around nanoengineered van der Waals materials.</description>

      <title>Towards coherent polaritonic circuits operating at room temperature</title>

Abstract: Polariton condensation is a potential system state for performing analog computations, given that it exhibits quantum behavior at macroscopic scales readily probed with low-cost optical methods. Current methods of fabricating devices in polariton microcavities largely involve patterning the devices via e-beam lithography before the cavity is completed, which offers less flexibility in device creation and reduces the maximum possible refractive index contrast. Moreover, the momentum and spatial distributions of the condensate are highly dependent on the host platform, and it has been difficult to preserve the desired behavior when modifying a given cavity. Here we introduce a method that addresses both of these challenges with the creation of polaritonic circuits of arbitrary forms etched via Focused Ion Beam into an organic microcavity based on Rhodamine 3B Perchlorate within a Small Molecule Ionic Isolation Lattices complex. We demonstrate room temperature condensation and propagation of polaritons in rectangular and trapezoidal waveguides by analyzing spatial and angle-resolved photoluminescence. We also discuss the blue-shifting and non-zero momentum of the condensate and show that it is strongly confined up to several higher energy levels. As an example, we report the spatial profiles of condensation in custom devices, such as a ring waveguide, a Y-splitter, and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. This work represents a first step towards the realization of more complex, fully integrated, coherent polaritonic circuits operating at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Language Models in Scientific Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific research, yet prevailing science benchmarks probe decontextualized knowledge and overlook the iterative reasoning, hypothesis generation, and observation interpretation that drive scientific discovery. We introduce a scenario-grounded benchmark that evaluates LLMs across biology, chemistry, materials, and physics, where domain experts define research projects of genuine interest and decompose them into modular research scenarios from which vetted questions are sampled. The framework assesses models at two levels: (i) question-level accuracy on scenario-tied items and (ii) project-level performance, where models must propose testable hypotheses, design simulations or experiments, and interpret results. Applying this two-phase scientific discovery evaluation (SDE) framework to state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a consistent performance gap relative to general science benchmarks, diminishing return of scaling up model sizes and reasoning, and systematic weaknesses shared across top-tier models from different providers. Large performance variation in research scenarios leads to changing choices of the best performing model on scientific discovery projects evaluated, suggesting all current LLMs are distant to general scientific "superintelligence". Nevertheless, LLMs already demonstrate promise in a great variety of scientific discovery projects, including cases where constituent scenario scores are low, highlighting the role of guided exploration and serendipity in discovery. This SDE framework offers a reproducible benchmark for discovery-relevant evaluation of LLMs and charts practical paths to advance their development toward scientific discovery.</description>

Abstract: We report a comprehensive study of pressure-induced evolution of the magnetism and development of superconductivity (SC) in MnBi8Te13, a promising ambient pressure, ferromagnetic (FM) topological insulator candidate. By employing high-pressure electrical transport, magnetoresistance, DC magnetic susceptibility, and X-ray diffraction measurements, we construct a detailed temperature-pressure phase diagram. At ambient pressure, MnBi8Te13 exhibits FM ordering with an easy-axis along the c-axis which is progressively suppressed under pressure and replaced by an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. Density functional theory calculations predicted an evolution from FM to a G-type AFMg2 phase near 5 GPa. Above 16.6 GPa, a bulk SC state emerges with a maximum transition temperature ~6.8 K, as confirmed by resistance and magnetic susceptibility measurements. This pressure-induced SC may co-exist with another AFM dome that shows a weak anomaly in the transport data. In contrast, our work on MnBi6Te10 shows no SC up to 40 GPa. Indeed, in contrast to MnBi8Te13, the MnBi2Te4(Bi2Te3)n compounds with n &lt; 3, didn't exhibit SC, highlighting the crucial role of Mn concentration in stabilizing SC. The observation of pressure-induced FM-AFM-SC transitions in MnBi8Te13 not only establishes it as a rare Mn-based SC but also provides a platform to study the interplay between magnetism, SC, and potentially nontrivial band topology in correlated magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Silver electrodes are highly selective for CO in CO$_2$ electroreduction due to interplay between voltage dependent kinetics and thermodynamics</title>

Abstract: Electrochemical reduction is a promising way to make use of CO$_2$ as feedstock for generating renewable fuel and valuable chemicals. Several metals can be used in the electrocatalyst to generate CO and formic acid but hydrogen formation is an unwanted side reaction that can even be dominant. The lack of selectivity is in general a significant problem, but silver-based electrocatalysts have been shown to be highly selective for CO with over over 90% faradaic efficiency when the applied voltage is below -1 V vs. RHE. Hydrogen formation is then insignificant and little formate is formed even though it is thermodynamically favored. We present calculations of the activation free energy for the various elementary steps as a function of applied voltage at the three low index facets, Ag(111), Ag(100) and Ag(110), as well as experimental measurements on polycrystalline electrodes, to identify the reason for this high selectivity. The formation of formic acid is suppressed because of the low coverage of adsorbed hydrogen and kinetic hindrance to the formation of the HCOO* intermediate, while *COOH, a key intermediate in CO formation, is thermodynamically unstable until the applied voltage reaches -1 V vs. RHE, at which point the kinetics for its formation are more favorable than for hydrogen. The calculated results are consistent with experimental measurements carried out for acidic conditions and provide an atomic scale insight into the high CO selectivity of silver-based electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Sulfur and sulfur-oxide compounds as potential optically active defects on SWCNTs</title>

Abstract: Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) functionalized with covalent defects are a promising class of optoelectronic materials with strong, tunable photoluminescence and demonstrated single photon emission (SPE). Here, we investigate sulfur-oxide containing compounds as a new class of optically active dopants on (6,5) SWCNT. Experimentally, it has been found that when the SWCNT is exposed to sodium dithionite, the resulting compound displays a red-shifted and bright photoluminescence peak that is characteristic of doping with covalent defects. We perform density functional theory calculations on the possible adsorbed compounds that may be the source of doping (S, SO, SO2 and SO3). We predict that the two smallest molecules strongly bind to the SWCNT with binding energies of ~ 1.5-1.8 eV and 0.56 eV for S and SO, respectively, and introduce in-gap electronic states into the bandstructure of the tube consistent with the measured red-shift of (0.1-0.3) eV, consistent with measurements. In contrast, the larger compounds are found to be either unbound or weakly physisorbed with no appreciable impact on the electronic structure of the tube, indicating that they are unlikely to occur. Overall, our study suggests that sulfur-based compounds are promising new dopants for (6,5) SWCNT with tunable electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Grain boundaries amplify local chemical ordering in complex concentrated alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local chemical ordering strongly influences the behavior of complex concentrated alloys, yet its characterization remains challenging due to the nanoscale dimensions and scattered spatial distribution of the ordered domains. Here, we study chemical ordering near grain boundaries, demonstrating they can act as microstructural anchor points that amplify chemical order and drive the formation of compositional nanopatterns. Atomistic simulations reveal the development of composition waves with ordering vectors normal to the boundary plane in two distinct material systems, CrCoNi and NbMoTaW. These waves manifest as periodic enrichment-depletion patterns that reflect the underlying chemical ordering tendencies of each system, but with amplified contrast that extends several nanometers into the grain interior before gradually decaying. By examining multiple grain boundary orientations and alloys, we show that both the interfacial segregation profile and the crystallographic terminating plane govern the extent and character of this amplification. This interplay between boundary-dictated directional ordering and the diffuse, untemplated chemical domain evolution within the grain advances our understanding of interface-mediated ordering phenomena and suggests new opportunities for experimentally detecting local chemical order in complex concentrated alloys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental and theoretical studies of nanoscale hafnia-zirconia physical properties are hot topics in fundamental and applied science. However, magnetic and charge transport properties of HfxZr1-xO2-y nanoparticles are very poorly studied theoretically and experimentally. In this work we observed a superparamagnetic-like and superparaelectric-like response of ultra-small (5 - 10 nm in size) HfxZr1-xO2-y nanoparticles prepared by the solid-state organonitrate synthesis. The EPR spectra of HfxZr1-xO2-y nanopowders reveal the presence of paramagnetic defect centers, which are the oxygen vacancies with one captured electron, and hafnium or zirconium ions that changed their oxidation state from +4 to +3 due to the presence of oxygen vacancies. The Raman spectra indicate the decisive role of surface defects, presumably oxygen vacancies, for all studied x = 1, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4 and significant degree "y" of oxygen deficiency. At the same time elemental analysis did not reveal any noticeable concentration of magnetic impurities in the HfxZr1-xO2-y nanopowders, and the X-ray diffraction analysis reveals the dominant presence (from 87 to 96 wt. %) of the orthorhombic phase. Due to the flexo-electro-chemical strains, presumably induced by the oxygen vacancies and their complexes accumulated near their surface, the ultra-small HfxZr1-xO2-y nanoparticles reveal superparaelectric-like behavior, posistor-like behavior and significant values of accumulated charge. We observed that the static relative dielectric permittivity of the HfxZr1-xO2-y nanopowders overcomes 107 and related the colossal values with the superparaelectric state of the nanoparticles cores induced by the flexo-electro-chemical strains.</description>

      <title>Trajectory-Dependent Electronic Energy Losses in Ion Range Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy losses of energetic ions in materials depend on both nuclear and electronic interactions. In channeling geometries, the stopping effect of these interactions can be highly reduced, resulting in deeper ion penetration. Comprehensive, trajectory-dependent models for ion-material interactions are therefore crucial for the accurate prediction of ion range profiles. We present the implementation of a recent electron density-dependent energy-loss model in the efficient molecular dynamics-based MDRANGE code. The model captures \textit{ab initio} electron dynamics using a parametrized ion energy loss function, based on calculations for explicit trajectories using real-time time-dependent density functional theory. We demonstrate the efficient simulation of trajectory-dependent ion range profiles with this comprehensive model for electronic energy losses. Our results indicate that accurate trajectory-dependent ion range profiles can be simulated using well-fitted parametrizations of this model. This method offers a unique tool for validation of the fitted energy-loss functions using energetic ion ranges, which can be measured experimentally but are beyond the capability of full MD simulations due to the computational expense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control of localized magnetic domains at the nanoscale holds great promise for next-generation spintronic applications. Colloidal transition metal dichalcogenides nanostructures are experimentally accessible and chemically tunable platforms for spintronics, deserving dedicated research to assess their potential. Here, we investigate from first principles free-standing triangular MoS2 nanoflakes with sulfur-terminated, hydrogen-passivated edges, to probe intrinsic spin behavior at varying side lengths. We find a critical edge length of approximately 1.5 nm separating nonmagnetic nanoflakes from larger ones with a magnetic ground state emerging from several, energetically competing spin configurations. In these systems, the magnetic activity is not uniformly distributed along the edges but localized on specific "magnetic islands" around molybdenum edge atoms. The localization of magnetic moments is robust even in non-equilateral nanoflake geometries, highlighting their intrinsic stability regardless of the (high) symmetry of the hosting structure. These findings establish that the S-terminated, H-passivated triangular MoS2 nanoflakes are a stable and experimentally accessible platform via colloidal synthesis for low-dimensional, next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>An intermediately-homogenized peridynamics approach to failure of microstructually disordered materials</title>

Abstract: Peridynamics provides a versatile tool for fracture modelling in materials where fracture pathways cannot be predicted beforehand, but must be envisaged as an emergent features of the deformation process. One class of materials where this is surely the case are materials with strong microstructural disorder such as random composites, random porous materials or disordered metamaterials. For this class of materials we propose an intermediately-homogenized peridynamic modelling approach where the disordered microstructure is not resolved in full spatial detail but described in terms of random order parameter fields which retain essential information about the local heterogeneity and spatial correlations of material properties.</description>

      <title>Probing Topological Surface States and Conduction via Extended Defects in (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$ Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$ alloys are non-degenerate topological insulators (TIs) whose Dirac point (DP) can be tuned within the bulk bandgap by varying the composition, effectively reducing bulk conduction while allowing surface carrier conduction. Magnetotransport measurements of a series of (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$ thin films indicate electron-dominated conduction, with weak anti-localization attributed to topological surface states (TSSs). Due to the similarity of phase coherence lengths and twin boundary spacings ($\sim$100 nm), we consider the role of twin boundaries as additional conducting paths. Density functional theory calculations reveal an enhanced density of states near the Fermi level at $60^\circ$ twin boundaries, with 2D carrier concentration in excess of $3 \times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. Furthermore, an analysis of the longitudinal magnetoconductivity yields an upper bound of $7.3 \times 10^{-4}$ S for twin boundary conductivity, resulting in a carrier mobility as high as $142$ cm$^2$/(V$\cdot$s). We discuss the role of twin boundaries in facilitating a transition from a massive Dirac cone dispersion to gapless, topologically protected surface states. Understanding the role of twin boundaries on carrier conduction in non-degenerate TIs is critical for the development of novel TI-based electronic devices.</description>

The model comprises of a system of three coupled PDEs, taking the form of an Allen--Cahn equation, a Nernst--Planck equation and a Poisson equation. We prove existence of a weak solution and stability results for this system and present numerical simulations resulting from a finite element approximation of the system, which illustrate the dendritic nature of solutions to the model.</description>

      <title>`Interaction annealing' to determine effective quantized valence and orbital structure: an illustration with ferro-orbital order in WTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlated materials are known to display qualitatively distinct emergent behaviors at low energy. Conveniently, upon absorbing rapid quantum fluctuations, these rich low-energy behaviors can always be effectively described by dressed particles with fully quantized charge, spin, and orbital structure. Such a powerful and simple description is, however, difficult to access through bare particles used in most many-body computations, especially when fluctuations are strong such as in $4d$ and $5d$ compounds. To decipher the dominant quantized structure, we propose an easy-to-implement `interaction annealing' approach that utilizes suppressed charge fluctuation through enhancing ionic charging energy. We establish its theoretical foundation using an exactly treated two-site Hubbard model as a generic example. We then demonstrate its applications with more affordable density functional calculations to a representative $3d$ Mott insulator La${_2}$CuO${_4}$ and a highly fluctuating $5d$ semi-metal WTe${_2}$. In the latter, it reveals an emergent local electronic structure that makes possible an unprecedented explanation of several experimental observations. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in studying competing local electronic structures in functional materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct searches for sub-GeV dark matter are limited by the intrinsic quantum properties of the target material. In this proof-of-concept study, we argue that this problem is particularly well suited for machine learning. We demonstrate that a simple neural architecture consisting of a variational autoencoder and a multi-layer perceptron can efficiently generate unique molecules with desired properties. In specific, the energy threshold and signal (quantum) efficiency determine the minimum mass and cross section to which a detector can be sensitive. Organic molecules present a particularly interesting class of materials with intrinsically anisotropic electronic responses and $\mathcal{O}$(few) eV excitation energies. However, the space of possible organic compounds is intractably large, which makes traditional database screening challenging. We adopt excitation energies and proxy transition matrix elements as target properties learned by our network. Our model is able to generate molecules that are not in even the most expansive quantum chemistry databases and predict their relevant properties for high-throughput and efficient screening. Following a massive generation of novel molecules, we use clustering analysis to identify some of the most promising molecular structures that optimise the desired molecular properties for dark matter detection.</description>

      <title>Decoupling of Spin-Orbit Torque Components in Py/W Bilayers unveiled through variation of W-resistivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Harmonic Hall measurements were performed on a series of ferromagnetic metal/heavy metal (FM/HM) bilayers consisting of Permalloy (Py) as the FM and beta-Tungsten (W) as the HM, and the efficiencies of the two orthogonal components of the spin-orbit torque (SOT) were extracted. Two sets of Hall bar-shaped devices, differing in the aspect ratio of the voltage pickup line width and the current channel width, were studied. Within each set, the resistivity of the W layer was systematically varied over a wide range (approximately 150-1000 micro-Ohm-cm). To account for geometry-induced variations in current distribution, numerical simulations were performed, and a correction protocol was developed to normalize the torque efficiencies obtained from the conventional analysis. After applying the correction, the Slonczewski-like (anti-damping, in-plane) torque efficiency exhibited a consistent dependence on W resistivity across both device sets. In contrast, the field-like (out-of-plane) torque efficiency remained largely independent of W resistivity, reinforcing its interfacial character.</description>

      <title>Itinerant Magnetism in Twisted Bilayer WSe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory, we show that the recently observed ferromagnetism in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ [Nat. Commun. 16, 1959 (2025)] can be understood as a Stoner-like instability of interaction-renormalized moir\'e bands. We quantitatively reproduce the observed Lifshitz transition as function of hole filling and applied electric field that marks the boundary between layer-hybridized and layer-polarized regimes. The former supports a ferromagnetic valley-polarized ground state below half-filling, developing a topological charge gap at half-filling for smaller twist angles. At larger twist angles, the system hosts a gapped triangular N\'eel antiferromagnet. On the other hand, the layer-polarized regime supports a stripe antiferromagnet below half-filling and a wing-shaped multiferroic ground state above half-filling. We map the evolution of these states as a function of filling factor, electric field, twist angle, and interaction strength. Our results demonstrate that long-range exchange in a symmetry-unbroken parent state with strongly renormalized moir\'e bands provides a broadly applicable framework to understand itinerant magnetism in moir\'e TMDs.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale imaging of reduced forward bias at V-defects in green-emitting nitride LEDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18025v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Record wall-plug efficiencies in long-wavelength, III-nitride light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have recently been achieved through improvements in electrical efficiency in devices containing V-defects. Numerical modeling suggests this may be due to reduced barrier heights for charge injection in thinned, low-Indium quantum wells parallel to semi-polar V-defect facets. To test this proposition, a novel approach in which the tip of a scanning tunneling luminescence microscope as a local hole injector, is used to map the optoelectronic properties of commercial, green-emitting LED heterostructures around V-defects with nanoscale spatial resolution. A 1 V reduction in the forward bias necessary for current injection at V-defect rims is observed. This, combined with the observation of small (~10 meV) blue shifts in the locally emitted electroluminescence, unambiguously confirms the charge injection mechanism.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion Lattice Order Controlled by Confinement Geometry</title>

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions forming two-dimensional (2D) lattices provide a versatile platform for investigating phase transitions predicted by Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory. While 2D melting in skyrmion systems has been demonstrated, achieving controlled ordering in skyrmion lattices remains challenging due to pinning effects from a non-uniform energy landscape, which often results in polycrystalline structures. Skyrmions in thin films, however, offer thermal diffusion with high tunability and can be directly imaged via Kerr microscopy, enabling real-time observation of their dynamics. To regulate lattice order in such flexible systems, we introduce geometric confinements of varying shapes. Combining Kerr microscopy experiments with Thiele model simulations, we demonstrate that confinement geometry critically influences lattice order. Specifically, hexagonal confinements commensurate with the skyrmion lattice stabilize monodomain hexagonal ordering, while incommensurate geometries induce domain formation and reduce overall order. Understanding these boundary-driven effects is essential for advancing the study of 2D phase behavior and for the design of skyrmion-based spintronic applications, ranging from memory devices to unconventional computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Itinerant Orbital Hall Effect Mechanism Leading to Large Negative Orbital Torques from Light Metal Vanadium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The orbital Hall effect (OHE) has attracted significant attention for developing energy-efficient electronic devices. However, utilizing it in fast, low-power devices requires an enhanced understanding of underlying extrinsic and intrinsic contributions to OHE at timescales ranging from quasi-static to picoseconds. Here, we investigate OHE in light metal vanadium (V) using a combination of selected measurement schemes, spanning the full frequency range. We observe a negative damping-like torque efficiency from V, opposite to conventional theoretical predictions, with a magnitude that depends on the adjacent ferromagnet, a dependence that indicates orbital effects. These results, with consistent torque efficiencies across all frequencies, corroborate a negative and intrinsic OHE in V with a large effective orbital Hall conductivity of $-(1.44 \pm 0.34)\,\frac{\hbar}{2e}\,\times 10^{5}\,\Omega^{-1}\,\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ and a long orbital diffusion length of $(15.0 \pm 2.5)\,\mathrm{nm}$. To explain the observed OHE, we develop a theoretical model incorporating both local and itinerant circulation contributions to OHE. The model agrees excellently with the experimental results, demonstrating that itinerant contributions are essential for a complete physical understanding of intrinsic OHE. Our consistent experimental and theoretical data highlight the importance of itinerant contributions governing the fundamental understanding of intrinsic OHE and the large effects found open pathways for energy-efficient orbitronic devices.</description>

      <title>Uncovering origins of heterogeneous superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using quantum sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02429</link>

Abstract: The family of nickelate superconductors have long been explored as analogs of the high temperature cuprates. Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high $T_c$ under pressure came as a surprise. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. In addition to the practical challenges posed by working in a high pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous `filamentary' superconducting states. We perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples \emph{in situ}, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell. These maps confirm significant inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few micron scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged \emph{in situ}, and stoichiometric composition, we unravel the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behavior and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure-function correlations observed at the sub-micron pixel scale.</description>

      <title>Mechanically concealed holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a hole is introduced into an elastic material, it will usually act to reduce the overall mechanical stiffness. A general ambition is to investigate whether a stiff shell around the hole can act to maintain the overall mechanical properties. We consider this effect from a macroscopic continuum perspective down to atomistic scales. First, we focus on the basic continuum example situation of an isotropic, homogeneous, linearly elastic material loaded uniformly under compressive plane strain for low concentrations of holes. As we demonstrate, the thickness of the shell can be adjusted in a way to maintain the overall stiffness of the system. We derive a corresponding mathematical expression for the thickness of the shell that conceals the hole. Thus, one can work with given materials to mask the presence of the holes simply by adjusting the thickness of the surrounding shells, with no need to change the materials. Our predictions from linear elasticity continuum theory are extended to atomistic levels using molecular dynamics simulations of a model Lennard-Jones solid. These extensions attest the robustness of our predictions down to atomistic scales. Thus, they open a straightforward possibility to adjust the strategy of mechanical cloaking via atomistic manipulations. From both perspectives, the underlying concept is important in the context of light-weight construction.</description>

      <title>Chiral orbital current driven topological Hall effect in Mn3Si2Te6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral orbital current (COC) plays a crucial role in governing the magnetization and transport behaviour in the layered ferrimagnetic nodal-line semiconductor Mn3Si2Te6. Here, we observe that the topological Hall effect (THE), typically attributed to Berry curvature from chiral spin textures, originates from COC, which produces an emergent magnetic field for conduction electrons due to its real-space orbital textures. We find that the THE signal strengthens as we move down from bulk to nanoflakes, but tends to disappear with increasing current, along with the disappearance of the COC state. We also demonstrate a strong correlation between the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and the observed THE, suggesting that large Berry curvature and topological transport can arise purely from orbital degrees of freedom, providing a new platform for engineering dissipationless transport in 2D magnets.</description>
