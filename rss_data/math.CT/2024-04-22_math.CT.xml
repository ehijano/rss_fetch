      <title>Discrete vertices in simplicial objects internal to a monoidal category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We follow the work of Aguiar on internal categories and introduce simplicial objects internal to a monoidal category as certain colax monoidal functors. Then we compare three approaches to equipping them with a discrete set of vertices. We introduce based colax monoidal functors and show that under suitable conditions they are equivalent to the templicial objects defined in arXiv:2302.02484v2. We also compare templicial objects to the enriched Segal precategories appearing in the work of Lurie, Simpson and Bacard, and show that they are equivalent for cartesian monoidal categories, but not in general.</description>

      <title>Expanding \v{C}ech cohomology for quantales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We expand \v{C}ech cohomology of a topological space $X$ with values in a presheaf on $X$ to \v{C}ech cohomology of a commutative ring with unity $R$ with values in a presheaf on $R$. The strategy is to observe that both the set of open subsets of $X$ and the set of ideals of $R$ provide examples of a (semicartesian) quantale. We study a particular pair of (adjoint) functors $(\theta, \tau)$ between the quantale of open subsets of $X$ and the quantale of ideals of $C(X)$, the ring of real-valued continuous functions on $X$. This leads to the main result of this paper: the $q$th \v{C}ech cohomology groups of $X$ with values on the constant sheaf $F$ on $X$ is isomorphic to the $q$th \v{C}ech cohomology groups of the ring $C(X)$ with values on a sheaf $F \circ \tau$ on $C(X)$.</description>

      <title>Partial orders are the free conservative cocompletion of total orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the category of partially ordered sets $\mathsf{Pos}$ is equivalent to the free conservative cocompletion of the category of finite non-empty totally ordered sets $\Delta$, which is also known as the simplex category.</description>

      <title>Bi-accessible and bipresentable 2-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.07046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a 2-dimensional version of accessibility and presentability compatible with the formalism of flat pseudofunctors. First we give prerequisites on the different notions of 2-dimensional colimits, filteredness and cofinality; in particular we show that sigma-filteredness and bifilteredness are actually equivalent in practice for our purposes. Then, we define bi-accessible and bipresentable 2-categories in terms of bicompact objects and bifiltered bicolimits. We then characterize them as categories of flat pseudofunctors. We also prove a bi-accessible right bi-adjoint functor theorem and deduce a 2-dimensional Gabriel-Ulmer duality relating small bilex 2-categories and finitely bipresentable 2-categories. Finally, we show that 2-categories of pseudo-algebras of bifinitary pseudomonads on Cat are finitely bipresentable, which in particular captures the case of Lex, the 2-category of small lex categories. Invoking the technology of lex-colimits, we prove further that several 2-categories arising in categorical logic (Reg, Ex, Coh, Ext, Adh, Pretop) are also finitely bipresentable.</description>

      <title>Length of fully faithful framed bicategories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider framed bicategories for which identity squares are Cartesian. We call framed bicategories satisfying this condition fully faithful. The length of a double category is a numerical invariant measuring the work it takes to reconstruct the double category from its globular data. It is conjectured that framed bicategories are of length 1. In this paper we prove this conjecture for the case of fully faithful framed bicategories</description>

      <title>Enhanced Auslander-Reiten duality and Morita theorem for singularity categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a Morita theorem to construct triangle equivalences between the singularity categories of (commutative and non-commutative) Gorenstein rings and the cluster categories of finite dimensional algebras over fields, and more strongly, quasi-equivalences between their canonical dg enhancements. More precisely, we prove that such an equivalence exists as soon as we find a quasi-equivalence between the graded dg singularity category of a Gorenstein ring and the derived category of a finite dimensional algebra which can be done by finding a single tilting object.
  Our result is based on two key theorems on dg enhancements of cluster categories and of singularity categories, which are of independent interest. First we give a Morita-type theorem which realizes certain $\mathbb{Z}$-graded dg categories as dg orbit categories. Secondly, we show that the canonical dg enhancements of the singularity categories of symmetric orders have the bimodule Calabi-Yau property, which lifts the classical Auslander-Reiten duality on singularity categories.
  We apply our results to such classes of rings as Gorenstein rings of dimension at most $1$, quotient singularities, and Geigle-Lenzing complete intersections, including finite or infinite Grassmannian cluster categories, to realize their singularity categories as cluster categories of finite dimensional algebras.</description>
