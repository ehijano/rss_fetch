      <title>Deformations of partially wrapped Fukaya categories of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a complete description of the A$_\infty$ deformation theory of partially wrapped Fukaya categories of graded surfaces. We show that any abstract A$_\infty$ deformation is "geometric", namely it is equivalent to the partially wrapped Fukaya category of an orbifold surface obtained as a partial compactification of the original surface. For certain genus 0 surfaces, these deformations are generically Fukaya categories of compact pillowcases.
  We introduce the notion of a weak dual and use unbounded twisted complexes to overcome the curvature problem that naturally arises when some of the boundary components are fully wrapped.
  Our results provide a first account of the relationship between A$_\infty$ deformations of Fukaya categories and partial compactifications, as advocated in P. Seidel's ICM 2002 address, in the presence of stop data. All of our results also hold when the original surface has finitely many order 2 orbifold points.</description>

      <title>Contact triad connection of contact manifolds in almost contact moving frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of \emph{contact triad connection} on contact triads $(Q,\lambda,J_\xi)$ was introduced by Wang and the present author in early 2010's from scratch as the contact analog to the canonical connection of an almost K\"ahler manifolds. The connection facilitates the study of analysis of the contact instanton equation which ranges from local elliptic priori estimates, for both the interior [OW2,OW3] and the boundary [OY], to the generic perturbation theory of the asymptotic operators [KO], which also encompasses the case of pseudoholomorphic curves on noncompact symplectic manifolds with cylindrical ends [OK]. The main purpose of the present paper is to give a simpler and more canonical construction of the contact triad connection by first giving its characterization in terms of the associated \emph{almost contact structure} and then providing its construction using the almost contact moving frame in the framework of contact geometry.</description>

      <title>Degenerate symplectic fixed points and Gromov-Witten invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04191v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a connection between Gromov-Witten invariants and the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on a closed rational symplectic manifold via deformed Hamiltonian spectral invariants. We generalize Givental's symplectic fixed point theorem for Fano toric manifolds to closed rational symplectic manifolds which admit nonzero Gromov-Witten invariants with fixed marked points and one point insertion. We prove a new cuplength estimate of symplectic fixed points involved in deformed spectral invariants. We extend Schwarz's quantum cuplength to the notion of deformed quantum cuplength for symplectic periods and employ it to estimate the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on monotone symplectic manifolds with nonzero mixed Gromov-Witten invariants.</description>

      <title>On the knot types of periodic Reeb orbits of dynamically convex contact forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exhibit transverse knot types on the standard contact $3$-sphere that cannot be realized as periodic Reeb orbits of a dynamically convex contact form. In particular, such transverse knot types do not arise as closed characteristics of strictly convex energy levels on a four dimensional symplectic vector space.</description>

      <title>Almost Hermitian structures on moduli spaces of non-Abelian monopoles and applications to the topology of symplectic four-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13809v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is a sequel to our previous monograph arXiv:2010.15789 (to appear in AMS Memoirs), where we initiated our program to prove that the Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau inequality holds for closed, symplectic four-manifolds and, more generally, for closed, smooth four-manifolds with a Seiberg-Witten basic class. This inequality was first proved for compact, complex surfaces of general type independently by Miyaoka and Yau in 1977. Our approach uses a version of Morse theory for a natural Hamiltonian, the square of the $L^2$ norm of the coupled spinors, for the circle action on the moduli space of non-Abelian monopoles over a closed four-manifold. It has the aim of proving the existence of a projectively anti-self-dual connection on a rank-two Hermitian vector bundle over a blow-up of the four-manifold, where the first Pontrjagin number of the vector bundle is negative and greater than or equal to minus the Euler characteristic of the blown-up four-manifold. Our Morse theory argument relies on positivity of virtual Morse-Bott indices for critical points of Hamiltonians for circle actions on complex analytic spaces (or real analytic spaces that, locally, are sufficiently well-approximated by complex analytic model spaces), as developed by the first author in arXiv:2206.14710. In our application to the moduli space of non-Abelian monopoles, the critical points are fixed points of the circle action and thus represented by Seiberg-Witten monopoles.</description>
