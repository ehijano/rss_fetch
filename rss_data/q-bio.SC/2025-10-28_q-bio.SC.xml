      <title>Beyond Autophagy: VPS39 Deficiency Triggers Migrasome-Driven Stress Adaptation Revealed by Super-Resolution Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autophagy and migrasome formation constitute critical cellular mechanisms for maintaining cellular homeostasis, however, their potential compensatory interplay remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify VPS39, a core component of the HOPS complex, as a molecular switch coordinating these processes. Genetic ablation of VPS39 not only impairs autophagic flux but also triggers cell migration through RhoA/Rac1 GTPases upregulation, consequently facilitating migrasome formation. Using super-resolution microscopy, we further demonstrate that migrasomes serve as an alternative disposal route for damaged mitochondria during VPS39-induced autophagy impairment, revealing a novel stress adaptation mechanism. Our work establishes a previously unrecognized autophagy-migrasome axis and provides direct visual evidence of organelle quality control via migrasomal extrusion. These findings position VPS39-regulated pathway switching as a potential therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases characterized by autophagy dysfunction.</description>

      <title>Active Hydrodynamic Theory of Euchromatin and Heterochromatin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The genome contains genetic information essential for cell's life. The genome's spatial organization inside the cell nucleus is critical for its proper function including gene regulation. The two major genomic compartments -- euchromatin and heterochromatin -- contain largely transcriptionally active and silenced genes, respectively, and exhibit distinct dynamics. In this work, we present a hydrodynamic framework that describes the large-scale behavior of euchromatin and heterochromatin, and accounts for the interplay of mechanical forces, active processes, and nuclear confinement. Our model shows contractile stresses from cross-linking proteins lead to the formation of heterochromatin droplets via mechanically driven phase separation. These droplets grow, coalesce, and in nuclear confinement, wet the boundary. Active processes, such as gene transcription in euchromatin, introduce non-equilibrium fluctuations that drive long-range, coherent motions of chromatin as well as the nucleoplasm, and thus alter the genome's spatial organization. These fluctuations also indirectly deform heterochromatin droplets, by continuously changing their shape. Taken together, our findings reveal how active forces, mechanical stresses and hydrodynamic flows contribute to the genome's organization at large scales and provide a physical framework for understanding chromatin organization and dynamics in live cells.</description>
