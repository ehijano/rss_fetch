      <title>Relative Binding Free Energy Estimation of Congeneric Ligands and Macromolecular Mutants with the Alchemical Transfer with Coordinate Swapping Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Alchemical Transfer with Coordinate Swapping (ATS) method to enable the calculation of the relative binding free energies between large congeneric ligands and single-point mutant peptides to protein receptors with the Alchemical Transfer Method (ATM) framework. Similarly to ATM, the new method implements the alchemical transformation as a coordinate transformation, and works with any unmodified force fields and standard chemical topologies. Unlike ATM, which transfers the whole ligands in and out of the receptor binding site, ATS limits the magnitude of the alchemical perturbation by transferring only the portion of the molecules that differ between the the bound and unbound ligands. The common region of the two ligands, which can be arbitrarily large, is unchanged and does not contribute to the magnitude and statistical fluctuations of the perturbation energy. Internally, the coordinates of the atoms of the common regions are swapped to maintain the integrity of the covalent bonding data structures of the molecular dynamics engine. The work successfully validates the method on protein-ligand and protein-peptide RBFE benchmarks. This advance paves the road for the application of the relative binding free energy Alchemical Transfer Method protocol to study the effect of protein and nucleic acid mutations on the binding affinity and specificity of macromolecular complexes.</description>

      <title>From Generalist to Specialist: A Survey of Large Language Models for Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly transformed our daily life and established a new paradigm in natural language processing (NLP). However, the predominant pretraining of LLMs on extensive web-based texts remains insufficient for advanced scientific discovery, particularly in chemistry. The scarcity of specialized chemistry data, coupled with the complexity of multi-modal data such as 2D graph, 3D structure and spectrum, present distinct challenges. Although several studies have reviewed Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) in chemistry, there is a conspicuous absence of a systematic survey specifically focused on chemistry-oriented LLMs. In this paper, we outline methodologies for incorporating domain-specific chemistry knowledge and multi-modal information into LLMs, we also conceptualize chemistry LLMs as agents using chemistry tools and investigate their potential to accelerate scientific research. Additionally, we conclude the existing benchmarks to evaluate chemistry ability of LLMs. Finally, we critically examine the current challenges and identify promising directions for future research. Through this comprehensive survey, we aim to assist researchers in staying at the forefront of developments in chemistry LLMs and to inspire innovative applications in the field.</description>

      <title>A Verbose Note on Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note is intended for expanding the details on the derivation and properties of density functional theory, in hope to make them more systematic, better motivated, and step-by-step for readers new to the domain. The note starts with basic concepts in quantum mechanics, then takes the step towards many-body systems using the tools of second quantization and Fock space, with some highlights on properties of the Coulomb system. Given these general technical preparations, the Hartree-Fock method is naturally unrolled, with expressions for various cases and quantities. Density functional theory is then presented, with a motivating reasoning of the Kohn-Sham formulation, and a connection and comparison of the expressions with the Hartree-Fock method. Lieb's celebrated 1983 paper on functional analysis on density functionals is also summarized.</description>

      <title>Capturing strong correlation effects on a quantum annealer: calculation of avoided crossing in the H$_4$ molecule using the quantum annealer eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We broaden the scope of the Quantum Annealer Eigensolver (QAE) algorithm, an underexplored noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era approach for calculating atomic and molecular properties, to predict avoided crossings, where strong correlation effects are at play. For this purpose, we consider the classic example of the H$_4$ molecule in a rectangular geometry. Our results are obtained on the 5000-qubit D-Wave Advantage system 4.1 quantum computer. We benchmark our quantum annealing results with full configuration interaction (FCI) as well as with those obtained using simulated annealing. We find that we can predict avoided crossings within about 1.1% of the FCI value on real quantum hardware. We carry out analyses on the effect of the number of shots, anneal time, and the choice of Lagrange multiplier on our obtained results. Since the QAE algorithm provides information on the wave function as its output, we also check the quality of the computed wave function by calculating the fidelity, and find it to be 99.886%. Finally, we qualitatively discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the QAE algorithm relative to its gate-based NISQ algorithm counterpart, the celebrated Variational Quantum Eigensolver. Our work contributes to the existing body of literature on QAE by demonstrating that high-quality results can be achieved on noisy hardware.</description>

      <title>Topological analysis reveals multiple pathways in molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics simulations are essential tools for understanding the dynamic behavior of biomolecules, yet extracting meaningful molecular pathways from these simulations remains challenging due to the vast amount of generated data. In this work, we present Molecular Kinetics via Topology (MoKiTo), a novel approach that combines machine learning techniques to determine the reaction coordinate of a molecular system with a topological analysis inspired by the Mapper algorithm. Our strategy efficiently identifies and characterizes distinct molecular pathways, enabling the detection and visualization of critical conformational transitions and rare events. This method offers deeper insights into molecular mechanisms, facilitating the design of targeted interventions in drug discovery and protein engineering.</description>

      <title>Rotational excitation cross sections for chloronium based on a new 5D interaction potential with molecular hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chloronium (H$_2$Cl$^+$) is an important intermediate of Cl-chemistry in space. The accurate knowledge of its collisional properties allows a better interpretation of the corresponding observations in interstellar clouds and therefore a better estimation of its abundance in these environments. While the ro-vibrational spectroscopy of H$_2$Cl$^+$ is well known, the studies of its collisional excitation are rather limited and these are available for the interaction with helium atoms only. We provide a new 5-dimensional rigid-rotor potential energy surface for the interaction of H$_2$Cl$^+$ with H$_2$, calculated from explicitly correlated coupled cluster ab initio theory, which was fitted then with a set of analytical functions, allowing to perform scattering calculations using accurate quantum theories. We analyze the collision-energy-dependence of the rotational state-to-state cross sections and the temperature dependence of the corresponding thermal rate coefficients, with a particular attention on the collisional propensity rules. When comparing our results for collisions with H$_2$ with those obtained with He as a colliding partner, we found very significant differences with non-linear scaling trends, which proves again that He is not a suitable proxy for collisions between hydride molecules and molecular hydrogen, the most abundant gas particle in the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning of Slow Collective Variables and Enhanced Sampling via Spatial Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the long-time dynamics of complex physical processes depends on our ability to recognize patterns. To simplify the description of these processes, we often introduce a set of reaction coordinates, customarily referred to as collective variables (CVs). The quality of these CVs heavily impacts our comprehension of the dynamics, often influencing the estimates of thermodynamics and kinetics from atomistic simulations. Consequently, identifying CVs poses a fundamental challenge in chemical physics. Recently, significant progress was made by leveraging the predictive ability of unsupervised machine learning techniques to determine CVs. Many of these techniques require temporal information to learn slow CVs that correspond to the long timescale behavior of the studied process. Here, however, we specifically focus on techniques that can identify CVs corresponding to the slowest transitions between states without needing temporal trajectories as input, instead using the spatial characteristics of the data. We discuss the latest developments in this category of techniques and briefly discuss potential directions for thermodynamics-informed spatial learning of slow CVs.</description>

      <title>Towards detection of molecular parity violation via chiral co-sensing: the $^1$H/$^{31}$P model system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fundamental weak interactions have been shown to violate parity in both nuclear and atomic systems. However, observation of parity violation in a molecular system has proven an elusive target. Nuclear spin dependent contributions of the weak interaction are expected to result in energetic differences between enantiomers manifesting in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra as chemical shift differences on the order of $10^{-6}$ Hz to $10^{-3}$ Hz for high-$Z$ nuclei. By employing simultaneous measurements of the diastereomeric splittings for a light and a heavy nucleus in solution-state NMR, residual chemical shift differences persisting in non-chiral environment between enantiomers of chiral compounds smaller than the typical linewidth of high-field NMR may be resolved. Sources of error must be identified and minimized to verify that the observed effect is, in fact, due to parity violation and not systematic effects. This paper presents a detailed analysis of a system incorporating \textsuperscript{31}P and \textsuperscript{1}H NMR to elucidate the systematic effects and to guide experiments with higher-$Z$ nuclei where molecular parity violation may be resolved.</description>

      <title>Impact of Doping Spiro-OMeTAD with Li-TFSI, FK209, and tBP on the Performance of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study delves into the effects of doping Spiro-OMeTAD, a widely employed hole transport material (HTM) in perovskite solar cells, with three distinct impurities: lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI), FK209, and tertbutylpyridine (tBP). The focus lies on their influence on critical photovoltaic parameters, including Fill Factor (FF), power conversion efficiency (eta), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and open-circuit voltage (Voc). Employing advanced simulation tools, we systematically compare the performance of undoped and doped Spiro-OMeTAD structures. Among the examined dopants, Li-TFSI exhibits the most pronounced enhancements, significantly improving both FF and efficiency. In contrast, FK209 and tBP yield moderate gains in device performance. These results underscore the superior charge transport properties imparted by Li-TFSI doping and its capacity to optimize HTM functionality, thereby presenting a promising approach to advancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells</description>

      <title>Chemical Compositions of Soot Samples in Gold Electrode Capacitors: Molecular Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrical breakdown in a dielectric capacitor occurs when the electric field strength across the dielectric material exceeds its breakdown strength. A conductive channel through the dielectric emerges, resulting in a sudden surge of current. Self-healing represents a phenomenon of restoration of a capacitor's performance. The efficiency of self-healing depends on the products of high-temperature decomposition of the electrode and dielectric. We report atomistic simulations of the soot's chemical composition in the case of gold electrodes and four popular dielectric polymers: polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polycarbonate (PC), and polyimide (PI). We unravel that gold atoms form clusters within the carbon-rich soot, limiting their interactions with non-metal elements. The oxygen atoms of PET, PC, and PI act as stabilizers of gold thanks to electrostatic attraction. Compared to zinc, gold equalizes the soot conductivity in all samples but does not impact polymer gasification. The suitability of dielectrics for self-healing must be rated based on the volatile by-products: PP &gt; PC &gt; PET &gt; PI. Mind that PP issues three times more gases than PI. Therefore, the size of semiconducting soot is substantially smaller in the case of PP than in the case of PI. The obtained numerical results provide unprecedented physical insights into the phenomenon of self-healing and clearly drive the efforts to extend the lifespans of the metalized film capacitors.</description>

      <title>A Universal Method to Transform Aromatic Hydrocarbon Molecules into Confined Carbyne inside Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbyne, a sp1-hybridized allotrope of carbon, is a linear carbon chain with exceptional theoretically predicted properties that surpass those of sp2-hybridized graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). However, the existence of carbyne has been debated due to its instability caused by Peierls distortion, which limits its practical development. The only successful synthesis of carbyne has been achieved inside CNTs, resulting in a form known as confined carbyne (CC). However, CC can only be synthesized inside multi-walled CNTs, limiting its property-tuning capabilities to the inner tubes of the CNTs. Here, we present a universal method for synthesizing CC inside single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with diameter of 0.9-1.3 nm. Aromatic hydrocarbon molecules are filled inside SWCNTs and subsequently transformed into CC under low-temperature annealing. A variety of aromatic hydrocarbon molecules are confirmed as effective precursors for formation of CC, with Raman frequencies centered around 1861 cm-1. Enriched (6,5) and (7,6) SWCNTs with diameters less than 0.8 nm are less effective than the SWCNTs with diameter of 0.9-1.3 nm for CC formation. Furthermore, resonance Raman spectroscopy reveals that optical band gap of the CC at 1861 cm-1 is 2.353 eV, which is consistent with the result obtained using a linear relationship between the Raman signal and optical band gap. This newly developed approach provides a versatile route for synthesizing CC from various precursor molecules inside diverse templates, which is not limited to SWCNTs but could extend to any templates with appropriate size, including molecular sieves, zeolites, boron nitride nanotubes, and metal-organic frameworks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Activity, which represents the kinetic property of dynamics, plays a central role in obtaining thermodynamic speed limits (TSLs). In this paper, we discuss a unified framework that provides the existing TSLs based on different activities such as dynamical activity and dynamical state mobility. We also derive an infinite variety of TSLs for Markov jump processes and deterministic chemical reaction networks by using different activities defined by the generalized means. The lower bound on the entropy production given by each TSL provides the minimum dissipation achievable by a conservative force. We numerically and analytically discuss the tightness of the lower bounds on the EPR in the various TSLs.</description>

      <title>One Pot Synthesis of Cubic Gauche Polymeric Nitrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The long sought cubic gauche polymeric nitrogen (cg-N) consisting of N-N single bonds has been synthesized by a simple route using sodium azide as a precursor at ambient conditions. The recrystallization process was designed to expose crystal faces with low activation energy that facilitates initiating the polymeric reaction at ambient conditions. The azide was considered as a precursor due to the low energy barrier in transforming double bonded N=N to single bonded cg-N. Raman spectrum measurements detected the emerging vibron peaks at 635 cm-1 for the polymerized sodium azide samples, demonstrating the formation of cg-N with N-N single bonds. Different from traditional high pressure technique and recently developed plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition method, the route achieves the quantitative synthesis of cg-N at ambient conditions. The simple method to synthesize cg-N offers potential for further scale up production as well as practical applications of polymeric nitrogen based materials as high energy density materials.</description>

      <title>Submillimeter-wave spectroscopy of the CH$_3$O radical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The methoxy radical, CH$_3$O, has long been studied experimentally and theoretically by spectroscopists because it displays a weak Jahn-Teller effect in its electronic ground state, combined with a strong spin-orbit interaction. In this work, we report an extension of the measurement of the pure rotational spectrum of the radical in its vibrational ground state in the submillimeter-wave region (350$-$860 GHz). CH$_3$O was produced by H-abstraction from methanol using F-atoms, and its spectrum was probed in absorption using an association of source-frequency modulation and Zeeman modulation spectroscopy. All the observed transitions together with available literature data in $v = 0$ were combined and fit using an effective Hamiltonian allowing to reproduce the data at their experimental accuracy. The newly measured transitions involve significantly higher frequencies and rotational quantum numbers than those reported in the literature ($f &lt; 860$ GHz and $N \leq 15$ instead of 272 GHz and 7, respectively) which results in significant improvements in the spectroscopic parameters determination. The present model is well constrained and allows a reliable calculation of the rotational spectrum of the radical over the entire microwave to submillimeter-wave domain. It can be used with confidence for future searches of CH$_3$O in the laboratory and the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Live magnetic observation of parahydrogen hyperpolarization dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10766v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperpolarized nuclear spins in molecules exhibit high magnetization that is unachievable by classical polarization techniques, making them widely used as sensors in physics, chemistry, and medicine. The state of a hyperpolarized material, however, is typically only studied indirectly and with partial destruction of magnetization, due to the nature of conventional detection by resonant-pickup nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy or imaging. Here we establish atomic magnetometers with sub-pT sensitivity as an alternative modality to detect in real time the complex dynamics of hyperpolarized materials without disturbing or interrupting the magnetogenesis process. As an example of dynamics that are impossible to detect in real time by conventional means, we examine parahydrogen-induced $^{1}$H and $^{13}$C magnetization during adiabatic eigenbasis transformations at $\mu$T-field avoided crossings. Continuous but nondestructive magnetometry reveals previously unseen spin dynamics, fidelity limits, and magnetization backaction effects. As a second example, we apply magnetometry to observe the chemical-exchange-driven $^{13}$C hyperpolarization of [1--$^{13}$C]-pyruvate -- the most important spin tracer for clinical metabolic imaging. The approach can be readily combined with other high-sensitivity magnetometers and is applicable to a broader range of general observation scenarios involving production, transport and systems interaction of hyperpolarized compounds.</description>

      <title>A Basis-Free Phase Space Electronic Hamiltonian That Recovers Beyond Born-Oppenheimer Electronic Momentum and Current Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a phase-space electronic Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_{PS}$ (parameterized by both nuclear position $\mathbf{X}$ and momentum $\mathbf{P}$) that boosts each electron into the moving frame of the nuclei that are closest in real space -- without presuming the existence of an atomic orbital basis. We show that $(i)$ quantum-classical dynamics along such a Hamiltonian maintains momentum conservation and $(ii)$ diagonalizing such a Hamiltonian can recover the electronic momentum and electronic current density reasonably well. In conjunction with other reports in the literature that such a phase-space approach can also recover vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectra, we submit that the present phase-space approach offers a testable and powerful approach to post-Born-Oppenheimer electronic structure theory. Moreover, the approach is inexpensive and can be immediately applied to simulations of chiral induced spin selectivity experiments (where the transfer of angular momentum between nuclei and electrons is considered critical).</description>

      <title>An Investigation of Physics Informed Neural Networks to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann Equation in Molecular Electrostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) is a machine learning (ML)-based method to solve partial differential equations that has gained great popularity due to the fast development of ML libraries in the last few years. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE) is widely used to model mean-field electrostatics in molecular systems, and in this work we present a detailed investigation of the use of PINN to solve the PBE. Starting from a multidomain PINN for the PBE with an interface, we assess the importance of incorporating different features into the neural network architecture. Our findings indicate that the most accurate architecture utilizes input and output scaling layers, a random Fourier features layer, trainable activation functions, and a loss balancing algorithm. The accuracy of our implementation is of the order of 10$^{-2}$ -- $10^{-3}$, which is similar to previous work using PINN to solve other differential equations. We also explore the possibility of incorporating experimental information into the model, and discuss challenges and future work, especially regarding the nonlinear PBE. Along with this manuscript, we are providing an open-source implementation to easily perform computations from a PDB file. We hope this work will motivate application scientists into using PINN to study molecular electrostatics, as ML technology continues to evolve at a high pace.</description>

      <title>Spectro-temporal symmetry in action-detected optical spectroscopy: highlighting excited-state dynamics in large systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multidimensional optical spectroscopy observes transient excitation dynamics through the time evolution of spectral correlations. Its action-detected variants offer several advantages over the coherent detection and are thus becoming increasingly widespread. Nevertheless, a drawback of action-detected spectra is the presence of a large stationary background of so-called incoherent mixing of excitations from independent states that resembles a product of ground-state absorption spectra and obscures the excited-state signal. This issue is especially problematic in fluorescence-detected two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (F-2DES) and fluorescence-detected pump--probe spectroscopy (F-PP) of extended systems, where large incoherent mixing arises from efficient exciton--exciton annihilation. In this work, we demonstrate on the example of F-2DES and F-PP an inherent spectro-temporal symmetry of action-detected spectra, which allows general, system-independent subtraction of any stationary signals including incoherent mixing. We derive the expressions for spectra with normal and reversed time ordering of the pulses, relating these to the symmetry of the system response. As we demonstrate both analytically and numerically, the difference signal constructed from spectra with normal and reversed pulse ordering is free of incoherent mixing and highlights the excitation dynamics. We further verify the approach on the experimental F-PP spectra of a molecular squaraine heterodimer and the F-2DES spectra of the photosynthetic antenna LH2 of purple bacteria. The approach is generally applicable to action-detected 2DES and pump--probe spectroscopy without experimental modifications and independent of the studied system, enabling their application to large systems such as molecular complexes.</description>

      <title>Eigensolutions and thermodynamic properties of generalized hyperbolic Hulthen and Woods-Saxon potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and the thermodynamic properties of generalized hyperbolic Hulthen and Woods-Saxon potential. The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions were found using the parametric Nikiforov-Uvarov method (PNUM). The clean energies of the molecules HCl, NiC, CO, I$_2$, H$_2$, LiH, CuLi and CrH are calculated for certain values of $n$ and $\ell$. They are positive and close to the energy of the ground state ($n= \ell= 0$) in the case of the atomic unit (whose energies become negative for $n=2$). The figures show that the proper energies decrease as $n$, $\ell$, $\alpha$ increase, while they increase as $m$ increases, which confirms the results obtained in the literature. The obtained energy was used to calculate the partition function from which thermodynamic properties such as average energy, specific heat capacity, entropy and free energy are calculated. Numerical results are generated for this generalized hyperbolic Hulthen and Woods-Saxon potential. This study showed that the disorder decreases if the temperature decreases and this decrease is more rapid for HCl and H$_{2}$ molecules.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory dissipative tunneling in an asymmetric double-well potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dissipative tunneling remains a cornerstone effect in quantum mechanics. In chemistry, it plays a crucial role in governing the rates of chemical reactions, often modeled as the motion along the reaction coordinate from one potential well to another. The relative positions of energy levels in these wells strongly influence the reaction dynamics. Chemical research will benefit from a fully adjustable, asymmetric double-well equipped with precise measurement capabilities of the tunneling rates. In this paper, we show a quantum simulator system that consists of a continuously driven Kerr parametric oscillator with a third order non-linearity that can be operated in the quantum regime to create a fully tunable asymmetric double-well. Our experiment leverages a low-noise, all-microwave control system with a high-efficiency readout, based on a tunnel Josephson junction circuit, of the which-well information. We explore the reaction rates across the landscape of tunneling resonances in parameter space. We uncover two new and counter-intuitive effects: (i) a weak asymmetry can significantly decrease the activation rates, even though the well in which the system is initialized is made shallower, and (ii) the width of the tunneling resonances alternates between narrow and broad lines as a function of the well depth and asymmetry. We predict by numerical simulations that both effects will also manifest themselves in ordinary chemical double-well systems in the quantum regime. Our work is a first step for the development of analog molecule simulators of proton transfer reactions based on quantum superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-order tensors. After decades of research, we recently achieve an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ \citep{bonvicini2024irreducible} with factorial time/space complexity. This work, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contraction with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set \citep{pearce2023brauer}, through this path matrices technique. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available in https://github.com/ShihaoShao-GH/ICT-decomposition-and-equivariant-bases where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s, respectively.</description>

      <title>Identifying Split Vacancies with Foundation Models and Electrostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Point defects are ubiquitous in solid-state compounds, dictating many functional properties such as conductivity, catalytic activity and carrier recombination. Over the past decade, the prevalence of metastable defect geometries and their importance to relevant properties has been increasingly recognised. A particularly striking example of this is split vacancies, where an isolated atomic vacancy transforms to a stoichiometry-conserving complex of two vacancies and an interstitial ($V_X \rightarrow [V_X + X_i + V_X]$), which can be accompanied by a dramatic lowering of the defect energy and change in behaviour. Such species are particularly challenging to identify from computation, due to the `non-local' nature of this reconstruction. Here, I present an approach for efficiently identifying such species in solid-state compounds, through tiered screening which combines geometric analysis, electrostatic energies and foundation machine learning (ML) models. This approach allows the screening of all compounds in the Materials Project database (including all entries in the ICSD, along with several thousand predicted metastable materials), identifying thousands of split vacancy configurations, hitherto unknown. This study highlights both the potential utility of machine-learning potentials for defect investigations, with important caveats, and the importance of global optimisation approaches for correctly identifying stable defect geometries.</description>
