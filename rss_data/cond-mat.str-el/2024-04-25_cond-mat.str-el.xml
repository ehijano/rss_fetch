      <title>Fractional quantum Hall effect of partons and the nature of the 8/17 state in the zeroth Landau level of bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at the filling factor $8/17$, where signatures of incompressibility have been observed in the zeroth Landau level of bilayer graphene. We propose an Abelian state described by the "$\overline{(8/3)}\bar{2}1^{3}$" parton wave function, where a parton itself forms an FQHE state. This state is topologically distinct from the $8/17$ Levin-Halperin state, a daughter state of the Moore-Read state. We carry out extensive numerical exact diagonalization of the Coulomb interaction at 8/17 in the zeroth Landau level of bilayer graphene but find that our results cannot conclusively determine the topological order of the underlying ground state. We work out the low-energy effective theory of the $\overline{(8/3)}\bar{2}1^{3}$ edge and make predictions for experimentally measurable properties of the state which can tell it apart from the 8/17 Levin-Halperin state.</description>

      <title>Possible gapless quantum spin liquid behavior in the triangular-lattice Ising antiferromagnet PrMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) represent a novel state where spins are highly entangled but do not order even at zero temperature due to strong quantum fluctuations. Such a state is mostly studied in Heisenberg models defined on geometrically frustrated lattices. Here, we turn to a new triangular-lattice antiferromagnet PrMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$, in which the interactions are believed to be of Ising type. Magnetic susceptibility measured with an external field along the $c$ axis is two orders of magnitude larger than that with a field in the $ab$ plane, displaying an ideal easy-axis behavior. Meanwhile, there is no magnetic phase transition or spin freezing observed down to 1.8 K. Ultralow-temperature specific heat measured down to 50 mK does not capture any phase transition either, but a hump at 4.5 K, below which the magnetic specific heat exhibits a quasi-quadratic temperature dependence that is consistent with a Dirac QSL state. Inelastic neutron scattering technique is also employed to elucidate the nature of its ground state. In the magnetic excitation spectra, there is a gapless broad continuum at the base temperature 55~mK, in favor of the realization of a gapless QSL. Our results provide a scarce example for the QSL behaviors observed in an Ising-type magnet, which can serve as a promising platform for future research on QSL physics based on an Ising model.</description>

      <title>Partial Renormalization of Quasiparticle Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocal effective interactions are inherent to non-relativistic quantum many-body systems, but their systematic resummation poses a significant challenge known as the ``vertex problem" in many-body perturbation theory. We introduce a renormalization scheme based on a projection-based renormalization condition that selectively resums the most essential nonlocal contributions to the effective interaction vertex, avoiding the computational complexity of the full vertex function. This enables us to derive a renormalized Feynman diagrammatic series with large parameters canceled by counter-diagrams, efficiently generated using a perturbative expansion of the parquet equations and computed using a diagrammatic Monte Carlo algorithm. Applying our approach to a 3D Yukawa Fermi liquid, we demonstrate that the renormalized perturbation theory remains predictive even in the strongly correlated regime and uncover significant sign cancellations between different channels contributing to the scattering amplitude. Our work establishes a novel framework for investigating strong correlations in quantum many-body systems, offering a systematic approach to explore nonlocal theories for challenging systems like the electron liquid in material science.</description>

      <title>Some understanding of recent inelastic neutron scattering on Ce-pyrochlores: Signatures of electric monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the pyrochlore spin liquid materials Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ by examining the existing experiments. We continue to rely on the special properties of the dipole-octupole nature of the Ce$^{3+}$ moment. The inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurement in the octupolar U(1) spin liquid {\sl selects} the (gapped) spinon continuum, and thus has suppressed spectral weights below the energy threshold of two spinon gaps. This measurement, however, includes all other emergent excitations at lower energies in the dipolar U(1) spin liquid, in particular, the gapless photon and the continuum of {\sl the electric monopoles}. Although the electric monopole continuum is weakly gapped (compared to the larger spinon gap), the energy scale is actually close to the gauge photons, and the spectrum largely overlaps with the photons. Due to the background dual $\pi$ flux for the electric monopoles, the density of states is enhanced at lower energies, creating peak structures. This can be contrasted with the linearly suppressed spectral weight of the gauge photons at low energies. We propose that the electric monopole continuum should be mostly responsible for the low-energy spectrum in the INS measurement in the dipolar U(1) spin liquid. With these understanding and calculation, we discuss the available experimental results and predict further experiments for Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Emergent Topological Semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A material's electronic topology, which is generally described via its Bloch states and the associated bandstructure, will be enriched by the presence of interactions. In metallic settings, the interactions are usually treated through the concept of quasiparticles. Using the genuinely quantum critical heavy fermion compound CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$, we investigate what happens if no well-defined quasiparticles are present. Surprisingly, we discover a topological semimetal phase that emerges from the material's quantum critical state and exhibits a dome structure as a function of magnetic field and pressure. To understand these results, we study a Weyl-Kondo semimetal model at a Kondo destruction quantum critical point. Indeed, it exhibits features in the spectral function that can define topological crossings beyond the quasiparticle picture. We expect our work to stimulate the search for other emergent topological phases.</description>

      <title>Spin Supersolid Phase and Double Magnon-Roton Excitations in a Cobalt-based Triangular Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersolid is an exotic quantum state of matter that hosts spontaneously the features of both solid and superfluidity, which breaks the lattice translational symmetry and U(1) gauge symmetry. Here we conduct inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements and tensor-network calculations on the triangular-lattice cobaltate Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$, which is proposed in [Xiang ${\it et al.}$, Nature 625, 270-275 (2024)] as a quantum magnetic analog of supersolid. We uncover characteristic dynamical signatures, which include distinct magnetic Bragg peaks indicating out-of-plane spin solidity and gapless Goldstone modes corresponding to the in-plane spin superfluidity, offering comprehensive spectroscopic evidence for spin supersolid in Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$. We also compute spin dynamics of the easy-axis triangular-lattice model, and reveal magnon-roton excitations containing U(1) Goldstone and roton modes associated with the in-plane spin superfluidity, as well as pseudo-Goldstone and roton modes related to the out-of-plane spin solidity, rendering double magnon-roton dispersions in the spin supersolid. Akin to the role of phonon-roton dispersion in shaping the helium thermodynamics, the intriguing magnetic excitations also strongly influence the low-temperature thermodynamics of spin supersolid down to sub-Kelvin regime, explaining the recently observed giant magnetocaloric effect in Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$.</description>

      <title>Massive Higher-Spin Fields in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incompressibility plays a key role in the geometric description of fractional quantum Hall fluids. It is naturally related to quantum area-preserving diffeomorphisms and the underlying Girvin-MacDonald-Plazman algebra, which gives rise to an emergent non-relativistic massive spin-2 mode propagating in the bulk. The corresponding metric tensor can be identified with a nematic order parameter for the bulk states. In the linearised regime with a flat background, it has been shown that this mode can be described by a spin-2 Schroedinger action. However, quantum area-preserving diffeomorphisms also suggest the existence of higher-spin modes that cannot be described through nematic fractional quantum Hall states. Here, we consider p-atic Hall phases, in which the corresponding p-atic order parameters are related to higher-rank symmetric tensors. We then show that in this framework, non-relativistic massive chiral higher-spin fields naturally emerge and that their dynamics is described by higher-spin Schroedinger actions. We finally show that these effective actions can be derived from relativistic massive higher-spin theories in 2+1 dimensions after taking a non-relativistic limit.</description>

      <title>The quantum adiabatic algorithm suppresses the proliferation of errors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propagation of errors severely compromises the reliability of quantum computations. The quantum adiabatic algorithm is a physically motivated method to prepare ground states of classical and quantum Hamiltonians. Here, we analyze the proliferation of a single error event in the adiabatic algorithm. We give numerical evidence using tensor network methods that the intrinsic properties of adiabatic processes effectively constrain the amplification of errors during the evolution for geometrically local Hamiltonians. Our findings indicate that low energy states could remain attainable even in the presence of a single error event, which contrasts with results for error propagation in typical quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Helical trilayer graphene in magnetic field: Chern mosaic and higher Chern number ideal flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Helical trilayer graphene (hTG) exhibits a supermoir\'e pattern with large domains centered around stacking points ABA and BAB, where two well-separated low-energy bands appear with different total Chern numbers at each valley, forming a Chern mosaic pattern. In the chiral limit, the low-energy bands become exactly flat at zero energy for magic-angle twists. Here we investigate these zero-energy flat bands and their topological properties in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. We show that hTG retains the precise flatness of the zero-energy bands, even at finite magnetic fields. We find topological phase transitions at fields corresponding to unit and half magnetic flux leading to an emergence of higher Chern number flat bands. Consequently the Chern mosaic gets modified for finite magnetic fields. We further find the analytical forms of zero-energy wave functions and identify a set of hidden wave functions, which gives crucial insights into both the topological transitions and enhancement of Chern numbers across them. We also find topological transitions away from the chiral limit with finite corrugations and at different magic angles.</description>

      <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis and Magnetic Properties of the Mixed-Valent Binary Silver(I,II) Fluorides, AgI2AgIIF4 and AgIAgIIF3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluoridoargentates(II) represent a fascinating class of silver(II) compounds that exhibit structural and magnetic similarities to cuprate superconductors. However, their synthesis is challenging, leaving their properties largely unexplored. In this study, mechanochemistry is introduced as a new technique for the synthesis of fluoridoargentates(II), which avoids the use of anhydrous HF or heating, and employs simple equipment. Furthermore, by ball milling of commercially available precursors, AgF and AgF2, we obtained the first two examples of binary mixed-valent silver(I,II) phases, AgI2AgIIF4 and AgIAgIIF3. While the AgI2AgIIF4 phase was obtained at room temperature, the AgIAgIIF3 phase is metastable and required milling under cryogenic conditions. Using synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction, it was found that AgI2AgIIF4 crystallizes in the P21/c space group and is isostructural to beta-K2AgF4. Here, double-bridged [AgF6]4- octahedra form chains that propagate along the a-crystallographic direction, giving a quasi-1D canted antiferromagnetic character, as shown by magnetic susceptibility. The AgIAgIIF phase adopts the P-1 space group, is isostructural to AgCuF3 and shows features of a one-dimensional antiferromagnet. It is expected that this facile synthetic approach will enable the expansion of silver(II) chemistry and accelerate the search for a silver analogue to cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Flat bands in chiral multilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the formation and properties of perfectly-flat zero energy bands in a multi-layer graphene systems in the chiral limit. Employing the degrees of freedoms of the multi-layer system, such as relative twist-angle and relative shifts, in a way that preserves a set of symmetries, we define a two-dimensional parameter plane that hosts lines of two and four flat bands. This plane enables adiabatic continuation of multi-layer chiral systems to weakly coupled bi- and tri-layer systems, and through that mapping provides tools for calculating the Chern numbers of the flat bands. We show that a flat band of Chern number $C$ can be spanned by $C$ effective Landau levels, all experiencing an effective flux of $1/C$ flux quantum per unit cell, and each carrying its own intra-unit-cell wave function. The flat bands do not disperse under the effect of a perpendicular magnetic field, and the gap to the dispersive bands closes when the externally applied flux cancels the $1/C$ effective flux.</description>

      <title>Non-onsite symmetries and quantum teleportation in split-index matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a class of spin chains with new physical and computational properties. On the physical side, the spin chains give examples of symmetry-protected topological phases that are defined by non-onsite symmetries, i.e. symmetries that are not a tensor product of single-site operators. These phases can be detected by string-order parameters, but notably do not exhibit entanglement spectrum degeneracy. On the computational side, the spin chains represent a new class of states that can be used to deterministically teleport information across long distances, with the novel property that the necessary classical side processing is a non-linear function of the measurement outcomes. We also give examples of states that can serve as universal resources for measurement-based quantum computation, providing the first examples of such resources without entanglement spectrum degeneracy. The key tool in our analysis is a new kind of tensor network representation which we call split-index matrix product states (SIMPS). We develop the basic formalism of SIMPS, compare them to matrix product states, show how they are better equipped to describe certain kinds of non-onsite symmetries and quantum teleportation, and discuss how they are also well-suited to describing constrained spin chains.</description>

      <title>Tricriticality in 4D U(1) Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 4D compact U(1) gauge theory has a well-established phase transition between a confining and a Coulomb phase. In this paper, we revisit this model using state-of-the-art Monte Carlo simulations on anisotropic lattices. We map out the coupling-temperature phase diagram, and determine the location of the tricritical point, $T/K_0 \simeq 0.19$, below which the first-order transition is observed. We find the critical exponents of the high-temperature second-order transition to be compatible with those of the 3-dimensional $O(2)$ model. Our results at higher temperatures can be compared with literature results and are consistent with them. Surprisingly, below $T/K_0 \simeq 0.05$ we find strong indications of a second tricritical point where the first-order transition becomes continuous. These results suggest an unexpected second-order phase transition extending down to zero temperature, contrary to the prevailing consensus. If confirmed, these findings reopen the question of the detailed characterization of the transition including a suitable field theory description.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Order parameters represent a fundamental resource to characterize quantum matter. We show that pair superfluids can be rigorously defined in terms of a nonlocal order parameter, named odd parity, which derivation is experimentally accessible by local density measurements. As a case of study, we first investigate a constrained Bose-Hubbard model at different densities, both in one and two spatial dimensions. Here, our analysis finds pair superfluidity for relatively strong attractive interactions. The odd parity operator acts as the unique order parameter for such phase irrespectively to the density of the system and its dimensionality. In order to enforce our finding, we confirm the generality of our approach also on a two-component Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, which experimental realization represents a timely topic in ultracold atomic systems. Our results shed new light on the role of correlated density fluctuations in pair superfluids. In addition, they provide a powerful tool for the experimental detection of such exotic phases and the characterization of their transition to the normal superfluid phase.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals with magnetic ordering provide a promising platform for the investigation of rare topological effects such as the anomalous Hall effect, resulting from the interplay of nontrivial bands with various spin configurations. The materials $R$AlSi, where $R$ represents a rare-earth element, are prominent representatives of Weyl semimetals, where the Weyl states are induced by space inversion symmetry breaking and in addition, for several rare-earth elements $R$, enhanced by time-reversal symmetry breaking through the formation of a magnetic order at low temperature. We report optical signatures of Weyl fermions in the magnetic compounds CeAlSi, PrAlSi, NdAlSi, and SmAlSi as well as the non-magnetic family member LaAlSi by broad-frequency infrared spectroscopy at room temperature, i.e., in the paramagnetic phase. A similar profile of the optical conductivity spectrum and a metallic character are observed for all compounds, with LaAlSi showing the strongest free charge carrier contribution. Furthermore, the linear-in-frequency behavior of the optical conductivity of all investigated compounds indicates the presence of Weyl nodes in close vicinity of the Fermi energy, resulting from inversion symmetry breaking in noncentrosymmetric structures. According to the characteristics of these linear slopes, the $R$AlSi compounds are expected to host mainly type-II Weyl states with overtilted Weyl cones. The results are compared to the optical response of the closely related $R$AlGe materials, which are considered as potential hybridization-driven Weyl-Kondo systems.</description>

      <title>Charge Density Wave Ordering in NdNiO$_2$: Effects of Multiorbital Nonlocal Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09983v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate collective electronic fluctuations and, in particular, the possibility of the charge density wave ordering in an infinite-layer NdNiO$_2$. We perform advanced many-body calculations for the ab-initio three-orbital model by taking into account local correlation effects, non-local charge and magnetic fluctuations, and the electron-phonon coupling. We find that in the considered material, electronic correlations are strongly orbital- and momentum-dependent. Notably, the charge density wave and magnetic instabilities originate from distinct orbitals. In particular, we show that the correlation effects lead to the momentum-dependent hybridization between different orbitals, resulting in the splitting and shifting of the flat part of the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ band. This strong renormalization of the electronic spectral function drives the charge density wave instability that is related to the intraband Ni-$d_{z^2}$ correlations. Instead, the magnetic instability stems from the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, which remains half-filled through the redistribution of the electronic density between different bands even upon hole doping. Consequently, the strength of the magnetic fluctuations remains nearly unchanged for the considered doping levels. We argue that this renormalization is not inherent to the stoichiometric case but can be induced by hole doping.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Response and Neutral Excitations in Integer and Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall States Emerging from Correlated Flat Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integer and fractional Chern insulators have been extensively explored in correlated flat band models. Recently, the prediction and experimental observation of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states with spontaneous time-reversal-symmetry breaking have garnered attention. While the thermodynamics of integer quantum anomalous Hall (IQAH) states have been systematically studied, our theoretical knowledge on thermodynamic properties of FQAH states has been severely limited. Here, we delve into the general thermodynamic response and collective excitations of both IQAH and FQAH states within the paradigmatic flat Chern-band model with remote band considered. Our key findings include: i) In both $\nu$ = 1 IQAH and $\nu$ = 1/3 FQAH states, even without spin fluctuations, the charge-neutral collective excitations would lower the onset temperature of these topological states, to a value significantly smaller than the charge gap, due to band-mixing and multi-particle scattering; ii) By employing large-scale thermodynamic simulations in FQAH states in the presence of strong inter-band mixing between C = $\pm1$ bands, we find that the lowest collective excitations manifest as the zero-momentum excitons in the IQAH state, whereas in the FQAH state, they take the form of magneto-rotons with finite momentum; iii) The unique charge oscillations in FQAH states are exhibited with distinct experimental signatures, which we propose to detect in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Dynamical separation of charge and energy transport in one-dimensional Mott insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One-dimensional Mott insulators can be described using the sine-Gordon model, an integrable quantum field theory that provides the low-energy effective description of several one-dimensional gapped condensed matter systems, including recent realizations with trapped ultra-cold atoms. Employing the theory of Generalized Hydrodynamics, we demonstrate that this model exhibits separation of the transport of topological charge vs. energy. Analysis of the quasiparticle dynamics reveals that the mechanism behind the separation is the reflective scattering between topologically charged kinks/antikinks. The effect of these scattering events is most pronounced at strong coupling and low temperatures, where the distribution of quasiparticles is narrow compared to the reflective scattering amplitude. This effect results in a distinctively shaped "arrowhead" light cone for the topological charge.</description>

Abstract: The photoinduced topological phase transitions and thermal Hall conductivity of a kagome magnet with Heisenberg, Kitaev, and DM interactions under an external magnetic field aligned along the [111] directions is investigated in this study. In the presence of a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the lattice plane in the [111] direction, the system exhibits a fully polarized paramagnetic phase and the magnon band carries an asymmetric Chern number across the phase diagram region. Utilizing magnetic Floquet-Bloch theory, we demonstrate that periodically driven intrinsic topological magnetic materials can be manipulated into different topological phases with varying Berry curvature, Chern numbers and thermal Hall conductivities signatures by adjusting light intensity throughout the phase diagram region.</description>

      <title>Time reversal invariant topological 1D and 2D superconductors: doubling the Sau-Luchtin-Tewari-Sarma and Oreg-Refael-von Oppen proposals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we present a doubled version of the Sau-Luchtin-Tewari-Sarma and Oreg-Refael-von Open proposals thereby obtaining time reversal invariant p-wave superconductivity in both 1D and 2D. This construction is much like the Kane-Mele spin Hall model which is a time reversal invariant doubling of the Haldane model. We show that the low energy effective action for these doubled versions of the Sau-Luchtin-Tewari-Sarma and Oreg-Refael-von Open models corresponds to a single band p-wave time reversal invariant superconductors with pseudo spin degree of freedom instead of spin degree of freedom. There are Majorana fermions at the ends of wires or in vortex cores of these superconductors. Furthermore these are shown to be stable to small perturbations. In the supplement we present physical realization of the system with cold atoms and show a related "no-go" theorem given in Haim et. al. (2019) has too restrictive assumptions to apply to this proposal.</description>

      <title>Direct transition from a fractional quantum anomalous Hall state to a smectic state with the same Hall conductance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent developments in twisted MoTe_2 and rhombohedral multilayer graphene have generated widespread attention to the general features of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states, including their possible coexistence with and transition to various symmetry breaking charge ordered states. These attentions are pushing forward our knowledge of the relation between the topological order in FQAH states and the Landau-type of symmetry breaking order such as the 1D smectic electronic liquid crystal and 2D charge-density-wave (CDW) solid. Although the transitions from topological states to symmetry breaking states with trivial topology have been discussed, the road from one topological ordered state to another with the same Hall conductance and broken translational symmetry has not been found. Here we show the intriguing evidence that the FQAH to FQAH Smectic (FQAHS) transition is robustly realizable in the archetypal correlated flat Chern-band model at filling $\nu$ = 2/3. This transition is novel in that: i) the FQAHS acquires the same fractional Hall conductance as FQAH, which cannot be explained by mean-field band folding. The formation of smectic order can be viewed as perturbation around the transition point, and thus, do not destroy or change the original topology; ii) the charge excitation remains gapped across the transition although the neutral gap is closed at transition point; and iii) the transition is triggered by the softening of roton mode with the same wave vector as the smectic order. Our discovery opens countless new possibilities, both theoretical and experimental, in the fast-growing field of robust fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>Confinement in 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theories at Finite Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confinement is a paradigmatic phenomenon of gauge theories, and its understanding lies at the forefront of high-energy physics. Here, we study confinement in a simple one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory at finite temperature and filling, which is within the reach of current cold-atom and superconducting-qubit platforms. By employing matrix product states (MPS) calculations, we investigate the decay of the finite-temperature Green's function and uncover a smooth crossover between the confined and deconfined regimes. Furthermore, using the Friedel oscillations and string length distributions obtained from snapshots sampled from MPS, both of which are experimentally readily available, we verify that confined mesons remain well-defined at arbitrary finite temperature. This phenomenology is further supported by probing quench dynamics of mesons with exact diagonalization. Our results shed new light on confinement at finite temperature from an experimentally relevant standpoint.</description>

      <title>Classifying fermionic states via many-body correlation measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the structure of quantum correlations in a many-body system is key to its computational treatment. For fermionic systems, correlations can be defined as deviations from Slater determinant states. The link between fermionic correlations and efficient computational physics methods is actively studied but remains ambiguous. We make progress in establishing this connection mathematically. In particular, we find a rigorous classification of states relative to $k$-fermion correlations, which admits a computational physics interpretation. Correlations are captured by a measure $\omega_k$, a function of $k$-fermion reduced density matrix that we call twisted purity. Vanishing of $\omega_k$ for a given $k$ puts the state in a class $G_k$ of correlated states. Sets $G_k$ are nested in $k$, Slater determinants correspond to $k = 1$. Various physically relevant states are in or close to $G_{k=O(1)}$, including truncated configuration-interaction states, perturbation series around Slater determinants, and some nonperturbative eigenstates of the 1D Hubbard model. For each $k = O(1)$, we give an explicit ansatz with a polynomial number of parameters that covers all states in $G_k$. Potential applications of this ansatz and its connections to the coupled-cluster wavefunction are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a model of Pauli spin operators with all-to-all 4-local interactions by replacing Majorana fermions in the SYK model with spin operators. Equivalently, we replace fermions with hard-core bosons. We study this model numerically and compare the properties with those of the SYK model. We observe a striking quantitative coincidence between the spin model and the SYK model, which suggests that this spin model is strongly chaotic and, perhaps, can play some role in holography. We also discuss the path-integral approach with multi-local fields and the possibility of quantum simulations. This model may be an interesting target for quantum simulations because Pauli spins are easier to implement than fermions on qubit-based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Many-body effects on superconductivity mediated by double-magnon processes in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets exhibit a large electron spin splitting which can be understood as a result of strong coupling between itinerant electrons and localized spins. We consider superconductivity due to electron-magnon scattering, using strong-coupling Eliashberg theory to capture many-body effects that are not covered by a weak-coupling approach. The characteristic band structure of altermagnets puts significant constraints on the spin structure of electron scattering on the Fermi surface. We emphasize the role of spin-preserving, double-magnon scattering processes compared to conventional spin-flip processes involving a single magnon. Then, we derive the Eliashberg equations for a situation where double-magnon scattering mediates spin-polarized Cooper pairs, while both double-magnon and single-magnon scatterings contribute to many-body effects. These many-body effects impact superconducting properties in a way that differs significantly from systems where conventional spin-flip processes mediate superconductivity. To highlight the role of $d$-wave magnetism on superconductivity in altermagnets, we compare our results to those found in ferromagnetic half-metals and conventional antiferromagnetic metals.</description>

      <title>Pressure-driven right-triangle shape superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we report a comprehensive study of the crystal structure, resistivity, and alternating-current magnetic susceptibility in single crystals of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, with a hydrostatic pressure up to 104 GPa. X-ray diffraction measurements reveal a bilayer orthorhombic structure (space group $Amam$) at ambient pressure and a transformation into a tetragonal phase (space group $I4/mmm$) at ad critical pressure of $\sim$14 GPa. The transport measurements reveal a right-triangle shape superconducting region with a maximum $T_c$ of 83 K at 18.0 GPa. The superconductivity is gradually suppressed when applying a higher pressure, but it can persist up to 90 GPa. Importantly, we measured the Meissner effect of superconductivity using an alternating-current magnetic susceptibility technique under pressure and estimated the maximum superconducting volume fraction of being 48$\%$ at 19.4 GPa. Thus, we demonstrate the bulk nature of superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure. The intimate connection among the superconductivity, the oxygen content, and the tetragonal structure are discussed.</description>
