      <title>Deep learning insights into non-universality in the halo mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abundance of dark matter haloes is a key cosmological probe in forthcoming galaxy surveys. The theoretical understanding of the halo mass function (HMF) is limited by our incomplete knowledge of the origin of non-universality and its cosmological parameter dependence. We present a deep learning model which compresses the linear matter power spectrum into three independent factors which are necessary and sufficient to describe the $z=0$ HMF from the state-of-the-art AEMULUS emulator to sub-per cent accuracy in a $w$CDM$+N_\mathrm{eff}$ parameter space. Additional information about growth history does not improve the accuracy of HMF predictions if the matter power spectrum is already provided as input, because required aspects of the former can be inferred from the latter. The three factors carry information about the universal and non-universal aspects of the HMF, which we interrogate via the information-theoretic measure of mutual information. We find that non-universality is captured by recent growth history after matter-dark-energy equality and $N_\mathrm{eff}$ for $M\sim 10^{13} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}\, h^{-1}$ haloes, and by $\Omega_{\rm m}$ for $M\sim 10^{15} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}\, h^{-1}$. The compact representation learnt by our model can inform the design of emulator training sets to achieve high emulator accuracy with fewer simulations.</description>

      <title>When to interfere with dark matter? The impact of wave dynamics on statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight candidates for dark matter can present wavelike features on astrophysical scales. Full wave based simulations of such candidates are currently limited to box sizes of 1--10 Mpc/$h$ on a side, limiting our understanding of the impact of wave dynamics on the scale of the cosmic web. We present a statistical analysis of density fields produced by perturbative forward models in boxes of 128 Mpc/$h$ side length. Our wave-based perturbation theory maintains interference on all scales, and is compared to fluid dynamics of Lagrangian perturbation theory. The impact of suppressed power in the initial conditions and interference effects caused by wave dynamics can then be disentangled. We find that changing the initial conditions captures most of the change in one-point statistics such as the skewness of the density field. However, different environments of the cosmic web, quantified by critical points of the smoothed density, appear to be more sensitive to interference effects sourced by the quantum potential. This suggests that certain large-scale summary statistics may need additional care when studying cosmologies with wavelike dark matter.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures of cogenesis from a burdened PBH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of explaining the observed dark matter (DM) relic abundance, along with matter-antimatter asymmetry, entirely from the evaporation of primordial black holes (PBH), beyond the semi-classical approximation. We find that, depending on the timing of modification to the semi-classical approximation and the efficiency of the backreaction, it is possible to produce the correct DM abundance for PBHs with masses $\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ g, whereas producing the right amount of baryon asymmetry requires light PBHs with masses $\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ g, satisfying bounds on the PBH mass from the Cosmic Microwave Background and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. However, in a simplistic scenario, achieving both {\it simultaneously} is not feasible, typically because of the stringent Lyman-$\alpha$ constraint on warm dark matter mass. We also demonstrate how induced gravitational waves from PBH density fluctuations can provide a window to test the memory-burden effects, thereby placing constraints on either the DM mass scale or the scale of leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Dual Inflation and Bounce Cosmologies Interpretation of Pulsar Timing Array Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the entire parameter space of a dual scenario that combines generalized inflation and bounce cosmologies. In this scenario, the redshift term of curvature perturbation are phenomenologically generalized to accommodate various model-building of inflation and bounce cosmologies. Performing a Bayesian analysis with data from NANOGrav 15-year, PPTA DR3, EPTA DR2, and IPTA DR2, we identify, for the first time, two groups of regions -- each comprising dual regions from inflation and bounce -- that can simultaneously explain stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) signals detected by pulsar timing arrays and produce scale-invariant curvature perturbations compatible with observations of CMB anisotropies. Bayes factor (BF) calculations indicate that this dual scenario is strongly favored by NG15 data with large BFs over other conventional astrophysical and cosmological sources, such as supermassive black hole binaries, cosmic strings, domain walls, first-order phase transitions, and scalar-induced gravitational waves. Our Bayesian analysis also provides initial evidence of a duality between inflation and bounce cosmologies regarding SGWB. These results offer new insights for model-building in the early universe's inflation or bounce phases and highlight parameter regions that can be probed by current and future CMB observations and gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>A Study of Cosmological Models Based on Long Gamma-ray Bursts Duration Histogram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The duration of more than one thousand gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been measured by Swift satellite. Besides the redshift distribution of GRBs, the burst duration could be another significant property of GRBs that can be analyzed. In this project, First, we find the detection rate of Swift/BAT for a cosmological model with the $ \omega CDM$ model, then by performing a Monte-Carlo simulation, we find the "long" GRB duration histogram to compare the cosmological model with the $ \omega CDM$ model and the $\Lambda CDM$ model. The $\chi^2$ minimization method is employed to determine the optimal value of $\alpha$ in the dark energy equation of state, $P= c \omega(z) \rho$, with $\omega(z)=1+\alpha z$ as $\alpha=0.08 ^{+ 0.04}_{-0.02}$. We showed that the $\omega CDM$ model is statistically favored over the $\Lambda CDM$ model. Other studies by measuring the expansion rate of the Universe directly from the SNIa data by Pantheon and DES-SN3YR samples and the combinations of SNIa, CMB, and BAO data confirmed that the value of $\alpha$ in the dark energy equation of state is not zero \citep{Dark_energy_Abbott, 2011Beutler, 2014Anderson, 2015Ross, 2016PlanckCollaboration, Alam2017, Mazumdar2021}.</description>

      <title>Forward modeling fluctuations in the DESI LRGs target sample using image simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the forward modeling pipeline, Obiwan, to study the imaging systematics of the Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) targeted by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We update the Obiwan pipeline, which had previously been developed to simulate the optical images used to target DESI data, to further simulate WISE images in the infrared. This addition makes it possible to simulate the DESI LRGs sample, which utilizes WISE data in the target selection. Deep DESI imaging data combined with a method to account for biases in their shapes is used to define a truth sample of potential LRG targets. We simulate a total of 15 million galaxies to obtain a simulated LRG sample (Obiwan LRGs) that predicts the variations in target density due to imaging properties. We find that the simulations predict the trends with depth observed in the data, including how they depend on the intrinsic brightness of the galaxies. We observe that faint LRGs are the main contributing power of the imaging systematics trend induced by depth. We also find significant trends in the data against Galactic extinction that are not predicted by Obiwan. These trends depend strongly on the particular map of Galactic extinction chosen to test against, implying Large-Scale Structure systematic contamination (e.g. Cosmic-Infrared Background) in the Galactic extinction maps is a likely root cause. We additionally observe that the DESI LRGs sample exhibits a complex dependency on a combination of seeing, depth, and intrinsic galaxy brightness, which is not replicated by Obiwan, suggesting discrepancies between the current simulation settings and the actual observations. The detailed findings we present should be used to guide any observational systematics mitigation treatment for the clustering of the DESI LRG sample.</description>

      <title>Accurate Measurement of the Lensing Magnification by BOSS CMASS Galaxies and Its Implications for Cosmology and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnification serves as an independent and complementary gravitational lensing measurement to shear. We develop a novel method to achieve an accurate and robust magnification measurement around BOSS CMASS galaxies across physical scales of $0.016h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc} &lt; r_{\rm p} &lt; 10h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}$. We first measure the excess total flux density $\delta M$ of the source galaxies in deep DECaLS photometric catalog that are lensed by CMASS galaxies. We convert $\delta M$ to magnification $\mu$ by establishing the $\delta \mu-\delta M$ relation using a deeper photometric sample. By comparing magnification measurements in three optical bands ($grz$), we constrain the dust attenuation curve and its radial distribution, discovering a steep attenuation curve in the circumgalactic medium of CMASS galaxies. We further compare dust-corrected magnification measurements to model predictions from high-resolution dark matter-only (DMO) simulations in WMAP and Planck cosmologies, as well as the hydrodynamic simulation TNG300-1, using precise galaxy-halo connections from the Photometric objects Around Cosmic webs method and the accurate ray-tracing algorithm P3MLens. For $r_{\rm p} &gt; 70h^{-1}\,$kpc, our magnification measurements are in good agreement with both WMAP and Planck cosmologies. Assuming a linear correlation between the magnification signal and the fluctuation amplitude $S_8$, we obtain a tight constraint of $S_8 = 0.816 \pm 0.024$. However, at $r_{\rm p} &lt; 70h^{-1}\,$kpc, we observe an excess magnification signal, which is higher than the DMO model in Planck cosmology at $2.8\sigma$ and would be exacerbated if significant baryon feedback is included. Implications of the potential small scale discrepancy for the nature of dark matter and for the processes governing galaxy formation are discussed.</description>

      <title>The Construction of Large-scale Structure Catalogs for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the technical details on how large-scale structure (LSS) catalogs are constructed from redshifts measured from spectra observed by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The LSS catalogs provide the information needed to determine the relative number density of DESI tracers as a function of redshift and celestial coordinates and, e.g., determine clustering statistics. We produce catalogs that are weighted subsamples of the observed data, each matched to a weighted `random' catalog that forms an unclustered sampling of the probability density that DESI could have observed those data at each location.
  Precise knowledge of the DESI observing history and associated hardware performance allows for a determination of the DESI footprint and the number of times DESI has covered it at sub-arcsecond level precision. This enables the completeness of any DESI sample to be modeled at this same resolution. The pipeline developed to create LSS catalogs has been designed to easily allow robustness tests and enable future improvements. We describe how it allows ongoing work improving the match between galaxy and random catalogs, such as including further information when assigning redshifts to randoms, accounting for fluctuations in target density, accounting for variation in the redshift success rate, and accommodating blinding schemes.</description>

      <title>Bounding Dark Energy from the SPARC rotation curves: Data driven probe for galaxy virialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark Energy (DE) acts as a repulsive force that opposes gravitational attraction. Assuming galaxies maintain a steady state over extended periods, the estimated upper bound on DE studies its resistance to the attractive gravitational force from dark matter. Using the SPARC dataset, we fit the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and Hernquist models to identify the most suitable galaxies for these models. Introducing the presence of DE in these galaxies helps establish the upper limit on its repulsive force. This upper bound on DE sits around $\rho_{\left(&lt;\Lambda\right)} \sim 10^{-25}$~kg/m$^3$, only two orders of magnitude higher than the one measured by Planck. We discuss the conditions for detecting DE in different systems and show the consistency of the upper bound from galaxies to other systems. The upper bound is of the same order of magnitude as $\rho_{200} = 200 \rho_c$ for both dark matter profiles. We also address the implications for future measurements on that upper bound and the condition for detecting the impact of $\Lambda$ on galactic scales.</description>

      <title>ELG Spectroscopic Systematics Analysis of the DESI Data Release 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) uses more than 2.4 million Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) for 3D large-scale structure (LSS) analyses in its Data Release 1 (DR1). Such large statistics enable thorough research on systematic uncertainties. In this study, we focus on spectroscopic systematics of ELGs. The redshift success rate ($f_{\rm goodz}$) is the relative fraction of secure redshifts among all measurements. It depends on observing conditions, thus introduces non-cosmological variations to the LSS. We, therefore, develop the redshift failure weight ($w_{\rm zfail}$) and a per-fibre correction ($\eta_{\rm zfail}$) to mitigate these dependences. They have minor influences on the galaxy clustering. For ELGs with a secure redshift, there are two subtypes of systematics: 1) catastrophics (large) that only occur in a few samples; 2) redshift uncertainty (small) that exists for all samples. The catastrophics represent 0.26\% of the total DR1 ELGs, composed of the confusion between O\,\textsc{ii} and sky residuals, double objects, total catastrophics and others. We simulate the realistic 0.26\% catastrophics of DR1 ELGs, the hypothetical 1\% catastrophics, and the truncation of the contaminated $1.31&lt;z&lt;1.33$ in the \textsc{AbacusSummit} ELG mocks. Their $P_\ell$ show non-negligible bias from the uncontaminated mocks. But their influences on the redshift space distortions (RSD) parameters are smaller than $0.2\sigma$. The redshift uncertainty of \Yone ELGs is 8.5 km/s with a Lorentzian profile. The code for implementing the catastrophics and redshift uncertainty on mocks can be found in https://github.com/Jiaxi-Yu/modelling_spectro_sys.</description>

      <title>Color Dependence of Dipole in CatWISE2020 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The signal of dipole anisotropy in quasar number counts is studied using the CatWISE2020 catalog in various color bins. It is found that the dipole signal differs significantly in two color bins, namely, $1.1&gt;W1-W2\ge 0.8$ and $1.4&gt;W1-W2&gt;1.1$. The color bin $1.4&gt;W1-W2&gt;1.1$ appears strongly contaminated, with possibly Galactic contributions and is unreliable for extracting the signal of cosmological dipole. The source of this contamination has not been identified and cannot be attributed to known emissions within the galaxy. Removing this contaminated color bin leads to a strong dipole signal with a direction significantly different from that obtained from full data. If we interpret this dipole as due to our local motion, the extracted velocity turns out to be $900\pm 113$ Kms$^{-1}$, which deviates from the CMB dipole velocity with approximately $4.7$ sigma significance.</description>

      <title>Impact and mitigation of spectroscopic systematics on DESI DR1 clustering measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large scale structure catalogs within DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) use nearly 6 million galaxies and quasars as tracers of the large-scale structure of the universe to measure the expansion history with baryon acoustic oscillations and the growth of structure with redshift-space distortions. In order to take advantage of DESI's unprecedented statistical power, we must ensure that the galaxy clustering measurements are unaffected by non-cosmological density fluctuations. One source of spurious fluctuations comes from variation in galaxy density with spectroscopic observing conditions, lowering the redshift efficiency (and thus galaxy density) in certain areas of the sky. We measure the uniformity of the redshift success rate for DESI luminous red galaxies (LRG), bright galaxies (BGS) and quasars (QSO), complementing the detailed discussion of emission line galaxy (ELG) systematics in a companion paper (Yu et al., 2024). We find small but significant fluctuations of up to 3% in redshift success rate with the effective spectroscopic signal-to-noise, and create and describe weights that remove these fluctuations. We also describe the process to identify and remove data from certain poorly performing fibers from DESI DR1, and measure the stability of the redshift success rate with time. Finally, we find small but significant correlations of redshift success rate with position on the focal plane, survey speed, and number of exposures required, and show the impact of weights correcting these trends on the power spectrum multipoles and on cosmological parameters from BAO and RSD fits. These corrections change the best-fit parameters by $&lt;15\%$ of their statistical errors, and thus contribute negligibly to the overall DESI error budget.</description>

      <title>The Three Hundred project: Estimating the dependence of gas filaments on the mass of galaxy clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are located in the densest areas of the universe and are intricately connected to larger structures through the filamentary network of the Cosmic Web. In this scenario, matter flows from areas of lower density to higher density. As a result, the properties of galaxy clusters are deeply influenced by the filaments that are attached to them, which are quantified by a parameter known as connectivity. We explore the dependence of gas-traced filaments connected to galaxy clusters on the mass and dynamical state of the cluster. Moreover, we evaluate the effectiveness of the cosmic web extraction procedure from the gas density maps of simulated cluster regions. Using the DisPerSE cosmic web finder, we identify filamentary structures from 3D gas particle distribution in 324 simulated regions of $30 \, h^{-1}$ Mpc side from The Three Hundred hydrodynamical simulation at redshifts z=0, 1, and 2. We estimate the connectivity at various apertures for $\sim3000$ groups and clusters spanning a mass range from $10^{13} \, h^{-1} \, M_{\odot}$ to $10^{15} \, h^{-1} \, M_{\odot}$. Relationships between connectivity and cluster properties like radius, mass, dynamical state and hydrostatic mass bias are explored. We show that the connectivity is strongly correlated with the mass of galaxy clusters, with more massive clusters being on average more connected. This finding aligns with previous studies in literature, both from observational and simulated data sets. Additionally, we observe a dependence of the connectivity on the aperture at which it is estimated. We find that connectivity decreases with cosmic time, while no dependencies on the dynamical state and hydrostatic mass bias of the cluster are found. Lastly, we observe a significant agreement between the connectivity measured from gas-traced and mock-galaxies-traced filaments in the simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical dark energy has gained renewed interest due to recent theoretical and observational developments. In the present paper, we focus on a string-motivated dark energy set-up, and perform a detailed cosmological analysis of exponential quintessence with potential $V=V_0 e^{-\lambda\phi}$, allowing for non-zero spatial curvature. We first gain some physical intuition into the full evolution of such a scenario by analysing the corresponding dynamical system. Then, we test the model using a combination of Planck CMB data, DESI BAO data, as well as recent supernovae datasets. For the model parameter $\lambda$, we obtain a preference for nonzero values: $\lambda = 0.48^{+0.28}_{-0.21},\; 0.68^{+0.31}_{-0.20},\; 0.77^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$ at 68% C.L. when combining CMB+DESI with Pantheon+, Union3 and DES-Y5 supernovae datasets respectively. We find no significant hint for spatial curvature. We discuss the implications of current cosmological results for the exponential quintessence model, and more generally for dark energy in string theory.</description>

      <title>A universal constraint on axion non-Abelian dynamics during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inflationary models equipped with Chern-Simons coupling between their axion and gauge sectors exhibit an array of interesting signals including a testable chiral gravitational wave spectrum. The energy injection in the gauge sector triggered by the rolling axion leads to a well-studied enhancement of gauge field fluctuations. These may in turn affect observables such as the scalar and tensor spectra and also account for non-linear corrections to field propagators. In this work, we focus on non-Abelian gauge sectors. We show that gauge field self-interactions and axion-gauge field non-linear couplings significantly renormalize the gauge field mode function. Operating within the regime of validity of the perturbative treatment places strong constraints on the accessible parameter space of this class of models. We calculate corrections to the gauge field propagator that are universally present in these scenarios. Enforcing perturbativity on such propagators leads to bounds that are competitive with those stemming from analytical estimates on the onset of the strong backreaction regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energetic cosmic rays scatter off the cosmic neutrino background throughout the history of the Universe, yielding a diffuse flux of cosmic relic neutrinos boosted to high energies. We calculate this flux under different assumptions of the cosmic-ray flux spectral slope and redshift evolution. The non-observation of the diffuse flux of boosted relic neutrinos with current high-energy neutrino experiments already excludes an average cosmic neutrino background overdensity larger than $\sim 10^{4}$ over cosmological distances. We discuss the future detectability of the diffuse flux of boosted relic neutrinos in light of neutrino overdensity estimates and cosmogenic neutrino backgrounds.</description>

Abstract: Holographic dark energy models have proven to be a very interesting way to study various aspects of late-time acceleration of the universe. In this work we extensively study HDE models with the Granda-Oliveros cutoff with an ansatz based approach. We consider the Tsallis, Barrow and PLEC HDE models in this regard and consdier simple power law, emergent universe, intermediate and logamediate forms of for the universe. Studying various cosmologically interesting parameters alongside the thermodynamical aspects in these models, we show that the Logamediate models are the best fit out of the other possibilites, followed by the emergent universe model, intermediate model and the simple power law models at the very last in terms of feasibility.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Bonnet Cosmology: large-temperature behaviour and bounds from Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a transparent discussion of the high temperature asymptotic behaviour of Cosmology in a dilaton-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (dEGB) scenario of modified gravity with vanishing scalar potential. In particular, we show that it has a clear interpretation in terms of only three attractors (stable critical points) of a set of autonomous differential equations: $w=-\frac{1}{3}$, $w=1$ and $1&lt;w&lt;\frac{7}{3}$, where $w\equiv p/\rho$ is the equation of state, defined as the ratio of the total pressure and the total energy density. All the possible different high-temperature evolution histories of the model are exhausted by only eight paths in the flow of the set of the autonomous differential equations. Our discussion clearly explains why five out of them are characterized by a swift transition of the system toward the attractor, while the remaining three show a more convoluted evolution, where the system follows a meta-stable equation of state at intermediate temperatures before eventually jumping to the real attractor at higher temperatures. Compared to standard Cosmology, the regions of the dEGB parameter space with $w=-\frac{1}{3}$ show a strong enhancement of the expected Gravitational Wave stochastic background produced by the primordial plasma of relativistic particles of the Standard Model. This is due to the very peculiar fact that dEGB allows to have an epoch when the energy density $\rho_{\rm rad}$ of the relativistic plasma dominates the energy of the Universe while at the same time the rate of dilution with $T$ of the total energy density is slower than what usually expected during radiation dominance. This allows to use the bound from BBN to put in dEGB a constraint $T_{\rm RH}\lesssim 10^8 - 10^9$ GeV on the reheating temperature of the Universe $T_{\rm RH}$. Such BBN bound is complementary to late-time constraints from compact binary mergers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent potentials are common in galactic systems that undergo significant evolution, interactions, or encounters with other galaxies, or when there are dynamic processes like star formation and merging events. Recent studies show that an ensemble approach along with the so-called snapshot framework in dynamical system theory provide a powerful tool to analyze time dependent dynamics.
  In this work, we aim to explore and quantify the phase space structure and dynamical complexity in time-dependent galactic potentials consisting of multiple components. We apply the classical method of Poincar\'e-surface of section to analyze the phase space structure in a chaotic Hamiltonian system subjected to parameter drift. This, however, makes sense only when the evolution of a large ensemble of initial conditions is followed. Numerical simulations explore the phase space structure of such ensembles while the system undergoes a continuous parameter change. The pair-wise average distance of ensemble members allows us to define a generalized Lyapunov-exponent, that might also be time dependent, to describe the system stability. We revise the system parameters for the Milky Way galaxy and provide a comprehensive dynamical analysis of the system under circumstances where linear mass transfer undergoes between the disk and bulge components of the model.</description>

Abstract: While two highly intensive laser beams collide, they create a region where the refractive index varies so quickly that photons are created. The variance of the refractive index is analog to the universe scale factor variance. Therefore, this laser system can be an analog to the expansion of the universe. We find that several hundreds of photons can be created under feasible conditions. This system can demonstrate the particle creation during inflation or other similar periods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutrino force results from the exchange of a pair of neutrinos. A neutrino background can significantly influence this force. In this work, we present a comprehensive calculation of the neutrino force in various neutrino backgrounds with spin dependence taken into account. In particular, we calculate the spin-independent and spin-dependent parity-conserving neutrino forces, in addition to the spin-dependent parity-violating neutrino forces with and without the presence of a neutrino background for both isotropic and anisotropic backgrounds. Compared with the vacuum case, the neutrino background can effectively violate Lorentz invariance and lead to additional parity-violating terms that are not suppressed by the velocity of external particles. We estimate the magnitude of the effect of atomic parity-violation experiments, and it turns out to be well below the current experimental sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Image formation near hyperbolic umbilic in strong gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic umbilic (HU) is a point singularity of the gravitational lens equation, giving rise to a ring-shaped image formation made of four highly magnified images, off-centred from the lens centre. Recent observations have revealed new strongly lensed image formations near HU singularities, and many more are expected in ongoing and future observations. Like fold/cusp, image formations near HU also satisfy magnification relation ($R_{\rm hu}$), i.e., the signed magnification sum of the four images equals zero. Here, we study how $R_{\rm hu}$ deviates from zero as a function of area ($A_{\rm hu}$) covered by the image formation near HU and the distance ($d$) of the central maxima image (which is part of the HU image formation) from the lens centre for ideal single- and double-component cluster-scale lenses. For lens ellipticity values $\geq0.3$, the central maxima image will form sufficiently far from the lens centre ($d\gtrsim5''$), similar to the observed HU image formations. We also find that, in some cases, double-component and actual cluster-scale lenses can lead to large cross-sections for HU(-like) image formations for sources at $z\gtrsim5$ effectively increasing the chances to observe HU(-like) image formation at high redshift. Finally, we study the time delay distribution in the observed HU image formation, finding that not only are these images highly magnified, but the relative time delay between various pairs of HU characteristic image formation has a typical value of $\sim100$ days, an order of magnitude smaller than generic five-image formations in cluster lenses, making such image formations a promising target for time delay studies.</description>

      <title>Spectral similarities in galaxies through an unsupervised classification of spaxels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first unsupervised classification of spaxels in hyperspectral images of individual galaxies. Classes identify regions by spectral similarity and thus take all the information into account that is contained in the data cubes (spatial and spectral).We used Gaussian mixture models in a latent discriminant subspace to find clusters of spaxels. The spectra were corrected for small-scale motions within the galaxy based on emission lines with an automatic algorithm. Our data consist of two MUSE/VLT data cubes of JKB 18 and NGC 1068 and one NIRSpec/JWST data cube of NGC 4151.Our classes identify many regions that are most often easily interpreted. Most of the 11 classes that we find for JKB 18 are identified as photoionised by stars. Some of them are known HII regions, but we mapped them as extended, with gradients of ionisation intensities. One compact structure has not been reported before, and according to diagnostic diagrams, it might be a planetary nebula or a denser HII region. For NGC 1068, our 16 classes are of active galactic nucleus-type (AGN) or star-forming regions. Their spatial distribution corresponds perfectly to well-known structures such as spiral arms and a ring with giant molecular clouds. A subclassification in the nuclear region reveals several structures and gradients in the AGN spectra. Our unsupervised classification of the MUSE data of NGC 1068 helps visualise the complex interaction of the AGN and the jet with the interstellar medium in a single map. The centre of NGC 4151 is very complex, but our classes can easily be related to ionisation cones, the jet, or H2 emission. We find a new elongated structure that is ionised by the AGN along the N-S axis perpendicular to the jet direction. It is rotated counterclockwise with respect to the axis of the H2 emission. Our work shows that the unsupervised classification of spaxels takes full advantage of the richness of the information in the data cubes by presenting the spectral and spatial information in a combined and synthetic way.</description>

      <title>Standardizing the Gamma-ray burst as a standard candle and applying to the cosmological probes: constraints on the two-component dark energy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As one of the most energetic and brightest events, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been used as a standard candle for cosmological probe. Based on the relevant features of GRBs light curves, a plateau phase followed a decay phase, we obtain X-ray samples of 31 GRBs and optical samples of 50 GRBs, which are thought to be caused by the same physical mechanism. We standardize GRBs using the two-dimension fundamental plane relation of the rest-frame luminosity of the plateau emission ($L_{b,z}$) and the end time of plateau ($T_{b,z}$) $L_{b,z}-T_{b,z}$, as well as the three-dimension fundamental plane correlation including the peak energy ($E_{p,i}$) $L_{b,z}-T_{b,z}-E_{p,i}$. For the cosmological probes, we consider the $\omega$CDM model in which the dark energy consists of one component, and mainly focus on the $X_1X_2$CDM model in which the dark energy is made up of two independent components. We obtain the constraints on the related parameters of the cosmological models using the type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data and selected X-ray and optical samples. For the $X_1X_2$CDM model, we find that the values of the equations of state parameters of two dark energies, $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, are very close. We also conduct the comparison between the models using the Bayesian information criterion, and find that the $\omega$CDM model is favoured.</description>

      <title>High Redshift Merger Model for Low Frequency Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2023, the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) Collaborations announced the discovery of a gravitational wave background (GWB), predominantly attributed to supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) mergers. However, the detected GWB is several times stronger than the default value expected from galactic observations at low and moderate redshifts. Recent findings by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have unveiled a substantial number of massive, high-redshift galaxies, suggesting more massive SMBHB mergers at these early epochs. Motivated by these findings, we propose an "early merger" model that complements the standard merger statistics by incorporating these early, massive galaxies. We compare the early and standard "late merger" models, which assume peak merger rates in the local universe, and match both merger models to the current detected GWB. Our analysis shows that the early merger model has a significantly lower detection probability for single binaries and predicts a $\sim 30 \%$ likelihood that the first detectable single source will be highly redshifted and remarkably massive with rapid frequency evolution. In contrast, the late merger model predicts a nearly monochromatic first source at low redshift. The future confirmation of an enhanced population of massive high-redshift galaxies and the detection of fast-evolving binaries would strongly support the early merger model, offering significant insights into galaxy and SMBH redshift evolution.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences (CBCs) offer insights into the universe expansion. The spectral siren method, used without electromagnetic counterparts (EMC), infers cosmic expansion (Hubble constant) by relating detector and source frame masses of black hole (BH) mergers. However, heuristic mass models (broken power law, power law plus peak, multipeak) may introduce biases in the Hubble constant estimation, potentially up to 3 sigma with 2000 detected GW mergers. These biases stem from the models inability to consider redshift evolution and unexpected mass features. Future GW cosmology studies should employ adaptable source mass models to address these issues.</description>

      <title>Closing the net on transient sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) observed above $4\times10^{19}\,$eV provide evidence of localized excesses that are key to identifying their sources. We leverage the 3D matter distribution from optical and infrared surveys as a density model of UHECR sources, which are considered to be transient. Agreement of the sky model with UHECR data imposes constraints on both the emission rate per unit matter and the time spread induced by encountered turbulent magnetic fields. Based on radio measurements of cosmic magnetism, we identify the Local Sheet as the magnetized structure responsible for the kiloyear duration of UHECR bursts for an observer on Earth and find that the turbulence amplitude must be within $0.5-20\,$nG for a coherence length of $10\,$kpc. At the same time, the burst-rate density must be above $50\,$Gpc$^{-3}\,$yr$^{-1}$ for Local-Sheet galaxies to reproduce the UHECR excesses and below $5\,000\,$Gpc$^{-3}\,$yr$^{-1}$ ($30\,000\,$Gpc$^{-3}\,$yr$^{-1}$) for the Milky Way (Local-Group galaxies) not to outshine other galaxies. For the transient emissions of protons and nuclei to match the energy spectra of UHECRs, the kinetic energy of the outflows responsible for UHECR acceleration must be below $4\times10^{54}\,$erg and above $5\times10^{50}\,$erg ($2\times10^{49}\,$erg) if we consider the Milky Way (or not). The only stellar-sized transients that satisfy both Hillas' and our criteria are long gamma-ray bursts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new Hubble parameterization method and employ observational data from Hubble, Pantheon, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations to constrain model parameters. The proposed method is thoroughly validated against these datasets, demonstrating a robust fit to the observational Hubble, Pantheon, and BAO data. The obtained best-fit values are $H_0 = 67.5^{+1.3}_{-1.6}$ $\text{km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $\Omega_{\rm{m0}} = 0.2764\pm{0.0094}$, and $\alpha = 0.33\pm{0.22}$, consistent with the Planck 2018 results, highlighting the existence of Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>A new search pipeline for gravitational waves with higher-order modes using mode-by-mode filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nearly all template-based gravitational wave (GW) searches only include the quasi-circular quadrupolar modes of the signals in their templates. Including additional degrees of freedom in the GW templates corresponding to higher-order harmonics, orbital precession, or eccentricity is challenging because: ($i$) the size of template banks and the matched-filtering cost increases significantly with the number of degrees of freedom, $(ii)$ if these additional degrees are not included properly, the search can lose sensitivity overall (due to an increase in the rate of background triggers). Here, we focus on including aligned-spin higher harmonics in GW search templates. We use a new mode-by-mode filtering approach, where we separately filter GW strain data with three harmonics [namely $(\ell, |m|)=(2,2)$, $(3,3)$ and $(4,4)$]. This results in an increase in the matched-filtering cost by only a factor of $3$ compared to that of a $(2,2)$-only search. We develop computationally cheap trigger-ranking statistics to optimally combine the different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) timeseries from different harmonics, which ensure only physically-allowed combinations of the different harmonics are triggered on. We use an empirical template-dependent background model in our ranking statistic to account for non-Gaussian transients. In addition, we develop a tool called band eraser which specifically excises narrow time-varying noisy bands in time-frequency space (without having to excise entire time chunks in the data). New GW candidate events that we detect using our search pipeline and the details of our template banks are discussed in accompanying papers: Wadekar et al. [1] and [2] respectively. Apart from higher harmonics, we expect our methodology to also be useful for cheap and optimal searches including orbital precession and eccentricity in GW waveforms.</description>

      <title>21cmFirstCLASS I. Cosmological tool for $\Lambda$CDM and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03942v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we present 21cmFirstCLASS, a modified version of 21cmFAST, the most popular code in the literature for computing the anisotropies of the 21-cm signal. Our code uses the public cosmic microwave background (CMB) Boltzmann code CLASS, to establish consistent initial conditions at recombination for any set of cosmological parameters and evolves them throughout the dark ages, cosmic dawn, the epoch of heating and reionization. We account for inhomogeneity in the temperature and ionization fields throughout the evolution, crucial for a robust calculation of both the global 21-cm signal and its fluctuations. We demonstrate how future measurements of the CMB and the 21-cm signal can be combined and analyzed with 21cmFirstCLASS to obtain constraints on both cosmological and astrophysical parameters and examine degeneracies between them. As an example application, we show how 21cmFirstCLASS can be used to study cosmological models that exhibit non-linearities already at the dark ages, such as scattering dark matter (SDM). For the first time, we present self-consistent calculations of the 21-cm power spectrum in the presence of SDM during the non-linear epoch of cosmic dawn. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/jordanflitter/21cmFirstCLASS.</description>

      <title>21cmFirstCLASS II. Early linear fluctuations of the 21cm signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03948v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a companion paper we introduce 21cmFirstCLASS, a new code for computing the 21-cm anisotropies, assembled from the merger of the two popular codes 21cmFAST and CLASS. Unlike the standard 21cmFAST, which begins at $z=35$ with homogeneous temperature and ionization boxes, our code begins its calculations from recombination, evolves the signal through the dark ages, and naturally yields an inhomogeneous box at $z=35$. In this paper, we validate the output of 21cmFirstCLASS by developing a new theoretical framework which is simple and intuitive on the one hand, but is robust and precise on the other hand. As has been recently claimed, using consistent inhomogeneous initial conditions mitigates inaccuracies, which according to our analysis can otherwise reach the $\mathcal O\left(20\%\right)$ level. On top of that, we also show for the first time that 21cmFAST over-predicts the 21-cm power spectrum at $z\gtrsim20$ by another $\mathcal O\left(20\%\right)$, due to the underlying assumption that $\delta_b=\delta_c$, namely that the density fluctuations in baryons and cold dark matter are indistinguishable. We propose an elegant solution to this discrepancy by introducing an appropriate scale-dependent growth factor into the evolution equations. Our analysis shows that this modification will ensure sub-percent differences between 21cmFirstCLASS and the Boltzmann solver CAMB at $z\leq50$ for all scales between the horizon and the Jeans scale. This will enable 21cmFirstCLASS to consistently and reliably simulate the 21-cm anisotropies both in the dark ages and cosmic dawn, for any cosmology. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/jordanflitter/21cmFirstCLASS.</description>

      <title>21 cm Intensity Mapping with the DSA-2000</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Line intensity mapping is a promising probe of the universe's large-scale structure. We explore the sensitivity of the DSA-2000, a forthcoming array consisting of over 2000 dishes, to the statistical power spectrum of neutral hydrogen's 21 cm emission line. These measurements would reveal the distribution of neutral hydrogen throughout the near-redshift universe without necessitating resolving individual sources. The success of these measurements relies on the instrument's sensitivity and resilience to systematics. We show that the DSA-2000 will have the sensitivity needed to detect the 21 cm power spectrum at z=0.5 and across power spectrum modes of 0.03-35.12 h/Mpc with 0.1 h/Mpc resolution. We find that supplementing the nominal array design with a dense core of 200 antennas will expand its sensitivity at low power spectrum modes and enable measurement of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs). Finally, we present a qualitative discussion of the DSA-2000's unique resilience to sources of systematic error that can preclude 21 cm intensity mapping.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of a vector-field-induced (and possibly parity breaking) compensated isocurvature perturbation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is natural to wonder whether there may be observational relics of new fundamental fields, beyond the inflaton, in large scale structure. Here we discuss the phenomenology of a model in which compensated isocurvature perturbations (CIPs) arise through the action of a primordial vector field that displaces dark matter relative to baryons. The model can be tested best by kinematic-Sunyaev-Zeldovich tomography, which involves the cross-correlation of cosmic microwave background and galaxy surveys, with next-generation observatories. There are also signatures of the vectorial nature of the new field that may be detectable in forthcoming galaxy surveys, but the galaxy survey cannot alone indicate the presence of a CIP. Models that induce a parity breaking four-point correlation in the galaxy distribution are also possible.</description>

      <title>Late-Time constraints on Interacting Dark Energy: Analysis independent of $H_0$, $r_d$ and $M_B$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A possible interaction between cold dark matter and dark energy, corresponding to a well-known interacting dark energy model discussed in the literature within the context of resolving the Hubble tension, has been investigated. We put constraints on it in a novel way, by creating new likelihoods with an analytical marginalization over the Hubble parameter $H_0$, the sound horizon $r_d$, and the supernova absolute magnitude $M_B$. Our aim is to investigate the impacts on the coupling parameter of the interacting model, $\xi$, and the equation of state of dark energy $w$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{m,0}$. The late-time cosmological probes used in our analysis include the PantheonPlus (calibrated and uncalibrated), Cosmic Chronometers, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations samples and the Pantheon for comparison. Through various combinations of these datasets, we demonstrate hints of up to $2\sigma$ deviation from the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We split the total matter fluid into a bound (halo) component and an unbound (free particles) fluid component that is accreted by the halos. We adopt a different framework that treats the structure formation problem as a gravitational interaction between these virialised cold dark matter halos and the unbound inter-halo cold dark matter (and cold baryon) particles. This interaction involves in general an exchange of energy and momentum during the accretion process. We then explore the evolution of the average matter density and of large-scale structure formation, using a simplified phenomenological model that is based on results from extended Press-Schechter and N-body simulations. At high redshifts most matter is in diffuse form and is not part of the haloes. As particles are accreted by the virialised halos, the particle number density decreases and that of the bound matter increases. We also present a general analysis of the background and linear perturbations for the interacting fluids, showing in detail the energy and momentum exchange terms.</description>

      <title>Studying the Supernova Absolute Magnitude Constancy with Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this proceeding we review and expand on our recent work investigating the constancy of the absolute magnitude $M_B$ of Type Ia supernovae. In it, we used baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) to calibrate the supernova data and to check whether the resulting $M_B$ is constant. We used non-parametric methods like Gaussian processes and artificial neural networks to reconstruct $M_B(z)$. Here we elaborate on the results by putting them in the context of other studies investigating possible non-constant $M_B$ and the impact of the distance-duality relation. We also present some numerical details on the calculations in the original paper and new non-parametric reconstructions, including a conservative model-independent fit, confirming its main results. Notably, we see that $M_B$ remains constant within $1\sigma$, with a possible jump around $z = 0.01 - 0.15$. Furthermore, the observed distribution of $M_B(z)$ cannot be described by a single Gaussian, displaying multiple peaks and tails. The choice of the only remaining parameter -- the sound horizon $r_d$ leads to a tension in the $M_B-r_d$ plane. Fitting different non-constant $M_B(z)$ models does not significantly improve the fit and there is no preference for any of the models by the statistical measures we employ.</description>

Abstract: General Relativistic Entropic Acceleration (GREA) theory provides a covariant formalism for out-of-equilibrium phenomena in GR, extending the Einstein equations with an entropic force that behaves like bulk viscosity with a negative effective pressure. In particular, the growth of entropy associated with the homogeneous causal horizon can explain the present acceleration of the Universe, without introducing a cosmological constant. The dynamics of the accelerated Universe is characterized by a single parameter $\alpha$, the ratio of the causal horizon to the curvature scale, which provides a unique history of the Universe distinguishable from that of LCDM. In particular, we explain the coincidence problem and the Hubble tension by shifting the coasting point to higher redshifts. All background observables are correlated among themselves due to their common dependence on $\alpha$. This scenario gives a specific evolution for the effective equation of state parameter, $w(a)$. Furthermore, we study the linear growth of matter perturbations in the context of a homogeneous expanding background driven by the entropy of the causal horizon. We find that the rate of growth of matter fluctuations in GREA slows down due to the accelerated expansion and alleviates the $\sigma_8$ tension of LCDM. We compute the growth function of matter fluctuations, the redshift space distortions in the galaxy correlation function, as well as the redshift evolution of the BAO scale, and find that the ISW effect is significantly larger than in LCDM. It is interesting to note that many of the tensions and anomalies of the standard model of cosmology are alleviated by the inclusion of this transient period of acceleration of the Universe based on known fundamental physics. In the near future we will be able to constrain this theory with present data from deep galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Weak lensing of strong lensing: beyond the tidal regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of strong lensing images usually involves an external convergence and shear, which are meant to model the effect of perturbations along the line of sight, on top of the main lens. Such a description of line-of-sight perturbations supposes that the corresponding gravitational fields can be treated in the tidal regime. Going one step further introduces additional effects, known as flexion, which have been hitherto neglected in strong lensing. In this work, we build a minimal model for the line-of-sight flexion, which adds four new complex parameters to the lens model. Contrary to convergence and shear, the line-of-sight flexion cannot be projected onto the main lens plane. For a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we predict the typical line-of-sight flexion to be on the order of $10^{-3} \mathrm{arcsec}^{-1}$ on galactic scales. Neglecting its effect in lens modelling is found to bias the recovery of other parameters; in particular, the line-of-sight shear can be biased up to $2\sigma$. Accounting for the line-of-sight flexion in our minimal framework restores accuracy, at the the cost of degrading precision. With current imaging capabilities, the line-of-sight flexion is unlikely to be measurable on individual strong lensing images; it must therefore be considered a nuisance parameter rather than an observable in its own right.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Lithium abundance problem in Big-Bang nucleosynthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the three testaments in favor of the big bang theory is the prediction of the primordial elemental abundances in the big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). The Standard BBN is a parameter-free theory due to the precise knowledge of the baryon-to-photon ratio of the Universe obtained from studies of the anisotropies of cosmic microwave background radiation. Although the computed abundances of light elements during primordial nucleosynthesis and those determined from observations are in good agreement throughout a range of nine orders of magnitude, there is still a disparity of $^7$Li abundance overestimated by a factor of $\sim 2.5$ when calculated theoretically. The number of light neutrino flavors, the neutron lifetime and the baryon-to-photon ratio in addition to the astrophysical nuclear reaction rates determine the primordial abundances. We previously looked into the impact of updating baryon-to-photon ratio and neutron lifetime and changing quite a few reaction rates on the yields of light element abundances in BBN. In this work, calculations are performed using new reaction rates for $^3$H(p,$\gamma$)$^4$He, $^6$Li(p,$\gamma$)$^7$Be, $^7$Be(p,$\gamma$)$^8$B, $^{13}$N(p,$\gamma$)$^{14}$O, $^7$Li(n,$\gamma$)$^8$Li and $^{11}$B(n,$\gamma$)$^{12}$B along with the latest measured value of neutron lifetime. We observe from theoretical calculations that these changes result in improvement by causing further reduction in the abundance of $^7$Li than calculated earlier.</description>

      <title>Confronting Dark Matter Freeze-In during Reheating with Constraints from Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the production of particle Dark Matter (DM) in a minimal freeze-in model considering a non-instantaneous reheating phase after inflation. We demonstrate that for low reheating temperatures, bosonic or fermionic reheating from monomial potentials can lead to a different evolution in the DM production and hence to distinct predictions for the parent particle lifetime and mass, constrained by long-lived particle (LLP) searches. We highlight that such scenario predicts parent particle decay lengths larger compared to using the instantaneous reheating approximation. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of an accurate definition of the reheating temperature and emphasize its relevance for the correct interpretation of experimental constraints. We explore different models of inflation, which can lead to the considered reheating potential. We find that the extent to which the standard DM freeze-in production can be modified crucially depends on the underlying inflationary model. Based on the latest CMB constraints, we derive lower limits on the decay length of the parent particle and confront these results with the corresponding reach of LLP searches. Our findings underscore the impact of the specific dynamics of inflation on DM freeze-in production and highlight their importance for the interpretation of collider signatures. At the same time, our results indicate the potential for LLP searches to shed light on the underlying dynamics of reheating.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave constraints on scalar-tensor gravity from a neutron star and black-hole binary GW200115</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In nonminimally coupled theories where a scalar field is coupled to the Ricci scalar, neutron stars (NSs) can have scalar charges through an interaction with matter mediated by gravity. On the other hand, the same theories do not give rise to hairy black hole (BH) solutions. The observations of gravitational waves (GWs) emitted from an inspiralling NS-BH binary system allows a possibility of constraining the NS scalar charge. Moreover, the nonminimally coupled scalar-tensor theories generate a breathing scalar mode besides two tensor polarizations. Using the GW200115 data of the coalescence of a BH-NS binary, we place observational constraints on the NS scalar charge as well as the nonminimal coupling strength for a subclass of massless Horndeski theories with a luminal GW propagation. Unlike past related works, we exploit a waveform for a mixture of tensor and scalar polarizations. Taking the breathing mode into account, the scalar charge is more tightly constrained in comparison to the analysis of the tensor GWs alone. In nonminimally coupled theories including Brans-Dicke gravity and spontaneous scalarization scenarios with/without a kinetic screening, we put new bounds on model parameters of each theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider antisymmetric Metric-Affine Theories of Gravity with a Lagrangian containing the most general terms up to dimension four and search for theories that are ghost- and tachyon-free when expanded around flat space. We find new examples that propagate only the graviton and one other massive degree of freedom of spin zero, one or two. These models require terms of the form $(\nabla T)^2$ in the Lagrangian, that have been largely ignored in the literature.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Lensing of Spherically Symmetric Black Holes in Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational lensing of supermassive black holes surrounded by dark matter halo has attracted a great number of interests in recent years. However, many studies employed simplified dark matter density models, which makes it very hard to give a precise prediction on the dark matter effects in real astrophysical galaxies. In this work, to more accurately describe the distribution of dark matter in real astrophysical galaxies, we study the gravitational lensing of black holes in astrophysical dark matter halo models (Beta, Burkert, Brownstein, and Moore). The deflection angle is obtained using a generalized Gibbons-Werner approach. The visual angular positions and the Einstein rings are also calculated by adopting the gravitational lens equation. Specifically, we choose the supermassive black holes in Milky Way Galaxy, Andromeda galaxy (M31), Virgo galaxy (M87), and ESO138-G014 galaxy as examples, including the corresponding fitted value of dark matter halos. The results suggest that the dark matter halo described by the Beta model has non-negligible influences on the gravitational deflection angle and gravitational lensing observations. However, the Burkert, Brownstein, and Moore models have relatively small influences on angular position of images and the Einstein ring.</description>

      <title>A NIRCam-dark galaxy detected with the MIRI/F1000W filter in the MIDIS/JADES Hubble Ultra Deep Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of Cerberus, an extremely red object detected with the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) observations in the F1000W filter of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. The object is detected at $S/N\sim6$, with $\mathrm{F1000W}\sim27$ mag, and undetected in the NIRCam data gathered by the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey, JADES, fainter than the 30.0-30.5 mag $5\sigma$ detection limits in individual bands, as well as in the MIDIS F560W ultra-deep data ($\sim$29 mag, $5\sigma$). Analyzing the spectral energy distribution built with low-$S/N$ ($&lt;5$) measurements in individual optical-to-mid-infrared filters and higher $S/N$ ($\gtrsim5$) in stacked NIRCam data, we discuss the possible nature of this red NIRCam-dark source using a battery of codes. We discard the possibility of Cerberus being a Solar System body based on the $&lt;0.016$" proper motion in the 1-year apart JADES and MIDIS observations. A sub-stellar Galactic nature is deemed unlikely, given that the Cerberus' relatively flat NIRCam-to-NIRCam and very red NIRCam-to-MIRI flux ratios are not consistent with any brown dwarf model. The extragalactic nature of Cerberus offers 3 possibilities: (1) A $z\sim0.4$ galaxy with strong emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; the very low inferred stellar mass, $\mathrm{M}_\star=10^{5-6}$ M$_\odot$, makes this possibility highly improbable. (2) A dusty galaxy at $z\sim4$ with an inferred stellar mass $\mathrm{M}_\star\sim10^{8}$ M$_\odot$. (3) A galaxy with observational properties similar to those of the reddest little red dots discovered around $z\sim7$, but Cerberus lying at $z\sim15$, with the rest-frame optical dominated by emission from a dusty torus or a dusty starburst.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I present an introduction and topical review on axions as a dark matter candidate. Emphasis is placed on issues surrounding the cosmology of axion dark matter that are relevant for present-day searches, including: early-Universe production mechanisms, predictions of the axion mass, bounds on axion properties derived from cosmological data, as well as the direct and indirect detection of relic axion populations.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Bell Tests with Decoherence Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inflationary universe creates particle pairs, which are entangled in their momenta due to momentum conservation. Operators involving the momenta of the fluctuations can be rewritten into pseudo-spin operators, such as the Gour-Khanna-Mann-Revzen (GKMR) pseudo-spin. Making use of these pseudo-spin operators, cosmological Bell inequalities can be formulated. The violation of these Bell inequalities indicates the quantum nature of primordial fluctuations.
  In this work, we focus on primordial curvature perturbations. Since curvature perturbations arise from gravity, their action includes the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. We clarify the role of the boundary term in selecting suitable initial conditions for linear perturbations.
  After that, we proceed to the interactions of cosmological perturbations, including the bulk and boundary interaction terms, which introduce decoherence effects. These decoherence effects change the expectation value of the Bell operator, and gradually restore the Bell inequality. We describe this process by a ``Bell test curve'', which offers a window around 5 e-folds for testing the quantum origin of cosmological perturbations. We also explore the possibility of extracting the information of the decoherence rate and the structure of primordial interactions from the Bell test curve.</description>
