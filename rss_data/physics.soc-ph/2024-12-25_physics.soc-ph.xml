      <title>Post-pandemic social contacts in Italy: implications for social distancing measures on in-person school and work attendance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collection of updated data on social contact patterns following the COVID-19 pandemic disruptions is crucial for future epidemiological assessments and evaluating non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) based on physical distancing. We conducted two waves of an online survey in March 2022 and March 2023 in Italy, gathering data from a representative population sample on direct (verbal/physical interactions) and indirect (prolonged co-location in indoor spaces) contacts. Using a generalized linear mixed model, we examined determinants of individuals' total social contacts and evaluated the potential impact of work-from-home and distance learning on the transmissibility of respiratory pathogens. In-person attendance at work or school emerged as a primary driver of social contacts. Adults attending in person reported a mean of 1.69 (95% CI: 1.56-1.84) times the contacts of those staying home; among children and adolescents, this ratio increased to 2.38 (95% CI: 1.98-2.87). We estimated that suspending all non-essential work alone would marginally reduce transmissibility. However, combining distance learning for all education levels with work-from-home policies could decrease transmissibility by up to 23.7% (95% CI: 18.2%-29.0%). Extending these measures to early childcare services would yield only minimal additional benefits. These results provide useful data for modelling the transmission of respiratory pathogens in Italy after the end of the COVID-19 emergency. They also provide insights into the potential epidemiological effectiveness of social distancing interventions targeting work and school attendance, supporting considerations on the balance between the expected benefits and their heavy societal costs.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Sustainability Value and Dignified Well-Being in Inclusive Product Lifecycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sustainability is a concept mainly assessed by the features of a product that are considered as specific metrics for sustainability in an engineering context. However, sustainability is a comprehensive process for improvement in sustainable development that can be structured with the influence of inclusivity of empowered people. We define sustainability value, which measures the merit of the process to contribute to sustainable development. Sustainability is interrelated with the well-being and dignity of people; we propose a formula for dignified well-being to evaluate the benefit of dignity and well-being in an inclusive product lifecycle. This study uses the framework for assessing inclusivity and empowerment to correlate the influence of inclusivity of empowered people on sustainability value and dignified well-being. Based on the strength of the correlation, we can support the hypothesis that the inclusivity of empowered people can influence the sustainability value of the process and the dignified well-being of stakeholders. Due to the integration of qualitative methods in our approaches, we tested it with an intercoder reliability test with three coders. Results show high coder agreement and the generalisability of the framework.</description>

      <title>Trading Devil RL: Backdoor attack via Stock market, Bayesian Optimization and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models, a number of sub-fields of deep learning have made significant progress and are now very useful in everyday applications. For example, well-known financial institutions simulate a wide range of scenarios for various models created by their research teams using reinforcement learning, both before production and after regular operations. In this work, we propose a backdoor attack that focuses solely on data poisoning. This particular backdoor attack is classified as an attack without prior consideration or trigger, and we name it FinanceLLMsBackRL. Our aim is to examine the potential effects of large language models that use reinforcement learning systems for text production or speech recognition, finance, physics, or the ecosystem of contemporary artificial intelligence models.</description>

      <title>Supervised centrality Cvia sparse network influence regression: an application to the 2021 henan floods' social network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The social characteristics of players in a social network are closely associated with their network positions and relational importance. Identifying those influential players in a network is of great importance as it helps to understand how ties are formed, how information is propagated, and, in turn, can guide the dissemination of new information. Motivated by a Sina Weibo social network analysis of the 2021 Henan Floods, where response variables for each Sina Weibo user are available, we propose a new notion of supervised centrality that emphasizes the task-specific nature of a player's centrality. To estimate the supervised centrality and identify important players, we develop a novel sparse network influence regression by introducing individual heterogeneity for each user. To overcome the computational difficulties in fitting the model for large social networks, we further develop a forward-addition algorithm and show that it can consistently identify a superset of the influential Sina Weibo users. We apply our method to analyze three responses in the Henan Floods data: the number of comments, reposts, and likes, and obtain meaningful results. A further simulation study corroborates the developed method.</description>

      <title>CosIn: A Statistical-based Algorithm for Computation of Space-speed Time Delay in Pedestrian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03656v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise assessment of Space-speed time delay (TD) is critical for distinguishing between anticipation and reaction behaviors within pedestrian motion. Besides, the TD scale is instrumental in the evaluation of potential collision tendency of the crowd, thereby providing essential quantitative metrics for assessing risk. In this consideration, this paper introduced the CosIn algorithm for evaluating TD during pedestrian motion, which includes both the CosIn-1 and CosIn-2 algorithms. CosIn-1 algorithm analytically calculates TD, replacing the numerical method of discrete cross-correlation, whereas the CosIn-2 algorithm estimates the TD from a statistical perspective. Specifically, the CosIn-1 algorithm addresses the precise computation of TD for individual pedestrians, while the CosIn-2 algorithm is employed for assessing TD at the crowd scale, concurrently addressing the imperative of real-time evaluation. Efficacy analyses of the CosIn-1 and CosIn-2 algorithms are conducted with data from single-file pedestrian experiments and crowd-crossing experiments, respectively. During this process, the discrete cross-correlation method was employed as a baseline to evaluate the performance of both algorithms, which demonstrated notable accuracy. This algorithm facilitate the precise evaluation of behavior patterns and collision tendency within crowds, thereby enabling us to understand the crowds dynamics from a new perspective.</description>

      <title>CosForce: A Force-Based General Model Considering Pedestrian Anticipation and Reaction Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, a force-based general model, named the CosForce model, has been developed. To the best of our knowledge, this may represent the most simplified version of the force-based model. Considering the anisotropic interplay of pedestrians, the model focuses on binary interactions rather than metric-based interactions. Specifically, cosine functions are employed to describe the asymmetric interactions between the focal pedestrian and their nearest neighbor, implicitly simulating anticipation and reaction mechanisms. In addition to numerical calibration in basic scenarios, the simulation primarily focuses on two intriguing crowd phenomena: "phase separation" and the "catfish effect". Speed related metrics are introduced to quantitatively analyze self-organizing phenomena, and the "catfish effect" is examined from the perspective of momentum assessment. Many of the results require further exploration, particularly with support from empirical data. This study provides a new perspective on pedestrian modeling: the dynamics among pedestrians can be simplified as binary interactions.</description>
