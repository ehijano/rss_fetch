      <title>On $NP$ versus ${\rm co}NP$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove in this paper that there is a language $L_d$ accepted by some nondeterministic Turing machines but not by any ${\rm co}\mathcal{NP}$-machines (defined later). We further show that $L_d$ is in $\mathcal{NP}$, thus proving that $\mathcal{NP}\neq{\rm co}\mathcal{NP}$. The techniques used in this paper are lazy-diagonalization and the novel new technique developed in author's recent work \cite{Lin21}. As a by-product, we reach the important result \cite{Lin21} that $\mathcal{P}\neq\mathcal{NP}$ once again, which is clear from the above outcome and the well-known fact that $\mathcal{P}={\rm co}\mathcal{P}$. Other direct consequences are also summarized.</description>

      <title>Treewidth Inapproximability and Tight ETH Lower Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple, self-contained, linear reduction from 3-SAT to Treewidth. Specifically, it shows that 1.00005-approximating Treewidth is NP-hard, and solving Treewidth exactly requires $2^{\Omega(n)}$ time, unless the Exponential-Time Hypothesis fails. We further derive, under the latter assumption, that there is some constant $\delta &gt; 1$ such that $\delta$-approximating Treewidth requires time $2^{n^{1-o(1)}}$.</description>

      <title>A parallel framework for graphical optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study multi-marginal optimal transport (MOT) problems where the underlying cost has a graphical structure. These graphical multi-marginal optimal transport problems have found applications in several domains including traffic flow control and regression problems in the Wasserstein space. MOT problem can be approached through two aspects: a single big MOT problem, or coupled minor OT problems. In this paper, we focus on the latter approach and demonstrate it has efficiency gain from the parallelization. For tree-structured MOT problems, we introduce a novel parallelizable algorithm that significantly reduces computational complexity. Additionally, we adapt this algorithm for general graphs, employing the modified junction trees to enable parallel updates. Our contributions, validated through numerical experiments, offer new avenues for MOT applications and establish benchmarks in computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Quantum Property Testing Algorithm for the Concatenation of Two Palindromes Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a quantum property testing algorithm for recognizing a context-free language that is a concatenation of two palindromes $L_{REV}$. The query complexity of our algorithm is $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}n^{1/3}\log n)$, where $n$ is the length of an input. It is better than the classical complexity that is $\Theta^*(\sqrt{n})$.
  At the same time, in the general setting, the picture is different a little. Classical query complexity is $\Theta(n)$, and quantum query complexity is $\Theta^*(\sqrt{n})$. So, we obtain polynomial speed-up for both cases (general and property testing).</description>

      <title>Fixed-parameter tractability of canonical polyadic decomposition over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple proof that finding a rank-$R$ canonical polyadic decomposition of a 3-dimensional tensor over a finite field $\mathbb{F}$ is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to $R$ and $\mathbb{F}$. We also show a nontrivial upper bound on the time complexity of this problem.</description>

      <title>New Bounds on Quotient Polynomials with Applications to Exact Divisibility and Divisibility Testing of Sparse Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for monic polynomials $f, g \in \mathbb{C}[x]$ such that $g$ divides $f$, the $\ell_2$-norm of the quotient polynomial $f/g$ is bounded by $\lVert f \rVert_1 \cdot \tilde{O}(\lVert{g}\rVert_0^3\text{deg}^2{ f})^{\lVert{g}\rVert_0 - 1}$. This improves upon the previously known exponential (in $\text{deg}{ f}$) bounds for general polynomials. Our results implies that the trivial long division algorithm runs in quasi-linear time relative to the input size and number of terms of the quotient polynomial $f/g$, thus solving a long-standing problem on exact divisibility of sparse polynomials.
  We also study the problem of bounding the number of terms of $f/g$ in some special cases. When $f, g \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ and $g$ is a cyclotomic-free (i.e., it has no cyclotomic factors) trinomial, we prove that $\lVert{f/g}\rVert_0 \leq O(\lVert{f}\rVert_0 \text{size}({f})^2 \cdot \log^6{\text{deg}{ g}})$. When $g$ is a binomial with $g(\pm 1) \neq 0$, we prove that the sparsity is at most $O(\lVert{f}\rVert_0 ( \log{\lVert{f}\rVert_0} + \log{\lVert{f}\rVert_{\infty}}))$. Both upper bounds are polynomial in the input-size. We leverage these results and give a polynomial time algorithm for deciding whether a cyclotomic-free trinomial divides a sparse polynomial over the integers.
  As our last result, we present a polynomial time algorithm for testing divisibility by pentanomials over small finite fields when $\text{deg}{ f} = \tilde{O}(\text{deg}{ g})$.</description>

      <title>On the algorithmic descriptive complexity of attractors in topological dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the computational problem of rigorously describing the asymptotic behaviour of topological dynamical systems up to a finite but arbitrarily small pre-specified error. More precisely, we consider the limit set of a typical orbit, both as a spatial object (attractor set) and as a statistical distribution (physical measure), and prove upper bounds on the computational resources of computing descriptions of these objects with arbitrary accuracy. We also study how these bounds are affected by different dynamical constrains and provide several examples showing that our bounds are sharp in general. In particular, we exhibit a computable interval map having a unique transitive attractor with Cantor set structure supporting a unique physical measure such that both the attractor and the measure are non computable.</description>
