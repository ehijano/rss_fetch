      <title>Latent Space Dynamics Identification for Interface Tracking with Application to Shock-Induced Pore Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capturing sharp, evolving interfaces remains a central challenge in reduced-order modeling, especially when data is limited and the system exhibits localized nonlinearities or discontinuities. We propose LaSDI-IT (Latent Space Dynamics Identification for Interface Tracking), a data-driven framework that combines low-dimensional latent dynamics learning with explicit interface-aware encoding to enable accurate and efficient modeling of physical systems involving moving material boundaries. At the core of LaSDI-IT is a revised auto-encoder architecture that jointly reconstructs the physical field and an indicator function representing material regions or phases, allowing the model to track complex interface evolution without requiring detailed physical models or mesh adaptation. The latent dynamics are learned through linear regression in the encoded space and generalized across parameter regimes using Gaussian process interpolation with greedy sampling. We demonstrate LaSDI-IT on the problem of shock-induced pore collapse in high explosives, a process characterized by sharp temperature gradients and dynamically deforming pore geometries. The method achieves relative prediction errors below 9% across the parameter space, accurately recovers key quantities of interest such as pore area and hot spot formation, and matches the performance of dense training with only half the data. This latent dynamics prediction was 106 times faster than the conventional high-fidelity simulation, proving its utility for multi-query applications. These results highlight LaSDI-IT as a general, data-efficient framework for modeling discontinuity-rich systems in computational physics, with potential applications in multiphase flows, fracture mechanics, and phase change problems.</description>

      <title>Omnisoot: an object-oriented process design package for gas-phase synthesis of carbonaceous nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A computational tool, Omnisoot, was developed utilizing the chemical kinetics capabilities of Cantera to model the formation of carbonaceous nanoparticles, such as soot and Carbon Black (CB), from the reactions of gaseous hydrocarbons. Omnisoot integrates constant volume, constant pressure, perfectly stirred, and plug flow reactor models with four inception models from the literature, as well as two population balance models: a monodisperse model and a sectional model. This package serves as an integrated process design tool to predict soot mass, morphology, and composition under varying process conditions. The modeling approach accounts for soot inception, surface growth, and oxidation, coupled with detailed gas-phase chemistry, to close the mass and energy balances of the gas-particle system; subsequently, soot and gas-phase chemistry are linked to the particle dynamics models that consider the evolving fractal-like structure of soot agglomerates. The developed tool was employed to highlight the similarities and differences among the implemented inception models in predicting soot mass, morphology, and size distribution for three use-cases: methane pyrolysis in a shock tube, ethylene pyrolysis in a flow reactor, and ethylene combustion in a perfectly stirred reactor. The simulations of 5% $\mathrm{CH_4}$ pyrolysis in shock-tube with short residence times ($\approx1.5$ ms) demonstrated that multiple combinations of inception and surface growth rates minimized the prediction error for carbon yield but led to markedly different morphologies, emphasizing the need for measured data on soot morphology to constrain inception and surface growth rates. The comparison of simulation results in a pyrolysis flow reactor at three different flow rates suggested that only irreversible models can predict bimodality in particle size distribution.</description>

      <title>TMMax: High-performance modeling of multilayer thin-film structures using transfer matrix method with JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical multilayer thin-films are fundamental components that enable the precise control of reflectance, transmittance, and phase shift in the design of photonic systems. Rapid and accessible simulation of these structures holds critical importance for designing and analyzing complex coatings, such as distributed Bragg reflectors, anti-reflection layers, and spectral filters. While researchers commonly use the traditional transfer matrix method for designing these structures, its scalar approach to wavelength and angle of incidence causes redundant recalculations and inefficiencies in large-scale simulations. Furthermore, traditional method implementations do not support automatic differentiation, which limits their applicability in gradient-based inverse design approaches. Here, we present TMMax, a Python library that fully vectorizes and accelerates transfer matrix method using the high-performance machine learning library JAX. TMMax supports CPU, GPU, and TPU hardware, includes a publicly available material database, and offers comprehensive multilayer optical thin-film analysis tools. Our approach, demonstrated through benchmarking, allows us to model thin-film stacks with hundreds of layers within seconds. This illustrates that our method achieves a simulation speedup of x100s over a baseline NumPy implementation, providing a significant advantage in computational efficiency. Our method enables rapid and scalable simulations of large and complex multilayer thin-film structures, significantly accelerating the design process.</description>

      <title>Solid-State Dewetting of Polycrystalline Thin Films: a Phase Field Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state dewetting (SSD) is the process by which thin solid films break up and retract on a substrate, resulting in the formation of nanostructures and islands. While SSD in single-crystalline films is generally understood as a surface-energy-driven process mediated by surface diffusion, polycrystalline films feature additional complexity due to the presence of grain boundaries. Theoretical investigations and simulation frameworks have mainly focused on single-crystalline SSD. In this work, we present and apply a multi-phase-field framework that captures key mechanisms in polycrystalline thin films with multiple grains and grain boundaries in three dimensions. By considering isotropic surface and interface energy and curvature-driven grain boundary motion, we demonstrate how the framework reproduces the key phenomenology of SSD while being consistent with predictions based on energetic arguments. We also introduce refined analytical criteria for the onset of dewetting, confirmed by numerical simulations. Key evidence is given concerning the onset of dewetting at grain-boundary triple junctions. Moreover, we showcase SSD of polycrystalline patches. This work paves the way for in-depth investigations of the morphological evolution of polycrystalline thin films.</description>

      <title>Functional Neural Wavefunction Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for the design and analysis of optimization algorithms in variational quantum Monte Carlo, drawing on geometric insights into the corresponding function space. The framework translates infinite-dimensional optimization dynamics into tractable parameter-space algorithms through a Galerkin projection onto the tangent space of the variational ansatz. This perspective unifies existing methods such as stochastic reconfiguration and Rayleigh-Gauss-Newton, provides connections to classic function-space algorithms, and motivates the derivation of novel algorithms with geometrically principled hyperparameter choices. We validate our framework with numerical experiments demonstrating its practical relevance through the accurate estimation of ground-state energies for several prototypical models in condensed matter physics modeled with neural network wavefunctions.</description>

      <title>Quorum sensing of light-activated colloids in nematic liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motile living organisms routinely probe their surroundings to adapt in ever-evolving environments. Although synthetic microswimmers offer surrogates for self-propelled living entities, they often lack the complex feedback mechanisms that enable organisms to adapt. In this work, we present an experimental platform in which light-activated colloids dispersed in a nematic liquid crystal can (i) switch from directed to active Brownian motion depending on the nematic anchoring and (ii) mechanically adjust their motility in response to crowding, effectively enforcing quorum-sensing interactions. Both features are caused by a distinctive self-propulsion mechanism as unveiled through experiments, simulations, and theory. We characterize the dynamics of a single colloid and demonstrate that its motion is captured by an active Brownian particle model if the nematic anchoring is homeotropic, and by directed self-propulsion along the nematic director if the anchoring is planar. Next, we investigate the many-body dynamics, showing that it undergoes a clustering phase separation through effective quorum-sensing interactions. Our work suggests how to create adaptive materials with life-like capabilities using readily accessible properties of liquid crystals and colloids without explicitly engineering any of the needed mechano-chemical feedbacks.</description>

      <title>Wallpaper Group-Based Mechanical Metamaterials: Dataset Including Mechanical Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials often exhibit pattern transformations through instabilities, enabling applications in, e.g., soft robotics, sound reduction, and biomedicine. These transformations and their resulting mechanical properties are closely tied to the symmetries in these metamaterials' microstructures, which remain under-explored. Designing such materials is challenging due to the unbounded design space, and while machine learning offers promising tools, they require extensive training data. Here, we present a large dataset of 2D microstructures and their macroscopic mechanical responses in the hyperelastic, finite-strain regime, including buckling. The microstructures are generated using a novel method, which covers all 17 wallpaper symmetry groups and employs B\'ezier curves for a rich parametric space. Mechanical responses are obtained through finite element-based computational homogenization. The dataset includes 1,020 distinct geometries, each subjected to 12 loading trajectories, totaling 12,240 trajectories. Our dataset supports the development and benchmarking of surrogate models, facilitates the study of symmetry-property relationships, and enables investigations into symmetry-breaking during pattern transformations, potentially revealing emergent behavior in mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing phase transitions through time scale entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method based on the compression of arbitrary multi-point correlators into quantics tensor trains and studying its so called bond dimension as an indicator of time scale entanglement in the system. This quantics tensor train diagnostics approach allows us to i) identify quantum phase transitions (ground state crossings) and thermal crossovers, ii) distinguish between these two by allowing flexibility through iii) using arbitrary available correlators and iv) the possibility to deal with low-accuracy input data through varying the quantics tensor train cutoffs. We verify the validity of the approach by studying the phase diagram of the Hubbard dimer, the four-site Hubbard ring with and without next-nearest neighbor hopping and the single-impurity Anderson model. We find time scale entanglement to be a system-inherent property becoming maximal at phase transitions and crossover, which translates to peaks in the quantics tensor train bond dimension of correlator functions. Additionally, the connection of the method to other physical quantities, such as various entanglement measures and susceptibilities, is shown.</description>

      <title>Impacts of flow velocity and microbubbles on water flushing in a horizontal pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water flushing to remove particle sediment is essential for safe and continuous transport of many industrial slurries through pipelines. An efficient flushing strategy may reduce water consumption and the cost associated with water usage, and help water conservation for sustainability. In this study, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model coupled with the kinetic theory of granular flow for the flushing process is presented. The CFD models were validated against field data collected from a coal slurry pipeline of 128 $km$ in length, 0.575~$m$ in diameter, achieving an average error of less than 15\% for outlet solid concentration over time. A parametric study evaluated the effects of water velocity (1.88-5.88~$m/s$), bubble size (50~$\mu m$, 150~$\mu m$, and 1000~$\mu m$) and bubble volume fraction (0.05-0.2) on flushing performance including pipeline cleanness, cleanness efficiency, and water consumption. The obtained outcomes indicate that higher water velocity is preferred and an increase in water velocity from $1.88~m/s$ to $5.88~m/s$ reduces the water consumption by $28\%$. Large bubbles may hinder the flushing process and increase the water consumption by $23\%$. Remarkably, small bubbles facilitates the flushing process and lead to $35\%$ reduction in water consumption. These effects are attributed to the turbulent characteristics in the pipelines in presence of microbubbles.</description>

      <title>Spin Relaxation Mechanisms and Nuclear Spin Entanglement of the V$_B^{-1}$ Center in hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy $V_B^-$ defect in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently emerged as a promising spin qubit for sensing due to its high-temperature spin control and versatile integration into van der Waals structures. While extensive experiments have explored their coherence properties, much less is known about the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and its control-parameter dependence. In this work, we develop a parameter-free spin dynamics model based on the cluster-expansion technique to investigate $T_1$ relaxation mechanisms at low temperature. Our results reveal that the $V_B^-$ center constitutes a strongly coupled electron spin-nuclear spin core, which necessitates the inclusion of the coherent dynamics and derived memory effects of the three nearest-neighbor nitrogen nuclear spins. Using this framework, this work closely reproduces the experimentally observed $T_1$ time at $B = 90\,\mathrm{G}$ and further predicts the $T_1$ dependence on external magnetic field in the $0 \le B \le 2000\,\mathrm{G}$ interval, when the spin relaxation is predominantly driven by electron-nuclear and nuclear-nuclear flip-flop processes mediated by hyperfine and dipolar interactions. This study establishes a reliable and scalable approach for describing $T_1$ relaxation in $V_B^-$ centers and offers microscopic insights to support future developments in nuclear-spin-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Multiscale patterns of migration flows in Austria: regionalization, administrative barriers, and urban-rural divides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Migration is central in various societal problems related to socioeconomic development. While much of the existing research has focused on international migration, migration patterns within a single country remain relatively unexplored. In this work we study internal migration patterns in Austria for a period of over 20 years, obtained from open and high-granularity administrative records. We employ inferential network methods to characterize the flows between municipalities and extract their clustering according to similar target and destination rates. Our methodology reveals significant deviations from commonly assumed relocation patterns modeled by the gravity law. At the same time, we observe unexpected biases of internal migrations that leads to less frequent movements across boundaries at both district and state levels than predictions suggest. This leads to significant regionalization of migration at multiple geographical scales and augmented division between urban and rural areas. These patterns appear to be remarkably persistent across decades of migration data, demonstrating systematic limitations of conventionally used gravity models in migration studies. Our approach presents a robust methodology that can be used to improve such evaluations, and can reveal new phenomena in migration networks.</description>

      <title>BridgeNet: A Hybrid, Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Solving High-Dimensional Fokker-Planck Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04354v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: BridgeNet is a novel hybrid framework that integrates convolutional neural networks with physics-informed neural networks to efficiently solve non-linear, high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations (FPEs). Traditional PINNs, which typically rely on fully connected architectures, often struggle to capture complex spatial hierarchies and enforce intricate boundary conditions. In contrast, BridgeNet leverages adaptive CNN layers for effective local feature extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function that rigorously enforces physical constraints. Extensive numerical experiments across various test cases demonstrate that BridgeNet not only achieves significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to conventional PINN approaches but also maintains robust stability in high-dimensional settings. This work represents a substantial advancement in computational physics, offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology with promising applications in fields ranging from financial mathematics to complex system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Mode-Dependent Phonon Relaxation in fcc Ni: Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Frozen-Trajectory Excitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a computational method and apply it to study phonon relaxation in face-centered cubic (fcc) nickel (Ni). The phonons are excited beyond their thermal equilibrium population, and the relaxation behavior is analyzed as a function of both the wave vector $\vec{q}$ and the phonon frequency $\omega$. To efficiently investigate these excitations, we introduce a trajectory post-processing technique, the frozen-trajectory excitation, which facilitates the $(\vec{q},\omega)$-resolved analysis. Molecular dynamics simulations combined with frozen-phonon multislice calculations predict relaxation signatures observable with time-resolved transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at 10--20 fs resolution. Our findings indicate mode dependence in the relaxation processes, highlighting the importance of considering phonon-specific behavior in ultrafast dynamics.</description>

Abstract: The computational expense of solving non-equilibrium chemistry equations in astrophysical simulations poses a significant challenge, particularly in high-resolution, large-scale cosmological models. In this work, we explore the potential of machine learning, specifically Neural Operators, to emulate the Grackle chemistry solver, which is widely used in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Neural Operators offer a mesh-free, data-driven approach to approximate solutions to coupled ordinary differential equations governing chemical evolution, gas cooling, and heating. We construct and train multiple Neural Operator architectures (DeepONet variants) using a dataset derived from cosmological simulations to optimize accuracy and efficiency. Our results demonstrate that the trained models accurately reproduce Grackle's outputs with an average error of less than 0.6 dex in most cases, though deviations increase in highly dynamic chemical environments. Compared to Grackle, the machine learning models provide computational speedups of up to a factor of six in large-scale simulations, highlighting their potential for reducing computational bottlenecks in astrophysical modeling. However, challenges remain, particularly in iterative applications where accumulated errors can lead to numerical instability. Additionally, the performance of these machine learning models is constrained by their need for well-represented training datasets and the limited extrapolation capabilities of deep learning methods. While promising, further development is required for Neural Operator-based emulators to be fully integrated into astrophysical simulations. Future work should focus on improving stability over iterative timesteps and optimizing implementations for hardware acceleration. This study provides an initial step toward the broader adoption of machine learning approaches in astrophysical chemistry solvers.</description>

      <title>Conservative projection-based data-driven model order reduction of a fluid-kinetic spectral solver</title>

Abstract: Kinetic simulations are computationally intensive due to six-dimensional phase space discretization. Many kinetic spectral solvers use the asymmetrically weighted Hermite expansion due to its conservation and fluid-kinetic coupling properties, i.e., the lower-order Hermite moments capture and describe the macroscopic fluid dynamics and higher-order Hermite moments describe the microscopic kinetic dynamics. We leverage this structure by developing a parametric data-driven reduced-order model based on the proper orthogonal decomposition, which projects the higher-order kinetic moments while retaining the fluid moments intact. This approach can also be understood as learning a nonlocal closure via a reduced modal decomposition. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that the method ensures local and global mass, momentum, and energy conservation. The numerical results show that the proposed method effectively replicates the high-dimensional spectral simulations at a fraction of the computational cost and memory, as validated on the weak Landau damping and two-stream instability benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>Qracle: A Graph-Neural-Network-based Parameter Initializer for Variational Quantum Eigensolvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) are a leading class of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms with broad applications in quantum physics and quantum chemistry. However, as system size increases, VQE optimization is increasingly hindered by the barren plateau phenomenon, where gradients vanish and the loss function becomes trapped in local minima. While machine learning-based parameter initialization methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they often show limited effectiveness in complex VQE problems. This is primarily due to their inadequate ability to model the intricate correlations embedded in the Hamiltonian structure and the associated ansatz circuits. In this paper, we propose \textit{Qracle}, a graph neural network (GNN)-based parameter initializer for VQEs. \textit{Qracle} systematically encodes both the Hamiltonian and the associated ansatz circuit into a unified graph representation and leverages a GNN to learn a mapping from VQE problem graphs to optimized ansatz parameters. Compared to state-of-the-art initialization techniques, \textit{Qracle} achieves a reduction in initial loss of up to $10.86$, accelerates convergence by decreasing optimization steps by up to $64.42\%$, and improves final performance with up to a $26.43\%$ reduction in Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).</description>

      <title>Kinematic dynamos and resolution limits for Smoothed Particle Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the origin and evolution of magnetic fields on cosmological scales opens up a window into the physics of the early Universe. Numerical simulations of such fields require a careful treatment to faithfully solve the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) without introducing numerical artefacts. In this paper, we study the growth of the magnetic fields in controlled kinematic dynamo setups using both smoothed particle hydrodynamics implementations in the SWIFT code. We assess the quality of the reconstructed solution in the Roberts flow case against the reference implementation in the Pencil code and find generally a good agreement. Similarly, we reproduce the known features of the more complex ABC flow. Using a simple induction-diffusion balance model to analyse the results, we construct an "overwinding" trigger metric to locally detect regions where the magnetic diffusion cannot counteract the expected induction because of limitations in the method's ability to resolve magnetic field gradients. This metric is then used to identify the necessary resolution and resistivity levels to counteract the overwinding problem. We finally apply this metric to adiabatic cosmological simulations and discuss the resolution requirements needed to resolve the growth of the primordial fields without artefacts.</description>

      <title>Quantum block Krylov subspace projector algorithm for computing low-lying eigenenergies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing eigenvalues is a computationally intensive task central to numerous applications in the natural sciences. Toward this end, we investigate the quantum block Krylov subspace projector (QBKSP) algorithm - a multireference quantum Lanczos method designed to accurately compute low-lying eigenenergies, including degenerate ones, of quantum systems. We present three compact quantum circuits tailored to different problem settings for evaluating the required expectation values. To assess the impact of the number and fidelity of initial reference states, as well as time evolution duration, we perform error-free and limited-precision numerical simulations and quantum circuit simulations. Our results show that using multiple reference states significantly enhances convergence, particularly in precision-limited scenarios and in cases where a single reference state fails to capture all target eigenvalues. Additionally, the QBKSP algorithm allows for the determination of degenerate eigenstates and their multiplicities through appropriate convergence conditions.</description>

      <title>Correcting systematic errors in the likelihood optimization of underdamped Langevin models of molecular dynamics trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since Kramers' pioneering work in 1940, significant efforts have been devoted to studying Langevin equations applied to physical and chemical reactions projected onto few collective variables, with particular focus on the inference of their parameters. While the inference for overdamped Langevin equations is well-established and widely applied, a notable gap remains in the literature for underdamped Langevin equation. This gap arises from the challenge of accessing velocities solely through finite differences of positions, resulting in spurious correlations. In this letter, we propose an analytical correction for these correlations, specifically designed for a likelihood-maximization algorithm that exploits short, non-ergodic trajectories that can be obtained at reasonable numerical cost. The accuracy and robustness of our approach are tested on a benchmark case and a realistic system. This work paves the way for applying generalized Langevin equation inference to activated phenomena, such as chemical reactions, in several scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon vertex correction effect in superconducting H3S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Migdal-Eliashberg (ME) formalism provides a reliable framework for describing phonon-mediated superconductivity in the adiabatic regime, where the electronic Fermi energy exceeds the characteristic phonon energy. In this work, we go beyond this limit by incorporating first-order vertex corrections to the electron-phonon (e-ph) interaction within the Eliashberg formalism and assess their impact on the superconducting properties of H3S and Pb using first-principles calculations. For H3S, where the adiabatic assumption breaks down, we find that vertex corrections to the e-ph coupling are substantial. When combined with phonon anharmonicity and the energy dependence of the electronic density of states, the predicted critical temperature (Tc) is in very good agreement with experimental observations. In contrast, for elemental Pb, where the adiabatic approximation remains valid, vertex corrections have a negligible effect, and the calculated Tc and superconducting gap closely match the predictions of the standard ME formalism. These findings demonstrate the importance of non-adiabatic corrections in strongly coupled high-Tc hydrides and establish a robust first-principles framework for accurately predicting superconducting properties across different regimes.</description>
