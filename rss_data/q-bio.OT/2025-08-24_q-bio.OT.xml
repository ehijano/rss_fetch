      <title>Wired Beneath, Scented Above: A Dual-Parameter Approach to Soil-Plant Interaction via Electrical Resistance and VOC Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plants, being sessile organisms, have evolved a variety of defense mechanisms to protect themselves from invaders such as pathogens, insects, and herbivores. One key strategy is the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the air, which serve as warning signals to nearby plants, prompting them to activate their own defense mechanisms. Although plant communication through VOCs is well-documented, the interaction between VOC emissions and soil-released allelochemicals remains less understood. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the release of allelochemicals and VOCs by chickpea (gram) plants, focusing on their role in plant signalling. We grew 25 chickpea plants in individual beakers with soil as the growth medium. The release of allelochemicals was monitored indirectly by measuring the electrical resistance of the soil, while VOC emissions were analyzed using MQ-3 gas sensors. Continuous monitoring provided insights into soil chemistry changes potentially influenced by allelochemical release, alongside the VOC profile captured by the sensors. Spearman correlation analysis was applied to evaluate the relationship between allelochemical release and VOC emissions. Understanding this interplay could contribute to the development of sensor networks for early detection of plant stress, offering a potential strategy for reducing crop losses and improving agricultural resilience.</description>

      <title>Scalable Scientific Interest Profiling Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research profiles help surface scientists' expertise but are often outdated. We develop and evaluate two large language model-based methods to generate scientific interest profiles: one summarizing PubMed abstracts and one using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, and compare them with researchers' self-written profiles. We assembled titles, MeSH terms, and abstracts for 595 faculty at Columbia University Irving Medical Center; self-authored profiles were available for 167. Using GPT-4o-mini, we generated profiles and assessed them with automatic metrics and blinded human review. Lexical overlap with self-written profiles was low (ROUGE-L, BLEU, METEOR), while BERTScore indicated moderate semantic similarity (F1: 0.542 for MeSH-based; 0.555 for abstract-based). Paraphrased references yielded 0.851, highlighting metric sensitivity. TF-IDF Kullback-Leibler divergence (8.56 for MeSH-based; 8.58 for abstract-based) suggested distinct keyword choices. In manual review, 77.78 percent of MeSH-based profiles were rated good or excellent, readability was favored in 93.44 percent of cases, and panelists preferred MeSH-based over abstract-based profiles in 67.86 percent of comparisons. Overall, large language models can generate researcher profiles at scale; MeSH-derived profiles tend to be more readable than abstract-derived ones. Machine-generated and self-written profiles differ conceptually, with human summaries introducing more novel ideas.</description>
