      <title>The Orbit and Mass of the Cepheid AW Per</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cepheid AW Per is a component in a multiple system with a long period orbit. The radial velocities of Griffin (2016) cover the 38 year orbit well. An extensive program of interferometry with the CHARA array is reported here, from which the long period orbit is determined. In addition, a {\it Hubble Space Telescope} high resolution spectrum in the ultraviolet demonstrates that the companion is itself a binary with nearly equal mass components. These data combined with a distance from {\it Gaia} provide a mass of the Cepheid (primary) of M$_1$ = 6.79 $\pm$ 0.85 $M_\odot$. The combined mass of the secondary is M$_S$ = 8.79 $\pm$ 0.50 $M_\odot$. The accuracy of the mass will be improved after the fourth Gaia data release expected in approximately two years.</description>

      <title>A high-resolution imaging survey of massive young stellar objects in the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraints on the binary fraction of young massive stellar objects (mYSOs) are important for binary and massive star formation theory. Here, we present speckle imaging of 34 mYSOs located in the Large (1/2 $Z_{\odot}$) and Small Magellanic Clouds ($\sim$1/5 $Z_{\odot}$), probing projected separations between the 2000-20000 au (at angular scales of 0.02-0.2") range, for stars above 8 $M_{\odot}$. We find two wide binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud (from a sample of 23 targets), but none in a sample of 11 in the Small Magellanic Cloud, leading us to adopt a wide binary fraction of 9$\pm$5%, and $&lt;$5%, respectively. We rule out a wide binary fraction greater than 35% in the Large, and 38% in the Small Magellanic Cloud at the 99% confidence level. This is in contrast to the wide binary fraction of mYSOs in the Milky Way (presumed $Z_{\odot}$), which within the physical parameter space probed by this study is $\sim$15-60% from the literature. We argue that while selection effects could be responsible for the lower binary fraction observed; it is more likely that there are underlying physical mechanisms responsible for the observed properties. This indicates that metallicity and environmental effects may influence the formation of wide binaries among massive stars. Future larger, statistically more significant samples of high-mass systems in low-metallicity environments, and for comparison in the Milky Way, are essential to confirm or repudiate our claim.</description>

      <title>NEOWISE-R Caught the Luminous SN 2023ixf in Messier 101</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reactivated Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE-R) serendipitously caught the Type II supernova SN 2023ixf in Messier 101 on the rise, starting day 3.6 through day 10.9, and on the late-time decline from days 211 through 213 and days 370 through 372. We have considered these mid-infrared (mid-IR) data together with observations from the ultraviolet (UV) through the near-IR, when possible. At day 3.6 we approximated the optical emission with a hot, ~26,630 K blackbody, with a notable UV excess likely from strong SN shock interaction with circumstellar matter (CSM). In the IR, however, a clear excess is also obvious, and we fit it with a cooler, ~1,620 K blackbody with radius of ~2.6 x 10^{15} cm, consistent with dust in the progenitor's circumstellar shell likely heated by the UV emission from the CSM interaction. On day 10.8, the light detected was consistent with SN ejecta-dominated emission. At late times we also observed a clear NEOWISE-R excess, which could arise either from newly formed dust in the inner ejecta or in the contact discontinuity between the forward and reverse shocks, or from more distant pre-existing dust grains in the SN environment. Furthermore, the large 4.6 micron excess at late times can also be explained by the emergence of the carbon monoxide 1--0 vibrational band. SN 2023ixf is the best-observed SN IIP in the mid-IR during the first several days after explosion and one of the most luminous such SNe ever seen.</description>

      <title>Observations of the Formation and Disappearance of a Funnel Prominence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an observational study of the formation and disappearance of a funnel prominence. Before the funnel prominence formed, cool materials from the top of a preexisting polar crown prominence flowed along saddle-shaped coronal loops to their base, forming a smaller prominence. Meanwhile, the saddle-shaped coronal loops gradually rose, and U-shaped coronal loops, termed prominence horns, began to appear along with a coronal cavity. Afterwards, a cool column emerged from the chromosphere, rose vertically into the corona, and then moved laterally to be transported into the U-shaped coronal loops. The formed prominence slid into the chromosphere, while the U-shaped coronal loops and the coronal cavity became more pronounced. As cool materials accumulated at the base of the U-shaped coronal loops, these loops underwent a significant descent and a V-shaped structure appeared at the base of the cool materials, indicating that the U-shaped coronal loops may be dragged down to sag. Subsequently, cool materials from the V-shaped structure continued to flow almost vertically toward the chromosphere, forming the funnel prominence. The vertical downflows might be produced by magnetic reconnection within or between the sagging field lines. Due to persistent vertical downflows, the U-shaped coronal loops were lifted up and prominence materials followed along inclined coronal loops towards the chromosphere, causing the funnel prominence to disappear. Our observations suggest that chromospheric plasma transported into a coronal cavity and then drained out via vertical downflows can form a funnel prominence.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Stellar Rotation of Early-type Stars in the LAMOST Medium-resolution Survey. III. Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar rotation significantly shapes the evolution of massive stars, yet the interplay of mass and metallicity remains elusive, limiting our capacity to construct accurate stellar evolution models and to better estimate the impact of rotation in chemical evolution of galaxies. Our goal is to investigate how mass and metallicity influence the rotational evolution of A-type stars on the main sequence (MS). We seek to identify deviations in rotational behaviors that could serve as new constraints to existing stellar models. Using the LAMOST median-resolution survey Data Release 9, we derived stellar parameters for a population of 104,752 A-type stars. Our study focused on the evolution of surface rotational velocities and their dependence on mass and metallicity in 84,683 `normal' stars. Normalized surface rotational revealed a prevailing evolutionary profile from 1.7 to 4.0 $M_\odot$. This profile features an initial rapid acceleration until $t/t_\mathrm{ms} = 0.25$, potentially a second acceleration peak near $t/t_\mathrm{ms} = 0.55$ for stars heavier than 2.5 $M_\odot$, followed by a steady decline and a `hook' feature at the end. Surpassing theoretical expectations, the initial acceleration likely stems from a concentrated distribution of angular momentum at ZAMS, resulting in a prolonged increase in speed. The inverse circulation becomes more efficient at lower metallicity, explaining the correlation of the slope of this deceleration phase with metallicity from -0.3 dex up to 0.1 dex. The metal-poor subsample suggests a mechanism dependent on metallicity for removing angular momentum during star formation. The proportion of fast rotators decreases with an increase in metallicity, up to $\log(Z/Z_\odot)\sim -0.2$, a trend consistent with observations of OB-type stars found in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Solar Differential Rotation by Absolutely Calibrated Iodine-Cell Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The iodine-cell technique, which is known to be efficient in precisely establishing Doppler velocity shifts, was once applied by the author to measuring the solar differential rotation based on full-disk spectroscopic observations (Takeda and Ueno, Sol. Phys. 270, 447, 2011). However, the data reduction procedure (in simple analogy with the stellar case) adopted therein was not necessarily adequate, because specific characteristic involved with the disk-resolved Sun (i.e., center-limb variation of line strengths) was not properly taken into consideration. Therefore, this problem is revisited based on the same data but with an application to theoretical spectrum fitting, which can yield absolute heliocentric radial velocities (v_obs) in a consistent manner as shown in the study of solar gravitational redshift (Takeda and Ueno, Sol. Phys. 281, 551, 2012). Likewise, instead of converting v_obs into omega (angular velocity) at each disk point, which suffers considerable errors especially near the central meridian, omega was derived this time by applying the least squares analysis to a dataset comprising v_obs values at many points. This new analysis resulted in omega (deg/day) = 13.92 (+/- 0.03) -1.69(+/- 0.34)(sin psi)^2 -2.37(+/- 0.62) (sin psi)^4 (psi: the heliographic latitude) along with the gravitational redshift of 675 m/s, which are favorably compared with previous publications. In addition, how the distribution of observing points on the disk affects the result is also examined, which reveals that rotation parameters may suffer appreciable errors depending on cases.</description>

      <title>Hemispheric analysis of the magnetic flux in regular and irregular solar active regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the hemispheric distribution of active regions (ARs) with different magnetic morphology may clarify the features of the dynamo process that is hidden under the photospheric level. The magnetic flux data for 3047 ARs from the CrAO catalog between May 1996 and December 2021 (cycles 23 and 24) were used to study ARs cyclic variations and perform correlation analysis. According to the magneto-morphological classification (MMC) of ARs proposed earlier, subsets of the regular (obeying empirical rules for sunspots) and irregular (violating these rules) ARs were considered separately. Our analysis shows the following. For ARs of each MMC type, in each of the hemispheres, time profiles demonstrate a multi-peak structure. The double-peak structure of a cycle is formed by ARs of both MMC types in both hemispheres. For the irregular ARs, the pronounced peaks occur in the second maxima (close to the polar field reversal). Their significant hemispheric imbalance might be caused by a weakening of the toroidal field in one of the hemispheres due to the interaction between the dipolar and quadrupolar components of the global field, which facilitates the manifestation of the turbulent component of the dynamo. The similarity of the irregular ARs activity that was found in adjacent cycles in different hemispheres also hints at realization of the mix-parity dynamo solution. For the quadrupolar-like component of the flux (compiled in the simple axisymmetric approximation), signs of oscillations with a period of about 15 years are found, and they are pronounced specifically for the irregular groups. This MMC type ARs might also contribute in $\alpha$-quenching.</description>

      <title>A population of mid-infrared large-amplitude variable young stellar objects from unTimely</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing a decade-long unTimely dataset, supplemented by multi-band data from archives, we search for young stellar objects (YSOs) with variations larger than one magnitude in W1 band within a region of 110 square degrees in the Galactic plane, covered by VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV). A total of 641 candidate YSOs have been identified. We classified them into bursts, dips, faders, seculars, and irregulars. Within the burst category, 18 sources were identified as FUor candidates and 1 as an EXor candidate. Irregulars are the most prevalent in the sample. In both bursts and faders, the redder sources tend to show a pattern of bluer when brighter, whereas the bluer sources display the opposite trend, possibly related to the accretion structure of YSOs at different stages. Finally, we obtained the recurrence time scale for FUor eruptions at various stages of YSO evolution. Our findings indicate that younger YSOs generally experience more frequent eruptions compared to older ones.</description>

      <title>The Incompressible Magnetohydrodynamic Energy Cascade Rate Upstream of Mars: Effects of the Total Energy and the Cross-Helicity on Solar Wind Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar wind turbulence is a dynamical phenomenon that evolves with heliocentric distance. Orbiting Mars since September 2014, Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) offers a unique opportunity to explore some of its main properties beyond ~1.38 au. Here, we analyze solar wind turbulence upstream of Mars's bow shock, utilizing more than five years of magnetic field and plasma measurements. This analysis is based on two complementary methodologies: 1) the computation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) invariants characterizing incompressible fluctuations; 2) the estimation of the incompressible energy cascade rate at MHD scales (i.e., $\langle\varepsilon^{T}\rangle_{MHD}$). Our results show the solar wind incompressible fluctuations are primarily in a magnetically dominated regime, with the component travelling away from the Sun having a higher median pseudo-energy. Moreover, turbulent fluctuations have a total energy per mass of up to ~300 km2 s-2, a range smaller than reported at 1 au. For these conditions, we determine the probability distribution function of $\langle\varepsilon^{T}\rangle_{MHD}$ ranges mainly between ~-1x10-16 and ~1x10-16 J m-3 s-1, with a median equal to -1.8x10-18 J m-3 s-1, suggesting back-transfer of energy. Our results also suggest that $|\langle\varepsilon^{T}\rangle_{MHD}|$ is correlated with the total energy per mass of fluctuations and that the median of $\langle\varepsilon^{T}\rangle_{MHD}$ does not vary significantly with the cross-helicity. We find, however, that the medians of the inward and outward pseudo-energy cascade rates vary with the solar wind cross-helicity. Finally, we discuss these results and their implications for future studies that can provide further insight into the factors affecting solar wind energy transfer rate.</description>

      <title>Active Learning for Stellar Spectral Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised machine learning models are increasingly being used for solving the problem of stellar classification of spectroscopic data. However, training such models requires a large number of labelled instances, the collection of which is usually costly in both time and expertise. This paper explores the application of active learning algorithms to sampling stellar spectra using data from a highly class-imbalanced dataset. We utilize the MaStar library from the SDSS DR17 along with its associated stellar parameter catalogue. Using different active learning algorithms, we iteratively select informative instances, where the model or committee of models exhibits the highest uncertainty or disagreement, respectively. We assess the effectiveness of the sampling techniques by comparing several performance metrics of supervised-learning models trained on the queried samples with randomly-sampled counterparts. Evaluation metrics include specificity, sensitivity, and the area under the curve, in addition to the Matthew\'s correlation coefficient, which offers a more-balanced assessment that considers all aspects of the confusion matrix, and is thus more suitable for use with imbalanced datasets. We apply this procedure to effective temperature, surface gravity, and iron metallicity, separately. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of active learning algorithms in selecting samples that produce performance metrics superior to random sampling and even stratified samples. We discuss the implications of the findings for prioritizing instance labelling of astronomical-survey data by experts or crowdsourcing to mitigate the high time cost.</description>

      <title>Surface parameterisation and spectral synthesis of rapidly rotating stars. Vega as a testbed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral synthesis is a powerful tool with which to find the fundamental parameters of stars. Models are usually restricted to single values of temperature and gravity, and assume spherical symmetry. This approximation breaks down for rapidly rotating stars.This paper presents a joint formalism to allow a computation of the stellar structure, namely, the photospheric radius, the effective temperature, and gravity, as a function of the colatitude for rapid rotators with radiative envelopes, and a subsequent method to build the corresponding synthetic spectrum.
  The structure of the star is computed using a semi-analytical approach, which is easy to implement from a computational point of view and which reproduces very accurately the results of much more complex codes. Once R, T, and g are computed, the suite of code atlas and synthe, by R. Kurucz are used to synthesise spectra for a mesh of cells in which the star is divided. The appropriate limb-darkening coefficients are also computed, and the final output spectrum is built for a given inclination of the rotation axis with respect to the line of sight. All the geometrical transformations required are described in detail.
  The combined formalism has been applied to Vega, a rapidly rotating star almost seen pole-on, as a testbed. The structure reproduces the results from interferometric studies and the synthetic spectrum matches the peculiar shape of the spectral lines well.
  Contexts where this formalism can be applied are outlined.</description>

      <title>Correlated mid-infrared and X-ray outbursts in black hole X-ray binaries: A new route to discovery in infrared surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mid-infrared (MIR; $\lambda\simeq3 - 10\mu$m) bands offer a unique window into understanding accretion and its interplay with jet formation in Galactic black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs). Although extremely difficult to observe from the ground, the NEOWISE time domain survey offers an excellent data set to study MIR variability when combined with contemporaneous X-ray data from the MAXI all-sky survey over a $\approx15$ yr baseline. Using a new forced photometry pipeline for NEOWISE data, we present the first systematic study of BHXRB MIR variability in outburst. Analyzing a sample of 16 sources detected in NEOWISE, we show variability trends in the X-ray hardness and MIR spectral index wherein i) the MIR bands are typically dominated by jet emission during the hard states, constraining the electron power spectrum index to $p \approx 1-4$ in the optically thin regime and indicating emitting regions of a few tens of gravitational radii when evolving towards a flat spectrum, ii) the MIR luminosity ($L_{IR}$) scales as $L_{IR}\propto L_X^{0.82\pm0.12}$ with the $2-10$ keV X-ray luminosity ($L_X$) in the hard state, consistent with its origin in a jet, and iii) the thermal disk emission dominates the soft state as the jet switches off and dramatically suppresses ($\gtrsim 10\times$) the MIR emission into a inverted spectrum ($\alpha\approx -1$, where $F_\nu\propto\nu^{-\alpha}$). We highlight a population of `mini' BHXRB outbursts detected in NEOWISE (including two previously unreported episodes in MAXI J1828-249) but missed in MAXI due to their faint fluxes or source confusion, exhibiting MIR spectral indices suggestive of thermal emission from a large outer disk. We highlight that upcoming IR surveys and the Rubin observatory will be powerful discovery engines for the distinctively large amplitude and long-lived outbursts of BHXRBs, as an independent discovery route to X-ray monitors.</description>

      <title>Linear adiabatic analysis for general relativistic instability in primordial accreting supermassive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accreting supermassive stars of $\gtrsim 10^{5}\,M_\odot$ will eventually collapse directly to a black hole via the general relativistic (GR) instability. Such direct collapses of supermassive stars are thought to be a possible formation channel for supermassive black holes at $z &gt; 6$. In this work, we investigate the final mass of accreting Population III stars with constant accretion rates between $0.01$ and $1000\,M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$. We determine the final mass by solving the differential equation for the general relativistic linear adiabatic radial pulsations. We find that models with accretion rates $\gtrsim 0.05\,M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ experience the GR instability at masses depending on the accretion rates. The critical masses are larger for higher accretion rates, ranging from $8\times10^{4}\,M_\odot$ for $0.05\,M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ to $\sim10^6\,M_\odot$ for $1000\,M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$. The $0.05\,M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ model reaches the GR instability at the end of the core hydrogen burning. The higher mass models with the higher accretion rates reach the GR instability during the hydrogen burning stage.</description>

      <title>White dwarf constraints on geological processes at the population level</title>

Abstract: White dwarf atmospheres are frequently polluted by material from their own planetary systems. Absorption features from Ca, Mg, Fe and other elements can provide unique insights into the provenance of this exoplanetary material, with their relative abundances being used to infer accretion of material with core- or mantle-like composition. Across the population of white dwarfs, the distribution of compositions reveals the prevalence of geological and collisional processing across exoplanetary systems. By predicting the distribution of compositions in three evolutionary scenarios, this work assesses whether they can explain current observations. We consider evolution in an asteroid belt analog, in which collisions between planetary bodies that formed an iron core lead to core- or mantle-rich fragments. We also consider layer-by-layer accretion of individual bodies, such that the apparent composition of atmospheric pollution changes during the accretion of a single body. Finally, we consider that compositional spread is due to random noise. We find that the distribution of Ca, Fe and Mg in a sample of 202 cool DZs is consistent with the random noise scenario, although 7 individual systems show strong evidence of core-mantle differentiation from additional elements and/or low noise levels. Future surveys which detect multiple elements in each of a few hundred white dwarfs, with well understood biases, have the potential to confidently distinguish between the three models.</description>

      <title>14 New Light Curves and an Updated Ephemeris for the Hot Jupiter HAT-P-54 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we present an analysis of 14 transit light curves of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-54 b. Thirteen of our datasets were obtained with the 6-inch MicroObservatory telescope, Cecilia, and one was measured with the 61-inch Kuiper Telescope. We used the EXOplanet Transit Interpretation Code (EXOTIC) to reduce 49 datasets in order to update the planet's ephemeris to a mid-transit time of 2460216.95257 +/- 0.00022 BJD_TBD and an updated orbital period of 3.79985363 +/- 0.00000037 days. These results improve the mid-transit uncertainty by 70.27% from the most recent ephemeris update. The updated mid-transit time can help to ensure the efficient use of expensive, large ground- and space-based telescope missions in the future. This result demonstrates that amateur astronomers and citizen scientists can provide meaningful, cost-efficient, crowd-sourcing observations using ground-based telescopes to further refine current mid-transit times and orbital periods.</description>

      <title>Carbon Isotope Fractionation of Complex Organic Molecules in Star-Forming Cores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent high-resolution and sensitivity ALMA observations have unveiled the carbon isotope ratios ($^{12}$C/$^{13}$C) of Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in a low-mass protostellar source. To understand the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs, we investigated the carbon isotope fractionation of COMs from prestellar cores to protostellar cores with a gas-grain chemical network model. We confirmed that the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of small molecules are bimodal in the prestellar phase: CO and species formed from CO (e.g., CH$_{3}$OH) are slightly enriched in $^{13}$C compared to the local ISM (by $\sim$ 10 $\%$), while those from C and C$^{+}$ are depleted in $^{13}$C owing to isotope exchange reactions. COMs are mainly formed on the grain surface and in the hot gas ($&gt;$ 100 K) in the protostellar phase. The $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs depend on which molecules the COMs are formed from. In our base model, some COMs in the hot gas are depleted in $^{13}$C compared to the observations. Thus, We additionally incorporate reactions between gaseous atomic C and H$_{2}$O ice or CO ice on the grain surface to form H$_2$CO ice or \ce{C2O} ice, as suggested by recent laboratory studies. The direct C-atom addition reactions open pathways to form \ce{^13C}-enriched COMs from atomic C and CO ice. We find that these direct C-atom addition reactions mitigate $^{13}$C-depletion of COMs, and the model with the direct C-atom addition reactions better reproduces the observations than our base model. We also discuss the impact of the cosmic ray ionization rate on the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of COMs.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Scattering Constraints from Observations of Stars Surrounding Sgr A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High resolution infrared data has revealed several young stars in close proximity to Sgr A*. These stars may encounter extremely high dark matter densities. We examine scenarios where dark matter scatters on stellar gas, accumulates in stellar cores, and then annihilates. We study the stars S2, S62, S4711 and S4714 and find three observable effects. First, dark matter interactions can inhibit in situ star-formation close to Sgr A*, favoring scenarios where these stars migrate into the Galactic Center. Second, dark matter interactions can delay main sequence evolution, making stars older than they appear. Third, very high dark matter densities can inject enough energy to disrupt main sequence stars, allowing S-star observations to constrain the dark matter density near Sgr A*.</description>

      <title>SN 2024ggi in NGC 3621: Rising Ionization in a Nearby, CSM-Interacting Type II Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present UV/optical/NIR observations and modeling of supernova (SN) 2024ggi, a type II supernova (SN II) located in NGC 3621 at 7.2 Mpc. Early-time ("flash") spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi within +0.8 days of discovery shows emission lines of H I, He I, C III, and N III with a narrow core and broad, symmetric wings (i.e., IIn-like) arising from the photoionized, optically-thick, unshocked circumstellar material (CSM) that surrounded the progenitor star at shock breakout. By the next spectral epoch at +1.5 days, SN 2024ggi showed a rise in ionization as emission lines of He II, C IV, N IV/V and O V became visible. This phenomenon is temporally consistent with a blueward shift in the UV/optical colors, both likely the result of shock breakout in an extended, dense CSM. The IIn-like features in SN 2024ggi persist on a timescale of $t_{\rm IIn} = 3.8 \pm 1.6$ days at which time a reduction in CSM density allows the detection of Doppler broadened features from the fastest SN material. SN 2024ggi has peak UV/optical absolute magnitudes of $M_{\rm w2} = -18.7$ mag and $M_{\rm g} = -18.1$ mag that are consistent with the known population of CSM-interacting SNe II. Comparison of SN 2024ggi with a grid of radiation hydrodynamics and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (nLTE) radiative-transfer simulations suggests a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} = 10^{-2}$M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($v_w$ = 50 km/s), confined to a distance of $r &lt; 5\times 10^{14}$ cm. Assuming a wind velocity of $v_w$ = 50 km/s, the progenitor star underwent an enhanced mass-loss episode in the last ~3 years before explosion.</description>

      <title>Diagnostics of magnetohydrodynamic modes in the ISM through synchrotron polarization statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the biggest challenges in understanding Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is identifying the plasma mode components from observational data. Previous studies on synchrotron polarization from the interstellar medium (ISM) suggest that the dominant MHD modes can be identified via statistics of Stokes parameters, which would be crucial for studying various ISM processes such as the scattering and acceleration of cosmic rays, star formation, dynamo. In this paper, we present a numerical study of the Synchrotron Polarization Analysis (SPA) method through systematic investigation of the statistical properties of the Stokes parameters. We derive the theoretical basis for our method from the fundamental statistics of MHD turbulence, recognizing that the projection of the MHD modes allows us to identify the modes dominating the energy fraction from synchrotron observations. Based on the discovery, we revise the SPA method using synthetic synchrotron polarization observations obtained from 3D ideal MHD simulations with a wide range of plasma parameters and driving mechanisms, and present a modified recipe for mode identification. We propose a classification criterion based on a new SPA+ fitting procedure, which allows us to distinguish between Alfv\'en mode and compressible/slow mode dominated turbulence. We further propose a new method to identify fast modes by analyzing the asymmetry of the SPA+ signature and establish a new asymmetry parameter to detect the presence of fast mode turbulence. Additionally, we confirm through numerical tests that the identification of the compressible and fast modes is not affected by Faraday rotation in both the emitting plasma and the foreground.</description>
