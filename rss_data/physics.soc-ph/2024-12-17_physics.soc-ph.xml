      <title>Centrality and Universality in Scale-Free Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel paradigm for modeling real-world scale-free networks, where the integration of new nodes is driven by the combined attractiveness of degree and betweenness centralities, the competition of which (expressed by a parameter $0\le p\le 1$) shapes the structure of the evolving network. We reveal the ability to seamlessly explore a vast landscape of scale-free networks, unlocking an entirely new class of complex networks that we call \textit{stars-with-filament} structure. Remarkably, the average degree $\bar k$ of these networks grows like $\log t$ to some power, where $t$ is time and the average shortest path length grows logarithmically with the system size for intermediate $p$ values, offering fresh insights into the structural dynamics of scale-free systems. Our approach is backed by a robust mean-field theory, which nicely captures the dynamics of $\bar{k}$. We further unveil a rich, $p$-dependent phase diagram, encompassing 47 real-world scale-free networks, shedding light on previously hidden patterns. This work opens exciting new avenues for understanding the universal properties of complex networks.</description>

      <title>Energetic closure of the spatially resolved global food system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global food system provides the energy that supports human metabolism, with complex spatial interdependencies between food production, transformation, and consumption. Empirical food system data for these global processes are often fragmented and inconsistent, with only certain components captured in spatially resolved formats. Here we propose a flexible approach to allocating country-level food system data subnationally. We estimate the spatial patterns of food energy production and supply, which we compare to estimates of human metabolism based on average body size. We downscale these rates onto a one-degree resolution grid with 95 corresponding food types to derive an internally consistent, energy-conserving, and spatially resolved dataset. We show that national food supply varies linearly with metabolism per capita, with about half the variation in food supply explained by metabolic rates. Our data processing pipeline is openly available and can readily incorporate new inputs in order to advance trans-disciplinary food system modeling efforts.</description>

      <title>Observing Micromotives and Macrobehavior of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thomas C. Schelling, awarded the 2005 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, pointed out that ``individuals decisions (micromotives), while often personal and localized, can lead to societal outcomes (macrobehavior) that are far more complex and different from what the individuals intended.'' The current research related to large language models' (LLMs') micromotives, such as preferences or biases, assumes that users will make more appropriate decisions once LLMs are devoid of preferences or biases. Consequently, a series of studies has focused on removing bias from LLMs. In the NLP community, while there are many discussions on LLMs' micromotives, previous studies have seldom conducted a systematic examination of how LLMs may influence society's macrobehavior. In this paper, we follow the design of Schelling's model of segregation to observe the relationship between the micromotives and macrobehavior of LLMs. Our results indicate that, regardless of the level of bias in LLMs, a highly segregated society will emerge as more people follow LLMs' suggestions. We hope our discussion will spark further consideration of the fundamental assumption regarding the mitigation of LLMs' micromotives and encourage a reevaluation of how LLMs may influence users and society.</description>

      <title>Regional Air Mobility Flight Demand Modeling in Tennessee State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), encompassing Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and Regional Air Mobility (RAM), offers innovative solutions to mitigate the issues related to ground transportation like traffic congestion, environmental pollution etc. RAM addresses transportation inefficiencies over medium-distance trips (50-500 miles), which are often underserved by both traditional air and ground transportation systems. This study focuses on RAM in Tennessee, addressing the complexities of demand modeling as a critical aspect of effective RAM implementation. Leveraging datasets from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and other sources, we assess trip data across Tennessee's Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) to develop a predictive framework for RAM demand. Through cost, time, and risk regression, we calculate a Generalized Travel Cost (GTC) that allows for comparative analysis between ground transportation and RAM, identifying factors that influence mode choice. When focusing on only five major airports (BNA, CHA, MEM, TRI, and TYS) as RAM hubs, the results reveal a mixed demand pattern due to varying travel distances to these central locations, which increases back-and-forth travel for some routes. However, by expanding the RAM network to include more regional airports, the GTC for RAM aligns more closely with traditional air travel, providing a smoother and more competitive option against ground transportation, particularly for trips exceeding 300 miles. The analysis shows that RAM demand is likely to be selected when air transportation accounts for more than 80\% of the total GTC, air travel time is more than 1 hour and when the ground GTC exceeds 300 for specific origin-destination pairs. The data and code can be accessed on GitHub. {https://github.com/lotussavy/AIAAScitecth-2025.git}</description>

      <title>Supervised cooperation on interdependent public goods games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a challenging task to reach global cooperation among self-interested agents, which often requires sophisticated design or usage of incentives. For example, we may apply supervisors or referees who are able to detect and punish selfishness. As a response, defectors may offer bribes for corrupt referees to remain hidden, hence generating a new conflict among supervisors. By using the interdependent network approach, we model the key element of the coevolution between strategy and judgment. In a game layer, agents play public goods game by using one of the two major strategies of a social dilemma. In a monitoring layer, supervisors follow the strategy change and may alter the income of competitors. Fair referees punish defectors while corrupt referees remain silent for a bribe. Importantly, there is a learning process not only among players but also among referees. Our results suggest that large fines and bribes boost the emergence of cooperation by significantly reducing the phase transition threshold between the pure defection state and the mixed solution where competing strategies coexist. Interestingly, the presence of bribes could be as harmful for defectors as the usage of harsh fines. The explanation of this system behavior is based on a strong correlation between cooperators and fair referees, which is cemented via overlapping clusters in both layers.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Robustness and Resilience of U.S. Strategic Highways: A Network Science Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network science is a powerful tool for analyzing transportation networks, offering insights into their structures and enabling the quantification of resilience and robustness. Understanding the underlying structures of transportation networks is crucial for effective infrastructure planning and maintenance. In military contexts, network science is valuable for analyzing logistics networks, critical for the movement and supply of troops and equipment. The U.S. Army's logistical success, particularly in the "fort-to-port" phase, relies heavily on the Strategic Highway Network (STRAHNET) in the U.S., which is a system of public highways crucial for military deployments. However, the shared nature of these networks with civilian users introduces unique challenges, including vulnerabilities to cyberattacks and physical sabotage, which is highlighted by the concept of contested logistics. This paper proposes a method using network science and geographic information systems (GIS) to assess the robustness and resilience of transportation networks, specifically applied to military logistics. Our findings indicate that while the STRAHNET is robust against targeted disruptions, it is more resilient to random disruptions.</description>

      <title>Interplay of epidemic spreading and vaccine uptake under complex social contagion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling human behavior is essential to accurately predict epidemic spread, with behaviors like vaccine hesitancy complicating control efforts. While epidemic spread is often treated as a simple contagion, vaccine uptake may follow complex contagion dynamics, where individuals' decisions depend on multiple social contacts. Recently, the concept of complex contagion has received strong theoretical underpinnings thanks to the generalization of spreading phenomena from pairwise to higher-order interactions. Although several potential applications have been suggested, examples of complex contagions motivated by real data remain scarce. Surveys on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the US suggest that vaccination attitudes may indeed depend on the vaccination status of social peers, aligning with complex contagion principles. In this work, we examine the interactions between epidemic spread, vaccination, and vaccine uptake attitudes under complex contagion. Using the SIR model with a dynamic, threshold-based vaccination campaign, we simulate scenarios on an age-structured multilayer network informed by US contact data. Our results offer insights into the role of social dynamics in shaping vaccination behavior and epidemic outcomes.</description>

      <title>Prediction of social dilemmas in networked populations via graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human behavior presents significant challenges for data-driven approaches and machine learning, particularly in modeling the emergent and complex dynamics observed in social dilemmas. These challenges complicate the accurate prediction of strategic decision-making in structured populations, which is crucial for advancing our understanding of collective behavior. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to predicting high-dimensional collective behavior in structured populations engaged in social dilemmas. We propose a new feature extraction methodology, Topological Marginal Information Feature Extraction (TMIFE), which captures agent-level information over time. Leveraging TMIFE, we employ a graph neural network to encode networked dynamics and predict evolutionary outcomes under various social dilemma scenarios. Our approach is validated through numerical simulations and transfer learning, demonstrating its robustness and predictive accuracy. Furthermore, results from a Prisoner's Dilemma experiment involving human participants confirm that our method reliably predicts the macroscopic fraction of cooperation. These findings underscore the complexity of predicting high-dimensional behavior in structured populations and highlight the potential of graph-based machine learning techniques for this task.</description>

      <title>Hiring Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the hiring problem where a sequence of applicants is sequentially interviewed, and a decision on whether to hire an applicant is immediately made based on the applicant's score. For the maximal and average improvement strategies, the decision depends on the applicant's score and the scores of all employees, i.e., previous successful applicants. For local improvement strategies, an interviewing committee randomly chosen for each applicant makes the decision depending on the score of the applicant and the scores of the members of the committee. These idealized hiring strategies capture the challenges of decision-making under uncertainty. We probe the average score of the best employee, the probability of hiring all first $N$ applicants, the fraction of superior companies in which, throughout the evolution, every hired applicant has a score above expected, etc.</description>

      <title>Q-DISCO: Query-Centric Densest Subgraphs in Networks with Opinion Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a network $G=(V,E)$, where each node $v$ is associated with a vector $\boldsymbol{p}_v \in \mathbb{R}^d$ representing its opinion about $d$ different topics, how can we uncover subsets of nodes that not only exhibit exceptionally high density but also possess positively aligned opinions on multiple topics? In this paper we focus on this novel algorithmic question, that is essential in an era where digital social networks are hotbeds of opinion formation and dissemination. We introduce a novel methodology anchored in the well-established densest subgraph problem. We analyze the computational complexity of our formulation, indicating that our problem is NP-hard and eludes practically acceptable approximation guarantees. To navigate these challenges, we design two heuristic algorithms: the first is predicated on the Lagrangian relaxation of our formulation, while the second adopts a peeling algorithm based on the dual of a Linear Programming relaxation. We elucidate the theoretical underpinnings of their performance and validate their utility through empirical evaluation on real-world datasets. Among others, we delve into Twitter datasets we collected concerning timely issues, such as the Ukraine conflict and the discourse surrounding COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, to gauge the effectiveness of our methodology. Our empirical investigations verify that our algorithms are able to extract valuable insights from networks with opinion information.</description>

      <title>Multiplexing in Networks and Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social and economic networks are often multiplexed, meaning that people are connected by different types of relationships -- such as borrowing goods and giving advice. We make three contributions to the study of multiplexing. First, we document empirical multiplexing patterns in Indian village data: relationships such as socializing, advising, helping, and lending are correlated but distinct, while commonly used proxies for networks based on ethnicity and geography are nearly uncorrelated with actual relationships. Second, we examine how these layers and their overlap affect information diffusion in a field experiment. The advice network is the best predictor of diffusion, but combining layers improves predictions further. Villages with greater overlap between layers (more multiplexing) experience less overall diffusion. This leads to our third contribution: developing a model and theoretical results about diffusion in multiplex networks. Multiplexing slows the spread of simple contagions, such as diseases or basic information, but can either impede or enhance the spread of complex contagions, such as new technologies, depending on their virality. Finally, we identify differences in multiplexing by gender and connectedness. These have implications for inequality in diffusion-mediated outcomes such as access to information and adherence to norms.</description>

      <title>Diversity is Key: Fantasy football dream teams under budget constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a fixed budget for player salaries, what is the distribution of salaries of the top scoring teams? We investigated this question using the wealth of data available from fantasy premier league football (soccer). Using the players' data from past seasons, for several seasons and several different budget constraints, we identified the highest scoring fantasy team for each season subject to each budget constraint. We then investigated quantifiable characteristics of these teams. Interestingly, across nearly every variable that is significant to the game of football and the budget, these top teams display diversity across these variables. Furthermore, randomly assembled teams would statistically \em not \em display such diversity across these variables. Our results indicate that diversity across these variables, including salaries, is a general feature of top performing teams. Moreover, in the process of obtaining these results we developed a data cleaning (or data reduction) algorithm that drastically reduced the amount of data to be analyzed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global chaos caused by the 19 July 2024 technology meltdown highlights the need for a theory of what large-scale cohesive behaviors -- dangerous or desirable -- could suddenly emerge from future systems of interacting humans, machinery and software including AI; when will they emerge; and how will they evolve and be controlled. Here we offer answers by introducing an aggregation model that accounts for the interacting entities' inter- and intra-species diversities. It yields a novel multi-dimensional generalization of existing aggregation physics. We derive exact analytic solutions for the time-to-cohesion and growth-of-cohesion for two species, and some generalizations for an arbitrary number of species. These solutions reproduce -- and offer a microscopic explanation for -- an anomalous nonlinear growth feature observed in various current real-world systems. Our theory suggests good and bad 'surprises' will appear sooner and more strongly as humans-machinery-AI etc. interact more -- but it also offers a rigorous approach for understanding and controlling this.</description>

      <title>How much longer do you have to drive than the crow has to fly?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When traveling by car from one location to another, our route is constrained by the road network. The network distance between the two locations is generally longer than the geodetic distance as the crow flies. We report a systematic relation between the statistical properties of these two distances. Empirically, we find a robust scaling between network and geodetic distance distributions for a variety of large motorway networks. A simple consequence is that we typically have to drive $1.3\pm0.1$ times longer than the crow flies. This scaling is not present in standard random networks; rather, it requires non-random adjacency. We develop a set of rules to build a realistic motorway network, also consistent with the above scaling. We hypothesize that the scaling reflects a compromise between two societal needs: high efficiency and accessibility on the one hand, and limitation of costs and other burdens on the other.</description>

Abstract: Natural fluctuations have played a crucial role in affecting the dynamics of pervasive diseases such as the coronavirus. Examining the effects of irregular unsettling disturbances on epidemic models is important for understanding these dynamics. In this study, we introduce a mathematical model for the SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) dynamics of the coronavirus, incorporating perturbations in the contact rate through Levy noise. The utilization of the Levy process is essential for the protection and control of diseases. We delve into the dynamics of both the deterministic model and the global positive solution of the stochastic model, establishing their existence and uniqueness. Additionally, we explore conditions for the termination and persistence of the infection. Furthermore, we derive the basic reproduction number, a critical determinant of disease extinction or persistence. Numerical results indicate that COVID-19 dissipates from the population when the reproduction number is less than one in the presence of significant or minor noise. Conversely, controlling epidemic diseases becomes challenging when the reproduction number exceeds one. To illustrate this phenomenon, we provide numerical simulations, offering insights into the dynamics of the disease and the efficacy of control measures</description>

      <title>Integration vs segregation: network analysis of interdisciplinarity in funded and unfunded research on infectious diseases</title>

Abstract: Interdisciplinary research fuels innovation. In this paper, we examine the interdisciplinarity of research output driven by funding. Considering 36 major infectious diseases, we model interdisciplinarity through temporal correlation networks based on funded and unfunded research from 1995-2022. Using hierarchical clustering, we identify coherent periods of time or regimes characterised by important research topics like vaccinations or the Zika outbreak. We establish that funded research is less interdisciplinary than unfunded research, but the effect has decreased markedly over time. In terms of network growth, we find a tendency of funded research to focus on readily established connections leading to compartmentalisation and conservatism. In contrast, unfunded research tends to be exploratory and bridge distant knowledge leading to knowledge integration. Our results show that interdisciplinary research on prominent infectious diseases like HIV and tuberculosis tends to have strong bridging effects facilitating global knowledge integration in the network. At the periphery of the network, we observe the emergence of vaccination-related and Zika-related knowledge clusters, both with limited systemic impact. We further show that despite the surge in publications related to COVID-19, its systematic impact on the disease network remains relatively low. Overall, this research provides a generalisable framework to examine the impact of funding in interdisciplinary knowledge creation. It can assist in priority setting, for example with horizon scanning for new and emerging threats to health, such as pandemic planning. Policymakers, funding agencies, and research institutions should consider revamping evaluation systems to reward interdisciplinary work and implement mechanisms that promote and support intelligent risk-taking.</description>
