      <title>Math{\'e}matiques et M{\'e}canique {\`a} Strasbourg entre 1871 et 1939</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The University of Strasbourg, fundamentally humanistic since its creation, has a complicated history, being sometimes German, sometimes French through the ages. If one focus, from 1871, on the area of mathematics, we can identify two periods. Political goals led to send high-level scientists, sometimes rather young, to develop theoretical, later applied mathematics, leading to a novel area, mechanics. The first period, under Prussian influence until 1918, will see the emergence of an Institute of mathematics such it was existing in G{\"o}ttingen; the second, dominated by the French influence, will make Strasbourg an anteroom to positions at the prestigious Faculty of Sciences in Paris, the Sorbonne, the Academy of Sciences or the ENS. Present communication will give an inside, through its history, of the development of Mathematics in Strasbourg, prelude to emerging Mechanics and the creation of what will become the Institut de M{\'e}canique des Fluides et des Solides en 2000.</description>

      <title>On Physical Mathematics: an approach through Gilles Ch\^atelet's philosophy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from Greg Moore's description about Physical Mathematics, a framework is proposed in order to understand it, based on Gilles Ch\^atelet's philosophy. It will be argued that Ch\^atelet's ideas of inverting, splitting, augmenting and virtuality are crucial in the discussion about the nature of Physical Mathematics. Along this line, it will be proposed that mirror symmetry is a natural study case to test Ch\^atelet's ideas in this context. This should be considered as a first step in a long term project aiming to study the relations among mathematics, physics and philosophy in the construction of a global understanding of the structure of the universe, as it was envisioned by Grothendieck in the late 80's of the last century and it was started to be developed independently by Ch\^atelet in the beginning of the 90's. The main suggestion of the essay is that it is in the relations between mathematics, physics and philosophy that new knowledge arises.</description>

      <title>Agency cannot be a purely quantum phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What are the physical requirements for agency? We investigate whether a purely quantum system (one evolving unitarily in a coherent regime without decoherence or collapse) can satisfy three minimal conditions for agency: an agent must be able to create a world-model, use it to evaluate the likely consequences of alternative actions, and reliably perform the action that maximizes expected utility. We show that the first two conditions conflict with the no-cloning theorem, which forbids copying unknown quantum states: world-model construction requires copying information from the environment, and deliberation requires copying the world-model to assess multiple actions. Approximate cloning strategies do not permit sufficient fidelity or generality for agency to be viable in purely quantum systems. The third agency condition also fails due to the linearity of quantum dynamics. These results imply four key consequences. First, agency requires significant classical resources, placing clear constraints on its physical basis. Second, they provide insight into how classical agents emerge within a quantum universe. Third, they show that quantum computers cannot straightforwardly simulate agential behavior without significant classical components. Finally, they challenge quantum theories of agency, free will, and consciousness.</description>

      <title>The counterfactual account of L\"uders' rule is sufficient to rule out ontological models of quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ontological models, as used in the generalised contextuality literature, play a central role in current research on quantum foundations, providing a framework for defining classicality, constructing classical analogues of key quantum phenomena, and examining the ontology of quantum states. In this work, we show that a counterfactual account of L\"uders' rule -- which we argue is naturally implied by the mathematical structure of the rule itself -- renders such models inherently incompatible with the quantum formalism. This incompatibility arises because the counterfactual update requires ontological models to update their states according to conditional probability, which in turn which in turn renders predictions of sequential measurements order-independent. This implies that ontological models, even contextual ones, must either act differently to what we would expect given (this, typically implicitly-assumed account of) quantum state update rule, or cannot model quantum behaviour.</description>
