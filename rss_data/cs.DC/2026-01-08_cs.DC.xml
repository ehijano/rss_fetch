      <title>Revisiting Speculative Leaderless Protocols for Low-Latency BFT Replication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols begin to be used in permissioned blockchains for user-facing applications such as payments, it is crucial that they provide low latency. In pursuit of low latency, some recently proposed BFT consensus protocols employ a leaderless optimistic fast path, in which clients broadcast their requests directly to replicas without first serializing requests at a leader, resulting in an end-to-end commit latency of 2 message delays ($2\Delta$) during fault-free, synchronous periods. However, such a fast path only works if there is no contention: concurrent contending requests can cause replicas to diverge if they receive conflicting requests in different orders, triggering costly recovery procedures.
  In this work, we present Aspen, a leaderless BFT protocol that achieves a near-optimal latency of $2\Delta + \varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ indicates a short waiting delay. Aspen removes the no-contention condition by utilizing a best-effort sequencing layer based on loosely synchronized clocks and network delay estimates. Aspen requires $n = 3f + 2p + 1$ replicas to cope with up to $f$ Byzantine nodes. The $2p$ extra nodes allow Aspen's fast path to proceed even if up to $p$ replicas diverge due to unpredictable network delays. When its optimistic conditions do not hold, Aspen falls back to PBFT-style protocol, guaranteeing safety and liveness under partial synchrony. In experiments with wide-area distributed replicas, Aspen commits requests in less than 75 ms, a 1.2 to 3.3$\times$ improvement compared to previous protocols, while supporting 19,000 requests per second.</description>

      <title>Majorum: Ebb-and-Flow Consensus with Dynamic Quorums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic availability is the ability of a consensus protocol to remain live despite honest participants going offline and later rejoining. A well-known limitation is that dynamically available protocols, on their own, cannot provide strong safety guarantees during network partitions or extended asynchrony. Ebb-and-flow protocols [SP21] address this by combining a dynamically available protocol with a partially synchronous finality protocol that irrevocably finalizes a prefix.
  We present Majorum, an ebb-and-flow construction whose dynamically available component builds on a quorum-based protocol (TOB-SVD). Under optimistic conditions, Majorum finalizes blocks in as few as three slots while requiring only a single voting phase per slot. In particular, when conditions remain favourable, each slot finalizes the next block extending the previously finalized one.</description>

      <title>A Scheduling Framework for Efficient MoE Inference on Edge GPU-NDP Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models facilitate edge deployment by decoupling model capacity from active computation, yet their large memory footprint drives the need for GPU systems with near-data processing (NDP) capabilities that offload experts to dedicated processing units. However, deploying MoE models on such edge-based GPU-NDP systems faces three critical challenges: 1) severe load imbalance across NDP units due to non-uniform expert selection and expert parallelism, 2) insufficient GPU utilization during expert computation within NDP units, and 3) extensive data pre-profiling necessitated by unpredictable expert activation patterns for pre-fetching. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient inference framework featuring three key optimizations. First, the underexplored tensor parallelism in MoE inference is exploited to partition and compute large expert parameters across multiple NDP units simultaneously towards edge low-batch scenarios. Second, a load-balancing-aware scheduling algorithm distributes expert computations across NDP units and GPU to maximize resource utilization. Third, a dataset-free pre-fetching strategy proactively loads frequently accessed experts to minimize activation delays. Experimental results show that our framework enables GPU-NDP systems to achieve 2.41x on average and up to 2.56x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to state-of-the-art approaches, significantly enhancing MoE inference efficiency in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Hummingbird: SLO-Oriented GPU Preemption at Microsecond-scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing GPU-sharing techniques, including spatial and temporal sharing, aim to improve utilization but face challenges in simultaneously ensuring SLO adherence and maximizing efficiency due to the lack of fine-grained task scheduling on closed-source GPUs. This paper presents Hummingbird, an SLO-oriented GPU scheduling system that overcomes these challenges by enabling microsecond-scale preemption on closed-source GPUs while effectively harvesting idle GPU time slices. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse GPU architectures reveal that Hummingbird improves the SLO attainment of high-priority tasks by 9.7x and 3.5x compared to the state-of-the-art spatial and temporal-sharing approaches. When compared to executing exclusively, the SLO attainment of the high-priority task, collocating with low-priority tasks on Hummingbird, only drops by less than 1%. Meanwhile, the throughput of the low-priority task outperforms the state-of-the-art temporal-sharing approaches by 2.4x. Hummingbird demonstrates significant effectiveness in ensuring the SLO while enhancing GPU utilization.</description>

      <title>Failure-Resilient and Carbon-Efficient Deployment of Microservices over the Cloud-Edge Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying microservice-based applications (MSAs) on heterogeneous and dynamic Cloud-Edge infrastructures requires balancing conflicting objectives, such as failure resilience, performance, and environmental sustainability. In this article, we introduce the FREEDA toolchain, designed to automate the failure-resilient and carbon-efficient deployment of MSAs over the Cloud-Edge Continuum.
  The FREEDA toolchain continuously adapts deployment configurations to changing operational conditions, resource availability, and sustainability constraints, aiming to maintain the MSA quality and service continuity while reducing carbon emissions. We also introduce an experimental suite using diverse simulated and emulated scenarios to validate the effectiveness of the toolchain against real-world challenges, including resource exhaustion, node failures, and carbon intensity fluctuations. The results demonstrate FREEDA's capability to autonomously reconfigure deployments by migrating services, adjusting flavour selections, or rebalancing workloads, successfully achieving an optimal balance among resilience, efficiency, and environmental impact.</description>

      <title>Local Gradient Regulation Stabilizes Federated Learning under Client Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, yet its stability is fundamentally challenged by statistical heterogeneity in realistic deployments. Here, we show that client heterogeneity destabilizes FL primarily by distorting local gradient dynamics during client-side optimization, causing systematic drift that accumulates across communication rounds and impedes global convergence. This observation highlights local gradients as a key regulatory lever for stabilizing heterogeneous FL systems. Building on this insight, we develop a general client-side perspective that regulates local gradient contributions without incurring additional communication overhead. Inspired by swarm intelligence, we instantiate this perspective through Exploratory--Convergent Gradient Re-aggregation (ECGR), which balances well-aligned and misaligned gradient components to preserve informative updates while suppressing destabilizing effects. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, including evaluations on the LC25000 medical imaging dataset, demonstrate that regulating local gradient dynamics consistently stabilizes federated learning across state-of-the-art methods under heterogeneous data distributions.</description>

      <title>MorphServe: Efficient and Workload-Aware LLM Serving via Runtime Quantized Layer Swapping and KV Cache Resizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently serving large language models (LLMs) under dynamic and bursty workloads remains a key challenge for real-world deployment. Existing serving frameworks and static model compression techniques fail to adapt to workload fluctuations, leading to either service-level objective (SLO) violations under full-precision serving or persistent accuracy degradation with static quantization. We present MorphServe, a dynamic, workload-aware LLM serving framework based on morphological adaptation. MorphServe introduces two asynchronous, token-level runtime mechanisms: quantized layer swapping, which selectively replaces less impactful layers with quantized alternatives during high-load periods, and pressure-aware KV cache resizing, which dynamically adjusts KV cache capacity in response to memory pressure. These mechanisms enable state-preserving transitions with minimum runtime overhead and are fully compatible with modern scheduling and attention techniques. Extensive experiments on Vicuna and Llama family models with real-world workloads demonstrate that MorphServe reduces average SLO violations by 92.45 percent and improves the P95 TTFT latency by 2.2x-3.9x compared to full-precision serving, without compromising generation quality. These results establish MorphServe as a practical and elastic solution for LLM deployment in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>On the Operational Resilience of CBDC: Threats and Prospects of Formal Validation for Offline Payments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information and communication technologies are by now employed in most activities, including economics and finance. Despite the extraordinary power of modern computers in terms of information processing, storage, retrieval, and transmission, several results of theoretical computer science imply the impossibility of certifying software quality in general. With the exception of safety-critical systems, this has primarily concerned the information processed by confined systems, with limited socio-economic consequences. In the emerging era of technologies for exchanging digital money and tokenized assets over the Internet, such as in particular central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), even a minor bug could trigger a financial collapse. Although the aforementioned impossibility results cannot be overcome in an absolute sense, there exist formal methods that can provide correctness assertions for computing systems. We advocate their use to validate the operational resilience of software infrastructures enabling CBDCs, with special emphasis on offline payments as they constitute a very critical issue.</description>

      <title>Venus: An Efficient Edge Memory-and-Retrieval System for VLM-based Online Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal comprehension capabilities and are being deployed in an increasing number of online video understanding applications. While recent efforts extensively explore advancing VLMs' reasoning power in these cases, deployment constraints are overlooked, leading to overwhelming system overhead in real-world deployments. To address that, we propose Venus, an on-device memory-and-retrieval system for efficient online video understanding. Venus proposes an edge-cloud disaggregated architecture that sinks memory construction and keyframe retrieval from cloud to edge, operating in two stages. In the ingestion stage, Venus continuously processes streaming edge videos via scene segmentation and clustering, where the selected keyframes are embedded with a multimodal embedding model to build a hierarchical memory for efficient storage and retrieval. In the querying stage, Venus indexes incoming queries from memory, and employs a threshold-based progressive sampling algorithm for keyframe selection that enhances diversity and adaptively balances system cost and reasoning accuracy. Our extensive evaluation shows that Venus achieves a 15x-131x speedup in total response latency compared to state-of-the-art methods, enabling real-time responses within seconds while maintaining comparable or even superior reasoning accuracy.</description>

      <title>FedDUAL: A Dual-Strategy with Adaptive Loss and Dynamic Aggregation for Mitigating Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) marks a transformative approach to distributed model training by combining locally optimized models from various clients into a unified global model. While FL preserves data privacy by eliminating centralized storage, it encounters significant challenges such as performance degradation, slower convergence, and reduced robustness of the global model due to the heterogeneity in client data distributions. Among the various forms of data heterogeneity, label skew emerges as a particularly formidable and prevalent issue, especially in domains such as image classification. To address these challenges, we begin with comprehensive experiments to pinpoint the underlying issues in the FL training process. Based on our findings, we then introduce an innovative dual-strategy approach designed to effectively resolve these issues. First, we introduce an adaptive loss function for client-side training, meticulously crafted to preserve previously acquired knowledge while maintaining an optimal equilibrium between local optimization and global model coherence. Secondly, we develop a dynamic aggregation strategy for aggregating client models at the server. This approach adapts to each client's unique learning patterns, effectively addressing the challenges of diverse data across the network. Our comprehensive evaluation, conducted across three diverse real-world datasets, coupled with theoretical convergence guarantees, demonstrates the superior efficacy of our method compared to several established state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Supercomputing for High-speed Avoidance and Reactive Planning in Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19486v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents SHARP (Supercomputing for High-speed Avoidance and Reactive Planning), a proof-of-concept study demonstrating how high-performance computing (HPC) can enable millisecond-scale responsiveness in robotic control. While modern robots face increasing demands for reactivity in human-robot shared workspaces, onboard processors are constrained by size, power, and cost. Offloading to HPC offers massive parallelism for trajectory planning, but its feasibility for real-time robotics remains uncertain due to network latency and jitter. We evaluate SHARP in a stress-test scenario where a 7-DOF manipulator must dodge high-speed foam projectiles. Using a hash-distributed multi-goal A* search implemented with MPI on both local and remote HPC clusters, the system achieves mean planning latencies of 22.9 ms (local) and 30.0 ms (remote, ~300 km away), with avoidance success rates of 84% and 88%, respectively. These results show that when round-trip latency remains within the tens-of-milliseconds regime, HPC-side computation is no longer the bottleneck, enabling avoidance well below human reaction times. The SHARP results motivate hybrid control architectures: low-level reflexes remain onboard for safety, while bursty, high-throughput planning tasks are offloaded to HPC for scalability. By reporting per-stage timing and success rates, this study provides a reproducible template for assessing real-time feasibility of HPC-driven robotics. Collectively, SHARP reframes HPC offloading as a viable pathway toward dependable, reactive robots in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>QoS-Aware Load Balancing in the Computing Continuum via Multi-Player Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As computation shifts from the cloud to the edge to reduce processing latency and network traffic, the resulting Computing Continuum (CC) creates a dynamic environment where meeting strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements and avoiding service instance overload becomes challenging. Existing methods often prioritize global metrics and overlook per-client QoS, which is crucial for latency-sensitive and reliability-critical applications. We propose QEdgeProxy, a decentralized QoS-aware load balancer that acts as a proxy between IoT devices and service instances in the CC. We formulate the load balancing problem as a Multi-Player Multi-Armed Bandit (MP-MAB) with heterogeneous rewards: Each load balancer autonomously selects service instances to maximize the probability of meeting its clients' QoS requirements by using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to estimate QoS success probabilities. Our load-balancing algorithm also incorporates an adaptive exploration mechanism to recover rapidly from performance shifts and non-stationary conditions. We present a Kubernetes-native QEdgeProxy implementation and evaluate it on an emulated CC testbed deployed on a K3s cluster with realistic network conditions and a latency-sensitive edge-AI workload. Results show that QEdgeProxy significantly outperforms proximity-based and reinforcement-learning baselines in per-client QoS satisfaction, while adapting effectively to load surges and changes in instance availability.</description>
