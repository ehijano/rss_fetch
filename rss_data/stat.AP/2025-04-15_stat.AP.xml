      <title>Predicting Power Grid Failures Using Self-Organized Criticality: A Case Study of the Texas Grid 2014-2022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops a novel predictive framework for power grid vulnerability based on the statistical signatures of Self-Organized Criticality (SOC). By analyzing the evolution of the power law critical exponents in outage size distributions from the Texas grid during 2014-2022, we demonstrate the method's ability for forecasting system-wide vulnerability to catastrophic failures. Our results reveal a systematic decline in the critical exponent from 1.45 in 2018 to 0.95 in 2020, followed by a drop below the theoretical critical threshold ($\alpha$ = 1) to 0.62 in 2021, coinciding precisely with the catastrophic February 2021 power crisis. Such predictive signal emerged 6-12 months before the crisis. By monitoring critical exponent transitions through subcritical and supercritical regimes, we provide quantitative early warning capabilities for catastrophic infrastructure failures, with significant implications for grid resilience planning, risk assessment, and emergency preparedness in increasingly stressed power systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling zero-inflated precipitation extremes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of daily rainfall, encompassing both dry and wet days as well as extreme precipitation events, is critical for robust hydrological and climatological analyses. This study proposes a zero-inflated extended generalized Pareto distribution model that unifies the modeling of dry days, low, moderate, and extreme rainfall within a single framework. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on prespecified threshold selection to identify extremes, our proposed model captures tail behavior intrinsically through a tail index that aligns with the generalized Pareto distribution. The model also accommodates covariate effects via generalized additive modeling, allowing for the representation of complex climatic variability. The current implementation is limited to a univariate setting, modeling daily rainfall independently of covariates. Model estimation is carried out using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches. Simulation studies and empirical applications demonstrate the model flexibility in capturing zero inflation and heavy-tailed behavior characteristics of daily rainfall distributions.</description>

      <title>Two-Part Forecasting for Time-Shifted Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Katz, Savage, and Brusch propose a two-part forecasting method for sectors where event timing differs from recording time. They treat forecasting as a time-shift operation, using univariate time series for total bookings and a Bayesian Dirichlet Auto-Regressive Moving Average (B-DARMA) model to allocate bookings across trip dates based on lead time. Analysis of Airbnb data shows that this approach is interpretable, flexible, and potentially more accurate for forecasting demand across multiple time axes.</description>

      <title>Rank-based transfer learning for high-dimensional survival data with application to sepsis data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sepsis remains a critical challenge due to its high mortality and complex prognosis. To address data limitations in studying MSSA sepsis, we extend existing transfer learning frameworks to accommodate transformation models for high-dimensional survival data. Specifically, we construct a measurement index based on C-index for intelligently identifying the helpful source datasets, and the target model performance is improved by leveraging information from the identified source datasets via performing the transfer step and debiasing step. We further provide an algorithm to construct confidence intervals for each coefficient component. Another significant development is that statistical properties are rigorously established, including $\ell_1/\ell_2$-estimation error bounds of the transfer learning algorithm, detection consistency property of the transferable source detection algorithm and asymptotic theories for the confidence interval construction. Extensive simulations and analysis of MIMIC-IV sepsis data demonstrate the estimation and prediction accuracy, and practical advantages of our approach, providing significant improvements in survival estimates for MSSA sepsis patients.</description>

      <title>EthosGPT: Mapping Human Value Diversity to Advance Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming global decision-making and societal systems by processing diverse data at unprecedented scales. However, their potential to homogenize human values poses critical risks, similar to biodiversity loss undermining ecological resilience. Rooted in the ancient Greek concept of ethos, meaning both individual character and the shared moral fabric of communities, EthosGPT draws on a tradition that spans from Aristotle's virtue ethics to Adam Smith's moral sentiments as the ethical foundation of economic cooperation. These traditions underscore the vital role of value diversity in fostering social trust, institutional legitimacy, and long-term prosperity. EthosGPT addresses the challenge of value homogenization by introducing an open-source framework for mapping and evaluating LLMs within a global scale of human values. Using international survey data on cultural indices, prompt-based assessments, and comparative statistical analyses, EthosGPT reveals both the adaptability and biases of LLMs across regions and cultures. It offers actionable insights for developing inclusive LLMs, such as diversifying training data and preserving endangered cultural heritage to ensure representation in AI systems. These contributions align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), SDG 11.4 (Cultural Heritage Preservation), and SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions). Through interdisciplinary collaboration, EthosGPT promotes AI systems that are both technically robust and ethically inclusive, advancing value plurality as a cornerstone for sustainable and equitable futures.</description>

      <title>A Nonparametric Bayesian Local-Global Model for Enhanced Adverse Event Signal Detection in Spontaneous Reporting System Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous reporting system databases are key resources for post-marketing surveillance, providing real-world evidence (RWE) on the adverse events (AEs) of regulated drugs or other medical products. Various statistical methods have been proposed for AE signal detection in these databases, flagging drug-specific AEs with disproportionately high observed counts compared to expected counts under independence. However, signal detection remains challenging for rare AEs or newer drugs, which receive small observed and expected counts and thus suffer from reduced statistical power. Principled information sharing on signal strengths across drugs/AEs is crucial in such cases to enhance signal detection. However, existing methods typically ignore complex between-drug associations on AE signal strengths, limiting their ability to detect signals. We propose novel local-global mixture Dirichlet process (DP) prior-based nonparametric Bayesian models to capture these associations, enabling principled information sharing between drugs while balancing flexibility and shrinkage for each drug, thereby enhancing statistical power. We develop efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for implementation and employ a false discovery rate (FDR)-controlled, false negative rate (FNR)-optimized hypothesis testing framework for AE signal detection. Extensive simulations demonstrate our methods' superior sensitivity -- often surpassing existing approaches by a twofold or greater margin -- while strictly controlling the FDR. An application to FDA FAERS data on statin drugs further highlights our methods' effectiveness in real-world AE signal detection. Software implementing our methods is provided as supplementary material.</description>

      <title>A conceptual synthesis of causal assumptions for causal discovery and inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a conceptual synthesis of causal discovery and inference frameworks, with a focus on how foundational assumptions -- causal sufficiency, causal faithfulness, and the causal Markov condition -- are formalized and operationalized across methodological traditions. Through structured tables and comparative summaries, I map core assumptions, tasks, and analytical choices from multiple causal frameworks, highlighting their connections and differences. The synthesis provides practical guidance for researchers designing causal studies, especially in settings where observational or experimental constraints challenge standard approaches. This guide spans all phases of causal analysis, including question formulation, formalization of background knowledge, selection of appropriate frameworks, choice of study design or algorithm, and interpretation. It is intended as a tool to support rigorous causal reasoning across diverse empirical domains.</description>

      <title>A Review of Traffic Wave Suppression Strategies: Variable Speed Limit vs. Jam-Absorption Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main form of freeway traffic congestion is the familiar stop-and-go wave, characterized by wide moving jams that propagate indefinitely upstream provided enough traffic demand. They cause severe, long-lasting adverse effects, such as reduced traffic efficiency, increased driving risks, and higher vehicle emissions. This underscores the crucial importance of artificial intervention in the propagation of stop-and-go waves. Over the past two decades, two prominent strategies for stop-and-go wave suppression have emerged: variable speed limit (VSL) and jam-absorption driving (JAD). Although they share similar research motivations, objectives, and theoretical foundations, the development of these strategies has remained relatively disconnected. To synthesize fragmented advances and drive the field forward, this paper first provides a comprehensive review of the achievements in the stop-and-go wave suppression-oriented VSL and JAD, respectively. It then focuses on bridging the two areas and identifying research opportunities from the following perspectives: fundamental diagrams, traffic dynamics modeling, traffic state estimation and prediction, stochasticity, scenarios for strategy validation, and field tests and practical deployment. We expect that through this review, one area can effectively address its limitations by identifying and leveraging the strengths of the other, thus promoting the overall research goal of freeway stop-and-go wave suppression.</description>

      <title>Investigating dimensionally-reduced highly-damped systems with multivariate variational mode decomposition: An experimental approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural health monitoring (SHM) is an essential engineering field aimed at ensuring the safety and reliability of civil infrastructures. This study proposes a methodology using multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) for damage detection and modal identification. MVMD decomposes multi-sensor vibration responses into intrinsic modal components, facilitating the extraction of natural frequencies and damping ratios by analyzing amplitude decay in the identified modes. Mode shapes are determined through peak-normalization of Fourier spectra corresponding to each mode. The methodology is further applied to detect damage by identifying changes in the extracted modal parameters and spatial features of the structure. The proposed approach enables damage detection by tracking variations in modal parameters and spatial structural characteristics. To validate its efficacy, the methodology is applied to a benchmark eight-degree-of-freedom (8-DOF) system from Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), demonstrating its robustness in identifying structural damage under non-stationary excitation and narrowband frequency content. The results confirm that MVMD provides a reliable and adaptable framework for modal analysis and damage assessment in complex infrastructure systems, addressing key challenges such as environmental variability and practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional statistical inference for linkage disequilibrium score regression and its cross-ancestry extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) has emerged as an essential tool for genetic and genomic analyses of complex traits, utilizing high-dimensional data derived from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). LDSC computes the linkage disequilibrium (LD) scores using an external reference panel, and integrates the LD scores with only summary data from the original GWAS. In this paper, we investigate LDSC within a fixed-effect data integration framework, underscoring its ability to merge multi-source GWAS data and reference panels. In particular, we take account of the genome-wide dependence among the high-dimensional GWAS summary statistics, along with the block-diagonal dependence pattern in estimated LD scores. Our analysis uncovers several key factors of both the original GWAS and reference panel datasets that determine the performance of LDSC. We show that it is relatively feasible for LDSC-based estimators to achieve asymptotic normality when applied to genome-wide genetic variants (e.g., in genetic variance and covariance estimation), whereas it becomes considerably challenging when we focus on a much smaller subset of genetic variants (e.g., in partitioned heritability analysis). Moreover, by modeling the disparities in LD patterns across different populations, we unveil that LDSC can be expanded to conduct cross-ancestry analyses using data from distinct global populations (such as European and Asian). We validate our theoretical findings through extensive numerical evaluations using real genetic data from the UK Biobank study.</description>
