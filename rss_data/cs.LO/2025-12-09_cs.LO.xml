      <title>Formal State-Machine Models for Uniswap v3 Concentrated-Liquidity AMMs: Priced Timed Automata, Finite-State Transducers, and Provable Rounding Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concentrated-liquidity automated market makers (CLAMMs), as exemplified by Uniswap v3, are now a common primitive in decentralized finance frameworks. Their design combines continuous trading on constant-function curves with discrete tick boundaries at which liquidity positions change and rounding effects accumulate. While there is a body of economic and game-theoretic analysis of CLAMMs, there is negligible work that treats Uniswap v3 at the level of formal state machines amenable to model checking or theorem proving.
  In this paper we propose a formal modeling approach for Uniswap v3-style CLAMMs using (i) networks of priced timed automata (PTA), and (ii) finite-state transducers (FST) over discrete ticks. Positions are treated as stateful objects that transition only when the pool price crosses the ticks that bound their active range. We show how to encode the piecewise constant-product invariant, fee-growth variables, and tick-crossing rules in a PTA suitable for tools such as UPPAAL, and how to derive a tick-level FST abstraction for specification in TLA+.
  We define an explicit tick-wise invariant for a discretized, single-tick CLAMM model and prove that it is preserved up to a tight additive rounding bound under fee-free swaps. This provides a formal justification for the "$\epsilon$-slack" used in invariance properties and shows how rounding enters as a controlled perturbation. We then instantiate these models in TLA+ and use TLC to exhaustively check the resulting invariants on structurally faithful instances, including a three-tick concentrated-liquidity configuration and a bounded no-rounding-only-arbitrage property in a bidirectional single-tick model. We discuss how these constructions lift to the tick-wise structure of Uniswap v3 via virtual reserves, and how the resulting properties can be phrased as PTA/TLA+ invariants about cross-tick behaviour and rounding safety.</description>

      <title>Reasoning about concurrent loops and recursion with rely-guarantee rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to present general, mechanically verified, refinement rules for reasoning about recursive programs and while loops in the context of concurrency. Unlike many approaches to concurrency, we do not assume that expression evaluation is atomic. We make use of the rely-guarantee approach to concurrency that facilitates reasoning about interference from concurrent threads in a compositional manner. Recursive programs can be defined as fixed points over a lattice of commands and hence we develop laws for reasoning about fixed points. Loops can be defined in terms of fixed points and hence the laws for recursion can be applied to develop laws for loops.</description>

      <title>A finer reparameterisation theorem for MSO and FO queries on strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show a theorem on monadic second-order k-ary queries on finite words. It may be illustrated by the following example: if the number of results of a query on binary strings is O(number of 0s $\times$ number of 1s), then each result can be MSO-definably identified from a 0-position, a 1-position and some finite data.
  Our proofs also handle the case of first-order logic / aperiodic monoids. Thus we can state and prove the folklore theorem that dimension minimisation holds for first-order string-to-string interpretations.</description>

      <title>String Diagrams for Closed Symmetric Monoidal Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a graphical language for closed symmetric monoidal categories based on an extension of string diagrams with special bracket wires representing internal homs. These bracket wires make the structure of the internal hom functor explicit, allowing standard morphism wires to interact with them through a well-defined set of graphical rules.
  We establish the soundness and completeness of the diagrammatic calculus, and illustrate its expressiveness through examples drawn from category theory, logic and programming language semantics.</description>

      <title>Comparing Knowledge: An Analysis of the Relative Epistemic Powers of Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a novel type of epistemic logic, employing comparative knowledge assertions, to analyze the relative epistemic powers of individuals or groups of agents. Such comparative assertions can express that a group has the potential to (collectively) know everything that another group can know. Moreover, we look at comparisons involving various types of knowledge (fully introspective, positively introspective, etc.), satisfying the corresponding modal-epistemic conditions (e.g., $S5$, $S4$, $KT$). For each epistemic attitude, we are particularly interested in what agents or groups can know about their own epistemic position relative to that of others.</description>

      <title>Description Logics with Two Types of Definite Descriptions: Complexity, Expressiveness, and Automated Deduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Definite descriptions are expressions of the form "the unique $x$ satisfying property $C$," which allow reference to objects through their distinguishing characteristics. They play a crucial role in ontology and query languages, offering an alternative to proper names (IDs), which lack semantic content and serve merely as placeholders.
  In this paper, we introduce two extensions of the well-known description logic $\mathcal{ALC}$ with local and global definite descriptions, denoted $\mathcal{ALC}\iota_L$ and $\mathcal{ALC}\iota_G$, respectively. We define appropriate bisimulation notions for these logics, enabling an analysis of their expressiveness. We show that although both logics share the same tight ExpTime complexity bounds for concept and ontology satisfiability, $\mathcal{ALC}\iota_G$ is strictly more expressive than $\mathcal{ALC}\iota_L$. Moreover, we present tableau-based decision procedures for satisfiability in both logics, provide their implementation, and report on a series of experiments. The empirical results demonstrate the practical utility of the implementation and reveal interesting correlations between performance and structural properties of the input formulas.</description>

      <title>FastLEC: Parallel Datapath Equivalence Checking with Hybrid Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinational equivalence checking (CEC) remains a challenge EDA task in the formal verification of datapath circuits due to their complex arithmetic structures and the limited capability or scalability of SAT, BDD, and exact-simulation (ES) based techniques when used independently. This work presents FastLEC, a hybrid prover that unifies these three formal reasoning engines and introduces three strategies that substantially enhance verification efficiency. First, a regression-based engine-scheduling heuristic predicts solver effectiveness, enabling more accurate and balanced allocation of computational resources. Second, datapath-structure-aware partitioning strategies, along with a dynamic divide-and-conquer SAT prover, exploit the regularity of arithmetic designs while preserving completeness. Third, the memory overhead of ES is significantly reduced through address-reference-count tracking, and simulation is further accelerated through a GPU-enabled backend. FastLEC is evaluated across 368 datapath circuits. Using 32 CPU cores, it proves 5.07x more circuits than the widely used ABC &amp;cec tool. Compared with the latest best datapath-oriented serial and parallel CEC provers, FastLEC outperforms them by 3.33x and 2.67x in PAR-2 time, demonstrating an improvement of 74 newly solved circuits. With the addition of a single GPU, it achieves a further 4.07x improvement. The prover also demonstrates excellent scalability.</description>

      <title>Functional Reduction to Speed Up Bounded Model Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bounded model checking (BMC) is a widely used technique for formal property verification (FPV), where the transition relation is repeatedly unrolled to increasing depths and encoded into Boolean satisfiability (SAT) queries. As the bound grows deeper, these SAT queries typically become more difficult to solve, posing scalability challenges. Howevefor, many FPV problems involve multiple copies of related circuits, creating opportunities to simplify the unrolled transition relation. Motivated by the functionally reduced and-inverter-graph (FRAIG) technique, we propose FRAIG-BMC, which incrementally identifies and merges functionally equivalent nodes during the unrolling process. By reducing redundancy, FRAIG-BMC improves the efficiency of SAT solving and accelerates property checking. Experiments demonstrate that FRAIG-BMC significantly speeds up BMC across a range of applications, including sequential equivalence checking, partial retention register detection, and information flow checking</description>

      <title>Formal that "Floats" High: Formal Verification of Floating Point Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal verification of floating-point arithmetic remains challenging due to non-linear arithmetic behavior and the tight coupling between control and datapath logic. Existing approaches often rely on high-level C models for equivalence checking against Register Transfer Level (RTL) designs, but this introduces abstraction gaps, translation overhead, and limits scalability at the RTL level. To address these challenges, this paper presents a scalable methodology for verifying floating-point arithmetic using direct RTL-to-RTL model checking against a golden reference model. The approach adopts a divide-and conquer strategy that decomposes verification into modular stages, each captured by helper assertions and lemmas that collectively prove a main correctness theorem. Counterexample (CEX)-guided refinement is used to iteratively localize and resolve implementation defects, while targeted fault injection validates the robustness of the verification process against precision-critical datapath errors. To assess scalability and practicality, the methodology is extended with agentic AI-based formal property generation, integrating large language model (LLM)-driven automation with Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) refinement. Coverage analysis evaluates the effectiveness of the approach by comparing handwritten and AI-generated properties in both RTL-to-RTL model checking and standalone RTL verification settings. Results show that direct RTL-to-RTL model checking achieves higher coverage efficiency and requires fewer assertions than standalone verification, especially when combined with AI-generated properties refined through HITL guidance.</description>

      <title>Resource-Bounded Type Theory: Compositional Cost Analysis via Graded Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a compositional framework for certifying resource bounds in typed programs. Terms are typed with synthesized bounds drawn from an abstract resource lattice, enabling uniform treatment of time, memory, gas, and domain-specific costs.
  We introduce a graded feasibility modality with co-unit and monotonicity laws. Our main result is a syntactic cost soundness theorem for the recursion-free simply-typed fragment: if a closed term has synthesized bound b under a given budget, its operational cost is bounded by b. We provide a syntactic term model in the topos of presheaves over the lattice -- where resource bounds index a cost-stratified family of definable values -- with cost extraction as a natural transformation. We prove canonical forms via reification and establish initiality of the syntactic model: it embeds uniquely into all resource-bounded models.
  A case study demonstrates compositional reasoning for binary search using Lean's native recursion with separate bound proofs.</description>

      <title>Hereditary History-Preserving Bisimilarity: Characterizations via Backward Ready Multisets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We devise two complementary characterizations of hereditary history-preserving bisimilarity (HHPB): a denotational one, based on stable configuration structures, and an operational one, formulated in a reversible process calculus. Our characterizations rely on forward-reverse bisimilarity augmented with backward ready multiset equality. This shifts the emphasis from uniquely identifying events, as done in previous characterizations, to counting occurrences of identically labeled events associated with incoming transitions, which yields a more lightweight behavioral equivalence than HHPB. We show that our characterizations correctly distinguish between autoconcurrency and autocausation, but are valid only in the absence of non-local conflicts. We then study the logical foundations of these characterizations by relating event identifier logic, which captures the classical view of HHPB, and backward ready multiset logic, developed for our new equivalence.</description>

Abstract: Tape diagrams provide a convenient graphical notation for arrows of rig categories, i.e., categories equipped with two monoidal products, $\oplus$ and $\otimes$. In this work, we introduce Kleene-Cartesian rig categories, namely rig categories where $\otimes$ provides a Cartesian bicategory, while $\oplus$ a Kleene bicategory. We show that the associated tape diagrams can conveniently deal with imperative programs and various program logic.</description>

      <title>Symmetries in Sorting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sorting algorithms are fundamental to computer science, and their correctness criteria are well understood as rearranging elements of a list according to a specified total order on the underlying set of elements. As mathematical functions, they are functions on lists that perform combinatorial operations on the representation of the input list. In this paper, we study sorting algorithms conceptually as abstract sorting functions.
  There is a canonical surjection from the free monoid on a set (lists of elements) to the free commutative monoid on the same set (multisets of elements). We show that sorting functions determine a section (right inverse) to this surjection satisfying two axioms, that do not presuppose a total order on the underlying set. Then, we establish an equivalence between (decidable) total orders on the underlying set and correct sorting functions.
  The first part of the paper develops concepts from universal algebra from the point of view of functorial signatures, and gives constructions of free monoids and free commutative monoids in (univalent) type theory. Using these constructions, the second part of the paper develops the axiomatisation of sorting functions. The paper uses informal mathematical language, and comes with an accompanying formalisation in Cubical Agda.</description>

      <title>Less Is More for Multi-Step Logical Reasoning of LLM Generalisation Under Rule Removal, Paraphrasing, and Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across many natural language tasks, yet their generalisation to structural perturbations in logical contexts remains poorly understood. We introduce a controlled evaluation framework that probes reasoning reliability through four targeted stress tests: (1) rule deletion, removing either redundant or essential rules from a multi-step inference chain; (2) contradictory evidence injection; (3) logic-preserving rewrites generated through several families of equivalence laws (contrapositive, double negation, implication, De Morgan, identity, and commutativity); and (4) multi-law equivalence stacking that introduces 2-5 simultaneous logical transformations.
  Across three representative model families: BERT, Qwen2, and LLaMA-like models. Our experiments reveal a strikingly consistent pattern: all models achieve perfect accuracy on the base tasks and remain fully generalise to redundant rule deletion and all equivalence-based rewrites (single or multi-law), but fail sharply under essential rule deletion (dropping to 25% accuracy) and collapse completely in the presence of explicit contradictions (0% accuracy). These results demonstrate that LLMs possess stable invariance to semantic-preserving logical transformations, yet remain fundamentally brittle to missing or conflicting evidence. Our framework provides a clean diagnostic tool for isolating such reasoning failure modes and highlights persistent gaps in the logical generalisation abilities of current LLMs.</description>

      <title>Formalisation of Security for Federated Learning with DP and Attacker Advantage in IIIf for Satellite Swarms -- Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In distributed applications, like swarms of satellites, machine learning can be efficiently applied even on small devices by using Federated Learning (FL). This allows to reduce the learning complexity by transmitting only updates to the general model in the server in the form of differences in stochastic gradient descent. FL naturally supports differential privacy but new attacks, so called Data Leakage from Gradient (DLG) have been discovered recently. There has been work on defenses against DLG but there is a lack of foundation and rigorous evaluation of their security. In the current work, we extend existing work on a formal notion of Differential Privacy for Federated Learning distributed dynamic systems and relate it to the notion of the attacker advantage. This formalisation is carried out within the Isabelle Insider and Infrastructure framework (IIIf) allowing the machine supported verification of theory and applications within the proof assistant Isabelle. Satellite swarm systems are used as a motivating use case but also as a validation case study.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Boolean Synthesis with Zero-suppressed Decision Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by functional synthesis in sequential circuit construction and quantified boolean formulas (QBF), boolean synthesis serves as one of the core problems in Formal Methods. Recent advances show that decision diagrams (DD) are particularly competitive in symbolic approaches for boolean synthesis, among which zero-suppressed decision diagram (ZDD) is a relatively new algorithmic approach, but is complementary to the industrial portfolio, where binary decision diagrams (BDDs) are more often applied. We propose a new dynamic-programming ZDD-based framework in the context of boolean synthesis, show solutions to theoretical challenges, develop a tool, and investigate the experimental performance. We also propose an idea of magic number that functions as the upper bound of planning-phase time and treewidth, showing how to interpret the exploration-exploitation dilemma in planning-execution synthesis framework. The algorithm we propose shows its strengths in general, gives inspiration for future needs to determine industrial magic numbers, and justifies that the framework we propose is an appropriate addition to the industrial synthesis solvers portfolio.</description>

      <title>The Equational Theories Project: Advancing Collaborative Mathematical Research at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the Equational Theories Project (ETP), an online collaborative pilot project to explore new ways to collaborate in mathematics with machine assistance. The project successfully determined all 22 028 942 edges of the implication graph between the 4694 simplest equational laws on magmas, by a combination of human-generated and automated proofs, all validated by the formal proof assistant language Lean. As a result of this project, several new constructions of magmas satisfying specific laws were discovered, and several auxiliary questions were also addressed, such as the effect of restricting attention to finite magmas.</description>

      <title>Canonical bidirectional typechecking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the checkable/synthesisable split in bidirectional typechecking coincides with existing dualities in polarised System L, also known as polarised $\mu\tilde{\mu}$-calculus. Specifically, positive terms and negative coterms are checkable, and negative terms and positive coterms are synthesisable. This combines a standard formulation of bidirectional typechecking with Zeilberger's `cocontextual' variant. We extend this to ordinary `cartesian' System L using Mc Bride's co-de Bruijn formulation of scopes, and show that both can be combined in a linear-nonlinear style, where linear types are positive and cartesian types are negative. This yields a remarkable 3-way coincidence between the shifts of polarised System L, LNL calculi, and bidirectional calculi.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are widely used, yet their analysis and verification remain challenging. In this work, we present a Lean 4 formalization of neural networks, covering both deterministic and stochastic models. We first formalize Hopfield networks, recurrent networks that store patterns as stable states. We prove convergence and the correctness of Hebbian learning, a training rule that updates network parameters to encode patterns, here limited to the case of pairwise-orthogonal patterns. We then consider stochastic networks, where updates are probabilistic and convergence is to a stationary distribution. As a canonical example, we formalize the dynamics of Boltzmann machines and prove their ergodicity, showing convergence to a unique stationary distribution using a new formalization of the Perron-Frobenius theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09138v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear Logic refines Intuitionnistic Logic by taking into account the resources used during the proof and program computation. In the past decades, it has been extended to various frameworks. The most famous are indexed linear logics which can describe the resource management or the complexity analysis of a program. From an other perspective, Differential Linear Logic is an extension which allows the linearization of proofs. In this article, we merge these two directions by first defining a differential version of Graded linear logic: this is made by indexing exponential connectives with a monoid of differential operators. We prove that it is equivalent to a graded version of previously defined extension of finitary differential linear logic. We give a denotational model of our logic, based on distribution theory and linear partial differential operators with constant coefficients.</description>

      <title>Bridging Weighted First Order Model Counting and Graph Polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Weighted First-Order Model Counting Problem (WFOMC) asks to compute the weighted sum of models of a given first-order logic sentence over a given domain. It can be solved in time polynomial in the domain size for sentences from the two-variable fragment with counting quantifiers, known as $C^2$. This polynomial-time complexity is known to be retained when extending $C^2$ by one of the following axioms: linear order axiom, tree axiom, forest axiom, directed acyclic graph axiom or connectedness axiom. An interesting question remains as to which other axioms can be added to the first-order sentences in this way. We provide a new perspective on this problem by associating WFOMC with graph polynomials. Using WFOMC, we define Weak Connectedness Polynomial and Strong Connectedness Polynomials for first-order logic sentences. It turns out that these polynomials have the following interesting properties. First, they can be computed in polynomial time in the domain size for sentences from $C^2$. Second, we can use them to solve WFOMC with all of the existing axioms known to be tractable as well as with new ones such as bipartiteness, strong connectedness, having $k$ connected components, etc. Third, the well-known Tutte polynomial can be recovered as a special case of the Weak Connectedness Polynomial, and the Strict and Non-Strict Directed Chromatic Polynomials can be recovered from the Strong Connectedness Polynomials.</description>

      <title>Seven kinds of equivalent models for generalized coalition logics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coalition Logic is an important logic in logical research on strategic reasoning. In two recent papers, Li and Ju argued that generally, concurrent game models, models of Coalition Logic, have three too strong assumptions: seriality, independence of agents, and determinism. They presented eight coalition logics based on eight classes of general concurrent game models, determined by which of the three assumptions are met. In this paper, we show that each of the eight sets of valid formulas of the eight logics is determined by six other kinds of models, that is, single-coalition-first action models, single-coalition-first actual neighborhood models, clear grand-coalition-first action models, clear single-coalition-first actual neighborhood models, tree-like grand-coalition-first action models, and tree-like single-coalition-first actual neighborhood models.</description>

      <title>ProofBridge: Auto-Formalization of Natural Language Proofs in Lean via Joint Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Translating human-written mathematical theorems and proofs from natural language (NL) into formal languages (FLs) like Lean 4 has long been a significant challenge for AI. Most state-of-the-art methods either focus on theorem-only NL-to-FL auto-formalization or on FL proof synthesis from FL theorems. In practice, auto-formalization of both theorem and proof still requires human intervention, as seen in AlphaProof's silver-medal performance at the 2024 IMO, where problem statements were manually translated before automated proof synthesis.
  We present ProofBridge, a unified framework for automatically translating entire NL theorems and proofs into Lean 4. At its core is a joint embedding model that aligns NL and FL (NL-FL) theorem-proof pairs in a shared semantic space, enabling cross-modal retrieval of semantically relevant FL examples to guide translation. Our training ensures that NL-FL theorems (and their proofs) are mapped close together in this space if and only if the NL-FL pairs are semantically equivalent. ProofBridge integrates retrieval-augmented fine-tuning with iterative proof repair, leveraging Lean's type checker and semantic equivalence feedback to ensure both syntactic correctness and semantic fidelity. Experiments show substantial improvements in proof auto-formalization over strong baselines (including GPT-5, Gemini-2.5, Kimina-Prover, DeepSeek-Prover), with our retrieval-augmented approach yielding significant gains in semantic correctness (SC, via proving bi-directional equivalence) and type correctness (TC, via type-checking theorem+proof) across pass@k metrics on miniF2F-Test-PF, a dataset we curated. In particular, ProofBridge improves cross-modal retrieval quality by up to 3.28x Recall@1 over all-MiniLM-L6-v2, and achieves +31.14% SC and +1.64% TC (pass@32) compared to the baseline Kimina-Prover-RL-1.7B.</description>

      <title>The Seifert-van Kampen Theorem via Computational Paths: A Formalized Approach to Computing Fundamental Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Seifert-van Kampen theorem computes the fundamental group of a space from the fundamental groups of its constituents. We formalize this theorem within the framework of computational paths -- an approach to equality where witnesses are explicit sequences of rewrites governed by the confluent, terminating LND_EQ-TRS.
  Our contributions are: (i) pushouts as higher-inductive types with explicit path constructors; (ii) free products and amalgamated free products as quotients of word representations; (iii) an encode-decode proof establishing pi_1(Pushout(A,B,C)) = pi_1(A) *_{pi_1(C)} pi_1(B); and (iv) applications to the figure-eight (pi_1(S^1 V S^1) = Z * Z), 2-sphere (pi_1(S^2) = 1), and 3-sphere (pi_1(S^3) = 1 with Hopf fibration context).
  Recent extensions include: higher homotopy groups pi_n via the weak omega-groupoid structure (with pi_2 abelian via Eckmann-Hilton, and pi_2 = 1 in the 1-groupoid truncated setting); truncation levels connecting the framework to HoTT n-types; automated path simplification tactics; basic covering space theory with pi_1-actions on fibers; fibration theory with long exact sequences; and Eilenberg-MacLane space characterization (S^1 = K(Z,1)).
  The framework makes coherence witnesses explicit as rewrite derivations. The development is formalized in Lean 4 with over 25,000 lines of mechanized proofs. This demonstrates that the encode-decode method for higher-inductive types becomes fully constructive when path equality is decidable via normalization.</description>

      <title>Taint Analysis for Graph APIs Focusing on Broken Access Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first systematic approach to static and dynamic taint analysis for Graph APIs focusing on broken access control. The approach comprises the following. We taint nodes of the Graph API if they represent data requiring specific privileges in order to be retrieved or manipulated, and identify API calls which are related to sources and sinks. Then, we statically analyze whether a tainted information flow between API source and sink calls occurs. To this end, we model the API calls using graph transformation rules. We subsequently use Critical Pair Analysis to automatically analyze potential dependencies between rules representing source calls and rules representing sink calls. We distinguish direct from indirect tainted information flow and argue under which conditions the Critical Pair Analysis is able to detect not only direct, but also indirect tainted flow. The static taint analysis (i) identifies flows that need to be further reviewed, since tainted nodes may be created by an API call and used or manipulated by another API call later without having the necessary privileges, and (ii) can be used to systematically design dynamic security tests for broken access control. The dynamic taint analysis checks if potential broken access control risks detected during the static taint analysis really occur. We apply the approach to a part of the GitHub GraphQL API. The application illustrates that our analysis supports the detection of two types of broken access control systematically: the case where users of the API may not be able to access or manipulate information, although they should be able to do so; and the case where users (or attackers) of the API may be able to access/manipulate information that they should not.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to cast values between related types is a leitmotiv of many flavors of dependent type theory, such as observational type theories, subtyping, or cast calculi for gradual typing. These casts all exhibit a common structural behavior that boils down to the pervasive functoriality of type formers. We propose and extensively study a type theory, called AdapTT, which makes systematic and precise this idea of functorial type formers, with respect to an abstract notion of adapters relating types. Leveraging descriptions for functorial inductive types in AdapTT, we derive structural laws for type casts on general inductive type formers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a resilience-based framework for computing feasible assume-guarantee contracts that ensure the satisfaction of temporal specifications in interconnected discrete-time systems. Interconnection effects are modeled as structured disturbances. We use a resilience metric, the maximum disturbance under which local specifications hold, to refine assumptions and guarantees across subsystems iteratively. We first demonstrate correctness and monotone refinement of guarantees for two subsystems. Then, we extend our approach to general networks of L subsystems using weighted combinations of interconnection effects. We instantiate the framework on linear systems by meeting finite-horizon safety, exact-time reachability, and finite-horizon reachability specifications, and on nonlinear systems by fulfilling general finite-horizon specifications. Our approach is demonstrated through numerical linear examples and a nonlinear DC microgrid case study, showcasing the impact of our framework on verifying temporal logic specifications with compositional reasoning.</description>

      <title>Information Physics of Intelligence: Unifying Logical Depth and Entropy under Thermodynamic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid scaling of artificial intelligence models has revealed a fundamental tension between model capacity (storage) and inference efficiency (computation). While classical information theory focuses on transmission and storage limits, it lacks a unified physical framework to quantify the thermodynamic costs of generating information from compressed laws versus retrieving it from memory. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework that treats information processing as an enabling mapping from ontological states to carrier states. We introduce a novel metric, Derivation Entropy, which quantifies the effective work required to compute a target state from a given logical depth. By analyzing the interplay between Shannon entropy (storage) and computational complexity (time/energy), we demonstrate the existence of a critical phase transition point. Below this threshold, memory retrieval is thermodynamically favorable; above it, generative computation becomes the optimal strategy. This "Energy-Time-Space" conservation law provides a physical explanation for the efficiency of generative models and offers a rigorous mathematical bound for designing next-generation, energy-efficient AI architectures. Our findings suggest that the minimization of Derivation Entropy is a governing principle for the evolution of both biological and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Black Box: A Cognitive Architecture for Explainable and Aligned AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current AI paradigms, as "architects of experience," face fundamental challenges in explainability and value alignment. This paper introduces "Weight-Calculatism," a novel cognitive architecture grounded in first principles, and demonstrates its potential as a viable pathway toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The architecture deconstructs cognition into indivisible Logical Atoms and two fundamental operations: Pointing and Comparison. Decision-making is formalized through an interpretable Weight-Calculation model (Weight = Benefit * Probability), where all values are traceable to an auditable set of Initial Weights. This atomic decomposition enables radical explainability, intrinsic generality for novel situations, and traceable value alignment. We detail its implementation via a graph-algorithm-based computational engine and a global workspace workflow, supported by a preliminary code implementation and scenario validation. Results indicate that the architecture achieves transparent, human-like reasoning and robust learning in unprecedented scenarios, establishing a practical and theoretical foundation for building trustworthy and aligned AGI.</description>
