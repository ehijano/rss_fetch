      <title>Optical and transport properties of NbN thin films revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly disordered NbN thin films exhibit promising superconducting and optical properties. Despite extensive study, discrepancies in its basic electronic properties persist. Analysis of the optical conductivity of disordered ultra-thin NbN films, obtained from spectroscopic ellipsometry by standard Drude-Lorentz model, provides inconsistent parameters. We argue that this discrepancy arise from neglecting the presence of quantum corrections to conductivity in the IR range. To resolve this matter, we propose a modification to the Drude-Lorentz model, incorporating quantum corrections. The parameters obtained from the modified model are consistent not only with transport and superconducting measurements but also with ab initio calculations. The revisited values describing conduction electrons, which differ significantly from commonly adopted ones, are the electron relaxation rate $\Gamma\approx1.8~\textrm{eV}/\hbar$, the Fermi velocity $v_F \approx 0.7 \times 10^{6}~\textrm{ms}^{-1}$ and the electron density of states $N(E_F)=2~$states of both spins/eV/$V_{\textrm{f.u.}}$.</description>

      <title>Topologically trivial gap-filling in superconducting Fe(Se,Te) by one dimensional defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural distortions and imperfections are a crucial aspect of materials science, on the macroscopic scale providing strength, but also enhancing corrosion and reducing electrical and thermal conductivity. At the nanometre scale, multi-atom imperfections, such as atomic chains and crystalline domain walls have conversely been proposed as a route to topological superconductivity, whose most prominent characteristic is the emergence of Majorana Fermions that can be used for error-free quantum computing. Here, we shed more light on the nature of purported domain walls in Fe(Se,Te) that may host 1D dispersing Majorana modes. We show that the displacement shift of the atomic lattice at these line-defects results from sub-surface impurities that warp the topmost layer(s). Using the electric field between the tip and sample, we manage to reposition the sub-surface impurities, directly visualizing the displacement shift and the underlying defect-free lattice. These results, combined with observations of a completely different type of 1D defect where superconductivity remains fully gapped, highlight the topologically trivial nature of 1D defects in Fe(Se,Te).</description>

      <title>Superconducting properties and electronic structure of CuAl2-type transition-metal zirconide Fe1-xNixZr2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CuAl2-type transition-metal (Tr) zirconides are superconductor family, and the Tr-site element substitution largely modifies its transition temperature (Tc). Here, we synthesized polycrystalline samples of Fe1-xNixZr2 by arc melting. From magnetic susceptibility measurements, bulk superconductivity was observed for 0.4 &lt;= x &lt;= 0.8, and the highest Tc of 2.8 K was observed for x = 0.6. The obtained superconductivity phase diagram exhibits dome-shaped trend, which is similar to unconventional superconductors, where magnetic fluctuations are essential for superconductivity. In addition, from the c/a lattice constant ratio analysis, we show the possible relationship between the suppression of bulk superconductivity in the Ni-rich compositions and a collapsed tetragonal transition.</description>

      <title>Frustrated Superconductivity in the Trilayer Nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the opposite trend of maximum $T_c$ in multilayer nickelate and cuprate superconductors, we propose an interlayer pairing scenario for the superconductivity of the trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ discovered recently under high pressure. Our theory reveals intrinsic frustration of the spin-singlet pairing formed between two outer layers and the same inner layer, which causes strong superconducting fluctuations between layers and thus explains the reduction of its maximum $T_c$ compared to that of the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$. This supports a fundamental distinction between multilayer nickelate and cuprate superconductors associated with their potentially different (interlayer vs intralayer) pairing mechanisms. Our theory predicts extended $s^\pm$-wave gap structures in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, with varying signs and possible nodes on different Fermi pockets. We also find an intrinsic Josephson coupling with potentially interesting consequences to be examined in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Tunable superconductivity in electron- and hole-doped Bernal bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene-based, high quality two-dimensional electronic systems have emerged as a highly tunable platform for studying superconductivity. Specifically, superconductivity has been observed in both electron-doped and hole-doped twisted graphene moire systems, whereas in crystalline graphene systems, superconductivity has so far only been observed in hole-doped rhombohedral trilayer and hole-doped Bernal bilayer graphene (BBG). Recently, enhanced superconductivity has been demonstrated in BBG due to the proximity with a monolayer WSe2. Here, we report the observation of superconductivity and a series of flavor-symmetry-breaking phases in both electron- and hole-doped BBG/WSe2 device by electrostatic doping. The strength of the observed superconductivity is tunable by applied vertical electric fields. The maximum Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition temperature for the electron- and hole-doped superconductivity is about 210 mK and 400 mK, respectively. Superconductivities emerge only when applied electric fields drive BBG electron or hole wavefunctions toward the WSe2 layer, underscoring the importance of the WSe2 layer in the observed superconductivity. We find the hole-doped superconductivity violates the Pauli paramagnetic limit, consistent with an Ising-like superconductor. In contrast, the electron-doped superconductivity obeys the Pauli limit, even though the proximity induced Ising spin-orbit coupling is also notable in the conduction band. Our findings highlight the rich physics associated with the conduction band in BBG, paving the way for further studies into the superconducting mechanisms of crystalline graphene and the development of novel superconductor devices based on BBG.</description>

      <title>Chern number landscape of spin-orbit coupled chiral superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral superconductors are one of the predominant quantum electronic states of matter where topology, symmetry, and Fermiology intertwine. This is pushed to a new limit by further invoking the coupling between spin and charge degrees of freedom, which fundamentally affects the principal nature of the Cooper pair wave function. We investigate the onset of superconductivity in the Rashba-Hubbard model on the triangular lattice, which is symmetry-classified by the associated irreducible representations (irrep) of the hexagonal point group. From an instability analysis by means of the truncated-unity functional renormalization group (TU-FRG) we find the $E_2$ irrep to dominate a large fraction of phase space and to lead up to an energetically preferred gapped, chiral superconducting state. The topological phase space classification associated with the anomalous propagators obtained from TU-FRG reveals a fragmentation of the $E_2$ domain into different topological sectors with vastly differing Chern numbers. It hints at a potentially applicable high sensitivity and tunability of chiral superconductors with respect to topological edge modes and phase transitions.</description>

      <title>MSene: A new large family of two-dimensional transition metal sulfide with MXene structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, discovering new two-dimensional (2D) materials with unique properties and potential applications remains a focus in condensed matter physics. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we report a new large family of transition metal sulfides M2S with MXene structure in 2H and 1T phases, which we name as MSene. Twenty-four out of fifty-eight MSenes are proved to be stable. Notably, this family includes twelve superconducting (SC) materials, seven SC topological metals (SCTMs), four charge density wave (CDW) materials, and five magnetic materials including one ferromagnetic (FM) and four antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials. For example, 2H-W2S is a SCTM which exhibits SC transition temperature (Tc) of 12.4 K and nontrivial topological properties as evidenced by topological invariant Z2=1 and the presence of edge states; 1T-Hf2S is a CDW material with the CDW originating from electron-phonon coupling. The CDW can be suppressed by compressive strain, leading to the emergence of superconductivity; 2H-Cr2S and 1T-Mn2S show FM and AFM properties, respectively. Thus, the new large family we predicted shows rich physical properties and significantly expands the repertoire of 2D materials. It serves as a novel platform for investigating the competition or coexistence of multiple orders such as SC, CDW, FM, AFM and topological orders in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Josephson threshold detector in the phase diffusion regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the performance of threshold detectors based on Al Josephson junctions can be significantly improved by exploiting the phase diffusion regime. When the escape dynamics of the detector switches to this regime, a decrease in both - dark count rate and the standard deviation of switching current is simultaneously observed. However, this effect is essential for (i) critical currents below 100 nA, and (ii) temperatures of the order of several hundreds millikelvin. Importantly that for such detectors optimal performance occurs at finite temperatures, making the microwave single photon detection feasible even in the sub-K range. Possible explanation of these findings is discussed.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of Al/AlOx/Al junctions with high uniformity and stability on sapphire substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tantalum and aluminum on sapphire are widely used platforms for qubits of long coherent time. As quantum chips scale up, the number of Josephson junctions on Sapphire increases. Thus, both the uniformity and stability of the junctions are crucial to quantum devices, such as scalable superconducting quantum computer circuit, and quantum-limited amplifiers. By optimizing the fabrication process, especially, the conductive layer during the electron beam lithography process, Al/AlOx/Al junctions of sizes ranging from 0.0169 to 0.04 {\mu}m2 on sapphire substrates were prepared. The relative standard deviation of room temperature resistances (RN) of these junctions is better than 1.7% on 15 mmx15 mm chips, and better than 2.66% on 2 inch wafers, which is the highest uniformity on sapphire substrates has been reported. The junctions are robust and stable in resistances as temperature changes. The resistances increase by the ratio of 9.73% relative to RN as the temperature ramp down to 4K, and restore their initial values in the reverse process as the temperature ramps back to RT. After being stored in a nitrogen cabinet for 100 days, the resistance of the junctions changed by1.16% in average. The demonstration of uniform and stable Josephson junctions in large area paves the way for the fabrication of superconducting chip of hundreds of qubits on sapphire substrates.</description>

      <title>High-quality superconducting {\alpha}-Ta film sputtered on heated silicon substrate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intrigued by the discovery of the long lifetime in the {\alpha}-Ta/Al2O3-based Transmon qubit, researchers recently found {\alpha}-Ta film is a promising platform for fabricating multi-qubits with long coherence time. To meet the requirements for integrating superconducting quantum circuits, the ideal method is to grow {\alpha}-Ta film on a silicon substrate compatible with industrial manufacturing. Here we report the {\alpha}-Ta film sputter-grown on Si (100) with a low-loss superconducting TiNx buffer layer. The {\alpha}-Ta film with a large growth temperature window has a good crystalline character. The superconducting critical transition temperature (Tc) and residual resistivity ratio (RRR) in the {\alpha}-Ta film grown at 500 {\deg}C are higher than that in the {\alpha}-Ta film grown at room temperature (RT). These results provide crucial experimental clues toward understanding the connection between the superconductivity and the materials' properties in the {\alpha}-Ta film and open a new route for producing a high-quality {\alpha}-Ta film on silicon substrate for future industrial superconducting quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Josephson junctions formed by multiple superconductors with distinct phases and explore the formation of nonlocal or inter-superconductor pair correlations. We find that the multiple superconductor nature offers an additional degree of freedom that broadens the classification of pair symmetries, enabling nonlocal even- and odd-frequency pairings that can be highly controlled by the superconducting phases and the energy of the superconductors. Specially, when the phase difference between two superconductors is $\pi$, their associated nonlocal odd-frequency pairing is the only type of inter-superconductor pair correlations. Finally, we show that these nonlocal odd-frequency Cooper pairs dominate the nonlocal conductance via crossed Andreev reflections, which constitutes a direct evidence of odd-frequency pairing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pairing interactions between electrons play an essential role in determining the properties in superconducting states. Recently, a plethora of unconventional superconducting states has been extensively explored, which often emerge owing to multipole fluctuations in the vicinity of multipole orders. We classify such superconducting states from the viewpoint of the multipole degrees of freedom by extending its representation to Nambu space. We clarify that under the crystallographic point group, arbitrary Cooper pairs between electrons with any angular momenta are systematically classified by four types of multipoles: electric, magnetic, magnetic toroidal, and electric toroidal. As examples, we apply our formulation to an $sp$-orbital electron system, which potentially exhibits exotic Cooper pairs under polar and axial point groups. Our systematic classification will be useful in characterizing unconventional superconducting states in multiorbital systems.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable Josephson diode effect in Rashba spin-orbit coupled quantum dot junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically explore Josephson diode effect (JDE) in superconductor/quantum dot (QD)/superconductor junction in the presence of a magnetic field and Rashba spin-orbit interaction (RSOI). We calculate the Josephson current in our QD junction using Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function technique. We show that JDE is induced in our chiral QD junction with large rectification coefficient (RC) in the presence of RSOI and external magnetic field simultaneously. Interestingly, the sign and magnitude of the RC are highly controllable by the magnetic field and RSOI. For realistic RSOI strength in the presence of magnetic field and chirality, the RC can be tuned to be as high as $70\%$ by an external gate potential, indicating a giant JDE in our QD junction. Our proposed QD-based Josephson diode (JD) may serve as a potential superconducting device component.</description>

Abstract: We develop a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory of the vortex spin Hall effect, i.e., a spin Hall effect that is driven by the motion of superconducting vortices. For the direct vortex spin Hall effect in which an input charge current drives the transverse spin current accompanying the vortex motion, we start from the well-known Schmid-Caroli-Maki solution for the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation under the applied electric field, and find out the expression of the induced spin current. For the inverse vortex spin Hall effect in which an input spin current drives the longitudinal vortex motion and produces the transverse charge current, we microscopically construct the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation under the applied spin accumulation gradient, and calculate the induced transverse charge current as well as the open circuit voltage. The time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation and its analytical solution developed here can be a basis for more quantitative numerical simulations of the vortex spin Hall effect.</description>

Abstract: Superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices, involving quantum dots interfaced with floating and/or grounded superconductors, have reached a level of complexity which calls for the development of versatile and numerically efficient modelling tools. Here, we propose an extension of the surrogate model solver for sub-gap states [Phys. Rev. B 108, L220506 (2023)], which is able to handle floating superconducting islands with finite charging energy. Upon eliminating all finite-size effects of the computationally demanding Richardson model approach, we achieve a more efficient way of calculating the sub-gap spectra and related observables without compromising their accuracy. We provide a number of benchmarks between the two approaches and showcase the versatility of the extended surrogate model solver by studying the stability of spin-triplet ground states in various tunable devices. The methods introduced here set the stage for reliable microscopic simulations of complex superconducting quantum circuits across all their relevant parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Observation of diamagnetic strange-metal phase in sulfur-copper codoped lead apatite</title>

Abstract: By codoping sulfur and copper into lead apatite, the crystal grains are directionally stacked and the room-temperature resistivity is reduced from insulating to $2\times10^{-5}~\Omega\cdot$m. The resistance-temperature curve exhibits a nearly linear relationship at low temperature suggesting the presence of strange-metal phase, and a second-order phase transition is then observed at around 230~K during cooling the samples. A possible Meissner effect is present in dc magnetic measurements. Further hydrothermal lead-free synthesis results in smaller resistance and stronger diamagnetism, demonstrating the essential component might be sulfur-substituted copper apatite and the alkalis matter as well. A clear pathway towards superconductivity in this material is subsequently benchmarked.</description>

      <title>Microwave Quantum Memcapacitor Effect</title>

Abstract: Developing the field of neuromorphic quantum computing necessitates designing scalable quantum memory devices. Here, we propose a superconducting quantum memory device in the microwave regime, termed as a microwave quantum memcapacitor. It comprises two linked resonators, the primary one is coupled to a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device, which allows for the modulation of the resonator properties through external magnetic flux. The auxiliary resonator, operated through weak measurements, provides feedback to the primary resonator, ensuring stable memory behaviour. This device operates with a classical input in one cavity while reading the response in the other, serving as a fundamental building block toward arrays of microwave quantum memcapacitors. We observe that a bipartite setup can retain its memory behaviour and gains entanglement and quantum correlations. Our findings pave the way for the experimental implementation of memcapacitive superconducting quantum devices and memory device arrays for neuromorphic quantum computing.</description>
