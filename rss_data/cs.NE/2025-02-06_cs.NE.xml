      <title>Kozax: Flexible and Scalable Genetic Programming in JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genetic programming is an optimization algorithm inspired by natural selection which automatically evolves the structure of computer programs. The resulting computer programs are interpretable and efficient compared to black-box models with fixed structure. The fitness evaluation in genetic programming suffers from high computational requirements, limiting the performance on difficult problems. To reduce the runtime, many implementations of genetic programming require a specific data format, making the applicability limited to specific problem classes. Consequently, there is no efficient genetic programming framework that is usable for a wide range of tasks. To this end, we developed Kozax, a genetic programming framework that evolves symbolic expressions for arbitrary problems. We implemented Kozax using JAX, a framework for high-performance and scalable machine learning, which allows the fitness evaluation to scale efficiently to large populations or datasets on GPU. Furthermore, Kozax offers constant optimization, custom operator definition and simultaneous evolution of multiple trees. We demonstrate successful applications of Kozax to discover equations of natural laws, recover equations of hidden dynamic variables and evolve a control policy. Overall, Kozax provides a general, fast, and scalable library to optimize white-box solutions in the realm of scientific computing.</description>

      <title>Abnormal Mutations: Evolution Strategies Don't Require Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mutation process in evolution strategies has been interlinked with the normal distribution since its inception. Many lines of reasoning have been given for this strong dependency, ranging from maximum entropy arguments to the need for isotropy. However, some theoretical results suggest that other distributions might lead to similar local convergence properties. This paper empirically shows that a wide range of evolutionary strategies, from the (1+1)-ES to CMA-ES, show comparable optimization performance when using a mutation distribution other than the standard Gaussian. Replacing it with, e.g., uniformly distributed mutations, does not deteriorate the performance of ES, when using the default adaptation mechanism for the strategy parameters. We observe that these results hold not only for the sphere model but also for a wider range of benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>STEM: Spatial-Temporal Mapping Tool For Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising bio-inspired third-generation neural networks. Recent research has trained deep SNN models with accuracy on par with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Although the event-driven and sparse nature of SNNs show potential for more energy efficient computation than ANNs, SNN neurons have internal states which evolve over time. Keeping track of SNN states can significantly increase data movement and storage requirements, potentially losing its advantages with respect to ANNs. This paper investigates the energy effects of having neuron states, and how it is influenced by the chosen mapping to realistic hardware architectures with advanced memory hierarchies. Therefore, we develop STEMS, a mapping design space exploration tool for SNNs. STEMS models SNN's stateful behavior and explores intra-layer and inter-layer mapping optimizations to minimize data movement, considering both spatial and temporal SNN dimensions. Using STEMS, we show up to 12x reduction in off-chip data movement and 5x reduction in energy (on top of intra-layer optimizations), on two event-based vision SNN benchmarks. Finally, neuron states may not be needed for all SNN layers. By optimizing neuron states for one of our benchmarks, we show 20x reduction in neuron states and 1.4x better performance without accuracy loss.</description>

      <title>How the Stroop Effect Arises from Optimal Response Times in Laterally Connected Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Stroop effect refers to cognitive interference in a color-naming task: When the color and the word do not match, the response is slower and more likely to be incorrect. The Stroop task is used to assess cognitive flexibility, selective attention, and executive function. This paper implements the Stroop task with self-organizing maps (SOMs): Target color and the competing word are inputs for the semantic and lexical maps, associative connections bring color information to the lexical map, and lateral connections combine their effects over time. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 84.2%, with significantly fewer errors and faster responses in congruent compared to no-input and incongruent conditions. The model's effect is a side effect of optimizing response times, and can thus be seen as a cost associated with overall efficient performance. The model can further serve studying neurologically-inspired cognitive control and related phenomena.</description>

      <title>Implementing Large Quantum Boltzmann Machines as Generative AI Models for Dataset Balancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the implementation of large Quantum Restricted Boltzmann Machines (QRBMs), a key advancement in Quantum Machine Learning (QML), as generative models on D-Wave's Pegasus quantum hardware to address dataset imbalance in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). By leveraging Pegasus's enhanced connectivity and computational capabilities, a QRBM with 120 visible and 120 hidden units was successfully embedded, surpassing the limitations of default embedding tools. The QRBM synthesized over 1.6 million attack samples, achieving a balanced dataset of over 4.2 million records. Comparative evaluations with traditional balancing methods, such as SMOTE and RandomOversampler, revealed that QRBMs produced higher-quality synthetic samples, significantly improving detection rates, precision, recall, and F1 score across diverse classifiers. The study underscores the scalability and efficiency of QRBMs, completing balancing tasks in milliseconds. These findings highlight the transformative potential of QML and QRBMs as next-generation tools in data preprocessing, offering robust solutions for complex computational challenges in modern information systems.</description>

      <title>Is In-Context Universality Enough? MLPs are Also Universal In-Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of transformers is often linked to their ability to perform in-context learning. Recent work shows that transformers are universal in context, capable of approximating any real-valued continuous function of a context (a probability measure over $\mathcal{X}\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$) and a query $x\in \mathcal{X}$. This raises the question: Does in-context universality explain their advantage over classical models? We answer this in the negative by proving that MLPs with trainable activation functions are also universal in-context. This suggests the transformer's success is likely due to other factors like inductive bias or training stability.</description>

      <title>FSTA-SNN:Frequency-based Spatial-Temporal Attention Module for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are emerging as a promising alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to their inherent energy efficiency. Owing to the inherent sparsity in spike generation within SNNs, the in-depth analysis and optimization of intermediate output spikes are often neglected. This oversight significantly restricts the inherent energy efficiency of SNNs and diminishes their advantages in spatiotemporal feature extraction, resulting in a lack of accuracy and unnecessary energy expenditure. In this work, we analyze the inherent spiking characteristics of SNNs from both temporal and spatial perspectives. In terms of spatial analysis, we find that shallow layers tend to focus on learning vertical variations, while deeper layers gradually learn horizontal variations of features. Regarding temporal analysis, we observe that there is not a significant difference in feature learning across different time steps. This suggests that increasing the time steps has limited effect on feature learning. Based on the insights derived from these analyses, we propose a Frequency-based Spatial-Temporal Attention (FSTA) module to enhance feature learning in SNNs. This module aims to improve the feature learning capabilities by suppressing redundant spike features.The experimental results indicate that the introduction of the FSTA module significantly reduces the spike firing rate of SNNs, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across multiple datasets.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent with Decoupled Backpropagation and Layer-Wise Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing size of deep learning models has made distributed training across multiple devices essential. However, current methods such as distributed data-parallel training suffer from large communication and synchronization overheads when training across devices, leading to longer training times as a result of suboptimal hardware utilization. Asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) methods can improve training speed, but are sensitive to delays due to both communication and differences throughput. Moreover, the backpropagation algorithm used within ASGD workers is bottlenecked by the interlocking between its forward and backward passes. Current methods also do not take advantage of the large differences in the computation required for the forward and backward passes. Therefore, we propose an extension to ASGD called Partial Decoupled ASGD (PD-ASGD) that addresses these issues. PD-ASGD uses separate threads for the forward and backward passes, decoupling the updates and allowing for a higher ratio of forward to backward threads than the usual 1:1 ratio, leading to higher throughput. PD-ASGD also performs layer-wise (partial) model updates concurrently across multiple threads. This reduces parameter staleness and consequently improves robustness to delays. Our approach yields close to state-of-the-art results while running up to $5.95\times$ faster than synchronous data parallelism in the presence of delays, and up to $2.14\times$ times faster than comparable ASGD algorithms by achieving higher model flops utilization. We mathematically describe the gradient bias introduced by our method, establish an upper bound, and prove convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to improving Genetic Algorithms (GA) in large or complex problem spaces by incorporating new chromosome patterns in the breeding process through border trade activities. These strategies increase chromosome diversity, preventing premature convergence and enhancing the GA's ability to explore the solution space more effectively. Empirical evidence demonstrates significant improvements in convergence behavior. This approach offers a promising pathway to addressing challenges in optimizing large or complex problem domains.</description>

      <title>Comply: Learning Sentences with Complex Weights inspired by Fruit Fly Olfaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biologically inspired neural networks offer alternative avenues to model data distributions. FlyVec is a recent example that draws inspiration from the fruit fly's olfactory circuit to tackle the task of learning word embeddings. Surprisingly, this model performs competitively even against deep learning approaches specifically designed to encode text, and it does so with the highest degree of computational efficiency. We pose the question of whether this performance can be improved further. For this, we introduce Comply. By incorporating positional information through complex weights, we enable a single-layer neural network to learn sequence representations. Our experiments show that Comply not only supersedes FlyVec but also performs on par with significantly larger state-of-the-art models. We achieve this without additional parameters. Comply yields sparse contextual representations of sentences that can be interpreted explicitly from the neuron weights.</description>
