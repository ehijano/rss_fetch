      <title>Lie symmetries and ghost-free representations of the Pais-Uhlenbeck model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Pais-Uhlenbeck (PU) model, a paradigmatic example of a higher time-derivative theory, by identifying the Lie symmetries of its associated fourth-order dynamical equation. Exploiting these symmetries in conjunction with the model's Bi-Hamiltonian structure, we construct distinct Poisson bracket formulations that preserve the system's dynamics. Amongst other possibilities, this allow us to recast the PU model in a positive definite manner, offering a solution to the long-standing problem of ghost instabilities. Furthermore, we systematically explore a family of transformations that reduce the PU model to equivalent first-order, higher-dimensional systems. Finally we examine the impact on those transformations by adding interaction terms of potential form to the PU model and demonstrate how they usually break the Bi-Hamiltonian structure. Our approach yields a unified framework for interpreting and stabilising higher time-derivative dynamics through a symmetry analysis in some parameter regime.</description>

      <title>$C^\ast$-categorical prefactorization algebras for superselection sectors and topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a conceptual and efficient geometric framework to encode the algebraic structures on the category of superselection sectors of an algebraic quantum field theory on the $n$-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$. It is shown that, under certain assumptions which are implied by Haag duality, the monoidal $C^\ast$-categories of localized superselection sectors carry the structure of a locally constant prefactorization algebra over the category of cone-shaped subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^n$. Employing techniques from higher algebra, one extracts from this datum an underlying locally constant prefactorization algebra defined on open disks in the cylinder $\mathbb{R}^1\times\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$. While the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ arises geometrically as the angular coordinates of cones, the origin of the line $\mathbb{R}^1$ is analytic and rooted in Haag duality. The usual braided (for $n=2$) or symmetric (for $n\geq 3$) monoidal $C^\ast$-categories of superselection sectors are recovered by removing a point of the sphere $\mathbb{R}^1\times(\mathbb{S}^{n-1}\setminus\mathrm{pt}) \cong\mathbb{R}^n$ and using the equivalence between $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras and locally constant prefactorization algebras defined on open disks in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The non-trivial homotopy groups of spheres induce additional algebraic structures on these $\mathbb{E}_n$-monoidal $C^\ast$-categories, which in the case of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is given by a braided monoidal self-equivalence arising geometrically as a kind of `holonomy' around the circle $\mathbb{S}^1$. The locally constant prefactorization algebra structures discovered in this work generalize, under some mild geometric conditions, to other discrete spaces and thereby provide a clear link between the geometry of the localization regions and the algebraic structures on the category of superselection sectors.</description>

      <title>Weak coupling limit for quantum systems with unbounded weakly commuting system operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is devoted to a rigorous analysis of the weak coupling limit (WCL) for the reduced dynamics of an open infinite-dimensional quantum system interacting with electromagnetic field or a reservoir formed by Fermi or Bose particles in the dipole approximation. The free system Hamiltonian and the system part of the Hamiltonian describing interaction with the reservoir are considered as unbounded operators with continuous spectrum which are commuting in a weak sense. We derive in the weak coupling limit the reservoir statistics, which is determined by whose terms in the multi-point correlation functions of the reservoir which are non-zero in the WCL. Then we prove that the resulting reduced system dynamics converges to unitary dynamics (such behavior sometimes called as Quantum Cheshire Cat effect) with a modified Hamiltonian which can be interpreted as a Lamb shift to the original Hamiltonian. We obtain exact form of the modified Hamiltonian and estimate the rate of convergence to the limiting dynamics. For Fermi reservoir, we prove the convergence of the full Dyson series. For Bose case the convergence is understood term by term.</description>

      <title>Interaction anomalies and one-particle dynamics in very special relativity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that relativistic invariance introduce strong constraints in the interactions of classical particles. We generalize the non-interaction theorems for Lorentz violating systems which still preserve a subgroup of Poincar\'e symmetry. In particular we analize the case of very special relativity introduced by Cohen and Glashow. We also extend the analysis for Galilei invariant multiparticle systems and for some anisotropic systems which are still invariant under some maximal subgroups of Galilei group.</description>

      <title>Fermion Doubling in Quantum Cellular Automaton Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA) is essentially an operator driving the evolution of particles on a lattice, through local unitaries. Because $\Delta_x=\Delta_t=\varepsilon$, QCA constitute a privileged framework to cast the digital quantum simulation of relativistic quantum particles, e.g. $(3+1)$-QED. But before they can be adopted, simulation schemes for high energy physics need prove themselves against specific numerical issues -- of which the most infamous in Fermion Doubling (FD). FD is well-understood in the discrete-space continuous-time setting of Lattice Gauge Theories as the appearance of spurious solutions for all $\Delta_x=\varepsilon\neq 0$. We rigorously extend its analysis to discrete-space discrete-time. We demonstrate the existence of FD issues in QCA. By applying a covering map on the Brillouin zone, we provide a flavouring-without-staggering way of fixing FD that does not break linearity nor the chiral symmetry. We explain how this method coexists with Nielsen-Ninomiya no-go theorem, and illustrate this with a neutrino-like QCA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantitative relationship between operator spreading and classical information propagation in quantum systems. Focusing on a bi-partite quantum channel, we derive new upper and lower bounds on the Holevo capacity, a typical information measure, in terms of the trace norm distance between output states, sharpening earlier results by Bravyi \textit{et al}. Our results clarify the extent to which operator growth governs information flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a functional calculus which allows one to apply functions to the matrix anti-commutator/commutator operator. The calculus is introduced in a straightforward manner if the operators are acting on symmetric matrices, and it leads to a coordinate-free version of Dalecki\u{\i}--Kre\u{\i}n formula. In this sense the proposed calculus provides symbolic formulae for the derivatives of matrix valued functions which are explicit and easy to use. We discuss several applications of the newly introduced calculus in continuum mechanics (viscoelastic fluids, hypoelasticity) and in theory of partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Singular Damped Twist Waves in Chromonic Liquid Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chromonics are special classes of nematic liquid crystals, for which a quartic elastic theory seems to be more appropriate than the classical quadratic Oseen-Frank theory. The relaxation dynamics of twist director profiles are known to develop a shock wave in finite time in the inviscid case, where dissipation is neglected. This paper studies the dissipative case. We give a sufficient criterion for the formation of shocks in the presence of dissipation and we estimate the critical time at which these singularities develop. Both criterion and estimate depend on the initial director profile. We put our theory to the test on a class of initial kink profiles and we show how accurate our estimates are by comparing them to the outcomes of numerical solutions.</description>

Abstract: We construct two rainbow tensor models with multi-tensors of rank-$3$ and present their $W$-representations. We give the formula of counting number of independent gauge-invariant operators in terms of Hurwitz numbers and establish a one-to-one correspondence between connected operators and colored Dessins. By means of the colored Dessins and $W$-representations, respectively, we derive two compact expressions of correlators for each of rainbow tensor models. Furthermore, two complex multi-matrix models from the degradations of the constructed rainbow tensor models are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing the Universe's Topology through a Quantum System?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global topology of the Universe could, in principle, affect quantum systems through boundary condition constraints. We investigate this connection by analyzing how compact, flat, cosmologically inspired topologies, specifically the $3-$Torus ($E_1$) and half turn space ($E_2$), influence the energy eigenvalues of a quantum particle in the bound state of a 3D Dirac delta potential. Using rigorous renormalization techniques, we derive the equations satisfied by the energy eigenvalues in each topology and develop a systematic method to compute spectral shifts. Our results reveal that each topology induces characteristic deviations in the energy spectrum. In the large$-L$ limit ($L &gt;&gt; g_R$), to leading order, the energy eigenvalues for both the $E_1$ and $E_2$ spaces can be written in the unified form $E\simeq -\frac{\hbar^2}{2mg_R^2}(1 + C_\Gamma\,\frac{2g_R}{L}\,e^{-L/g_R})$, where the topology dependent coefficient is $C_\Gamma = 6$ for the $E_1$ space and $C_\Gamma = 4$ for the $E_2$ space, $g_R$ is the characteristic length scale of the quantum system, and $L$ is the side physical length of the fundamental cubic region. Using the three dimensional Dirac potential as a toy model, we show that at the current cosmic epoch ($a=1$), these topological effects are exponentially suppressed, rendering direct observation infeasible. However, such effects may become measurable in the early Universe, when the physical size of the particle horizon is comparable to the characteristic scale of the quantum system. While immediate experimental verification remains impractical, our work offers theoretical insight into how global cosmic topology might manifest in quantum bound states and may inform future studies of early Universe quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Plastic deformation as a phase transition: a combinatorial model of plastic flow in copper single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuum models of plasticity fail to capture the richness of microstructural evolution because the continuum is a homogeneous construction. The present study shows that an alternative way is available at the mesoscale in the form of truly discrete constructions and in the discrete exterior calculus. A pre-existing continuum mean-field model with two parameters is rewritten in the language of the latter to model the properties of a network of plastic slip events in a perfect copper single crystal under uniaxial tension. The behaviour of the system is simulated in a triangular 2D mesh in 3D space employing a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Phases of distinct character emerge and both first-order and second-order phase transitions are observed. The phases can be interpreted as representing crystallographic phenomena like cross-slip, strain localisation and partial dislocations. The first-order transitions mostly occur as functions of the applied stress, while the second-order transitions occur exclusively as functions of the mean-field coupling parameter. The former are reminiscent of transitions in other statistical-mechanical models, while the latter find parallels in experimental observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A matrix formalism is proposed for computations based on Picard--Lefschetz theory in a 2D case. The formalism is essentially equivalent to the computation of the intersection indices necessary for the Picard--Lefschetz formula and enables one to prove non-trivial topological identities for integrals depending on parameters. We introduce the universal Riemannian domain $\tilde U$, i.e.\ a sort of ``compactification'' of the universal covering space $\tilde U_2$ over a small tubular neighborhood $N\mathbb{R}^2$ of $\mathbb{R}^2\backslash\sigma$ in $\mathbb{B} \setminus \sigma$, where $\mathbb{B}\subset\mathbb{C}^2$ is a big ball, and $\sigma$ is a one-dimensional complex analytic set (the set of singularities). We compute the Picard-Lefschetz monodromy of the relative homology group of the space $\tilde U$ modulo the singularities and the boundary for the standard local degenerations of type $P_1 ,P_2,P_3$ in F.~Pham's [1] notations and for more complicated configurations in~$\mathbb{C}^2$. As coefficients for the homology group, we take the group ring of the $\pi_1((N\mathbb{R}^2 \cap \mathbb{B})\backslash\sigma)$ over $\mathbb{Z}$. The results of the computations are presented in the form of a matrix of the monodromy operator calculated in a certain natural basis. We prove an ``inflation'' theorem, which states that the integration surfaces of interest (i.e.\ the elements of the homology group $H_2(\tilde U_2,\tilde{\partial \mathbb{B}})$) (the surfaces in the branched space possibly passing through singularities) are injectively mapped to the group $H_2(\tilde U,\tilde U'\cup\tilde{\partial \mathbb{B}})$ (the surfaces avoiding the singularities). The matrix formalism obtained describes the behavior of integrals depending on parameters and can be applied to the study Wiener-Hopf method in two complex variables.</description>

      <title>Degree of freedom count in linear gauge invariant PDE systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider not necessarily Lagrangian partial linear differential equations (PDE) with constant coefficients. Einstein proposed a definition of the"strength" of such a field theory that defines its degree of freedom (DoF). Einsteinian strength is based on the asymptotic number of free Taylor series coefficients of bounded degree in the general solution of the PDE system. The direct count of DoF in this way is a complex and technically demanding process. Proceeding from Einsteinian strength of equations and making use of commutative algebra tools, we deduce another DoF count recipe which is formulated in terms of orders of the field equations, their gauge symmetries and gauge identities. This DoF count recipe covers the case of reducible gauge field theories, and it is easy to use. We begin with interpreting the matrix of the system as a linear map between polynomial modules. First, proceeding from Einsteinian definition, we derive an explicit formula for DoF as the multiplicity of a certain extension module. Second, we prove another explicit formula for DoF in terms of orders of equations and gauge generators. A notable consequence of this formula is that two Hermitian conjugate systems have identical DoF. Every classical field theory defines the BRST complex which has the natural grading known as the ghost number. We equip this complex with another grading, which we call differential order. This grading is 1 for every space time-derivative, while all thefields, ghosts, and antifields are assigned with this degree in a certain way, depending on their ghost number and the orders of equations and gauge generators. We compute the Euler characteristic of the BRST complex with respect to this new grading. This provides homological interpretation of DoF for linear gauge system as minus the residue at infinity of the logarithmic derivative of the Euler characteristics for its BRST complex.</description>

      <title>Scalar products and norm of Bethe vectors in $\mathfrak{o}_{2n+1}$ invariant integrable models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute scalar products of off-shell Bethe vectors in models with $o_{2n+1}$ symmetry. The scalar products are expressed as a sum over partitions of the Bethe parameter sets, the building blocks being the so-called highest coefficients. We prove some recurrence relations and a residue theorem for these highest coefficients, and prove that they are consistent with the reduction to $gl_n$ invariant models. We also express the norm of on-shell Bethe vectors as a Gaudin determinant.</description>

      <title>Resource-Dependent Complexity of Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11304v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework for quantifying the complexity of quantum channels, grounded in a suitably chosen resource set. This class of convex functions is designed to analyze the complexity of both open and closed quantum systems. By leveraging Lipschitz norms inspired by quantum optimal transport theory, we rigorously establish the fundamental properties of this complexity measure. The flexibility in selecting the resource set allows us to derive effective lower bounds for gate complexities and simulation costs of both Hamiltonian simulations and dynamics of open quantum systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that this complexity measure exhibits linear growth for random quantum circuits and finite-dimensional quantum simulations, up to the Brown-Susskind threshold.</description>

      <title>2d Sigma Models on Non-compact Calabi-Yau and ${\mathcal N}=2$ Liouville Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of two dimensional conformal ${\mathcal N}=2$ supersymmetric $U(1)$ gauge linear sigma models with $N$ fields of charges $+1$ and $N$ fields of charges $-1$, whose Higgs branches are non-compact toric Calabi-Yau manifolds of complex dimension $2N-1$. We show, starting from large-$N$ approximation, that the Coulomb branch of these models, which opens up at strong coupling, is described by ${\mathcal N}=2$ Liouville theory and then extrapolate it to exact equivalence demanding the central charge of the Liouville theory to be $\hat{c}=2N-1$. Next we concentrate on mostly physically attractive $N=2$ and $N \geq 3$ cases and find there a perfect agreement of the set of complex moduli on the Calabi-Yau side with the marginal deformations in ${\mathcal N}=2$ Liouville theory, supporting proposed exact equivalence.</description>

      <title>Operator-state correspondence in simple current extended conformal field theories: Toward a general understanding of chiral conformal field theories and topological orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15621v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the operator-state correspondence in the Majorana conformal field theory (CFT) with emphasis on its semion representation. Whereas the semion representation (or $Z_{2}$ extension of the chiral Ising CFT) gives a concise ``abelian" (or invertible) representation in the level of fusion rule and quantum states, there exists subtlety when considering the chiral multipoint correlation function. In this sense, the operator-state correspondence in the semion sector of the fermionic theory inevitably contains difficulty coming from its anomalous conformal dimension $1/16$ as a $Z_{2}$ symmetry operator. By analyzing the asymptotic behaviors of the existing correlation functions, we propose a nontrivial correspondence between the chiral conformal blocks and bulk correlation functions containing both order and disorder fields. One can generalize this understanding to $Z_{N}$ models or fractional supersymmetric models (in which there exist long-standing open problems). We expect this may improve our understanding of the simple current extension of CFT which can appear commonly in the studies of topologically ordered systems.</description>

      <title>Dissipation driven phase transition in the non-Hermitian Kondo model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians capture several aspects of open quantum systems, such as dissipation of energy and non-unitary evolution. An example is an optical lattice where the inelastic scattering between the two orbital mobile atoms in their ground state and the atom in a metastable excited state trapped at a particular site and acting as an impurity, results in the two body losses. It was shown in \cite{nakagawa2018non} that this effect is captured by the non-Hermitian Kondo model. which was shown to exhibit two phases depending on the strength of losses. When the losses are weak, the system exhibits the Kondo phase and when the losses are stronger, the system was shown to exhibit the unscreened phase where the Kondo effect ceases to exist, and the impurity is left unscreened. We re-examined this model using the Bethe Ansatz and found that in addition to the above two phases, the system exhibits a novel $\widetilde{YSR}$ phase which is present between the Kondo and the unscreened phases. The model is characterized by two renormalization group invariants, a generalized Kondo temperature $T_K$ and a parameter `$\alpha$' that measures the strength of the loss. The Kondo phase occurs when the losses are weak which corresponds to $0&lt;\alpha&lt;\pi/2$. As $\alpha$ approaches $\pi/2$, the Kondo cloud shrinks resulting in the formation of a single particle bound state which screens the impurity in the ground state between $\pi/2&lt;\alpha&lt;\pi$. As $\alpha$ increases, the impurity is unscreened in the ground state but can be screened by the localized bound state for $\pi&lt;\alpha&lt;3\pi/2$. When $\alpha&gt;3\pi/2$, one enters the unscreened phase where the impurity cannot be screened. We argue that in addition to the energetics, the system displays different time scales associated with the losses across $\alpha=\pi/2$, resulting in a phase transition driven by the dissipation in the system.</description>

      <title>Conformally related vacuum gravitational waves, and their symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02230v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A special conformal transformation which carries a vacuum gravitational wave into another vacuum one is built by using M\"obius-redefined time. It can either transform a globally defined vacuum wave into a vacuum sandwich wave, or carry the gravitational wave into itself. The first type, illustrated by linearly and circularly polarized vacuum plane gravitational waves, permutes the symmetries and the geodesics. Our pp waves with conformal O(2,1) symmetry of the second type, which seem to ahve escaped attention so far, are anisotropic generalizations of the familiar inverse-square profile. An example inspired by molecular physics, for which the particle can escape, or perform periodic motion, or fall into the singularity is studied in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12928v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particles initially at rest hit by a passing sandwich gravitational wave exhibit, in general, thevelocity memory effect (VM): they fly apart with constant velocity. For specific values of the wave parameters their motion can however become pure displacement (DM) as suggested by Zel'dovich and Polnarev. For such a ``miraculous'' value, the particle trajectory is composed of an integer number of (approximate) standing half-waves. Our statements are illustrated numerically by a Gaussian, and analytically by the P\"oschl-Teller profiles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a volume preserving curvature evolution of surfaces in an asymptotically Euclidean initial data set with positive ADM-energy. The speed is given by a nonlinear function of the mean curvature which generalizes the spacetime mean curvature recently considered by Cederbaum-Sakovich (Calc. Var. PDE, 2021). Following a classical approach by Huisken-Yau (Invent. Math., 1996), we show that the flow starting from suitably round initial surfaces exists for all times and converges to a constant (spacetime) curvature limit. This provides an alternative construction of the CSTMC foliation by Cederbaum-Sakovich and has applications in the definition of center of mass of an isolated system in General Relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membrane configurations in the Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind matrix model are unstable due to the existence of flat directions in the potential and the decay process can be seen as a realization of chaotic scattering. In this note, we compute the lifetime of a membrane in a reduced model. The resulting lifetime exhibits scaling laws with respect to energy, coupling constant and a cut-off scale. We numerically evaluate the scaling exponents, which cannot be fixed by the dimensional analysis. Finally, some applications of the results are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new gauging of maximal supergravity in five spacetime dimensions with gauge group containing ISO(5), involving the local scaling symmetry of the metric, and admitting a supersymmetric anti-de Sitter vacuum. We show this maximal supergravity to arise by consistent truncation of M-theory on the (non-spherical, non-parallelisable) six-dimensional geometry associated to a stack of $N$ M5-branes wrapped on a smooth Riemann surface. The existence of this truncation allows us to holographically determine the complete, universal spectrum of light operators of the dual four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory of class $\mathcal{S}$. We then compute holographically the superconformal index of the dual field theory at large-$N$, finding perfect agreement with previously known field theory results in specific limits.</description>

      <title>Edge modes and boundary impurities in the anisotropic Heisenberg spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of boundary phenomena in a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain (XXZ-$\frac{1}{2}$) in the gapped antiferromagnetic phase, with a particular focus on the interplay between fractionalized spin-$\frac{1}{4} $ edge modes and a coupled spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity at the edge. Employing a combination of Bethe Ansatz, exact diagonalization, and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods, we explore the intricate phase diagram that emerges when the impurity is coupled either integrably or non-integrably to the chain. For integrable antiferromagnetic impurity couplings, we identify two distinct phases: the Kondo phase, where the impurity is screened by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and the antiferromagnetic bound mode phase, where an exponentially localized bound state screens the impurity in the ground state. When coupled ferromagnetically while maintaining integrability, the impurity behaves as a free spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, leading to either a ferromagnetic bound mode phase, where the impurity remains free in the ground state but may be screened at higher energy excitations or an unscreened (or local moment) phase where impurity remains unscreened in every eigenstate whereas for non-integrable ferromagnetic coupling, the impurity is not free. In the case of non-integrable antiferromagnetic coupling, a third phase emerges, characterized by mid-gap excitations with two degenerate states below the mass gap on top of the Kondo and antiferromagnetic bound mode phases, further enriching the phase diagram. Our findings highlight the nuanced behavior of boundary impurities in gapped antiferromagnetic systems, offering new insights into Kondo effects and impurity screening in the presence of fractionalized edge modes and bulk antiferromagnetic order.</description>

Abstract: Ehlers and Kundt [1] argued in favor of the velocity effect: particles initally at rest hit by a burst of gravitational waves should fly apart with constant velocity after the wave has passed. Zel'dovich and Polnarev [2] suggested instead that waves generated by flyby would be merely displaced. Their prediction is confirmed provided the wave parameters take some particular values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the operator formulation of classical mechanics by explicitly applying it to two central potentials in 2 dimensions. After constructing the classical Hamiltonian operators and corresponding Schr\"odinger like equations, we solve for the corresponding classical wave functions associated with these two potentials, viz; Kepler and harmonic potentials. While satisfying continuity equations, these classical wave functions are shown to be renormalizable only in a finite region of the 2D plane. We also derive the well-known equivalence between these two models within the operator formulation of classical mechanics. This equivalence is shown by relating the Schr\"odinger-like equations and corresponding classical wave functions of these two systems, using the Levi-Civita map and a reparametrizaton of time(Sundman map).</description>

      <title>On the Lyapunov exponent for the random field Ising transfer matrix, in the critical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the top Lyapunov exponent of a product of random $2 \times 2$ matrices appearing in the analysis of several statistical mechanical models with disorder, extending a previous treatment of the critical case (Giacomin and Greenblatt, ALEA 19 (2022), 701-728) by significantly weakening the assumptions on the disorder distribution. The argument we give completely revisits and improves the previous proof. As a key novelty we build a probability that is close to the Furstenberg probability, i.e. the invariant probability of the Markov chain corresponding to the evolution of the direction of a vector in ${\mathbb R}^2$ under the action of the random matrices, in terms of the ladder times of a centered random walk which is directly related to the random matrix sequence. We then show that sharp estimates on the ladder times (renewal) process lead to a sharp control on the probability measure we build and, in turn, to the control of its distance from the Furstenberg probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider isotropic and Lagrangian embeddings of coadjoint orbits of compact Lie groups into products of coadjoint orbits. After reviewing the known facts in the case of $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ we initiate a similar study for $\mathrm{SO}$ and $\mathrm{Sp}$ cases. In the second part we apply this to the study of dynamical systems with $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ symmetry, proving equivalence between systems of two types: those describing magnetic geodesic flow on flag manifolds and classical `spin chains' of a special type.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of probability measures associated with stochastic dynamical systems featuring either globally contracting or $B_{r}$-contracting drift terms. While classical results often assume constant diffusion and gradient-based drifts, we extend the analysis to spatially inhomogeneous diffusion and non-integrable vector fields. We establish sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of stationary measures under global contraction, showing that convergence is preserved when the contraction rate dominates diffusion inhomogeneity. For systems contracting only outside of a compact set and with constant diffusion, we demonstrate mass concentration near the minima of an associated non-convex potential, like in multistable regimes. The theoretical findings are illustrated through Hopfield networks, highlighting implications for memory retrieval dynamics in noisy environments.</description>
