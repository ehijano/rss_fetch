      <title>Resonant Landau-Zener Conversion In Multi-Axion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple axions may emerge in the low-energy effective theory of Nature. Generically, the potentials describing these axion fields are non-diagonal, leading to mass mixing between axion states which can be temperature-dependent due to QCD instanton effects. As the temperature of the Universe drops, level crossing can occur, causing resonant conversion between axion states. In this work, we present an analytic study of the cosmological evolution of multi-axion systems including adiabatic and non-adiabatic resonant conversion from one axion state into another during the misalignment process. We show how the Landau-Zener formalism accurately captures the non-adiabatic resonant conversion, permitting an analytic description of the relic abundances of each axion field for nearly any arbitrary two-state axion mass matrix. As an application, we study the mixing of a QCD axion with an axion-like-particle for specific potentials to identify the predictions for haloscope experiments. We conclude that the detection of an axion off the expected QCD mass-coupling line predicts other haloscope targets if it mixes with the QCD axion.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Unfolding in Large Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose new methodologies in multi-dimensional unfolding in dense environments, and show that incorporating auxiliary observables can significantly improve performance. Our approach builds on the ML-based OmniFold algorithm, which we extend to account for background, detector acceptance, efficiency, and uncertainties, enabling its application in high-luminosity and heavy-ion collision settings. We derive this algorithm and demonstrate its mathematical and numerical equivalence to expectation-maximization and Iterative Bayesian Unfolding (IBU). We illustrate our method with a realistic jet substructure analysis incorporating both large background and detector simulation. Our analysis includes up to 18 observables, leading to significantly improved performance in the unfolding. We propose a method that integrates calibration and unfolding into a single, consistent framework, and demonstrate enhanced performance relative to traditional methods. These developments lay the groundwork for robust, high-dimensional, ML-based unfolding and calibration in complex collider environments across a wide range of analyses.</description>

      <title>Positivity bounds in scalar-QED EFT at one-loop level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the implication of positivity bounds on loop-generated dim-8 operator coefficients is a nontrivial task, as these bounds only strictly hold when all the contributions are included in the dispersion relation up to a certain loop order in the UV theory. As a step towards more realistic gauge theories such as the Standard Model, in this paper we study the positivity bounds in the Scalar QED Effective Field Theory (EFT) from the scalar-photon scattering ($\gamma\phi \to \gamma\phi$) and the photon-photon scattering ($\gamma\gamma \to \gamma\gamma$), derived from the dispersion relation of the full one-loop EFT amplitudes. Assuming the UV theory is weakly coupled and all heavy particles have spin $\leq1$, the leading dim-8 interaction for both amplitudes are generated at the one-loop level in the UV theory. Gauge invariance imposes strong constraints on the loop structures, while potential IR divergences also require careful treatments. Our findings reveal that, for $\gamma\phi \to \gamma\phi$, while the tree-level bound does not necessarily hold, the one-loop $\beta$-function of the corresponding coefficient always tends to restore the tree-level bound, unless its actual loop order in the UV theory is further suppressed. For $\gamma\gamma \to \gamma\gamma$, on the other hand, the tree-level positivity bound is still robust at the one-loop level in the UV theory. These findings are verified in two example UV models with a heavy scalar extension. Importantly, the bounds on the $\beta$-functions that we obtain should be considered as an accidental feature at one loop, rather than a fundamental property of the theory.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Electron EDM in the NMSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) with explicit CP violation offers a promising framework for explaining the observed baryon asymmetry while remaining consistent with stringent electric dipole moment (EDM) bounds. In this work, we identify a previously overlooked set of two-loop diagrams that contribute to fermion EDMs in the NMSSM. Our analysis of the electron EDM shows that, for certain NMSSM specific CP-violating phases, these diagrams partially cancel existing contributions, thereby relaxing the associated constraints. In other phases, the diagrams dominate and tighten the bounds, which in turn necessitates more finely tuned parameters to reconcile successful baryogenesis with current EDM limits.</description>

      <title>A fresh look at the nuclear transparency using the generalized parton distributions (GPDs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color transparency (CT) is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) where hadrons produced in high-energy exclusive processes traverse nuclear matter with minimal interactions. Nuclear transparency, which quantifies this attenuation suppression, is a quantity with high sensitivity to CT effects and provides critical insights into QCD dynamics in nuclear environments. In this study, we revisit nuclear transparency using the framework of generalized parton distributions (GPDs). By constructing nuclear GPDs (nGPDs) through the incorporation of nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs), we calculate the nuclear transparency $ T(Q^2)$ for the carbon nucleus as a function of momentum transfer $ Q^2 $ considering various definitions and compare the results obtained with available experimental data. Our finding highlights the importance of choosing a physically motivated definition of nuclear transparency. Moreover, we emphasize that a more reliable determination of nGPDs requires a dedicated global analysis incorporating nuclear data. Such an approach is essential for improving the theoretical understanding of CT and for achieving consistency with experimental observations in the high-$ Q^2$ regime.</description>

      <title>Grand-unification Theory Atlas: Standard Model and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under a reasonable set of ab-initio assumptions, we define and chart the atlas of simple gauge theories with families of fermions whose masses are forbidden by gauge invariance. We propose a compass to navigate the atlas based on counting degrees of freedom. When searching for Grand-unification Theories with three matter generations, the free energy singles out the SU(5) Georgi-Glashow model as the minimal one, closely followed by SO(10) with spinorial matter. The atlas also defines the dryland of grand-unifiable gauge extensions of the standard model. We further provide examples relevant for gauge dual completions of the standard model as well as extensions by an additional SU(N) gauge symmetry.</description>

      <title>Cherenkov radiation in isotropic chiral matter: the space-frequency domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electromagnetic response of isotropic chiral matter, as described by Carroll-Field-Jackiw electrodynamics, arises in distinct physical contexts ranging from condensed matter systems to Lorentz-violating extensions of high-energy physics. Here, we derive exact expressions for the circularly polarized electromagnetic fields that contribute independently to Cherenkov radiation in isotropic chiral matter. Each spectral energy distribution is gauge-invariant and positive, yielding radiation that emerges at a characteristic angle, akin to the standard case. Furthermore, we identify specific frequency ranges that permit zero, one, or two Cherenkov cones for a given setup. Remarkably, one sector of the model allows for the existence of threshold-free Cherenkov radiation arising from slowly-moving charges.</description>

      <title>Experiments to test the hypothesis for solar and dark matter axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a pedagogical introduction to the direct search of axions as dark matter, as well as to searches for solar axions. The plethora of experimental searches exploit the axion's coupling to two photons: They attempt to convert the axion dark matter to photons in a resonator placed in an external magnetic field or convert solar axions into X-rays in a magnet pointing towards the sun. We give a basic introduction to this concept, its many variants and to searches that exploit the axion's other couplings. We also speculate about potentially transformative developments for such searches in the near-term future.</description>

      <title>Dark Walker in the Early Universe: A Strongly Coupled Sector Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the phenomenology of the ``Dark Walker'' -- an $\text{SU}(3)$ theory with eight flavors of fundamental fermions in the dark sector. During inflation, its walking dynamics generate primordial non-Gaussianities through the exchange of unparticles, while accounting for the current dark matter relic abundance if the resulting massive pseudoscalars behave as strongly interacting massive particles (SIMPs). This provides a simple yet concrete example of a strongly coupled sector during inflation.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry breaking and pion condensation in the early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the possible trajectories the universe may have followed in the QCD phase diagram during the QCD epoch. We focus on the roles of chiral symmetry breaking and pion condensation under high imbalances in lepton asymmetry. Adopting the quark-meson model as an effective description of QCD at finite temperature, charge and baryon chemical potentials we show that, for sufficiently large but physically motivated asymmetries, the universe may have entered the pion condensation phase through a first-order phase transition, followed by a second-order phase transition when exiting it. Such a first-order phase transition represents a new possible source of primordial gravitational waves during the QCD epoch.</description>

      <title>Electroweak splitting functions in the Standard Model and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive quasi-collinear factorization formulas in generic spontaneously broken gauge theories with scalars, fermions, and vector bosons. Specifically, we obtain polarized leading-order splitting functions for all possible final-state and initial-state 1-&gt;2 processes in the considered gauge theory. The main complication lies in the presence of mass-singular terms in longitudinal polarization vectors, prohibiting the direct application of the usual factorization procedure known from Quantum Electrodynamics and Quantum Chromodynamics. We overcome this issue with two different strategies, using gauge invariance and Ward identities as guiding principle. Our derivations do not use any explicit component-wise parametrizations of momenta and wave functions and bear no reference to a particular Lorentz frame. Furthermore, our results are valid for completely general definitions of the spin reference axes of the individual external particles. The various massless limits, the special case of the Electroweak Standard Model, the reproduction of existing literature results, and symmetry relations among our splitting functions are discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Resonant leptogenesis in inverse see-saw framework with modular $S_4$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a model for lepton mass generation and flavor mixing, realized through a (2,3) inverse seesaw structure within a modular \( S_4 \) symmetry framework. The model employs modular forms to construct the lepton Yukawa couplings, thereby significantly simplifying the model by reducing its complexity. A detailed numerical analysis demonstrates consistency with current neutrino oscillation data, yielding constrained predictions for the mixing angles and CP-violating phases. The Dirac CP phase is sharply localized near \( \delta_{\rm CP} \sim 359^\circ \), and the model predicts an effective Majorana mass \( |m_{ee}| \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3}) \,\text{eV} \), Within the scope of upcoming experiments on neutrinoless double beta decay such as nEXO and AMoRE-II. The model also remains consistent with current bounds on charged lepton flavor violating processes from MEG and BaBar. We further explore resonant leptogenesis enabled by quasi-degenerate heavy neutrino states, and show that observed baryon asymmetry of the universe can be succesfully generated within this framework. The combined treatment of low-energy observables and high-scale baryogenesis demonstrates the predictivity and testability of the modular \( S_4 \)-based ISS(2,3) framework.</description>

      <title>Understanding the low-lying $\Omega_c$ structures from a coupled-channel perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a systematic analysis of the low-lying $\Omega_c$ structures in a coupled-channel approach. The couplings between meson-baryon channels, $\Xi_c \bar K$, $\Xi_c^{\prime} \bar K$, $\Xi_c^{*} \bar K$, $\Omega_c\eta$ and $\Omega_c^{*}\eta$, and three-quark bare states $\Omega_c(1P_\lambda)$ are considered. We predict a bound state $\Omega_c(2954)$ below the $\Xi_c \bar K$ threshold with $(J^P,j)=(1/2^-,0)$, which can be studied in the final states of $\Omega_c^{(*)} \pi$ and $\Omega_c^{(*)} \gamma$. Also, the resonances $\Omega_c(3000)$ and $\Omega_c(3050)$ can be classified as the lower $(J^P,j)=(1/2^-,1)$ and $(J^P,j)=(3/2^-,1)$ states, respectively. Our present assignments based on this couple-channel perspective are significantly different from those of traditional three-quark picture and of molecular scenario. The future BelleII and LHCb experiments can search for the bound state $\Omega_c(2954)$ and measure the spin-parities of particles $\Omega_c(3000)$ and $\Omega_c(3050)$ to test our predictions.</description>

      <title>Two-flavor color superconductivity in a general Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with color and charge neutrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using a general NJL model including as many interaction channels as possible, and taking into account the constraints imposed by color and charge neutrality, we analyze how the different interaction channels contribute to the charge-neutral two-flavor color-superconducting matter. After taking the Fierz transformation, the number of parameters in the NJL model is reduced and thereby quark-antiquark condensates and diquark condensates are related. Through a self-consistent solution of the gap equations, we find that in addition to the diquark and vector channels, the scalar-isovector, vector-isovector, and vector-isovector-color-octet channels are also important, while other channels can be neglected. Moreover, between the normal quark matter phase and two-flavor color-superconducting phase, there is a gapless two-flavor color-superconducting phase. The fractions of quarks with different flavors and colors are calculated in both gaped and gapless two-flavor color-superconducting phases. In addition, We illustrate the phase diagrams in the diquark coupling and chemical potential plane, and discuss in detail how the dominant channels influence these phase diagrams.</description>

      <title>Structure of the $\Omega^{-}(2012)$ with Hamiltonian Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the internal structure of the $\Omega(2012)^-$ by analyzing lattice QCD simulation and experimental data within Hamiltonian effective field theory, considering both $J^P = 1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$ assignments. The couplings to the dominant decay channel $\Xi \bar{K}$ and the near-threshold channel $\Xi(1530) \bar{K}$ are determined through the quark-pair-creation model. By studying the lattice QCD spectra in these two spin-parity scenarios, we extract the masses and widths of the resonances. We notice that the $J^P = 3/2^-$ resonance is consistent with the observed $\Omega(2012)^-$ while the recently reported $\Omega(2109)^-$ may be a $J^P = 1/2^-$ $\Omega$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monopoles have been a subject of much theoretical and experimental research since they were proposed to symmetrize Maxwells equations. However, no experimental signature of their existence has been detected. Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain this lack of success. In here we generalize QED to a two photon theory where the magnetic photon and the monopole belong to dark matter. A naive mixing interaction produces duality and generates experimental consequences for indirect monopole detection via the magnetic charge of the electron.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Einstein-Dilaton Model for Pure Yang-Mills Thermodynamics and Glueball Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a machine learning assisted holographic model that consistently describes both the equation of state and glueball spectrum of pure Yang-Mills theory, achieved through neural network reconstruction of Einstein-dilaton gravity. Our framework incorporates key non-perturbative constraints of lattice QCD data: the ground ($0^{++}$) and first-excited ($0^{++*}$) scalar glueball masses pins down the infrared (IR) geometry, while entropy density data anchors the ultraviolet (UV) behavior of the metric. A multi-stage neural network optimization then yields the full gravitational dual -- warp factor $A(z)$ and dilaton field $\Phi(z)$ -- that satisfies both spectroscopic and thermodynamic constraints. The resulting model accurately reproduces the deconfinement phase transition thermodynamics (pressure, energy density, trace anomaly) and predicts higher glueball excitations ($0^{++**}$, $0^{++***}$) consistent with available lattice calculations. This work establishes a new paradigm for data-driven holographic reconstruction, solving the long-standing challenge of unified description of confinement thermodynamics and spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>A model for baryon production in spin-dependent string fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce spin-1/2 baryons in the string+${}^3P_0$ model of hadronization, previously restricted to the production of pseudoscalar and vector mesons. Baryons are modeled as quark-diquark bound states and baryon production is described by the tunneling of diquark-antidiquark pairs at string breaking points. Diquarks can be scalar or pseudovector, the latter being produced in the relative ${}^5D_0$ state. Introducing the quark-baryon-diquark coupling, the relevant splitting amplitudes for the emission of baryons are constructed and used to explore analytically the model predictions. We find a Collins effect for baryon production in the fragmentations of transversely polarized quarks or diquarks as well as a baryon spontaneous transverse polarization. The hadronic decays of polarized hyperons are also included in the model, which is presented in a form suitable for the implementation in a Monte Carlo event generator.</description>

      <title>From topological amplitudes to rescattering dynamics in charmed baryon decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charmed baryon decays play an important role in studying the weak and strong interactions. Charmed baryon decays decaying into an octet baryon and a pseudoscalar meson have been studied in the framework of rescattering dynamics at the hadron level and topological amplitudes at the quark level. In this work, we investigate the relation between topological amplitudes and rescattering dynamics in the $ B_{c\overline{3}}\to B_8P$ decays. Note that the chiral Lagrangian is constructed using (1,1)-rank octet tensors. The (1,1)-rank amplitudes, which are linear combinations of topological diagrams, are used to match the chiral Lagrangian. Possible meson-meson or meson-baryon coupling configurations are constructed from the (1,1)-rank amplitudes via tensor contractions. The rescattering amplitudes derived from topological amplitudes are consistent with those derived directly from the chiral Lagrangian. Isospin sum rules for all isospin systems in $ B_{c\overline{3}}\to B_8P$ decays are checked in terms of $s$- and $t$-channel rescattering amplitudes. Rescattering amplitudes contributing to quark-loop diagrams are found to be comparable to those contributing to tree diagrams, indicating potential observable $CP$ violation in charmed baryon decays. Furthermore, it is found that the K\"orner-Pati-Woo theorem is not consistent with the rescattering dynamics. The proof of the K\"orner-Pati-Woo theorem is questionable when the color changes of quarks arising from gluons are considered. We suggest precisely measuring the branching fraction of the $\Lambda^+_c\to \Sigma^+K^0_S$ mode on Belle (II) to test the K\"orner-Pati-Woo theorem.</description>

      <title>Inverse Seesaw Model in Non-holomorphic Modular $A_4$ Flavor Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an inverse seesaw model of neutrino masses based on non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry, by extending the framework of modular-invariant flavor models beyond the conventional holomorphic paradigm. After establishing the general theoretical framework, we analyze three concrete model realizations distinguished by their $A_4$ representation assignments and modular weight configurations for the matter fields. Focusing on these three specific realizations, we perform a comprehensive analysis of neutrino phenomenology. By constraining the modulus parameter $\tau$ to the fundamental domain and systematically scanning the parameter space, we identify regions compatible with current neutrino oscillation data. Our numerical results provide predictions for currently unmeasured quantities, including the absolute neutrino mass scale, Dirac CP-violating phase, and Majorana phases. These predictions establish specific, testable signatures for upcoming neutrino experiments, particularly in neutrinoless double beta decay and precision oscillation measurements. The framework offers a well-defined target for future experimental verification or exclusion, while demonstrating the phenomenological viability of non-holomorphic modular symmetry approaches to flavor structure.</description>

      <title>Hidden-Heavy Pentaquarks and Where to Find Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a simple explanation for the observed hidden-charm pentaquarks as bound states in Born-Oppenheimer potentials. We identify $P_{c\bar{c}}(4312)^+$, $P_{c\bar{c}}(4380)^+$, $P_{c\bar{c}}(4440)^+$, and $P_{c\bar{c}}(4457)^+$ as the heavy-quark spin states in a quartet of $c \bar{c}$ pentaquarks with $J^P$ quantum numbers $\frac{1}{2}^-$, $\frac{3}{2}^-$, $\frac{3}{2}^-$, and $\frac{5}{2}^-$. The quantum numbers of $P_{c\bar{c}}(4457)^+$ differ from all previous predictions. We identify $P_{c\bar{c}s}(4338)^0$ and $P_{c\bar{c}s}(4459)^0$ as spin states in a triplet of $c \bar{c}s$ pentaquarks with quantum numbers $\frac{1}{2}^-$, $\frac{1}{2}^-$, and $\frac{3}{2}^-$. We explain why $P_{c\bar{c}}(4380)^+$ is the only observed hidden-charm pentaquark with a large width.</description>

      <title>Cosmological phase transitions without high-temperature expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework for perturbatively computing equilibrium thermodynamic properties of cosmological phase transitions to high loop orders, using the full four-dimensional resummed thermal effective potential and avoiding the limitations of standard high-temperature approximations. By systematically disentangling the physics of hard and soft momentum scales, our approach unifies their treatment within a single expression, enabling consistent handling of both vacuum and thermal divergences across all mass regimes. This core innovation enables the efficient numerical evaluation of massive multiloop thermal sum-integrals, achieved through a finite-temperature generalization of Loop-Tree Duality -- an advanced algorithmic technique originally developed to render vacuum Feynman integrals numerically tractable via Monte Carlo methods. As a proof of principle, we apply the framework to a scalar-Yukawa model, presenting a complete two-loop calculation and a novel three-loop extension -- the first fully massive three-loop sum-integral computation without relying on high-temperature expansions. Our approach opens the door to precise perturbative predictions of the phase structure in a broad class of beyond-the-Standard-Model scenarios, including those featuring strong first-order phase transitions relevant for gravitational-wave signals, where conventional high-temperature approximations break down.</description>

      <title>Resolving the QCD Axion Domain Wall Problem with a Light Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two novel solutions to the domain wall problem of the QCD axion by introducing a massless or light axion that also couples to gluons. The first solution applies when the new axion forms strings after inflation. Due to its mixing with the QCD axion, domain walls of the QCD axion are bounded by these strings and confined into cosmologically safe string bundles. This scenario predicts the existence of such string bundles, which may survive until today and leave observable signatures, such as gravitational waves, cosmic birefringence, and CMB anisotropies. The simultaneous detection of the QCD axion and any of these cosmological signatures would serve as a smoking-gun signal. The second solution assumes a homogeneous initial condition for the new axion. If it is sufficiently light, its potential temporarily induces a bias in the QCD axion potential before the onset of oscillations, rendering the domain walls unstable. In both scenarios, the Peccei-Quinn mechanism remains effective, and the strong CP problem is not reintroduced. We identify the viable parameter regions and discuss the resulting dark matter abundance.</description>

      <title>Testing frozen-in pNGB dark matter with a long-lived dark Higgs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a simple Higgs portal dark matter (DM) model, where the Standard Model is extended with a complex singlet scalar. The imaginary part of the scalar becomes a massive and stable pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson, serving as the DM candidate, while the real part gives rise to a second (dark) Higgs boson. We focus on the freeze-in production of the DM, paying particular attention to low-reheating temperature scenarios, where the dark Higgs can be a long-lived particle (LLP). We also explore the phenomenology of this dark Higgs at the LHC and the Future Circular Collider in hadron-hadron mode, discussing its discovery prospects in regions of parameter space consistent with current DM constraints. Our results emphasize the impact of the cosmic reheating dynamics on the DM freeze-in production and their critical role in interpreting collider signatures. Furthermore, our findings suggest that LLP searches may provide insights into the fundamental dynamics of reheating.</description>

      <title>Effects of Lorentz invariance violation on particle and photon production in astrophysical sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) on radiation processes in astrophysical sources, focusing on synchrotron and inverse Compton interactions. We derive modified expressions for radiated power and photon energy under LIV assumptions and incorporate them into first-order Fermi acceleration models. Our analysis reveals energy thresholds beyond which LIV significantly alters particle dynamics and photon spectra, introducing non-physical divergences that highlight limitations in perturbative approaches. We model synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission in the presence of LIV and assess its consequences for photon fluxes from blazars, including Markarian 501 and the BL Lac population. LIV introduces distinct high-energy emission regions that deviate from standard expectations. Comparisons with observational data, particularly upper limits from the Pierre Auger Observatory, suggest that future multi-messenger observations could constrain LIV parameters through the non-detection of such excesses.</description>

      <title>Measuring cosmic baryon density with FRB and GW data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersion measure (DM) analysis of extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs) has accounted for all cosmic baryons but remains limited by systematic uncertainties from various parameter degeneracies. We show that the prominent degeneracy between the baryon density ($\Omega_{\rm b}$) and the Hubble constant ($H_0$) can be disentangled through an independent $H_0$ value uniquely inferred from the absolute luminosity distance measurements of gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens. By combining $104$ localized FRBs with $47$ GW events, we obtain a robust, late-Universe measurement of \ob $=0.0488\pm0.0064$ ($1\sigma$), in concordance with early-Universe observations of CMB + BBN. Notably, incorporating GW data helps not only avoid biases induced by the $H_0$ tension, but also mitigate those from the parameters of diffuse baryon fraction and DM distribution models. Although the current precision ($\sim 13\%$) is limited by sample size, the growing detections of both FRBs and GWs will make their synergy a powerful probe of low-redshift cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel class of Dark Matter (DM) candidates in the form of a heavy composite Axion-Like Particle (ALP) with highly suppressed electromagnetic interactions populating vast yet unexplored domains in the ALP parameter space. This is achieved for the first time in the simplest dark confining gauge theory yielding a new composite glueball ALP (GALP) DM coupling-mass relation found in terms of two distinct fundamental scales -- the large dark fermion mass scale and the dynamical scale of dark confinement. The presence of a heavy fermion portal between the visible (photons) and dark (GALPs) sectors ensures a strong radiative suppression of the GALP-photon coupling naturally without any fine-tuning. The observable features of heavy GALP DM in a minimal realization are controlled by only three physical parameters. Our work paves the road for a novel research field exploring the theory and phenomenology of composite ALPs in multi-messenger astrophysics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Probing Type-I 2HDM light Higgs in the top-pair-associated diphoton channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13636v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the possible 95 GeV diphoton excess, we investigate the capability of the Type-I Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM-I) to explain this signal under current theoretical and experimental constraints. Using full Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for the process of $pp \to t(\to W^+ b)\bar{t}(\to W^- \bar{b})h(\to \gamma\gamma)$, we evaluate the discovery potential of a 95 GeV Higgs boson at future colliders. Direct Higgs searches strongly constrain the parameter $\alpha$, excluding the region with $\alpha \lesssim 0.95$. Monte Carlo results indicate that a minimum cross section of 0.3 fb is required to achieve a $5\sigma$ signal statistical significance at the LHC with $\mathcal{L} = 3~\text{ab}^{-1}$. For the same luminosity, HE-LHC and FCC-hh require 0.67 fb and 2.36 fb, respectively. At the 14 TeV HL-LHC with an integrated luminosity of $3\,\abm$, parameter regions with $\sin(\beta-\alpha) \gtrsim 0.4$ and $\sin(\beta-\alpha) \gtrsim 0.25$ can be probed at the $5\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ significance levels, respectively. At the 27 TeV HL-LHC with $L = 10\,\abm$, the sensitivity improves to $\sin(\beta-\alpha) \gtrsim 0.25$ ($5\sigma$) and $\gtrsim 0.15$ ($2\sigma$). For the 100 TeV FCC-hh with $L = 30\,\abm$, even regions with $\sin(\beta-\alpha) \gtrsim 0.1$ or $\sin(\beta-\alpha) \lesssim -0.05$ can be covered at the $5\sigma$ level.

      <title>A 95 GeV Higgs Boson in the $U(1)_X$SSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13261v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CMS and ATLAS Collaborations have recently reported their findings based on the comprehensive run 2 dataset, detailing their searches for a light Higgs boson with a mass of approximately 95 GeV. We investigate the excesses observed in the $\gamma\gamma$ and $b{\bar b}$ data at approximately 95 GeV in the $U(1)_X$ extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ($U(1)_X$SSM). Additionally, it also mixes with the SM-like Higgs boson. Research indicates that, in this model, identifying the mixture of the singlet Higgs states as the lightest Higgs boson holds tremendous potential for explaining the excess observed at approximately 95 GeV. In our calculations, we maintain the masses of the lightest and next-to-lightest Higgs bosons at approximately 95 GeV and 125 GeV, respectively. The study finds that the theoretical predictions for the signal strengths $\mu(h_{95})_{\gamma\gamma}$ and $\mu(h_{95})_{b{\bar b}}$ in the $U(1)_X$SSM align well with the excesses observed by CMS.</description>

      <title>Dark axion portal at $Z$ boson factories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark axion portal connects an axion-like-particle (ALP), which can be the QCD axion, with the SM by the coupling to a photon and a dark photon, leading to a rich and distinct phenomenology related to dark matter, astrophysics, and cosmology. We note that due to the gauge invariance, the $Z$ boson-dark photon-ALP coupling should also be generated with sizable strength, and we study its phenomenological consequences at $Z$ boson factories: LEP, FCC-ee, and forward physics detectors at the LHC and FPF@FCC - FASER and MATHUSLA. Due to the large number of $Z$ bosons produced, DAP particles can be efficiently produced and detected by semi-visible displaced decays of the heavier DS species to $\gamma$+inv. or $f^+ f^-$+inv., and via missing energy signature with zero or one photon. Because of the complementarity of the two approaches, we find great prospects in exploring both short and long-lived lifetime regimes of DAP, especially when the heavier dark species has mass above $0.1\,$GeV.</description>

      <title>Giving wake to energy-energy correlators: Hydrodynamic response on the celestial sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03616v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observation of the medium response generated by the propagation of high energy partons in the quark gluon plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions would provide a clear and unmistakable evidence for the hydrodynamic behavior of the bulk. Recently, it has been argued that the features of the medium's back-reaction to the jet could be cleanly imprinted in the correlations of asymptotic energy flows, in principle allowing to isolate this signal from other uncorrelated physical processes. Nonetheless, the current limited theoretical understanding of these jet observables in heavy-ion collisions constrains their applicability as probes of the medium (hydro)dynamics. In this work, we provide an analytic picture for the medium back-reaction's effect on the energy flux and two point energy correlator. We show that the medium response leads to the emergence of an universal classical scaling law, competing with the perturbative QCD contribution at large angles. Comparing the associated correlator to recent experimental measurements, we find that the observed large angle features can be qualitatively described by a purely hydrodynamically driven response and its interplay with the hard jet component.</description>

      <title>On the $K^+ \to \pi^0\pi^0\pi^0 e^+ \nu$ decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The OKA Collaboration has obtained a new upper limit on the $K^+ \to \pi^0\pi^0\pi^0 e^+ \nu$ decay probability which is 65 times lower than the one currently listed by PDG. However it is still about $10^{4}$ times worse than the theoretical prediction. It was suggested that production of pionium $A_{2\pi}$ in the final state of the semileptonic $K^+$ decay with subsequent $A_{2\pi} \to \pi^0 \pi^0$ decay will increase the value of theoretical branching ratio due to the absence of five-particle phase space suppression. The estimates done in our paper show that despite the gain in the phase space the decay $K^+ \to A_{2\pi}\pi^0 e^+ \nu$ appeares to be strongly suppressed because of the smallness of the pionium wave function at zero $\pi$ mesons separation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon the success of optimal transport metrics defined for single collinear jets, we develop a multi-scale framework that models entire collider events as distributions on the manifold of their constituent jets, which are themselves distributions on the ground space of the calorimeter. This hierarchical structure of optimal transport effectively captures relevant physics at different scales. We demonstrate the versatility of our method in two event classification tasks, which respectively emphasize intra-jet substructure and inter-jet spatial correlations. Our results highlight the relevance of a nested structure of manifolds in the treatment of full collider events, broadening the applicability of optimal transport methods in collider analyses.</description>

Abstract: In this article, the vector, axial vector and tensor form factors of $B_{c}\to \chi_{cJ}$ ($J=0,1,2$) and $B_{c}\to h_{c}$ are analyzed within the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. With the calculated vector and axial vector form factors, we directly study the decay widths and branching ratios of semileptonic decays $B_{c}^{-}\to \chi_{cJ}l \bar{\nu}_l, h_{c}l \bar{\nu}_l$ $(l=e, \mu$ and $\tau)$ and analyze the nonleptonic decays $B_{c}^{-}\to \chi_{cJ}\pi^{-}, \chi_{cJ}K^{-}, \chi_{cJ}\rho^{-}, \chi_{cJ}K^{*-}$, $B_{c}^{-}\to h_{c}\pi^{-}, h_{c}K^{-}, h_{c}\rho^{-}, h_{c}K^{*-}$ by using the naive factorization approach (NFA). These results can provide more information to understand the properties of $B_{c}$ meson and $P$-wave charmonia and to study the heavy quark dynamics.</description>

      <title>Neutrino reheating predictions with non-thermal leptogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Connecting inflation with neutrino physics through non-thermal leptogenesis via direct inflaton-right-handed neutrino (RHN) coupling naturally incorporates neutrino reheating, leaving no ambiguity regarding the early history of the Universe. In ref.~\cite{Zhang:2023oyo}, we demonstrate that non-thermal leptogenesis from inflaton decay expands the viable parameter space compared to thermal leptogenesis and provides a natural link to inflation. In this work, we refine our previous findings by closely examining the dynamics of neutrino reheating. We first calculate the duration of neutrino reheating on a general basis, then analyze inflationary observables consistent with neutrino reheating across four models, establishing a direct connection between baryon asymmetry and the spectral index. This approach places these two important observables on the same plane and yields specific predictions that help break the degeneracy among inflationary models. The well-motivated and economical framework offers a simple, natural, and testable description of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Confined Monopoles in Chiral Bag</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chiral bag model offers a dual description of hadron physics in terms of quarks and hadrons in the sense of Cheshire Cat principle. In this work, we find that, within the chiral bag, confinement is likely caused by monopole condensation. The chiral bag surface can be interpreted as an $\eta'$ domain wall, where a dynamical Chern-Simons theory emerges. Under level-rank duality, the Chern-Simons theory serves as the counterterm introduced to block the so-called color charge leakage. To ensure the correct net baryon number of the full chiral bag, an additional Chern-Simons theory involving the vector meson field arises on the bag surface and extends outside the bag. This leads to a Chern-Simons-Higgs theory localized on the $\eta'$ domain wall, as previously conjectured. We also propose that the skyrmion description of baryons could be understood as a system of monopoles enveloped by a meson cloud.</description>

      <title>Complementary Probes of Warped Extra Dimension: Colliders, Gravitational Waves and Primordial Black Holes from Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) and stochastic gravitational waves background (SGWB) produced by the supercooled radion phase transition (PT) in warped extra-dimension models solving the gauge hierarchy problem. We first determine how the SGWB and the produced PBH mass and abundance depend on the warped model's infrared energy scale $\rho$, and the number of holographic colors $N$. With this finding, we recast on the plane $\{\rho, N\}$ the current SGWB and PBH constraints, as well as the expected parameter reaches of GW detectors, as LISA and ET, and the gravitational lensing ones, such as NGRST. On the same plane, we also map the collider bounds on massive graviton production, and cosmological bounds on the radion phenomenology. We find that, for $N \sim 10-50$, the considered PT predicts a PBH population mass in the range $M_{\rm PBH}\sim(10^{-1} - 10^{-25}) M_{\odot}$ for $\rho \sim (10^{-4} - 10^{8})\textrm{ TeV}$. In the range $\rho \simeq (0.05 - 0.5)$ GeV, it can explain the recent SGWB hint at nHz frequencies and generate PBH binaries with mass $M_{\rm PBH}\sim(0.1 - 1 ) M_\odot$ detectable at LISA and ET. The experimentally allowed mass region where PBHs can account for the whole dark matter abundance, and are produced with a tuning $\lesssim 10^{-4}$, corresponds to $10$ TeV $\lesssim \rho\lesssim$ $10^4$ TeV. These PBHs can compensate the lack of natural candidates for dark matter in warped extra dimensional models. Such a region represents a great science case where forthcoming and future colliders like HE-LHC and FCC-hh, gravitational-wave observatories and other PBHs probes play a key complementary role.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative heavy quark diffusion coefficients in a weakly magnetized thermal QCD medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the perturbative and non-perturbative contributions to the heavy quark (HQ) momentum ($\kappa$) as well as spatial ($D_s$) diffusion coefficients are computed in a weak background magnetic field. The formalism adopted here involves calculation of the in-medium potential of the HQ in a weak magnetic field, which then serves as a proxy for the resummed gluon propagator in the calculation of HQ self-energy ($\Sigma$). The self-energy determines the scattering rate of HQs with light thermal partons, which is subsequently used to evaluate $\kappa$ and $D_s$. It is observed that non-perturbative effects play a dominant role at low temperature. The spatial diffusion coefficient $2\pi T D_s$, exhibits good agreement with recent LQCD results. These findings can be applied to calculate the heavy quark directed flow at RHIC and LHC energies. An extension of this formalism to the case of finite HQ momentum has also been attempted.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the potential of future neutrino experiments, DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande, to probe magnetic monopoles via Callan-Rubakov (CR) processes. We consider both relativistic and non-relativistic monopoles and focus on two primary detection signatures: high-energy antiproton production and proton decay catalysis. For relativistic monopoles, our analysis of the CR process indicates antiproton production with energies near 900 GeV and we find that both experiments can provide limits on the fluxes an order of magnitude below the Parker bound (approximately $\Phi \lesssim 10^{-16}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,sr^{-1}}$). For non-relativistic monopoles, we recast the experimental sensitivity to proton decay catalysis and obtain upper limits on the monopole flux of $\Phi \lesssim 2.3 \times 10^{-23}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,sr^{-1}}$ for Hyper-Kamiokande and $\Phi \lesssim 1.1 \times 10^{-22}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,sr^{-1}}$ for DUNE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the updated analysis of the $G(3900)$ by the BESIII collaboration, we perform a global analysis of the cross sections of the $e^+e^-\to D\bar{D}$, $e^+e^-\to D\bar{D}^*+c.c.$, $e^+e^-\to D^*\bar{D}^*$ processes, especially focusing on the properties of the $G(3900)$. As the energy region of interest is limited by the next opening threshold, i.e. the $D_1\bar{D}$ threshold, we focus on the energy region $[3.7,4.25]~\mathrm{GeV}$, where three charmonia $\psi(1D)$, $\psi(3S)$ and $\psi(2D)$ explicitly contribute to the cross sections. By constructing the $P$-wave contact interaction between the $(D,D^*)$ doublet and its antiparticle in the heavy quark limit, we extract the physical scattering amplitude by solving the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. No matter whether three or two charmonium states are included in our framework, we always find a dynamically generated state corresponding to the $G(3900)$, which suggests it to be a $P$-wave dynamically generated state. We also predict several dynamically generated states in the corresponding $1^{-+}$ channel. These states can be further searched for in the electron-positron annihilation process involving the emission of a single photon.</description>

      <title>Fresh look at the diffuse ALP background from supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protoneutron stars, highly compact objects formed in the core of exploding supernovae (SNe), are powerful sources of axion-like particles (ALPs). In the SN core, ALPs are dominantly produced via nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung and pion conversion, resulting in an energetic ALP spectrum peaked at energies $\mathcal{O}(100)\,\rm MeV$. In this work, we revisit the diffuse ALP background, produced from all past core-collapse supernovae, and update the constraints derived from Fermi-LAT observations. Assuming the maximum ALP-nucleon coupling allowed by the SN 1987A cooling, we set the upper limit $g_{a \gamma \gamma} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{-13}\,\rm GeV^{-1}$ for ALP mass $m_a\lesssim 10^{-10}\,\rm eV$, which is approximately a factor of two improvement with respect to the existing bounds. On the other hand, for $m_a \gtrsim 10^{-10}\,\rm eV$, we find that including pion conversion strengthens the bound on $g_{a\gamma \gamma}$, approximately by a factor of two compared to the constraint obtained from bremsstrahlung alone. Additionally, we present a sensitivity study for future experiments such as AMEGO-X, e-ASTROGAM, GRAMS-balloon, GRAMS-satellite, and MAST. We find that the expected constraint from MAST would be comparable to Fermi-LAT bound. However, SN 1987A constraint remains one order of magnitude stronger as compared to the bound derived from the current and future gamma-ray telescopes.</description>

      <title>Parton helicities at arbitrary x and Q2 in double-logarithmic approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Description of spin-dependent hadronic processes at high energies in terms of parton helicities is a both effective and technically convenient means. In the present paper, we obtain explicit expressions for the parton helicities when either Collinear or KT forms of QCD Factorization are used. Starting our studies with calculation of the helicities in the double-logarithmic approximation (DLA) in the region of small x and large Q^2, we generalize the results in order to obtain formulae valid at arbitrary x and Q^2. We argue against using Collinear Factorization, when the parton orbital angular momenta are accounted for, and prove that KT-Factorization should be used instead. We also consider in detail the small-x asymptotics of the parton helicities, compare them with the DGLAP-asymptotics in LO,NLO,etc and prove that the form of DGLAP asymptotics cannot be of the Regge type.</description>

      <title>$B \to D^{(*)} \tau \nu_{\tau}$ decay properties with RIQ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we compute the branching fraction of $B \to D^{(*)} \,\tau \, \nu_{\tau}$ and $B_s \to D_s^{(*)}\, \tau\, \nu_{\tau}$ within the Relativistic Independent Quark Model, emphasizing the harmonic potential model dependent analysis of these decay channels in the precision flavor physics era. Considering the experimental observation of longitudinal $\tau$-polarization and fraction of longitudinal polarization at LHCb and Belle, we have also investigated these observables within our model framework which are aligning well with the standard model expectations. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the form factors across the whole accessible kinematic range of $q^2$. Our results are consistent and compatible with other theoretical approaches as well as with the experimental measurements. Furthermore, we evaluated the clean ratios of $B_s$ to $B_0$ in the semimuonic mode that are in accordance with the LHCb measurements, and support the validity of the SU(3) flavor symmetry. Although the concept of new physics is facing a significant challenge at the current TeV scale, semileptonic $B$ decays, nevertheless, always serve as a valuable probe to study the decay dynamics.</description>

      <title>Does the existence of $f_0$ meson enlarge the $K^+ \to \pi^0\pi^0\pi^0 e^+ \nu$ decay probability?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate a possible contribution of the two-pion system $f_0(500)$ wide resonance to the decay probability of the super rare decay $K^+ \to 3\pi^0 e^+ \nu$. We vary the width of the resonance from 0.01 MeV to 1000 MeV. We found that the contribution of the narrow resonance in a system of several final state particles into the decay probability is proportional to its width. However it never exceeds the value of the decay probability calculated on free final state particles neglecting the resonance contribution.</description>

      <title>Polarization Probes of New Physics in Lepton-Flavor-Violating Hyperon Production from $e^- N \to \tau^- Y$ Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While charged lepton-flavor-violating tau decays to strange mesons provide powerful probes of the underlying $\tau\to\ell d \bar{s}$ transition, the corresponding decay modes involving hyperons are kinematically forbidden. To address this gap, we propose the quasi-elastic scattering processes $e^- N \to \tau^- Y$. Within a general low-energy effective Lagrangian, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the final-state polarizations of both the $\tau$ lepton and the hyperon $Y$, systematically addressing the theoretical uncertainty driven by the model dependence of form factors. Our analysis demonstrates that while this uncertainty leads to large variations in predicted rates, the polarization observables can potentially distinguish between the form factor models, and help to determine the chiral nature of the vectorial new physics interaction. Finally, we forecast the event rates for future facilities, revealing a strong dependence on the form factor models, with predicted yields ranging from potentially observable levels to rates far below current detection thresholds.</description>

      <title>Entanglement, Trace Anomaly and Confinement in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate confinement in QCD as an entropic surface phenomenon. Quark and gluon quantum information is localized on a two-dimensional transverse sheet of radius $R_{\mathrm{EE}}$; at this radius the QCD vacuum -- partitioned by a hadron into interior and exterior regions -- reaches its maximal entanglement entropy. Lattice QCD determinations of scalar (trace) gravitational form factors of hadrons fix both $R_{\mathrm{EE}}$ and the transverse trace-anomaly density $\rho_h(R_{\mathrm{EE}})$ with percent-level accuracy, enabling a parameter-free mechanical entropy $S_{\mathrm{EE}}(y)=c_h\,y$ growing linearly with rapidity $y$. The associated entropy gradient changes sign at $R_{\mathrm{EE}}$: it repels color fields for $r&lt;R_{\mathrm{EE}}$ and attracts them for $r&gt;R_{\mathrm{EE}}$, trapping partons at all scales -- UV and IR -- in contrast to Wilson's area law, which probes only long distances. Squaring the entropy density, as required by unitarity, yields $\sigma\propto y^{\delta}$. World data demand $\delta=2$ for elastic $pp\,(p\bar p)$ scattering and heavy-quark photoproduction, but a softer $\delta=0.387$ for $\phi$ photoproduction, all two orders of magnitude below the Froissart--Martin bound. These results provide the first confinement criterion derived directly from nonperturbative QCD, unifying the trace anomaly, entanglement entropy, and high-energy scattering within a single quantitative framework.</description>

      <title>Connecting $t$-channel Dark Matter Models to the Standard Model Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between simplified dark matter models featuring a $t$-channel scalar mediator and the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We focus on scenarios with fermionic dark matter interacting with leptons, under the assumption of Minimal Flavor Violation. The dimension-six SMEFT Wilson coefficients are computed in the Warsaw basis at one loop, with the aid of Matchete. Assuming a compressed mass spectrum for the dark matter and the mediator, we incorporate coannihilations, Sommerfeld enhancement, and bound-state effects in the relic density calculation. We then analyze the interplay between the dark matter energy density, global SMEFT fits, and direct detection constraints. Our results show that SMEFT bounds, though loop-suppressed, can meaningfully constrain the parameter space for $m_\chi \gtrsim 0.5$ TeV and $\mathcal{O}(1)$ portal couplings.</description>

      <title>Search for Long-lived Particles at Future Lepton Colliders Using Deep Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05094v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-lived particles (LLPs) provide an unambiguous signal for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). They have a distinct detector signature, with decay lengths corresponding to lifetimes of around nanoseconds or longer. Lepton colliders allow LLP searches to be conducted in a clean environment, and such searches can reach their full physics potential when combined with machine learning (ML) techniques. This experimental study, utilizing comprehensive full simulation data samples, focuses on LLP searches resulting from Higgs decay in $e^+e^-\to ZH$. We demonstrate that, by employing deep neural network approaches the LLP signal efficiency can be improved up to 95% for an LLP mass around 50 GeV and a lifetime of approximately 1 nanosecond, while rejecting all SM backgrounds. Furthermore, the signal sensitivity for the branching ratio of Higgs decaying into LLPs reaches a state-of-art limit of $9.7 \times 10^{-7}$ with a statistics of $4 \times 10^{6}$ Higgs.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Zoom-In Simulations of Milky Way Host Mass Dark Matter Halos with a Blue-Tilted Primordial Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope revealed a surprisingly large number of galaxies at high redshift, challenging the standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmology with a power-law primordial power spectrum. Previous studies alleviated this tension with a blue tilted primordial power spectrum ($P(k)\propto k^{m_s}$ with $m_s&gt;1$ at small scales $&gt;1~{\rm cMpc}^{-1}$). In this study, we examine whether the blue tilted model can boost dark matter substructures especially at low redshift, thereby addressing other potential challenges to the standard cosmology. First, substructures in the standard cosmological model may not be sufficient to explain the anomalous flux ratio problem observed in strong gravitational lensing. Second, the number of observed nearby satellite galaxies could be higher than the theoretical predictions of the standard cosmology, after completeness correction and tidal stripping by baryonic disks. To study the impact of a blue tilted primordial power spectrum on substructures, we perform high-resolution cosmological zoom-in dark matter-only simulations of Milky Way host mass halos, evolving to redshift $z=0$. At $z=0$, we find that the blue-tilted subhalo mass functions can be enhanced by more than a factor of two for subhalo masses $M_{\rm sub} \lesssim 10^{10} ~M\odot$, whereas the subhalo $V_{\rm max}$ functions can be enhanced by a factor of four for maximum circular velocities $V_{\rm max}\lesssim 30 ~{\rm km/s}$. The blue-tilted scaled cumulative substructure fraction can be an order of magnitude higher at $\sim$10\% of the virial radius. The blue-tilted subhalos also have higher central densities, since the blue-tilted subhalos reach the same $V_{\rm max}$ at a smaller distance $R_{\rm max}$ from the center. We have also verified these findings with higher-resolution simulations.</description>

      <title>Enhancing DUNE Physics Sensitivity with Light and Charge Calorimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of light calorimetry in liquid argon time projection chambers and its intrinsic self compensation properties, emphasizing its advantages alongside conventional charge calorimetry. Previous studies have demonstrated that light calorimetry can achieve energy resolution comparable to advanced charge based techniques, particularly for GeV scale neutrinos. In this work, we explore the complementarity of light calorimetry with charge calorimetry for precision measurements of key physics parameters in the DUNE, including CP violation (CPV) and mass hierarchy determination. While charge calorimetry provides superior resolution in CP phase measurements, light calorimetry independently offers significant insights into CPV and mass hierarchy sensitivities. Furthermore, our exposure versus CPV sensitivity studies indicate that the $5\sigma$ discovery potential is reached faster using light and charge calorimetry than with the traditional TDR based reconstruction methods. These findings highlight the promising role of light calorimetry as a simple yet effective reconstruction method, serving as a complementary approach to enhance the physics capabilities of DUNE.</description>
