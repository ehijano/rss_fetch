      <title>K-Paths: Reasoning over Graph Paths for Drug Repurposing and Drug Interaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug discovery is a complex and time-intensive process that requires identifying and validating new therapeutic candidates. Computational approaches using large-scale biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a promising solution to accelerate this process. However, extracting meaningful insights from large-scale KGs remains challenging due to the complexity of graph traversal. Existing subgraph-based methods are tailored to graph neural networks (GNNs), making them incompatible with other models, such as large language models (LLMs). We introduce K-Paths, a retrieval framework that extracts structured, diverse, and biologically meaningful paths from KGs. Integrating these paths enables LLMs and GNNs to effectively predict unobserved drug-drug and drug-disease interactions. Unlike traditional path-ranking approaches, K-Paths retrieves and transforms paths into a structured format that LLMs can directly process, facilitating explainable reasoning. K-Paths employs a diversity-aware adaptation of Yen's algorithm to retrieve the K shortest loopless paths between entities in an interaction query, prioritizing biologically relevant and diverse relationships. Our experiments on benchmark datasets show that K-Paths improves the zero-shot performance of Llama 8.1B's F1-score by 12.45 points on drug repurposing and 13.42 points on interaction severity prediction. We also show that Llama 70B achieves F1-score gains of 6.18 and 8.46 points, respectively. K-Paths also improves the supervised training efficiency of EmerGNN, a state-of-the-art GNN, by reducing KG size by 90% while maintaining strong predictive performance. Beyond its scalability and efficiency, K-Paths uniquely bridges the gap between KGs and LLMs, providing explainable rationales for predicted interactions. These capabilities show that K-Paths is a valuable tool for efficient data-driven drug discovery.</description>

      <title>MotifBench: A standardized protein design benchmark for motif-scaffolding problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The motif-scaffolding problem is a central task in computational protein design: Given the coordinates of atoms in a geometry chosen to confer a desired biochemical function (a motif), the task is to identify diverse protein structures (scaffolds) that include the motif and maintain its geometry. Significant recent progress on motif-scaffolding has been made due to computational evaluation with reliable protein structure prediction and fixed-backbone sequence design methods. However, significant variability in evaluation strategies across publications has hindered comparability of results, challenged reproducibility, and impeded robust progress. In response we introduce MotifBench, comprising (1) a precisely specified pipeline and evaluation metrics, (2) a collection of 30 benchmark problems, and (3) an implementation of this benchmark and leaderboard at github.com/blt2114/MotifBench. The MotifBench test cases are more difficult compared to earlier benchmarks, and include protein design problems for which solutions are known but on which, to the best of our knowledge, state-of-the-art methods fail to identify any solution.</description>
