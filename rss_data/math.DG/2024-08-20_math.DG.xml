      <title>Optimal transport on null hypersurfaces and the null energy condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of the present work is to study optimal transport on null hypersurfaces inside Lorentzian manifolds. The challenge here is that optimal transport along a null hypersurface is completely degenerate, as the cost takes only the two values $0$ and $+\infty$.
  The tools developed in the manuscript enable to give an optimal transport characterization of the null energy condition (namely, non-negative Ricci curvature in the null directions) for Lorentzian manifolds in terms of convexity properties of the Boltzmann--Shannon entropy along null-geodesics of probability measures.
  We obtain as applications: a stability result under convergence of spacetimes, a comparison result for null-cones, and the Hawking area theorem (both in sharp form, for possibly weighted measures, and with apparently new rigidity statements).</description>

      <title>GKM actions on almost quaternionic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce quaternionic structures on abstract GKM graphs, as the combinatorial counterpart of almost quaternionic structures left invariant by a torus action of GKM type. In the GKM$_3$ setting the 2-faces of the GKM graph can naturally be divided into quaternionic and complex 2-faces; it turns out that for GKM$_3$ actions on positive quaternion-K\"ahler manifolds the quaternionic 2-faces are biangles or triangles, and the complex 2-faces triangles or quadrangles. We show purely combinatorially that any abstract GKM$_3$ graph with quaternionic structure satisfying this restriction on the 2-faces of the GKM graph is that of a torus action on quaternionic projective space ${\mathbb{H}} P^n$ or the Grassmannian ${\mathrm{Gr}}_2({\mathbb{C}}^n)$ of complex 2-planes in ${\mathbb{C}}^n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the asymptotic $\sigma_k$ Plateau problem in hyperbolic space. We establish $C^2$ estimates for semi-convex complete hypersurfaces satisfying constant $\sigma_k$ curvature with a prescribed asymptotic boundary at the infinity for $2\leq k\leq n-2$ . The result is based on a new crucial concavity inequality derived for hessian equations.</description>

      <title>Hermitian pluriharmonic maps between almost Hermitian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the case where both the domain and target manifolds are almost Hermitian, we introduce the concept of Hermitian pluriharmonic maps. We prove that any holomorphic or anti-holomorphic map between almost Hermitian manifolds is Hermitian pluriharmonic. We also establish some monotonicity formulae for the partial energies of Hermitian pluriharmonic maps into K\"ahler manifolds. As an application, under appropriate assumptions on the growth of the partial energies, some holomorphicity results are proven.</description>

      <title>Entire hypersurfaces of constant scalar curvature in Minkowski space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every regular domain $\mathcal D$ in Minkowski space $\mathbb R^{n,1}$ which is not a wedge admits an entire hypersurface whose domain of dependence is $\mathcal D$ and whose scalar curvature is a prescribed constant (or function, under suitable hypotheses) in $(-\infty,0)$. Under rather general assumptions, these hypersurfaces are unique and provide foliations of $\mathcal D$. As an application, we show that every maximal globally hyperbolic Cauchy compact flat spacetime admits a foliation by hypersurfaces of constant scalar curvature, generalizing to any dimension previous results of Barbot-B\'eguin-Zeghib (for $n=2$) and Smith (for $n=3$).</description>

      <title>Biharmonic conformal immersions into a 3-dimensional conformally flat space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the work of Ou [12,17], we study biharmonic conformal immersions of surfaces into a conformally flat 3-space. We first give a characterization of biharmonic conformal immersions of totally umbilical surfaces into a generic 3-manifold. As an application, we give a method to produce biharmonic conformal immersions into a conformally flat 3-space. We then use the method to obtain a classification of biharmonic maps in a family of conformal immersions and construct many examples of biharmonic conformal immersions from a 2-sphere into a conformal 3-sphere. Our examples include proper biharmonic conformal immersions of a 2-sphere minus a point into a conformal 3-sphere with nonconstant conformal factor and the biharmonic isometric immersion $S^2(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})\to S^3$ which was found in [2]. Finally, we study biharmonic conformal immersions of Hopf cylinders of a Riemannian submersion.</description>

      <title>Silent Orbits and Cancellations in the Wave Trace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper shows that the wave trace of a bounded and strictly convex planar domain may be arbitrarily smooth in a neighborhood of some point in the length spectrum. In other words, the Poisson relation, which asserts that the singular support of the wave trace is contained in the closure of $\pm$ the length spectrum, can almost be made into a strict inclusion. To do so, we construct large families of domains for which there exist multiple periodic billiard orbits having the same length but different Maslov indices. Using the microlocal Balian-Bloch-Zelditch parametrix for wave invariants developed in our previous paper, we solve a large system of equations for the boundary curvature jets, which leads to the required cancellations. We call such periodic orbits silent, since they are undetectable from the ostensibly audible wave trace. Such cancellations show that there are potential limitations in using the wave trace for inverse spectral problems and more fundamentally, that the Laplace spectrum and length spectrum are inherently different mathematical objects, at least insofar as the wave trace is concerned.</description>

      <title>Holographic M-Brane Super-Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over a decade before the modern formulation of AdS/CFT duality, Duff et al. had observed a candidate microscopic explanation by identifying the CFT fields with fluctuations of probe p-branes stretched out in parallel near the horizon of their own black brane incarnation. A profound way to characterize these and more general probe p-brane configurations, especially for M5-branes, is expected to be as "super-embeddings" of their super-worldvolumes into target super-spacetime - but no concrete example of these had appeared in the literature.
  Here we fill this gap by constructing the explicit holographic super-embedding of probe M5-branes and M2-branes into their corresponding super-AdS backgrounds. The result seems to be novel and shows that the holographic M-probes, static with respect to the Poincar\'e chart, must sit exactly at the throat radius.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glickenstein \cite{Glickenstein} and Glickenstein-Thomas \cite{GT} introduced the discrete conformal structures on surfaces in an axiomatic approach and studied its classification. In this paper, we give a full classification of the discrete conformal structures on surfaces, which completes Glickenstein-Thomas' classification. As a result, we find some new classes of discrete conformal structures on surfaces, including some of the generalized circle packing metrics introduced by Guo-Luo \cite{GL2}. The relationships between the discrete conformal structures on surfaces and the 3-dimensional hyperbolic geometry are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Point selections from Jordan domains in Riemannian Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using fiber bundle theory and conformal mappings, we continuously select a point from the interior of Jordan domains in Riemannian surfaces. This selection can be made equivariant under isometries, and take on prescribed values such as the center of mass when the domains are convex. Analogous results for conformal transformations are obtained as well. It follows that the space of Jordan domains in surfaces of constant curvature admits an isometrically equivariant strong deformation retraction onto the space of round disks. Finally we develop a canonical procedure for selecting points from planar Jordan domains.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hukuhara directional differentiability of interval-valued functions on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.04541v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that generalized Hukuhara directional differentiability of an interval-valued function (IVF) defined on Riemannian manifolds is not equivalent to the directional differentiability of its center and half-width functions and hence not to its end point functions. This contrasts with S.-L. Chen's \cite{chen} assertion which says the equivalence holds in terms of endpoint functions of an IVF which is defined on a Hadamard manifold. Additionally, the paper addresses some other inaccuracies which arise when assuming the convexity of a function at a single point in its domain. In light of these arguments, the paper presents some basic results that relate to both the convexity and directional differentiability of an IVF.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the hyperbolicity in the sense of Gromov of domains in $\mathbb{R}^d$ $(d\geq3)$ with respect to the minimal metric introduced by Forstneri\v{c} and Kalaj. In particular, we prove that every bounded strongly minimally convex domain is Gromov hyperbolic and its Gromov compactification is equivalent to its Euclindean closure. Moreover, we prove that the boundary of a Gromov hyperbolic convex domain does not contain non-trivial conformal harmonic disks. Finally, we study the relation between the minimal metric and the Hilbert metric in convex domains.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework to Enforce, Discover, and Promote Symmetry in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry is present throughout nature and continues to play an increasingly central role in physics and machine learning. Fundamental symmetries, such as Poincar\'{e} invariance, allow physical laws discovered in laboratories on Earth to be extrapolated to the farthest reaches of the universe. Symmetry is essential to achieving this extrapolatory power in machine learning applications. For example, translation invariance in image classification allows models with fewer parameters, such as convolutional neural networks, to be trained on smaller data sets and achieve state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we provide a unifying theoretical and methodological framework for incorporating symmetry into machine learning models in three ways: 1. enforcing known symmetry when training a model; 2. discovering unknown symmetries of a given model or data set; and 3. promoting symmetry during training by learning a model that breaks symmetries within a user-specified group of candidates when there is sufficient evidence in the data. We show that these tasks can be cast within a common mathematical framework whose central object is the Lie derivative associated with fiber-linear Lie group actions on vector bundles. We extend and unify several existing results by showing that enforcing and discovering symmetry are linear-algebraic tasks that are dual with respect to the bilinear structure of the Lie derivative. We also propose a novel way to promote symmetry by introducing a class of convex regularization functions based on the Lie derivative and nuclear norm relaxation to penalize symmetry breaking during training of machine learning models. We explain how these ideas can be applied to a wide range of machine learning models including basis function regression, dynamical systems discovery, neural networks, and neural operators acting on fields.</description>
