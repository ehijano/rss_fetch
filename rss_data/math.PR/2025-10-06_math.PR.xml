      <title>Characterization of Probability Distributions on Locally Compact Abelian Groups by the Property of Identical Distribution of Linear Forms with Random Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let X be a locally compact Abelian group. We consider linear forms of independent random variables with values in X. In doing so, one of the coefficients of the linear forms is a random variable with a Bernoulli distribution. For some classes of groups we describe possible distributions of random variables provided that the linear forms are identically distributed. The proof of the theorems is reduced to solving some functional equations on the character group of the group X, and to solve functional equations, methods of abstract harmonic analysis are used.</description>

      <title>Numerical Radius of Non-Hermitian Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a square matrix, the range of its Rayleigh quotients is known as the numerical range, which is a compact and convex set by the Toeplitz-Hausdorff theorem. The largest value and the smallest boundary value (in magnitude) of this convex set are known as the numerical radius and inner numerical radius respectively. The numerical radius is often used to study the convergence rate of iterative methods for solving linear systems. In this work, we investigate these radii for complex non-Hermitian random matrix and its elliptic variants. For the former, remarkably, these radii can be represented as extrema of a stationary Airy-like process, which undergoes a correlation-decorrelation transition from small to large time scale. Based on this transition, we obtain the precise first and second order terms of the numerical radii. In the elliptic case, we prove that the fluctuation of the numerical radii boils down to the maximum or minimum of two independent Tracy-Widom variables.</description>

      <title>Shadow and percolation II: discrete and continuous landscapes with correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a discrete or continuous landscape with correlations and we consider a source of light (a sun) at infinity emitting parallel rays of light making a slope l with the horizontal plane. Depending on the value of l some portions of the landscape may be lit by the sun or be in the shadow. Under some assumptions, we show that if l is big enough then there exists a giant component of light. However, if l&gt;0 is small enough and if we are in discrete case, then there exists a giant component of shadow. We relate this problem to the study of the percolation properties of a new random planar field.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorem and Cram\'{e}r-type moderate deviations for Milstein scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Milstein numerical scheme with step size $\eta$ for a stochastic differential equation driven by multiplicative Brownian motion. Under some appropriate coefficient conditions, the continuous-time system and its discrete Milstein scheme approximation each possess unique invariant measures, which we denote by $\pi$ and $\pi_\eta$ respectively. We first establish a central limit theorem for the empirical measure $\Pi_{\eta}$, a statistical consistent estimator of $\pi_{\eta}$. Subsequently, we derive both normalized and self-normalized Cram\'{e}r-type moderate deviations.</description>

      <title>A Moving Boundary Problem for Brownian Particles with Singular Forward-Backward Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a system of Brownian particles, each absorbed upon hitting an associated moving boundary. The boundaries are determined by the conditional probabilities of the particles being absorbed before some final time horizon, given the current knowledge of the system. While the particles evolve forward in time, the conditional probabilities are computed backwards in time, leading to a specification of the particle system as a system of singular forward-backward SDEs coupled through hitting times. Its analysis leads to a novel type of tiered moving boundary problem. Each level of this PDE corresponds to a different configuration of unabsorbed particles, with the boundary and the boundary condition of a given level being determined by the solution of the preceding one. We establish classical well-posedness for this moving boundary problem and use its solution to solve the original forward-backward system and prove its uniqueness.</description>

      <title>On Convergence Rates of General $N$-Player Stackelberg Games to their Mean Field Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we establish precise convergence rates of a general class of $N$-Player Stackelberg games to their mean field limits, which allows the response time delay of information, empirical distribution based interactions, and the control-dependent diffusion coefficients. All these features makes our problem nonstandard, barely been touched in the literature, and they complicate the analysis and therefore reduce the convergence rate. We first justify the same convergence rate for both the followers and the leader. Specifically, for the most general case, the convergence rate is shown to be $\mathcal{O}\left(N^{-\frac{2(q-2)}{n_1(3q-4)}}\right)$ when $n_1&gt;4$ where $n_1$ is the dimension of the follower's state, and $q$ is the order of the integration of the initial; and this rate has yet been shown in the literature, to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, by classifying cases according to the state dimension $n_1$, the nature of the delay, and the assumptions of the coefficients, we provide several subcases where faster convergence rates can be obtained; for instance the $\mathcal{O}\left(N^{-\frac{2}{3n_1}}\right)$-convergence when the diffusion coefficients are independent of control variable. Our result extends the standard $o(1)$-convergence result for the mean field Stackelberg games in the literature, together with the $\mathcal{O}(N^{-\frac{1}{n_1+4}})$-convergence for the mean field games with major and minor players. We also discuss the special case where our coefficients are linear in distribution argument while nonlinear in state and control arguments, and we establish an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N})$ convergence rate, which extends the linear quadratic cases in the literature.</description>

      <title>Probability distributions over CSS codes: two-universality, QKD hashing, collision bounds, security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize novel probability distributions for CSS codes. Such classes of error correcting codes, originally introduced by Calderbank, Shor, and Steane, are of great significance in advancing the fidelity of Quantum computation, with implications for future near term applications. Within the context of Quantum key distribution, such codes, as examined by Ostrev in arXiv: 2109.06709 along with two-universal hashing protocols, have greatly simplified Quantum phases of computation for unconditional security. To further examine novel applications of two-universal hashing protocols, particularly through the structure of parity check matrices, we demonstrate how being able to efficiently compute functions of the parity check matrices relates to marginals of a suitably defined probability measure supported over random matrices. The security of the two-universal QKD hashing protocol will be shown to depend upon the computation of purified states of random matrices, which relates to probabilistic collision bounds between two hashing functions. Central to our approach are the introduction of novel real, simulator, and ideal, isometries, hence allowing for efficient computations of functions of the two parity check matrices. As a result of being able to perform such computations involving parity check matrices, the security of the two-universal hashing protocol is a factor of $2^{ \frac{5}{2} ( 5 - \frac{3}{2} ) + \mathrm{log}_2 \sqrt{C}}$ less secure, for some strictly positive constant $C$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These expository notes introduce the Hellinger distance on the set of all measures and the induced Fisher-Rao distances for subsets of measures, such as probability measures or Gaussian measures. The historical background is highlighted and the relations and the distinct features of the two distances are discussed. Moreover, we provide a dynamic characterization of absolutely continuous curves in the Hellinger spaces in terms of the growth equation, which replaces the continuity equation in the theory of optimal transport.</description>

      <title>Mean-field analysis of a neural network with stochastic STDP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analysing biological spiking neural network models with synaptic plasticity has proven to be challenging both theoretically and numerically. In a network with N all-to-all connected neurons, the number of synaptic connections is on the order of $N^2$, making these models computationally demanding. Furthermore, the intricate coupling between neuron and synapse dynamics, along with the heterogeneity generated by plasticity, hinder the use of classic theoretical tools such as mean-field or slow-fast analyses. To address these challenges, we introduce a new variable which we term a typical neuron X. Viewed as a post-synaptic neuron, X is composed of the activity state V , the time since its last spike S, and the empirical distribution $\xi$ of the triplet V , S and W (incoming weight) associated to the pre-synaptic neurons. In particular, we study a stochastic spike-timing- dependent plasticity (STDP) model of connection in a probabilistic Wilson-Cowan spiking neural network model, which features binary neural activity. Taking the large N limit, we obtain from the empirical distribution of the typical neuron a simplified yet accurate representation of the original spiking network. This mean-field limit is a piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP) of McKean-Vlasov type, where the typical neuron dynamics depends on its own distribution. We term this analysis McKean-Vlasov mean-field (MKV-MF). Our approach not only reduces computational complexity but also provides insights into the dynamics of this spiking neural network with plasticity. The model obtained is mathematically exact and capable of tracking transient changes. This analysis marks the first exploration of MKV-MF dynamics in a network of spiking neurons interacting with STDP.</description>

      <title>Model Falsification for Predicting Dynamical Responses of Uncertain Structural Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of dynamical response of structural system depends on the correct modeling of that system. However, modeling becomes increasingly challenging when there are many candidate models available to describe the system behavior. Furthermore, uncertainties can be present even for the parameters of these model classes. The plausibility of each input-output model class of the structures with uncertain components can be determined by a Bayesian approach from measured dynamic responses to one or more input records; predictions of the structural system response to alternate input records can then be made. However, this approach may require many model simulations, even though most of those model classes are quite implausible. An approach is proposed herein to use a bound, computed from the false discovery rate, on the likelihood of measured data to falsify models considering uncertainties in the passive control devices that do not reproduce the measured data to sufficient accuracy. Response prediction is then performed using the unfalsified models in an approximate Bayesian sense by assigning weights, computed from the likelihoods, only to the unfalsified models approach incurring only a fraction of the computational cost of the standard Bayesian approach. The proposed approach for response prediction is illustrated using three structural examples: an earthquake-excited four--degree-of-freedom building model with a hysteretic isolation layer; a 1623--degree-of-freedom three-dimensional building model, with tuned mass dampers attached to its roof, subjected to wind loads; and a full-scale four-story base-isolated building tested on world's largest shake table in Japan's E-Defense lab. The results exhibit accurate response predictions and significant computational savings, thereby illustrating the potential of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Error estimates for finite-dimensional approximations of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations on the Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation set on the Wasserstein space $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$, with a second order term arising from a purely common noise. We do not assume that the Hamiltonian is convex in the momentum variable, which means that we cannot rely on representation formulas coming from mean field control. In this setting, Gangbo, Mayorga, and \'Swi\k{e}ch showed via viscosity solutions methods that the HJB equation on $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ can be approximated by a sequence of finite-dimensional HJB equations. Our main contribution is to quantify this convergence result. The proof involves a doubling of variables argument, which leverages the Hilbertian approach of P.L. Lions for HJB equations in the Wasserstein space, rather than working with smooth metrics which have been used to obtain similar results in the presence of idiosyncratic noise. In dimension one, our doubling of variables argument is made relatively simply by the rigid structure of one-dimensional optimal transport, but in higher dimension the argument is significantly more complicated, and relies on some estimates concerning the "simultaneous quantization" of probability measures.</description>

      <title>HOMC: A MATLAB Package for Higher Order Markov Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a MATLAB package, which is the first of its kind, for Higher Order Markov Chains (HOMC). It can be used to easily compute all important quantities in our recent works relevant to higher order Markov chains, such as the $k$-step transition tensor, limiting probability distribution, ever-reaching probability tensor, and mean first passage time tensor. It can also be used to check whether a higher order chain is ergodic or regular, to construct the transition matrix of the associated reduced first order chain, and to determine whether a state is recurrent or transient. A key function in the package is an implementation of the tensor ``box'' product which has a probabilistic interpretation and is different from other tensor products in the literature. This HOMC package is useful to researchers and practitioners alike for tasks such as numerical experimentation and algorithm prototyping involving higher order Markov chains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present in a unified setting the foundations for a theory of non-bilinear Dirichlet functionals on Hilbert spaces. We prove known and new equivalences between non-linear semigroups, non-linear resolvents, non-linear generators, and their energy functionals, including a complete characterization of Markovianity. We introduce and characterize strong notions of invariance for general lower semicontinuous convex functionals, and notions of locality and strong locality for non-bilinear Dirichlet functionals. Contrary to many partial results in the literature, these characterizations are complete and correctly extend the analogous assertions for the bilinear case in full generality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of probability measures on the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a closed symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$. We show that these measures are Borel measures with respect to the topology induced by the Hofer metric. Further, we show that these measures turn any Hofer-Lipschitz function into a random variable with finite expectation. These measures have (for suitable choices of parameters) several desirable properties, such as full support on $\text{Ham}(M,\omega)$, explicit estimates of the measure of Hofer-balls, and certain controls under the action of the group. We also define a family of probability measures on the space of autonomous Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. These measures have similar properties and give rise to a random walk on the group $\text{Ham}(M,\omega)$. Finally, we show that under certain limits this construction gives rise to probability measures on the space of Hamiltonian homeomorphisms and on the metric completion of $\text{Ham}(M,\omega)$ with respect to the Hofer metric and the spectral metric.</description>

We achieve this by demonstrating that the$\sqrt{\kappa}$-quantum length is equal to the $(\sqrt{\kappa}/2)$-Gaussian multiplicative chaos with reference measure given by half the conformal Minkowski content of the curve, multiplied by $2/(4-\kappa)$ for $\kappa\in (0,4)$ and by $1$ for $\kappa=4$. Our proof relies on a novel "one-sided" approximation of the conformal Minkowski content, which is compatible with the conformal change of coordinates formula.</description>

      <title>A semiconcavity approach to stability of entropic plans and exponential convergence of Sinkhorn's algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study stability of optimizers and convergence of Sinkhorn's algorithm for the entropic optimal transport problem. In the special case of the quadratic cost, our stability bounds imply that if one of the two entropic potentials is semiconcave, then the relative entropy between optimal plans is controlled by the squared Wasserstein distance between their marginals. When employed in the analysis of Sinkhorn's algorithm, this result gives a natural sufficient condition for its exponential convergence, which does not require the ground cost to be bounded. By controlling from above the Hessians of Sinkhorn potentials in examples of interest, we obtain new exponential convergence results. For instance, for the first time we obtain exponential convergence for log-concave marginals and quadratic costs for all values of the regularization parameter, based on semiconcavity propagation results. Moreover, the convergence rate has a linear dependence on the regularization: this behavior is sharp and had only been previously obtained for compact distributions arXiv:2407.01202. These optimal rates are also established in situations where one of the two marginals does not have subgaussian tails. Other interesting new applications include subspace elastic costs, weakly log-concave marginals, marginals with light tails (where, under reinforced assumptions, we manage to improve the rates obtained in arXiv:2311.04041), the case of Lipschitz costs with bounded Hessian, and compact Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Mixing for dynamical systems driven by stationary noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper deals with the problem of long-time asymptotic behaviour of solutions for classes of ODEs and PDEs, perturbed by stationary noises. The latter are not assumed to be $\delta$-correlated in time, so that the evolution in question is not necessarily Markovian. We first prove an abstract result which imply the mixing for random dynamical systems satisfying appropriate dissipativity and controllability conditions. It is applicable to a large class of evolution equations, and we illustrate it on the examples of a chain of anharmonic oscillators coupled to heat reservoirs, the 2d Navier-Stokes system, and a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Our results also apply to the general theory of random processes on the 1d lattice and allow one to get for them results related to Dobrushin's theorems on reconstructing processes via their conditional distributions. The proof is based on an iterative construction with quadratic convergence. It uses the method of Kantorovich functional, introduced in [KPS02, Kuk02, Kuk06] in the context of randomly forced PDEs, and some ideas suggested in [Shi15, KNS20] to prove mixing with the help of controllability properties of an associated system</description>

      <title>On Multiparameter Generalized Counting Process and its Time-Changed Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a multiparameter version of the generalized counting process (GCP), where there is a possibility of finitely many arrivals simultaneously. We call it the multiparameter GCP. In a particular case, it is uniquely represented as a weighted sum of independent multiparameter Poisson processes. For a specific case, we establish a relationship between the multiparameter GCP and the sum of independent GCPs. Some of its time-changed variants are studied where the time-changing components used are the multiparameter stable subordinator and the multiparameter inverse stable subordinator. An integral of the multiparameter GCP is defined, and its asymptotic distribution is obtained.</description>

      <title>A Malliavin-Gamma calculus approach to Score Based Diffusion Generative models for random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We adopt a Gamma and Malliavin Calculi point of view in order to generalize Score-based diffusion Generative Models (SGMs) to an infinite-dimensional abstract Hilbertian setting. Particularly, we define the forward noising process using Dirichlet forms associated to the Cameron-Martin space of Gaussian measures and Wiener chaoses; whereas by relying on an abstract time-reversal formula, we show that the score function is a Malliavin derivative and it corresponds to a conditional expectation. This allows us to generalize SGMs to the infinite-dimensional setting. Moreover, we extend existing finite-dimensional entropic convergence bounds to this Hilbertian setting by highlighting the role played by the Cameron-Martin norm in the Fisher information of the data distribution. Lastly, we specify our discussion for spherical random fields, considering as source of noise a Whittle-Mat\'ern random spherical field.</description>

      <title>Coagulation-Fragmentation Duality of Infinitely Exchangeable Partitions from Coupled Mixed Poisson Species Sampling Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jim Pitman's~(1999) celebrated coagulation-fragmentation duality for the PD($\alpha$,$\theta$) family of laws of Pitman and Marc Yor~(1997) has resisted generalization beyond its canonical setting. We resolve this by introducing a novel, four-part coupled process built upon the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP), a framework developed for modeling microbiome species sampling. This approach yields a tractable generalization of the duality in two fundamental directions: to processes driven by arbitrary subordinators and to the previously uncharacterised multi-group ($J \ge 1$) setting, providing explicit laws for both.
  The static, fixed-time partitions are revealed to be a single projection of an inherently dynamic system. This new construction simultaneously defines: (i) the fine-grained partition, (ii) its coagulation operator, (iii) a forward-in-time system of coupled, time-homogeneous fragmentation processes in the sense of Jean Bertoin~(2006), and (iv) a dual, backward-in-time structured coalescent that drives simultaneous, across-group merger events. All four components are governed by a unified compositional structure, yielding their exact compound Poisson representations. The hallmark of this work is its circumvention of direct, and often intractable, analysis on mass and integer partition spaces. By shifting the problem to this transparent framework, the generalized duality emerges as a natural consequence of the architecture itself.</description>

      <title>Covering the hypercube, the uncertainty principle, and an interpolation formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the minimal number of skewed hyperplanes that cover the hypercube $\{0,1\}^{n}$ is at least $\frac{n}{2}+1$, and there are infinitely many $n$'s when the hypercube can be covered with $n-\log_{2}(n)+1$ skewed hyperplanes. The minimal covering problems are closely related to uncertainty principle on the hypercube, where we also obtain an interpolation formula for multilinear polynomials on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ of degree less than $\lfloor n/m \rfloor$ by showing that its coefficients corresponding to the largest monomials can be represented as a linear combination of values of the polynomial over the points $\{0,1\}^{n}$ whose hamming weights are divisible by $m$.</description>

      <title>Restricted Spectral Gap Decomposition for Simulated Tempering Targeting Mixture Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulated tempering is a widely used strategy for sampling from multimodal distributions. In this paper, we consider simulated tempering combined with an arbitrary local Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler and present a new decomposition theorem that provides a lower bound on the restricted spectral gap of the algorithm for sampling from mixture distributions. By working with the restricted spectral gap, the applicability of our results is extended to broader settings such as when the usual spectral gap is difficult to bound or becomes degenerate. We demonstrate the application of our theoretical results by analyzing simulated tempering combined with random walk Metropolis--Hastings for sampling from mixtures of Gaussian distributions. Our complexity bound scales polynomially with the separation between modes, logarithmically with $1/\varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ denotes the target accuracy in total variation distance, and exponentially with the dimension $d$.</description>
