      <title>Persistence of Deuterium and Tritium Nuclear Spin-Polarization in Presence of High-Frequency Plasma Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present first-principles numerical calculations of the depolarization rate of spin-polarized deuterium and tritium nuclei in realistic tokamak plasmas, driven by resonant interactions with plasma waves. Backed up by first-of-a-kind linear and nonlinear simulations, we find that alpha particle-driven Alfv\'enic modes cause only negligible depolarization, which is contrary to expectations in prior literature. Other Alfv\'enic instabilities can in principle degrade polarization, but only under conditions unlikely to be realized on transport timescales. By combining full-orbit particle tracing with a dedicated depolarization solver, we demonstrate that wave-driven depolarization is surprisingly weak in SPARC and ITER-scale devices. These results provide strong evidence that spin-polarized fuel can maintain its polarization long enough to boost fusion reactivity, opening a viable path toward substantially enhanced performance in magnetic confinement fusion power plants.</description>

      <title>Validation of ERMES 20.0 finite element code for MAST Upgrade O-X mode conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the validation of the frequency-domain finite element code ERMES 20.0, benchmarked against Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) solvers. The simulations focus on Ordinary-Extraordinary (O-X) mode conversion in the Electron Bernstein Wave (EBW) regime of the MAST Upgrade experiment. Validation is performed in terms of mode conversion efficiency and wave propagation characteristics. Several finite element formulations are tested and compared with the FDTD results. The simulations demonstrate excellent agreement between the different approaches, confirming the accuracy and robustness of ERMES 20.0 for modeling cold plasma wave interactions.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Generation of Dense, Multi-GeV, Longitudinally-Polarized Positron Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The production of high-yield, longitudinally polarized positron beams represents an outstanding challenge in advanced accelerator science. Laser-driven schemes offer a compact alternative but typically yield only transverse polarization, or require pre-polarized electron beams, and struggle to efficiently accelerate positrons to high energies. Here, we introduce an all-optical scheme that overcomes these limitations by integrating positron generation, acceleration, and spin manipulation in a unified framework. Through a head-on collision between an ultraintense, circularly polarized laser pulse and a counterpropagating unpolarized electron beam, we drive a robust QED cascade. The nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process within the cascade produces positrons that are born directly within the strong laser field. Crucially, these positrons are instantaneously captured and accelerated to multi-GeV energies (up to $\sim$9 GeV) via a direct laser acceleration mechanism, while their spins are simultaneously rotated to longitudinal alignment by the field dynamics. Our Monte-Carlo simulations confirm the simultaneous achievement of a high positron yield ($\sim$20 $e^+/e^-$), a high average longitudinal polarization ($\sim$50\%), and GeV-scale energies. This all-optical source, feasible at upcoming ultraintense laser facilities, presents a compact and efficient solution for applications in collider physics and fundamental high-energy experiments.</description>

      <title>BABY 1L: First Tritium Breeding Campaign Results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving tritium self-sufficiency is a critical challenge for future fusion power plants. The BABY 1L experiment, part of the LIBRA project at MIT, aims to benchmark tritium breeding and release in molten salt breeder systems under deuterium-tritium (DT) neutron irradiation. Building on the initial \SI{100}{mL} campaign, BABY 1L introduces a tenfold increase in breeder volume, improved thermal and gas handling systems, and enhanced neutron diagnostics, including a proton recoil telescope. We report on results from four irradiation experiments using sealed-tube DT neutron generators, with tritium collected by water bubblers measured via liquid scintillation counting. Experimentally determined Tritium Breeding Ratios (TBRs) were compared to OpenMC neutronics simulations, showing very good agreement. The measured TBR values demonstrate a six-fold improvement over the \SI{100}{mL} experiments, largely attributed to the increased solid angle and improved measurement fidelity. We also investigate tritium release dynamics and identify diffusion-limited transport as the dominant regime in the salt volume in the temperature range 630-750 \si{\celsius}. Additionally, we observe that the introduction of hydrogen in the helium carrier gas significantly accelerates tritium release, consistent with an isotopic exchange mechanism. All analysis is conducted through the open-source \texttt{libra-toolbox} \cite{libra-toolbox}, which streamlines simulation, data processing, and validation across experimental campaigns. These results provide critical insights into the design and operation of future liquid breeder systems and demonstrate the maturity of the BABY platform as a testbed for tritium breeding studies.</description>

      <title>Supergranulation and poleward migration of the magnetic field at high latitudes of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetoconvection at the solar surface governs the dynamics in the upper solar atmosphere and sustains the heliosphere. Properties of this fundamental process are poorly described near the solar poles. Here we report the first out-of-ecliptic remote-sensing observations of the south pole of the Sun from a high-latitude campaign of the Solar Orbiter spacecraft which reveal spatial and temporal evolution of supergranular convective cells. The supergranular cells have spatial scales of 20--40\,Mm. From eight days of observations starting on 2025 March 16, our analysis shows that the magnetic network migrates poleward, on average, at high latitudes (above 60\textdegree), with speeds in the range of 10--20\,m\,s$^{-1}$, depending on the structures being tracked. These results shed light on the buildup of the polar magnetic field that is central to our understanding of the solar cycle and the heliospheric magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Omnigenous umbilic stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To better understand the dependence of the magnetic field structure in the plasma edge on the plasma boundary shape, in the context of X-point and island divertor designs, we define and develop a class of stellarators called umbilic stellarators. These equilibria are characterized by a single continuous high-curvature edge on the plasma boundary that goes around multiple times toroidally before meeting itself. We develop a technique that allows us to simultaneously optimize the plasma boundary along with a curve lying on the boundary on which we impose a high curvature while imposing omnigenity -- a property of the magnetic field that ensures trapped particle confinement throughout the plasma volume. We find that umbilic stellarators naturally tend to favor piecewise omnigenity instead of omnigenity with a specific helicity. After generating omnigenous umbilic stellarators, we design coil sets for some of them and explore the field line structure in the edge and its sensitivity to small fluctuations in the plasma. Finally, using single-stage optimization, we simultaneously modify the plasma and coil shape and propose an experiment to modify an existing tokamak to a finite-beta stellarator using this technique and explore a potentially simpler way to convert a limited tokamak into a diverted stellarator.</description>

      <title>Collisionless relaxation to equilibrium distributions in cold dark matter halos: origin of the NFW profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collisionless self-gravitating systems such as cold dark matter halos are known to harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation in the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The origin of such states has been a persistent mystery, particularly because the physics of collisionless relaxation has remained poorly understood. To solve this long-standing problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation that describes the secular evolution of the mean coarse-grained distribution function $f_0$ of accreted matter in the fluctuating force field of a spherical isotropic halo. The diffusion coefficient not only depends on the fluctuation power spectrum but also on the evolving potential of the system, which reflects the self-consistency of the problem. Diffusive heating by an initially cored halo develops an $r^{-1}$ cusp in the density profile of the accreted material, with $r$ the halocentric radius, if it is initially shallower than $r^{-1}$. This is fundamentally a consequence of the virial theorem: self-gravitating systems have a negative specific heat and want to cool down when energized. The inner halo relaxes to an $r^{-1}$ cusp because its central region is the coldest among all $r^{-\gamma}$ profiles with $0\leq \gamma \leq 2$. Accretion and relaxation in the $r^{-1}$ cusp develops an $r^{-3}$ outer fall-off, thereby establishing the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile. We demonstrate for the first time that this profile emerges as a steady state solution to the problem of self-consistent collisionless relaxation.</description>

      <title>Virtual states and exponential decay in small-scale dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the Kazantsev theory of small-scale dynamo generation at small Prandtl numbers near the generation threshold and restore the concordance between the theory and numerical simulations: the theory predicted a power-law decay below the threshold, while simulations demonstrate exponential decay. We show that the exponential decay is temporary and owes its existence to the flattening of the velocity correlator at large scales. This effect corresponds to the existence of a long-living virtual level in the corresponding Schrodinger type equation. We also find the critical Reynolds number and the increment of growth/decay above and under the threshold; we express them in terms of the quantitative characteristic properties of the velocity correlator, which makes it possible to compare the results with the data of different simulations.</description>
