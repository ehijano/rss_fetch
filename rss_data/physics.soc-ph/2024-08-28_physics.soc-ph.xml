      <title>Connecting Mass-action Models and Network Models for Infectious Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infectious disease modeling is used to forecast epidemics and assess the effectiveness of intervention strategies. Although the core assumption of mass-action models of homogeneously mixed population is often implausible, they are nevertheless routinely used in studying epidemics and provide useful insights. Network models can account for the heterogeneous mixing of populations, which is especially important for studying sexually transmitted diseases. Despite the abundance of research on mass-action and network models, the relationship between them is not well understood. Here, we attempt to bridge the gap by first identifying a spreading rule that results in an exact match between disease spreading on a fully connected network and the classic mass-action models. We then propose a method for mapping epidemic spread on arbitrary networks to a form similar to that of mass-action models. We also provide a theoretical justification for the procedure. Finally, we show the advantages of the proposed methods using synthetic data that is based on an empirical network. These findings help us understand when mass-action models and network models are expected to provide similar results and identify reasons when they do not.</description>

      <title>Recent Decade's Power Outage Data Reveals the Increasing Vulnerability of U.S. Power Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant anecdotal evidence regarding the vulnerability of the U.S. power infrastructure, there is a dearth of longitudinal and nation-level characterization of the spatial and temporal patterns in the frequency and extent of power outages. A data-driven national-level characterization of power outage vulnerability is particularly essential for understanding the urgency and formulating policies to promote the resilience of power infrastructure systems. Recognizing this, we retrieved 179,053,397 county-level power outage records with a 15-minute interval across 3,022 US counties during 2014-2023 to capture power outage characteristics. We focus on three dimensions--power outage intensity, frequency, and duration--and develop multiple metrics to quantify each dimension of power outage vulnerability. The results show that in the past ten years, the vulnerability of U.S. power system has consistently been increasing. Counties experienced an average of 999.4 outages over the decade, affecting an average of more than 540,000 customers per county, with disruptions occurring approximately every week. Coastal areas, particularly in California, Florida and New Jersey, faced more frequent and prolonged outages, while inland regions showed higher outage rates. A concerning increase in outage frequency and intensity was noted, especially after 2017, with a sharp rise in prolonged outages since 2019. The research also found positive association between social vulnerability and outage metrics, with the association becoming stronger over the years under study. Areas with higher social vulnerability experienced more severe and frequent outages, exacerbating challenges in these regions. These findings reveal the much-needed empirical evidence for stakeholders to inform policy formulation and program development for enhancing the resilience of the U.S. power infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Regional emission dynamics across phases of the EU ETS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between economic growth and CO$_2$ emissions across European regions from 1990 to 2022, specifically concerning the dynamics of emissions growth rates through different phases of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). We find that emissions dynamics exhibit significant volatility influenced by changing policy frameworks. Furthermore, the distribution of emissions growth rates is asymmetric and displays fat tails, suggesting the potential for extreme emissions events. We identify marked disparities across regions: less developed regions experience higher emissions growth rates and greater volatility compared to many developed areas, which show a trend of declining emissions and reduced volatility. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of emissions to policy changes and emphasise the need for clear and effective governance in emissions trading schemes.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Barriers of Urban Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Barriers in cities, such as administrative boundaries, natural obstacles, railways or major roads are thought to induce segregation. However, the empirical knowledge about this phenomenon is limited. Here, we present a network science framework to assess barriers to urban mobility along their hierarchy, across residential areas and visited amenities. Using GPS mobility data, we construct a network of blocks from the sequence of individual stays in a major European city. A community detection algorithm allows us to partition this network into non-overlapping areas of dense mobility clusters, in which the effect of transportation hubs can be tuned with a parameter. We apply the Symmetric Area Difference index to quantify the overlap between these mobility clusters and the polygons of urban area separated by barriers. Reducing the effect of transportation hubs results in smaller scale mobility clusters that fit better to lower rank administrative or road barriers compared to their higher rank pairs. We find that characteristic urban barriers can replace each other in dividing mobility clusters of different scales. Next, we define the Barrier Crossing Ratio, the fraction of barrier crossings that bridge mobility clusters. The decomposition of this indicator by origins and destinations suggests a significantly higher impact of barriers on those who live closer to the city center and smaller impact on visits to complex amenities. These results contribute to the ongoing discourse on urban segregation, emphasizing the importance of barriers to urban mobility in shaping interactions and mixing.</description>
