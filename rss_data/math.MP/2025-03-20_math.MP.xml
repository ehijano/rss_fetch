      <title>Long-Moody construction of braid group representations and Haraoka's multiplicative middle convolution for KZ-type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a correspondence between algebraic and analytic approaches to constructing representations of the braid group $B_n$, namely Katz-Long-Moody construction and multiplicative middle convolution for Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ)-type equations, respectively. By the left action of the braid group $B_n$ on the free group $F_n$, known as the Artin representation, the semidirect product can be defined $F_n \rtimes B_n$. The Long-Moody construction \cite{long1994constructing} provides a method to construct linear representations of $B_n$ from any given representation of $F_n \rtimes B_n$. The Katz-Long-Moody construction generalizes this approach, yielding an infinite sequence of representations of $F_n \rtimes B_n$ \cite{hiroe2023long}. On the other hand, the fundamental group of the domain of the $n$-valued KZ-type equation is isomorphic to the pure braid group $P_n$. The multiplicative middle convolution for the KZ-type equation provides an antirepresentation of $P_n$, derived from a given antirepresentation of $P_n$ \cite{haraoka2020multiplicative}. Furthermore, we show that this construction preserves unitarity relative to a Hermitian matrix $\widetilde{H}_{\widetilde{p}, \widetilde{q}}$, and established an algorithm to determine the signature of the Hermitian matrix $\widetilde{H}_{\widetilde{p}, \widetilde{q}}$.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle solutions to the 1D nonlocal Fisher--KPP equation with a fractal time derivative in the weak diffusion approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach for constructing quasiparticle-like asymptotic solutions within the weak diffusion approximation for the generalized population Fisher--Kolmogorov--Petrovskii--Piskunov (Fisher--KPP) equation, which incorporates nonlocal quadratic competitive losses and a fractal time derivative of non-integer order $\alpha$, where $0&lt;\alpha\leq 1$. This approach is based on the semiclassical approximation and the principles of the Maslov method. The fractal time derivative is introduced in the framework of $F^{\alpha}$-calculus. The Fisher--KPP equation is decomposed into a system of nonlinear equations that describe the dynamics of interacting quasiparticles within classes of trajectory-concentrated functions. A key element in constructing approximate quasiparticle solutions is the interplay between the dynamical system of quasiparticle moments and an auxiliary linear system of equations, which is coupled with the nonlinear system. General constructions are illustrated through examples that examine the effect of the fractal parameter $\alpha$ on quasiparticle behavior.</description>

      <title>System of stochastic interacting wave functions that model quantum measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a system of non-linear stochastic evolution equations that describes the continuous measurements of quantum systems with mixed initial state. We address quantum systems with unbounded Hamiltonians and unbounded interaction operators. Using arguments of the theory of quantum measurements we derive a system of stochastic interacting wave functions (SIWF for short) that models the continuous monitoring of quantum systems. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to this system under conditions general enough for the applications. We obtain that the mixed state generated by the SIWF at any time does not depend on the initial state, and satisfies the diffusive stochastic quantum master equation, which is also known as Belavkin equation. We present two physical examples. In one, the SIWF becomes a system of non-linear stochastic partial differential equations. In the other, we deal with a model of a circuit quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Higher order tacnodes in a free fermionic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a free fermion model with nearest and next-nearest neighbor hopping, evolving in imaginary time from a product state with N consecutive fermions, and conditioned to go back to the same state after a given time. In the case of nearest neighbor hoppings, this model is known to give rise to limit shapes and arctic curves for large time and fermion number, with in particular two fluctuating regions which can be tuned to merge depending on ratio between time and N. Fluctuations near the merger are governed by a so-called tacnode kernel. In this paper we study the analogous picture in the presence of a next nearest interactions. In particular, we discuss the limit shapes, and compute analytically the corresponding density profile. We also study the behavior of correlations close to the merger point, and find a novel higher order tacnode kernel governing them.</description>

      <title>Yang-Lee Zeros of 2D Nearest-Neighbor Antiferromagnetic Ising Models: A Numerical Linked Cluster Expansion Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Yang-Lee zeros in the thermodynamic limit of the 2D nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic Ising model on square and triangular lattices. We employ the Numerical Linked Cluster Expansion (NLCE) equipped with Exact Enumeration (EE) of the partition function to estimate the Laplacian of the free energy, which is proportional to the zeros density. Using a modified NLCE, where the expansion can be carried directly on the Yang-Lee zeros of the involved clusters, we estimate the density of Yang-Lee zeros in the thermodynamic limit. NLCE gives significantly more zeros than EE in the complex field plane providing more insights on how the root curves look in the thermodynamic limit. For the square lattice at $T \ll T_c$, the results suggest that two vertical lines at $\pm h_c(T)$ in the complex field plane (i.e two concentric circles in the complex fugacity plane) are the thermodynamic root curves. A similar picture is expected for the triangular lattice for phase transitions at large values of magnetic field while further study is needed for phase transitions at smaller values of magnetic field. The convergence of the NLCE and (EE) calculations of the partition function to the thermodynamic limit is studied in both lattices and the temperature-field phase diagram is obtained from Yang-Lee zeros using both methods. This NLCE-based approach will facilitate the study of different types of phase transitions using Yang-Lee zeros in future research.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian chaos and unique ergodicity for stochastic primitive equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Lagrangian flow associated with the stochastic 3D primitive equations (PEs) with non-degenerate noise is chaotic, i.e., the corresponding top Lyapunov exponent is strictly positive almost surely. This result builds on the landmark work by Bedrossian, Blumenthal, and Punshon-Smith on Lagrangian chaos in stochastic fluid mechanics. Our primary contribution is establishing an instance where Lagrangian chaos can be proven for a fluid flow with supercritical energy, a key characteristic of 3D fluid dynamics. For the 3D PEs, establishing the existence of the top Lyapunov exponent is already a challenging task. We address this difficulty by deriving new estimates for the invariant measures of the 3D PEs, which capture the anisotropic smoothing in the dynamics of the PEs. As a by-product of our results, we also obtain the first uniqueness result for invariant measures of stochastic PEs.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Supersonic flows for the steady Euler-Poisson system in divergent nozzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the unique existence of an axisymmetric supersonic solution with nonzero vorticity and nonzero angular momentum density for the steady Euler-Poisson system in three-dimensional divergent nozzles when prescribing the velocity, strength of electric field, and the entropy at the entrance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the three-dimensional divergent nozzle problem for the steady Euler-Poisson system. We first solve the reformulated problem via the method of the Helmholtz decomposition and obtain a strong solution with a Sobolev norm. Then, using the fact that the longitudinal axis is the axis of the time-like variable, we apply the standard elliptic theory for the interior regularity to see that the solution is a classical solution. Furthermore, we deal carefully with singularity issues related to the polar angle on the axis of the divergent nozzle.</description>

      <title>Resetting Dyson Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new stochastic process of $N$ interacting particles on the line that evolve via Dyson Brownian motion (DBM) with Dyson's index $\beta &gt; 0$ and undergo simultaneous resetting to their initial positions at a constant rate $r$. We call this process the resetting Dyson Brownian motion (RDBM) -- in short the $\beta$-RDBM. For $\beta = 1,2,4$, the positions of the particles in the RDBM can be interpreted as the eigenvalues of a random matrix ensemble where the entries of an $N x N$ Gaussian matrix evolve as simultaneously resetting Brownian motions (with rate $r$) in the presence or absence of a harmonic trap. For $r=0$ and in the presence of a harmonic trap, this system reaches an equilibrium Gibbs-Boltzmann state of the so called Dyson log-gas. However, the stochastic resetting drives the system at long time to a nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS). We compute exactly the joint distribution of the positions of the particles in this NESS for all $\beta&gt;0$ and calculate several observables for large $N$: the average density profile of the gas, the extreme value statistics, the spacing between two consecutive particles and the full counting statistics. We show that a nonzero resetting rate $r&gt;0$ drastically changes the nature of the fluctuations in the stationary state: while the log-gas is rather rigid, the $\beta$-RDBM in its NESS becomes fluffy, i.e., the fluctuations of different observables are of the same order as their mean. In the absence of a harmonic trap, our results for the $\beta = 2$-RDBM can be related to nonintersecting Brownian motions in the presence of resetting. Our model demonstrates interesting effects arising from the interplay between the eigenvalue repulsion and the all-to-all attraction (generated by stochastic resetting) in an interacting particle system. Numerical simulations are in excellent agreement with our analytical results.</description>

      <title>A Constrained Saddle Search Approach for Constructing Singular and Flexible Bar Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singularity analysis is essential in robot kinematics, as singular configurations cause loss of control and kinematic indeterminacy. This paper models singularities in bar frameworks as saddle points on constrained manifolds. Given an under-constrained, non-singular bar framework, by allowing one edge to vary its length while fixing lengths of others, we define the squared length of the free edge as an energy functional and show that its local saddle points correspond to singular and flexible frameworks. Using our constrained saddle search approach, we identify previously unknown singular and flexible bar frameworks, providing new insights into singular robotics design and analysis.</description>

      <title>Perturbed Fourier Transform Associated with Schr\"odinger Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an exposition on the $L^2$ theory of the perturbed Fourier transform associated with a Schr\"odinger operator $H=-d^2/dx^2 +V$ on the real line, where $V$ is a real-valued \mbox{finite} measure. In the case $V\in L^1\cap L^2$, we explicitly define the perturbed Fourier transform $\mathcal{F}$ for $H$ and obtain an eigenfunction expansion theorem for square integrable functions. This provides a complete proof of the inversion formula for $\cF$ that covers the class of short range potentials in $(1+|x|)^{-\frac12-\eps} L^2 $. Such paradigm has applications in the study of scattering problems in connection with the spectral properties and asymptotic completeness of the wave operators.</description>

      <title>Real Eigenvalues of Asymmetric Wishart Matrices: Expected Number, Global Density and Integrable Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the real eigenvalues of asymmetric Wishart matrices of size $N$, indexed by the rectangular parameter $\nu \in \mathbb{N}$ and the non-Hermiticity parameter $\tau \in [0,1]$. The rectangular parameter $\nu$ is either fixed or proportional to $N$. The non-Hermiticity parameter $\tau$ is either fixed or $\tau = 1 - O(1/N)$, corresponding to the strongly and weakly non-Hermitian regimes, respectively.
  We establish a decomposition structure for the finite-$N$ correlation kernel of the real eigenvalues, which form Pfaffian point processes. Taking the symmetric limit $\tau = 1$, where the model reduces to the Laguerre orthogonal ensemble, this decomposition structure reduces to the known rank-one perturbation structure established by Adler, Forrester, Nagao, and van Moerbeke, as well as by Widom. Using the decomposition structure, we show that the expected number of real eigenvalues is proportional to $\sqrt{N}$ in the strongly non-Hermitian regime and to $N$ in the weakly non-Hermitian regime, providing explicit leading coefficients in both cases. Furthermore, we derive the limiting real eigenvalue densities, which recovers the Marchenko-Pastur distribution in the symmetric limit.</description>

Abstract: The system of interacting Brownian motions, where a particle is reflected asymmetrically from its left neighbor, belongs to the KPZ universality class, with multi-point asymptotics having been derived in previous works. In this paper we show upper tail large deviation principles for all three fundamental initial conditions, including explicit calculation of the rate function. For the periodic case the Lambert-W function, which is already present in the Fredholm determinant formula, also appears in the rate function.</description>

      <title>Exact calculation of spectral properties of a particle interacting with a one-dimensional Fermi gas in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using the exact Bethe wavefunctions of the one-dimensional Hubbard model with $N$ spin-up fermions and one spin-down impurity, we derive an analytic expression of the impurity form factor, in the form of a determinant of a $(N+1)$ by $(N+1)$ matrix. This analytic expression enables us to exactly calculate spectral properties of one-dimensional Fermi polarons in lattices, when the masses of the impurity particle and the Fermi bath are equal. We present the impurity spectral function as functions of the on-site interaction strength and the filling factor of the Fermi bath, and discuss the origin of Fermi singularities in the spectral function at small momentum and the emergence of polaron quasiparticles at large momentum near the boundary of Brillouin zone. Our analytic expression of the impurity form factors pave the way to exploring the intriguing dynamics of a particle interacting with a Fermi bath. Our exact predictions on the impurity spectral function could be directly examined in cold-atom laboratories by using the radio-frequency spectroscopy and Ramsey spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Instability of the peaked traveling wave in a local model for shallow water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The traveling wave with the peaked profile arises in the limit of the family of traveling waves with the smooth profiles. We study the linear and nonlinear stability of the peaked traveling wave by using a local model for shallow water waves, which is related to the Hunter--Saxton equation. The evolution problem is well-defined in the function space $H^1_{\rm per} \cap W^{1,\infty}$, where we derive the linearized equations of motion and study the nonlinear evolution of co-periodic perturbations to the peaked periodic wave by using methods of characteristics. Within the linearized equations, we prove the spectral instability of the peaked traveling wave from the spectrum of the linearized operator in a Hilbert space, which completely covers the closed vertical strip with a specific half-width. Within the nonlinear equations, we prove the nonlinear instability of the peaked traveling wave by showing that the gradient of perturbations grow at the wave peak. By using numerical approximations of the smooth traveling waves and the spectrum of their associated linearized operator, we show that the spectral instability of the peaked traveling wave cannot be obtained in the limit along the family of the spectrally stable smooth traveling waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize a general traveling periodic wave of the defocusing mKdV (modified Korteweg--de Vries) equation by using a quotient of products of Jacobi's elliptic theta functions. Compared to the standing periodic wave of the defocusing NLS (nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger) equation, these solutions are special cases of Riemann's theta function of genus two. Based on our characterization, we derive a new two-parameter solution form which defines a general three-parameter solution form with the scaling transformation. Eigenfunctions of the Lax system for the general traveling periodic wave are also characterized as quotients of products of Jacobi's theta functions. As the main outcome of our analytical computations, we derive a new solution of the defocusing mKdV equation which describes the kink breather propagating on a general traveling wave background.</description>

      <title>Classification of locality preserving symmetries on spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the action of a finite group $G$ by locality preserving automorphisms (quantum cellular automata) on quantum spin chains. We refer to such group actions as ``symmetries''. The natural notion of equivalence for such symmetries is \emph{stable equivalence}, which allows for stacking with factorized group actions. Stacking also endows the set of equivalence classes with a group structure. We prove that the anomaly of such symmetries provides an isomorphism between the group of stable equivalence classes of symmetries with the cohomology group $H^3(G,U(1))$, consistent with previous conjectures. This amounts to a complete classification of locality preserving symmetries on spin chains. We further show that a locality preserving symmetry is stably equivalent to one that can be presented by finite depth quantum circuits with covariant gates if and only if the slant product of its anomaly is trivial in $H^2(G, U(1)[G])$.</description>

      <title>Gibbs Properties of Equilibrium States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of equivalence of Gibbs states and equilibrium states for continuous potentials on full shift spaces $E^{\mathbb{Z}}$. Sinai, Bowen, Ruelle and others established equivalence under various assumptions on the potential $\phi$. At the same time, it is known that every ergodic measure is an equilibrium state for some continuous potential. This means that the equivalence can occur only under some appropriate conditions on the potential function. In this paper, we identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for the equivalence.</description>

      <title>The importance of being empty: a spectral approach to Hopfield neural networks with diluted examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Hopfield networks, where neurons interact pair-wise by Hebbian couplings built over $i$. a set of definite patterns (ground truths), $ii$. a sample of labeled examples (supervised setting), $iii$. a sample of unlabeled examples (unsupervised setting). We focus on the case where ground-truths are Rademacher vectors and examples are noisy versions of these ground-truths, possibly displaying some blank entries (e.g., mimicking missing or dropped data), and we determine the spectral distribution of the coupling matrices in the three scenarios, by exploiting and extending the Marchenko-Pastur theorem. By levering this knowledge, we are able to analytically inspect the stability and attractiveness of the ground truths, as well as the generalization capabilities of the networks. In particular, as corroborated by long-running Monte Carlo simulations, the presence of black entries can have benefits in some specific conditions, suggesting strategies based on data sparsification; the robustness of these results in structured datasets is confirmed numerically. Finally, we demonstrate that the Hebbian matrix, built on sparse examples, can be recovered as the fixed point of a gradient descent algorithm with dropout, over a suitable loss function.</description>

      <title>Separation of variables for higher rank integrable models: review of recent progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Separation of variables (SoV) is a powerful method expected to be applicable for a wide range of quantum integrable systems, from models in condensed matter physics to gauge and string theories. Yet its full implementation for many higher rank examples, such as SU(N) spin chains with N&gt;2, has remained elusive for a long time. In this pedagogical review we discuss the major progress achieved recently in understanding SoV for models of this type. In particular, for rational SU(N) spin chains we describe different constructions of the SoV basis, novel compact forms for spin chain eigenstates, the functional SoV approach, and explicit computation of the SoV measure. We also discuss key first applications of these results, namely the new compact determinant representations for many observables such as scalar products and correlators.</description>

      <title>Quantized Coulomb branch of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $Sp(N)$ gauge theory and spherical DAHA of $(C_N^{\vee}, C_N)$-type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study BPS loop operators in a 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $Sp(N)$ gauge theory with four hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation and one hypermultiplet in the anti-symmetric representation. The algebra of BPS loop operators in the $\Omega$-background provides a deformation quantization of the Coulomb branch, which is expected to coincide with the quantized K-theoretic Coulomb branch in the mathematical literature. For the rank-one case, i.e., $Sp(1) \simeq SU(2)$, we show that the quantization of the Coulomb branch, evaluated using the supersymmetric localization formula, agrees with the polynomial representation of the spherical part of the double affine Hecke algebra (spherical DAHA) of $(C_1^{\vee}, C_1)$-type. For higher-rank cases, where $N \geq 2$, we conjecture that the quantized Coulomb branch of the 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $Sp(N)$ gauge theory is isomorphic to the spherical DAHA of $(C_N^{\vee}, C_N)$-type . As evidence for this conjecture, we demonstrate that the quantization of an 't Hooft loop agrees with the Koornwinder operator in the polynomial representation of the spherical DAHA.</description>

      <title>Foundation of classical dynamical density functional theory: uniqueness of time-dependent density-potential mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When can we map a classical density profile to an external potential? In equilibrium, without time dependence, the one-body density is known to specify the external potential that is applied to the many-body system. This mapping from a density to the potential is the cornerstone of classical density functional theory (DFT). Here, we consider non-equilibrium, time-dependent many-body systems that evolve from a given initial condition. We derive explicit conditions, for example, no flux at the boundary, that ensure that the mapping from the density to a time-dependent external potential is unique. We thus prove the underlying assertion of dynamical density functional theory (DDFT), without resorting to the so-called adiabatic approximation often used in applications. By ascertaining uniqueness for all $n$-body densities, we ensure that the proof and the physical conclusions drawn from it hold for general superadiabatic dynamics of interacting systems even in the presence of (known) non-conservative forces.</description>

      <title>Emergence of the polydeterminant in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalization of the determinant appears in particle physics in effective Lagrangian interaction terms that model the chiral anomaly in Quantum Chromodynamics (PRD 97 (2018) 9, 091901 PRD 109 (2024) 7, L071502), in particular in connection to mesons. This \textit{polydeterminant function}, known in the mathematical literature as a mixed discriminant, associates $N$ distinct $N\times N$ complex matrices into a complex number and reduces to the usual determinant when all matrices are taken as equal. Here, we explore the main properties of the polydeterminant applied to (quantum) fields by using a formalism and a language close to high-energy physics approaches. We discuss its use as a tool to write down novel Lagrangian terms and present an explicit illustrative model for mesons. Finally, the extension of the polydeterminant as a function of tensors is shown.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Operator Superalgebras and BFV-BRST Operators for Lagrangian Description of Mixed-symmetry HS Fields in AdS Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0812.2329</link>
      <description>arXiv:0812.2329v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of nonlinear superalgebras $\mathcal{A}$ and algebras $\mathcal{A}_b$ arising from a one-to-one correspondence between the sets of relations that extract AdS-group irreducible representations $D(E_0,s_1,s_2)$ in AdS$_d$-spaces and the sets of operators that form $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{A}_b$, respectively, for fermionic, $s_i=n_i+{1/2}$, and bosonic, $s_i=n_i$, $n_i \in \mathbb{N}_0$, $i=1,2$, HS fields characterized by a Young tableaux with two rows. We consider a method of constructing the Verma modules $V_\mathcal{A}$, $V_{\mathcal{A}_b}$ for $\mathcal{A}$, $\mathcal{A}_b$ and establish a possibility of their Fock-space realizations in terms of formal power series in oscillator operators which serve to realize an additive conversion of the above (super)algebra ($\mathcal{A}$) $\mathcal{A}_b$, containing a set of 2nd-class constraints, into a converted (super)algebra $\mathcal{A}_{b{}c}$ = $\mathcal{A}_{b}$ + $\mathcal{A}'_b$ ($\mathcal{A}_c$ = $\mathcal{A}$ + $\mathcal{A}'$), containing a set of 1st-class constraints only. For the algebra $\mathcal{A}_{b{}c}$, we construct an exact nilpotent BFV--BRST operator $Q'$ having nonvanishing terms of 3rd degree in the powers of ghost coordinates and use $Q'$ to construct a gauge-invariant Lagrangian formulation (LF) for HS fields with a given mass $m$ (energy $E_0(m)$) and generalized spin $\mathbf{s}$=$(s_1,s_2)$. LFs with off-shell algebraic constraints are examined as well.</description>

      <title>Entropic partial orderings of quantum measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate four partial orderings on the space of quantum measurements (i.e on POVMs or positive operator valued measures), describing four notions of coarse/fine-ness of measurement. These are the partial orderings induced by: (1) classical post-processing, (2) measured relative entropy, (3) observational entropy, and (4) linear relation of POVMs. The orderings form a hierarchy of implication, where e.g. post-processing relation implies all the others. We show that this hierarchy is strict for general POVMs, with examples showing that all four orderings are strictly inequivalent. Restricted to projective measurements, all are equivalent. Finally we show that observational entropy equality $S_M = S_N$ (for all $\rho$) holds if and only if $M \equiv N$ are post-processing equivalent, which shows that the first three orderings induce identical equivalence classes.</description>

Abstract: The two-dimensional one-component plasma (OCP) is a model of electrically charged particles which are embedded in a uniform background of the opposite charge, and interact through a logarithmic potential. More than 30 years ago, Jancovici, Lebowitz and Manificat discovered an asymptotic law for probabilities of large charge fluctuations in the OCP. We prove that this law holds for the hierarchical counterpart of the OCP. The hierarchical model was recently introduced by Chatterjee, and is inspired by Dyson's hierarchical model of the Ising ferromagnet.</description>

      <title>Exploring $G$-ality defects in 2-dim QFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Tambara-Yamagami (TY) fusion category symmetry $\text{TY}(\mathbb{A},\chi,\epsilon)$ describes the enhanced non-invertible self-duality symmetry of a $2$-dim QFT under gauging a finite Abelian group $\mathbb{A}$. We generalize the enhanced non-invertible symmetries by considering twisted gauging which allows stacking $\mathbb{A}$-SPT before and after the gauging. Such non-invertible symmetries correspond to invertible anyon permutation symmetries of the $3$-dim SymTFT. Consider a finite group $G$ formed by (un)twisted gaugings of $\mathbb{A}$, a $2$-dim QFT invariant under topological manipulations in $G$ admits non-invertible $\textit{$G$-ality defects}$. We study the classification and the physical implication of the $G$-ality defects using SymTFT and the group-theoretical fusion categories, with three concrete examples. 1) Triality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$ where $N$ is coprime with $3$. The classification is acquired previously by Jordan and Larson where the data is similar to the $\text{TY}$ fusion categories, and we determine the anomaly of these fusion categories. 2) $p$-ality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p$ where $p$ is an odd prime. We consider two such categories $\mathcal{P}_{\pm,m}$ which are distinguished by different choices of the symmetry fractionalization, a new data that does not appear in the TY classification, and show that they have distinct anomaly structures and spin selection rules. 3) $S_3$-ality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$. We study their classification explicitly for $N &lt; 20$ via SymTFT, and provide a group-theoretical construction for certain $N$. We find $N=5$ is the minimal $N$ to admit an $S_3$-ality and $N=11$ is the minimal $N$ to admit a group-theoretical $S_3$-ality.</description>

      <title>Exploring external rarefied gas flows through the method of fundamental solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The well-known Navier--Stokes--Fourier equations of fluid dynamics are, in general, not adequate for describing rarefied gas flows. Moreover, while the Stokes equations -- a simplified version of the Navier--Stokes--Fourier equations -- are effective in modeling slow and steady liquid flow past a sphere, they fail to yield a non-trivial solution to the problem of slow and steady liquid flow past an infinitely long cylinder (a two-dimensional problem essentially); this is referred to as Stokes' paradox. The paradox also arises when studying these problems for gases. In this paper, we present a way to obtain meaningful solutions for two-dimensional flows of rarefied gases around objects by circumventing Stokes' paradox. To this end, we adopt an extended hydrodynamic model, referred to as the CCR model, consisting of the balance equations for the mass, momentum and energy and closed with the coupled constitutive relations. We determine an analytic solution of the CCR model for the problem and compare it with a numerical solution based on the method of fundamental solutions. Apart from addressing flow past a circular cylinder, we aim to showcase the capabilities of the method of fundamental solutions to predict the flow past other objects in two dimensions for which analytic solutions do not exist or are difficult to determine. For that, we investigate the problem of rarefied gas flow past an infinitely long semicircular cylinder.</description>

      <title>The BRST quantisation of chiral BMS-like field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The BMS$_3$ Lie algebra belongs to a one-parameter family of Lie algebras obtained by centrally extending abelian extensions of the Witt algebra by a tensor density representation. In this paper we call such Lie algebras $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\lambda$, with BMS$_3$ corresponding to the universal central extension of $\lambda = -1$. We construct the BRST complex for $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\lambda$ in two different ways: one in the language of semi-infinite cohomology and the other using the formalism of vertex operator algebras. We pay particular attention to the case of BMS$_3$ and discuss some natural field-theoretical realisations. We prove two theorems about the BRST cohomology of $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\lambda$. The first is the construction of a quasi-isomorphic embedding of the chiral sector of any Virasoro string as a $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\lambda$ string. The second is the isomorphism (as Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras) of any $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\lambda$ BRST cohomology and the chiral ring of a topologically twisted $N{=}2$ superconformal field theory.</description>

      <title>On the optimal rate of vortex stretching for axisymmetric Euler flows without swirl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For axisymmetric flows without swirl and compactly supported initial vorticity, we prove the upper bound of $t^{4/3}$ for the growth of the vorticity maximum, which was conjectured by Childress [Phys. D, 2008] and supported by numerical computations from Childress--Gilbert--Valiant [J. Fluid Mech. 2016]. The key is to estimate the velocity maximum by the kinetic energy together with conserved quantities involving the vorticity.</description>

      <title>T-duality on Almost Hermitian Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19931v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate T-duality transformation on an almost bi-hermitian space with torsion. By virtue of the Buscher rule, we completely describe not only the covariant derivative of geometrical objects but also the Nijenhuis tensor. We apply this description to an almost bi-hermitian space with isometry and investigate integrability on its T-dualized one. We find that hermiticity is not a sufficient condition to preserve integrability under T-duality transformations. However, in the presence of the K\"{a}hler condition, the T-dualized space still admits integrability of the almost complex structures. We also observe that the form of H-flux is suitable for string compactification scenarios.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation exponents of the half-space KPZ at stationarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the half-space KPZ equation with a Neumann boundary condition, starting from stationary Brownian initial data. We derive a variance identity that links the fluctuations of the height function to the transversal fluctuations of a half-space polymer model. Utilizing this identity, we obtain estimates for the polymer endpoints, leading to optimal fluctuation exponents for the height function in both the subcritical and critical regimes, as well as an optimal upper bound for the fluctuation exponents in the supercritical regime. We also compute the average growth rate as a function of the boundary parameter.</description>

      <title>Horizon classification via Riemannian flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that the geometry of connected totally geodesic compact null hypersurfaces in Lorentzian manifolds is only slightly more specialized than that of Riemannian flows over compact manifolds, the latter mathematical theory having been much studied in the context of foliation theory since the work by Reinhart (1959). We are then able to import results on Riemannian flows to the horizon case, so obtaining theorems on the dynamical structure of compact horizons that do not rely on (non-)degeneracy assumptions. Furthermore, we clarify the relation between isometric/geodesible Riemannian flows and non-degeneracy conditions. This work also contains some positive results on the possibility of finding, in the degenerate case, lightlike fields tangent to the horizon that have zero surface gravity.</description>

      <title>Physical Vacuum Problems for the Full Compressible Euler Equations: Hadamard-style Local Well-posedness in Low-regularity Weighted Sobolev Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript concerns the dynamics of non-isentropic compressible Euler equations in a physical vacuum. We establish the Hadamard-style local well-posedness within low-regularity weighted Sobolev spaces, demonstrating existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on initial data. Additionally, we provide sharp a priori energy estimates and continuation criteria.
  The approach is based on the framework of Eulerian coordinates.</description>

      <title>Microcanonical Phase Space and Entropy in Curved Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the structure of microcanonical ensembles in inertial and non-inertial frames attached to a confined system of positive energy particles in curved spacetime. Under certain physically reasonable assumptions that ensure the existence of such ensembles, we derive two generic characteristics of the leading curvature corrections: (1) they are characterized by Ricci and Einstein tensors, and (2) their contribution is proportional to the boundary area of the system. We also obtain exact analytical results for microcanonical ensembles in de Sitter spacetime, which reproduce the perturbative results in the limit $\Lambda \to 0$, but have interesting limits when the size of the system is comparable to ${\Lambda}^{-1/2}$. We give a general argument to highlight two distinct sources of divergences in the phase space volume, coming from redshift and spatial geometry, and illustrate this by comparing and contrasting the results for (i) geodesic box in de Sitter, (ii) geodesic box in Schwarzschild, and (iii) uniformly accelerated box in Minkowski. Finally, we extend these results to $N$ particle systems in the massless (ultra-relativistic) limit for certain restricted class of spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Complete classification of integrability and non-integrability of S=1/2 spin chains with symmetric next-nearest-neighbor interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study S=1/2 quantum spin chains with shift-invariant and inversion-symmetric next-nearest-neighbor interaction, also known as zigzag spin chains. We completely classify the integrability and non-integrability of the above class of spin systems. We prove that in this class there are only two integrable models, a classical model and a model solvable by the Bethe ansatz, and all the remaining systems are non-integrable. Our classification theorem confirms that within this class of spin chains, there is no missing integrable model. This theorem also implies the absence of intermediate models with a finite number of local conserved quantities.</description>

      <title>Conditional Stability of the Euler Method on Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive nonlinear stability results for numerical integrators on Riemannian manifolds, by imposing conditions on the ODE vector field and the step size that makes the numerical solution non-expansive whenever the exact solution is non-expansive over the same time step. Our model case is a geodesic version of the explicit Euler method. Precise bounds are obtained in the case of Riemannian manifolds of constant sectional curvature. The approach is based on a cocoercivity property of the vector field adapted to manifolds from Euclidean space. It allows us to compare the new results to the corresponding well-known results in flat spaces, and in general we find that a non-zero curvature will deteriorate the stability region of the geodesic Euler method. The step size bounds depend on the distance traveled over a step from the initial point. Numerical examples for spheres and hyperbolic 2-space confirm that the bounds are tight.</description>
