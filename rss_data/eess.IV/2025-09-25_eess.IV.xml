      <title>Frequency-Aware Ensemble Learning for BraTS 2025 Pediatric Brain Tumor Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pediatric brain tumor segmentation presents unique challenges due to the rarity and heterogeneity of these malignancies, yet remains critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. We propose an ensemble approach integrating nnU-Net, Swin UNETR, and HFF-Net for the BraTS-PED 2025 challenge. Our method incorporates three key extensions: adjustable initialization scales for optimal nnU-Net complexity control, transfer learning from BraTS 2021 pre-trained models to enhance Swin UNETR's generalization on pediatric dataset, and frequency domain decomposition for HFF-Net to separate low-frequency tissue contours from high-frequency texture details. Our final ensemble combines nnU-Net ($\gamma=0.7$), fine-tuned Swin UNETR, and HFF-Net, achieving Dice scores of 72.3% (ET), 95.6% (NET), 68.9% (CC), 89.5% (ED), 92.3% (TC), and 92.3% (WT), respectively.</description>

      <title>BALANCE: Bitrate-Adaptive Limit-Aware Netcast Content Enhancement Utilizing QUBO and Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era of increasing data cap constraints, optimizing video streaming quality while adhering to user-defined data caps remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces Bitrate-Adaptive Limit-Aware Netcast Content Enhancement (BALANCE), a novel Quantum framework aimed at addressing this issue. BALANCE intelligently pre-selects video segments based on visual complexity and anticipated data consumption, utilizing the Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF) metric to enhance Quality of Experience (QoE). We compare our method against traditional bitrate ladders used in Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) streaming, demonstrating a notable improvement in QoE under equivalent data constraints. We compare the Slack variable approach with the Dynamic Penalization Approach (DPA) by framing the bitrate allocation problem through Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) to effectively enforce data limits. Our results indicate that the DPA consistently outperforms the Slack Variable Method, delivering more valid and optimal solutions as data limits increase. This new quantum approach significantly enhances streaming satisfaction for users with limited data plans.</description>

      <title>Ensuring Reliable Participation in Subjective Video Quality Tests Across Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subjective video quality assessment (VQA) is the gold standard for measuring end-user experience across communication, streaming, and UGC pipelines. Beyond high-validity lab studies, crowdsourcing offers accurate, reliable, faster, and cheaper evaluation-but suffers from unreliable submissions by workers who ignore instructions or game rewards. Recent tests reveal sophisticated exploits of video metadata and rising use of remote-desktop (RD) connections, both of which bias results. We propose objective and subjective detectors for RD users and compare two mainstream crowdsourcing platforms on their susceptibility and mitigation under realistic test conditions and task designs.</description>

      <title>Vision-Based Perception for Autonomous Vehicles in Off-Road Environment Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-latency intelligent systems are required for autonomous driving on non-uniform terrain in open-pit mines and developing countries. This work proposes a perception system for autonomous vehicles on unpaved roads and off-road environments, capable of navigating rough terrain without a predefined trail. The Configurable Modular Segmentation Network (CMSNet) framework is proposed, facilitating different architectural arrangements. CMSNet configurations were trained to segment obstacles and trafficable ground on new images from unpaved/off-road scenarios with adverse conditions (night, rain, dust). We investigated applying deep learning to detect drivable regions without explicit track boundaries, studied algorithm behavior under visibility impairment, and evaluated field tests with real-time semantic segmentation. A new dataset, Kamino, is presented with almost 12,000 images from an operating vehicle with eight synchronized cameras. The Kamino dataset has a high number of labeled pixels compared to similar public collections and includes images from an off-road proving ground emulating a mine under adverse visibility. To achieve real-time inference, CMSNet CNN layers were methodically removed and fused using TensorRT, C++, and CUDA. Empirical experiments on two datasets validated the proposed system's effectiveness.</description>

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) is essential for a wide range of computer vision and image processing tasks. Investigating infrared (IR) image (or thermal images) super-resolution is a continuing concern within the development of deep learning. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive perspective of IR image super-resolution, including its applications, hardware imaging system dilemmas, and taxonomy of image processing methodologies. In addition, the datasets and evaluation metrics in IR image super-resolution tasks are also discussed. Furthermore, the deficiencies in current technologies and possible promising directions for the community to explore are highlighted. To cope with the rapid development in this field, we intend to regularly update the relevant excellent work at https://github.com/yongsongH/Infrared_Image_SR_Survey.</description>

      <title>Scan-Adaptive MRI Undersampling Using Neighbor-based Optimization (SUNO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accelerated MRI involves collecting partial $k$-space measurements to reduce acquisition time, patient discomfort, and motion artifacts, and typically uses regular undersampling patterns or human-designed schemes. Recent works have studied population-adaptive sampling patterns learned from a group of patients (or scans). However, such patterns can be sub-optimal for individual scans, as they may fail to capture scan or slice-specific details, and their effectiveness can depend on the size and composition of the population. To overcome this issue, we propose a framework for jointly learning scan-adaptive Cartesian undersampling patterns and a corresponding reconstruction model from a training set. We use an alternating algorithm for learning the sampling patterns and the reconstruction model where we use an iterative coordinate descent (ICD) based offline optimization of scan-adaptive $k$-space sampling patterns for each example in the training set. A nearest neighbor search is then used to select the scan-adaptive sampling pattern at test time from initially acquired low-frequency $k$-space information. We applied the proposed framework (dubbed SUNO) to the fastMRI multi-coil knee and brain datasets, demonstrating improved performance over the currently used undersampling patterns at both $4\times$ and $8\times$ acceleration factors in terms of both visual quality and quantitative metrics. The code for the proposed framework is available at https://github.com/sidgautam95/adaptive-sampling-mri-suno.</description>

      <title>Imaging Biomarkers for Neurodegenerative Diseases from Detailed Segmentation of Medial Temporal Lobe Subregions on in vivo Brain MRI Using Upsampling Strategy Guided by High-resolution ex vivo MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is a region impacted extensively and non-uniformly in early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Regional MTL morphometric measures extracted from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are supportive features for the diagnosis of AD and related disorders (ADRD). Different MRI modalities have distinct advantages for MTL morphometry. Anisotropic T2-weighted (T2w) MRI is preferred for hippocampal subfields due to its higher contrast between hippocampal layers. Isotropic T1-weighted (T1w) MRI is beneficial for thickness calculation of extra-hippocampal subregions due to its stable image quality and isotropic resolution. We propose a multi-modality MTL segmentation algorithm that bridges the T1w and T2w modalities by bringing both to a nearly isotropic voxel space. Guided by high-resolution ex vivo 9.4T MRI, an upsampling model was designed for the ground truth segmentations. Combined with non-local means upsampling, this model was used to construct a nearly iso-tropic T1w and T2w MTL subregion segmentation training set, which was used to train a nnUNet model. Morphometric biomarkers extracted by this model were compared to those extracted using conventional models operating in anisotropic spaces on downstream tasks. Biomarkers extracted using the proposed model had greater ability to discriminate between individuals with mild cognitive impairment and cognitively unimpaired; and had great-er longitudinal stability. These findings suggest that the biomarkers derived from T1w and T2w MRI unsampled to nearly isotropic resolution have sig-nificant potential for improving disease diagnosis and monitoring disease progression in ADRD.</description>

      <title>HAZEMATCHING: Dehazing Light Microscopy Images with Guided Conditional Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22397v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is a major driver of scientific progress in the life sciences. Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering out-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as widefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data. Computational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to cheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off tells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high PSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID. Existing methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or produce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In this work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light microscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to find a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the realism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the conditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a hazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on 5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion and perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a consistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with calibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated predictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation operator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data. All data used for training and evaluation and our code will be publicly available under a permissive license.</description>

      <title>An on-chip Pixel Processing Approach with 2.4{\mu}s latency for Asynchronous Read-out of SPAD-based dToF Flash LiDARs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a fully asynchronous peak detection approach for SPAD-based direct time-of-flight (dToF) flash LiDAR, enabling pixel-wise event-driven depth acquisition without global synchronization. By allowing pixels to independently report depth once a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio is achieved, the method reduces latency, mitigates motion blur, and increases effective frame rate compared to frame-based systems. The framework is validated under two hardware implementations: an offline 256$\times$128 SPAD array with PC based processing and a real-time FPGA proof-of-concept prototype with 2.4$\upmu$s latency for on-chip integration. Experiments demonstrate robust depth estimation, reflectivity reconstruction, and dynamic event-based representation under both static and dynamic conditions. The results confirm that asynchronous operation reduces redundant background data and computational load, while remaining tunable via simple hyperparameters. These findings establish a foundation for compact, low-latency, event-driven LiDAR architectures suited to robotics, autonomous driving, and consumer applications. In addition, we have derived a semi-closed-form solution for the detection probability of the raw-peak finding based LiDAR systems that could benefit both conventional frame-based and proposed asynchronous LiDAR systems.</description>

      <title>MOIS-SAM2: Exemplar-based Segment Anything Model 2 for multilesion interactive segmentation of neurofibromas in whole-body MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background and Objectives: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of numerous neurofibromas (NFs) throughout the body. Whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) is the clinical standard for detection and longitudinal surveillance of NF tumor growth. Existing interactive segmentation methods fail to combine high lesion-wise precision with scalability to hundreds of lesions. This study proposes a novel interactive segmentation model tailored to this challenge.
  Methods: We introduce MOIS-SAM2, a multi-object interactive segmentation model that extends the state-of-the-art, transformer-based, promptable Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) with exemplar-based semantic propagation. MOIS-SAM2 was trained and evaluated on 119 WB-MRI scans from 84 NF1 patients acquired using T2-weighted fat-suppressed sequences. The dataset was split at the patient level into a training set and four test sets (one in-domain and three reflecting different domain shift scenarios, e.g., MRI field strength variation, low tumor burden, differences in clinical site and scanner vendor).
  Results: On the in-domain test set, MOIS-SAM2 achieved a scan-wise DSC of 0.60 against expert manual annotations, outperforming baseline 3D nnU-Net (DSC: 0.54) and SAM2 (DSC: 0.35). Performance of the proposed model was maintained under MRI field strength shift (DSC: 0.53) and scanner vendor variation (DSC: 0.50), and improved in low tumor burden cases (DSC: 0.61). Lesion detection F1 scores ranged from 0.62 to 0.78 across test sets. Preliminary inter-reader variability analysis showed model-to-expert agreement (DSC: 0.62-0.68), comparable to inter-expert agreement (DSC: 0.57-0.69).
  Conclusions: The proposed MOIS-SAM2 enables efficient and scalable interactive segmentation of NFs in WB-MRI with minimal user input and strong generalization, supporting integration into clinical workflows.</description>

      <title>RG-Attn: Radian Glue Attention for Multi-modality Multi-agent Cooperative Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooperative perception enhances autonomous driving by leveraging Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication for multi-agent sensor fusion. However, most existing methods rely on single-modal data sharing, limiting fusion performance, particularly in heterogeneous sensor settings involving both LiDAR and cameras across vehicles and roadside units (RSUs). To address this, we propose Radian Glue Attention (RG-Attn), a lightweight and generalizable cross-modal fusion module that unifies intra-agent and inter-agent fusion via transformation-based coordinate alignment and a unified sampling/inversion strategy. RG-Attn efficiently aligns features through a radian-based attention constraint, operating column-wise on geometrically consistent regions to reduce overhead and preserve spatial coherence, thereby enabling accurate and robust fusion. Building upon RG-Attn, we propose three cooperative architectures. The first, Paint-To-Puzzle (PTP), prioritizes communication efficiency but assumes all agents have LiDAR, optionally paired with cameras. The second, Co-Sketching-Co-Coloring (CoS-CoCo), offers maximal flexibility, supporting any sensor setup (e.g., LiDAR-only, camera-only, or both) and enabling strong cross-modal generalization for real-world deployment. The third, Pyramid-RG-Attn Fusion (PRGAF), aims for peak detection accuracy with the highest computational overhead. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world datasets show our framework delivers state-of-the-art detection accuracy with high flexibility and efficiency.

      <title>GaussianSeal: Rooting Adaptive Watermarks for 3D Gaussian Generation Model</title>

Abstract: With the advancement of AIGC technologies, the modalities generated by models have expanded from images and videos to 3D objects, leading to an increasing number of works focused on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) generative models. Existing research on copyright protection for generative models has primarily concentrated on watermarking in image and text modalities, with little exploration into the copyright protection of 3D object generative models. In this paper, we propose the first bit watermarking framework for 3DGS generative models, named GaussianSeal, to enable the decoding of bits as copyright identifiers from the rendered outputs of generated 3DGS. By incorporating adaptive bit modulation modules into the generative model and embedding them into the network blocks in an adaptive way, we achieve high-precision bit decoding with minimal training overhead while maintaining the fidelity of the model's outputs. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms post-processing watermarking approaches for 3DGS objects, achieving superior performance of watermark decoding accuracy and preserving the quality of the generated results.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Artificial Intelligence of Embryo Grading and Pregnancy Prediction in Assisted Reproductive Technology: A Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infertility, a pressing global health concern, affects a substantial proportion of individuals worldwide. While advancements in assisted reproductive technology (ART) have offered effective interventions, conventional in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) procedures still encounter significant hurdles in enhancing pregnancy success rates. Key challenges include the inherent subjectivity in embryo grading and the inefficiency of multi-modal data integration. Against this backdrop, the adoption of AI-driven technologies has emerged as a pivotal strategy to address these issues. This article presents a comprehensive review of the progress in AI applications for embryo grading and pregnancy prediction from a novel perspective, with a specific focus on the utilization of different modal data, such as static images, time-lapse videos, and structured tabular data. The reason for this perspective is that reorganizing tasks based on data sources can not only more accurately depict the essence of the problem but also help clarify the rationality and limitations of model design. Furthermore, this review critically examines the core challenges in contemporary research, encompassing the intricacies of multi-modal feature fusion, constraints imposed by data scarcity, limitations in model generalization capabilities, and the dynamically evolving legal and regulatory frameworks. On this basis, it explicitly identifies potential avenues for future research, aiming to provide actionable guidance for advancing the application of multi-modal AI in the field of ART.</description>

Abstract: High-resolution image synthesis remains a core challenge in generative modeling, particularly in balancing computational efficiency with the preservation of fine-grained visual detail. We present Latent Wavelet Diffusion (LWD), a lightweight training framework that significantly improves detail and texture fidelity in ultra-high-resolution (2K-4K) image synthesis. LWD introduces a novel, frequency-aware masking strategy derived from wavelet energy maps, which dynamically focuses the training process on detail-rich regions of the latent space. This is complemented by a scale-consistent VAE objective to ensure high spectral fidelity. The primary advantage of our approach is its efficiency: LWD requires no architectural modifications and adds zero additional cost during inference, making it a practical solution for scaling existing models. Across multiple strong baselines, LWD consistently improves perceptual quality and FID scores, demonstrating the power of signal-driven supervision as a principled and efficient path toward high-resolution generative modeling.</description>
