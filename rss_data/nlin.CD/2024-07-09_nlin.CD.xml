      <title>Deformation of invariant tori under perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study extends the functional perturbation theory, originally developed for orbits and periodic orbits in dynamical systems, \textit{e.g.} a map $\mathcal{P}$, to derive formulae for the deformation of an $d$-dimensional invariant torus, on which one can define $\mathcal{P}^k$ for $k\in \mathbb{R}$ and even $\mathbf{k}\in\mathbb{R}^d$ to continuize and generalize the exponential function $\mathcal{P}^{\mathbf{k}}$ in $k$. The invariant tori, which manifest as closed flux surfaces in magnetic confinement fusion (MCF) machines, are the dominant structure influencing the radial transport and, consequently, the overall confinement performance.</description>

      <title>Data-driven modeling from biased small training data using periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effect of reservoir computing training data on the reconstruction of chaotic dynamics. Our findings indicate that a training time series comprising a few periodic orbits of low periods can successfully reconstruct the Lorenz attractor. We also demonstrate that biased training data does not negatively impact reconstruction success. Our method's ability to reconstruct a physical measure is much better than the so-called cycle expansion approach, which relies on weighted averaging. Additionally, we demonstrate that fixed point attractors and chaotic transients can be accurately reconstructed by a model trained from a few periodic orbits, even when using different parameters.</description>

      <title>On the shifts of stable and unstable manifolds of a hyperbolic cycle under perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stable and unstable manifolds, originating from hyperbolic cycles, fundamentally characterize the behaviour of dynamical systems in chaotic regions. This letter demonstrates that their shifts under perturbation, crucial for chaos control, are computable with minimal effort using functional derivatives by considering the entire system as an argument. The shifts of homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits, as the intersections of these manifolds, are readily calculated by analyzing the movements of the intersection points.</description>

      <title>Temporal Convolution Derived Multi-Layered Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prediction of time series is a challenging task relevant in such diverse applications as analyzing financial data, forecasting flow dynamics or understanding biological processes. Especially chaotic time series that depend on a long history pose an exceptionally difficult problem. While machine learning has shown to be a promising approach for predicting such time series, it either demands long training time and much training data when using deep recurrent neural networks. Alternative, when using a reservoir computing approach it comes with high uncertainty and typically a high number of random initializations and extensive hyper-parameter tuning when using a reservoir computing approach. In this paper, we focus on the reservoir computing approach and propose a new mapping of input data into the reservoir's state space. Furthermore, we incorporate this method in two novel network architectures increasing parallelizability, depth and predictive capabilities of the neural network while reducing the dependence on randomness. For the evaluation, we approximate a set of time series from the Mackey-Glass equation, inhabiting non-chaotic as well as chaotic behavior and compare our approaches in regard to their predictive capabilities to echo state networks and gated recurrent units. For the chaotic time series, we observe an error reduction of up to $85.45\%$ and up to $87.90\%$ in contrast to echo state networks and gated recurrent units respectively. Furthermore, we also observe tremendous improvements for non-chaotic time series of up to $99.99\%$ in contrast to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Signature of chaos in perturbed quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14272v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous studies have concluded that \textit{Out-of-Time-Order-Correlator} (OTOC) shows exponential growth in the neighbourhood of a local maximum of a potential. If this statement holds true, the exponential growth should break off once the local maximum is no longer present within the system. By applying a small symmetry-breaking perturbation, we notice that the behaviour of the OTOCs remains remarkably resilient even in the absence of a maximum. Besides this, we also notice that with the increase in perturbation strength, the broken symmetric region expands, causing a broader range of eigenstates to engage in the exponential growth of OTOCs. Therefore, the critical factor lies not in the presence of a local maximum, but in the dynamic nature of the density of states in the broken symmetry regions. Our examination, spanning diverse potential landscapes, reveals the universality of this phenomenon. We also use other chaos diagnostic tool, \textit{Loschmidt Echo} (LE). Interestingly, they also show signature of chaos whenever there is an exponential growth of OTOC.</description>
