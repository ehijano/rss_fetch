      <title>Dispersion Relations for Active Undulators in Overdamped Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organisms that locomote by propagating waves of body bending can maintain performance across heterogeneous environments by modifying their gait frequency $\omega$ or wavenumber $k$. We identify a unifying relationship between these parameters for overdamped undulatory swimmers (including nematodes, spermatozoa, and mm-scale fish) moving in diverse environmental rheologies, in the form of an active `dispersion relation' $\omega\propto k^{\pm2}$. A model treating the organisms as actively driven viscoelastic beams reproduces the experimentally observed scaling. The relative strength of rate-dependent dissipation in the body and the environment determines whether $k^2$ or $k^{-2}$ scaling is observed. The existence of these scaling regimes reflects the $k$ and $\omega$ dependence of the various underlying force terms and how their relative importance changes with the external environment and the neuronally commanded gait.</description>

      <title>Growing tissue sheets on substrates: buds, buckles, and pores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many tissues take the form of thin sheets, being only a single cell thick, but millions of cells wide. These tissue sheets can bend and buckle in the third dimension. In this work, we investigated the growth of suspended and supported tissue sheets using particle-based simulations. We combine particle-based tissue growth and meshless membrane models to simulate the growth of tissue sheets with mechanical feedback. Free suspended growing tissues exhibit wrinkling when growth is sufficiently fast. Conversely, tissues on a substrate form buds when the adhesion to the substrate is weak and/or when the friction with the substrate is strong. These buds undergo a membrane-mediated attraction and subsequently fuse. The complete detachment of tissues from the substrate and straight buckled bump formation are also obtained at very weak adhesion and/or fast growth rates. Tissue pores grow via Ostwald ripening and coalescence. The reported dynamics can also be applied in research on the detachment dynamics of different tissues with weakened adhesion.</description>

      <title>Dissipation at limited resolutions: Power law and detection of hidden dissipative scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium systems, in particular living organisms, are maintained by irreversible transformations of energy that drive diverse functions. Quantifying their irreversibility, as measured by energy dissipation, is essential for understanding the underlying mechanisms. However, existing techniques usually overlook experimental limitations, either by assuming full information or by employing a coarse-graining method that requires knowledge of the structure behind hidden degrees of freedom. Here, we study the inference of dissipation from finite-resolution measurements by employing a recently developed model-free estimator that considers both the sequence of coarse-grained transitions and the waiting time distributions: $\sigma_2=\sigma_2^\ell + \sigma_2^t$. The dominant term $\sigma_2^\ell$ originates from the sequence of observed transitions; we find that it scales with resolution following a power law. Comparing the scaling exponent with a previous estimator highlights the importance of accounting for flux correlations at lower resolutions. $\sigma_2^t$ comes from asymmetries in waiting time distributions, with its peak revealing characteristic scales of the underlying dissipative process. Alternatively, the characteristic scale can be detected in a crossover of the scaling of $\sigma_2^\ell$. This provides a novel perspective for extracting otherwise hidden characteristic dissipative scales directly from dissipation measurements. We illustrate these results in biochemical models as well as complex networks. Overall, this study highlights the significance of resolution considerations in nonequilibrium systems, providing insights into the interplay between experimental resolution, entropy production, and underlying complexity.</description>

      <title>The information gain limit of molecular computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biomolecules stochastically occupy different possible configurations with probabilities given by non-equilibrium steady-state distributions. These distributions are determined by the transition rate constants between different configurations. Changing these biochemical parameters (inputs) alters the resulting distributions (outputs), and thus constitutes a form of computation. The information-theoretic advantage of performing computations using non-equilibrium distributions, which require a thermodynamic driving force and thus continual energy expenditure to maintain, is unclear. Here we show how much driving can change probability distributions beyond what is possible at equilibrium. First, we establish a tight limit on how much the driving force can change the probability of observing any configuration of an arbitrary molecular system. We then derive a concise expression relating the driving force to the maximum information gain -- the change in the full probability distribution over configurations -- in any computation, showing how small input changes can exponentially alter outputs. Finally, we numerically show that synthetic systems and Ras signaling can closely approach this bound, illustrating the necessity of energy expenditure to enable the computational capabilities observed in nature.</description>

      <title>Segmentation of dense and multi-species bacterial colonies using models trained on synthetic microscopy images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spread of microbial infections is governed by the self-organization of bacteria on surfaces. Limitations of live imaging techniques make collective behaviors in clinically relevant systems challenging to quantify. Here, novel experimental and image analysis techniques for high-fidelity single-cell segmentation of bacterial colonies are developed. Machine learning-based segmentation models are trained solely using synthetic microscopy images that are processed to look realistic using state-of-the-art image-to-image translation methods, requiring no biophysical modeling. Accurate single-cell segmentation is achieved for densely packed single-species colonies and multi-species colonies of common pathogenic bacteria, even under suboptimal imaging conditions and for both brightfield and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The resulting data provide quantitative insights into the self-organization of bacteria on soft surfaces. Thanks to their high adaptability and relatively simple implementation, these methods promise to greatly facilitate quantitative descriptions of bacterial infections in varied environments.</description>

      <title>Identifying heterogeneous micromechanical properties of biological tissues via physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10741v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The heterogeneous micromechanical properties of biological tissues have profound implications across diverse medical and engineering domains. However, identifying full-field heterogeneous elastic properties of soft materials using traditional engineering approaches is fundamentally challenging due to difficulties in estimating local stress fields. Recently, there has been a growing interest in using data-driven models to learn full-field mechanical responses such as displacement and strain from experimental or synthetic data. However, research studies on inferring full-field elastic properties of materials, a more challenging problem, are scarce, particularly for large deformation, hyperelastic materials. Here, we propose a physics-informed machine learning approach to identify the elasticity map in nonlinear, large deformation hyperelastic materials. We evaluate the prediction accuracies and computational efficiency of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) by inferring the heterogeneous elasticity maps across three materials with structural complexity that closely resemble real tissue patterns, such as brain tissue and tricuspid valve tissue. We further applied our improved architecture to three additional examples of breast cancer tissue and extended our analysis to three hyperelastic constitutive models: Neo-Hookean, Mooney Rivlin, and Gent. Our selected network architecture consistently produced highly accurate estimations of heterogeneous elasticity maps, even when there was up to 10% noise present in the training data.</description>
