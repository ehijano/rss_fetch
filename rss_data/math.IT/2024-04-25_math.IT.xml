      <title>NMBEnet: Efficient Near-field mmWave Beam Training for Multiuser OFDM Systems Using Sub-6 GHz Pilots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining millimetre-wave (mmWave) communications with an extremely large-scale antenna array (ELAA) presents a promising avenue for meeting the spectral efficiency demands of the future sixth generation (6G) mobile communications. However, beam training for mmWave ELAA systems is challenged by excessive pilot overheads as well as insufficient accuracy, as the huge near-field codebook has to be accounted for. In this paper, inspired by the similarity between far-field sub-6 GHz channels and near-field mmWave channels, we propose to leverage sub-6 GHz uplink pilot signals to directly estimate the optimal near-field mmWave codeword, which aims to reduce pilot overhead and bypass the channel estimation. Moreover, we adopt deep learning to perform this dual mapping function, i.e., sub-6 GHz to mmWave, far-field to near-field, and a novel neural network structure called NMBEnet is designed to enhance the precision of beam training. Specifically, when considering the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication scenarios with high user density, correlations arise both between signals from different users and between signals from different subcarriers. Accordingly, the convolutional neural network (CNN) module and graph neural network (GNN) module included in the proposed NMBEnet can leverage these two correlations to further enhance the precision of beam training.</description>

      <title>Co-existing/Cooperating Multicell Massive MIMO and Cell-Free Massive MIMO Deployments: Heuristic Designs and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) represent a deeply investigated evolution from the conventional multicell co-located massive MIMO (MC-mMIMO) network deployments. Anticipating a gradual integration of CF-mMIMO systems alongside pre-existing MC-mMIMO network elements, this paper considers a scenario where both deployments coexist, in order to serve a large number of users using a shared set of frequencies. The investigation explores the impact of this coexistence on the network's downlink performance, considering various degrees of mutual cooperation, precoder selection, and power control strategies. Moreover, to take into account the effect of the proposed cooperation scenarios on the fronthaul links, this paper also provides a fronthaul-aware heuristic association algorithm between users and network elements, which permits fulfilling the fronthaul requirement on each link. The research is finally completed by extensive simulations, shedding light on the performance outcomes associated with the diverse cooperation levels and several solutions delineated in the paper.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Beam Coverage for Satellite Communications Aided by Movable-Antenna Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the ultra-dense constellation, efficient beam coverage and interference mitigation are crucial to low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication systems, while the conventional directional antennas and fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays both have limited degrees of freedom (DoFs) in beamforming to adapt to the time-varying coverage requirement of terrestrial users. To address this challenge, we propose in this paper utilizing movable antenna (MA) arrays to enhance the satellite beam coverage and interference mitigation. Specifically, given the satellite orbit and the coverage requirement within a specific time interval, the antenna position vector (APV) and antenna weight vector (AWV) of the satellite-mounted MA array are jointly optimized over time to minimize the average signal leakage power to the interference area of the satellite, subject to the constraints of the minimum beamforming gain over the coverage area, the continuous movement of MAs, and the constant modulus of AWV. The corresponding continuous-time decision process for the APV and AWV is first transformed into a more tractable discrete-time optimization problem. Then, an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm is developed by iteratively optimizing the APV and AWV, where the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique is utilized to obtain locally optimal solutions during the iterations. Moreover, to further reduce the antenna movement overhead, a low-complexity MA scheme is proposed by using an optimized common APV over all time slots. Simulation results validate that the proposed MA array-aided beam coverage schemes can significantly decrease the interference leakage of the satellite compared to conventional FPA-based schemes, while the low-complexity MA scheme can achieve a performance comparable to the continuous-movement scheme.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Coded Poisson Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework for convolutional coded Poisson receivers (CCPRs) that incorporates spatially coupled methods into the architecture of coded Poisson receivers (CPRs). We use density evolution equations to track the packet decoding process with the successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique. We derive outer bounds for the stability region of CPRs when the underlying channel can be modeled by a $\phi$-ALOHA receiver. The stability region is the set of loads that every packet can be successfully received with a probability of 1. Our outer bounds extend those of the spatially-coupled Irregular Repetition Slotted ALOHA (IRSA) protocol and apply to channel models with multiple traffic classes. For CCPRs with a single class of users, the stability region is reduced to an interval. Therefore, it can be characterized by a percolation threshold. We study the potential threshold by the potential function of the base CPR used for constructing a CCPR. In addition, we prove that the CCPR is stable under a technical condition for the window size. For the multiclass scenario, we recursively evaluate the density evolution equations to determine the boundaries of the stability region. Numerical results demonstrate that the stability region of CCPRs can be enlarged compared to that of CPRs by leveraging the spatially-coupled method. Moreover, the stability region of CCPRs is close to our outer bounds when the window size is large.</description>

      <title>A Generalization of Relative Entropy to Count Vectors and its Concentration Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new generalization of relative entropy to non-negative vectors with sums $\gt 1$. We show in a purely combinatorial setting, with no probabilistic considerations, that in the presence of linear constraints defining a convex polytope, a concentration phenomenon arises for this generalized relative entropy, and we quantify the concentration precisely. We also present a probabilistic formulation, and extend the concentration results to it. In addition, we provide a number of simplifications and improvements to our previous work, notably in dualizing the optimization problem, in the concentration with respect to $\ell_{\infty}$ distance, and in the relationship to generalized KL-divergence. A number of our results apply to general compact convex sets, not necessarily polyhedral.</description>

      <title>Fast and Robust Expectation Propagation MIMO Detection via Preconditioned Conjugated Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the expectation propagation (EP) algorithm for symbol detection in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The EP detector shows excellent performance but suffers from a high computational complexity due to the matrix inversion, required in each EP iteration to perform marginal inference on a Gaussian system. We propose an inversion-free variant of the EP algorithm by treating inference on the mean and variance as two separate and simpler subtasks: We study the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm for obtaining the mean, which can significantly reduce the complexity and increase stability by relying on the Jacobi preconditioner that proves to fit the EP characteristics very well. For the variance, we use a simple approximation based on linear regression of the Gram channel matrix. Numerical studies on the Rayleigh-fading channel and on a realistic 3GPP channel model reveal the efficiency of the proposed scheme, which offers an attractive performance-complexity tradeoff and even outperforms the original EP detector in high multi-user inference cases where the matrix inversion becomes numerically unstable.</description>

      <title>How to Make Money From Fresh Data: Subscription Strategies in Age-Based Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a communication system consisting of a server that tracks and publishes updates about a time-varying data source or event, and a gossip network of users interested in closely tracking the event. The timeliness of the information is measured through the version age of information. The users wish to have their expected version ages remain below a threshold, and have the option to either rely on gossip from their neighbors or subscribe to the server directly to follow updates about the event if the former option does not meet the timeliness requirements. The server wishes to maximize its profit by increasing the number of subscribers and reducing costs associated with the frequent sampling of the event. We model the problem setup as a Stackelberg game between the server and the users, where the server commits to a frequency of sampling the event, and the users make decisions on whether to subscribe or not. As an initial work, we focus on directed networks with unidirectional flow of information and obtain the optimal equilibrium strategies for all the players. We provide simulation results to confirm the theoretical findings and provide additional insights.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective Optimization for Multi-UAV-assisted Mobile Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and mobile edge computing (MEC) have provided users with flexible and resilient computing services. However, meeting the computing-intensive and latency-sensitive demands of users poses a significant challenge due to the limited resources of UAVs. To address this challenge, we present a multi-objective optimization approach for multi-UAV-assisted MEC systems. First, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem \textcolor{b2}{aiming} at minimizing the total task completion delay, reducing the total UAV energy consumption, and maximizing the total amount of offloaded tasks by jointly optimizing task offloading, computation resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control. Since the problem is a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) and NP-hard problem which is challenging, we propose a joint task offloading, computation resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control (JTORATC) approach to solve the problem. \textcolor{b3}{However, since the decision variables of task offloading, computation resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control are coupled with each other, the original problem is split into three sub-problems, i.e., task offloading, computation resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control, which are solved individually to obtain the corresponding decisions.} \textcolor{b2}{Moreover, the sub-problem of task offloading is solved by using distributed splitting and threshold rounding methods, the sub-problem of computation resource allocation is solved by adopting the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) method, and the sub-problem of UAV trajectory control is solved by employing the successive convex approximation (SCA) method.} Simulation results show that the proposed JTORATC has superior performance compared to the other benchmark methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-stream Transmission for Directional Modulation Network via distributed Multi-UAV-aided Multi-IRS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a revolutionary technique for the future 6G networks. The conventional far-field single-IRS-aided directional modulation(DM) networks have only one (no direct path) or two (existing direct path) degrees of freedom (DoFs). This means that there are only one or two streams transmitted simultaneously from base station to user and will seriously limit its rate gain achieved by IRS. How to create multiple DoFs more than two for DM? In this paper, single large-scale IRS is divided to multiple small IRSs and a novel multi-IRS-aided multi-stream DM network is proposed to achieve a point-to-point multi-stream transmission by creating $K$ ($\geq3$) DoFs, where multiple small IRSs are placed distributively via multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The null-space projection, zero-forcing (ZF) and phase alignment are adopted to design the transmit beamforming vector, receive beamforming vector and phase shift matrix (PSM), respectively, called NSP-ZF-PA. Here, $K$ PSMs and their corresponding beamforming vectors are independently optimized. The weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) algorithm is involved in alternating iteration for the optimization variables by introducing the power constraint on IRS, named WMMSE-PC, where the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm is used to solve the total PSM. To achieve a lower computational complexity, a maximum trace method, called Max-TR-SVD, is proposed by optimize the PSM of all IRSs. Numerical simulation results has shown that the proposed NSP-ZF-PA performs much better than Max-TR-SVD in terms of rate. In particular, the rate of NSP-ZF-PA with sixteen small IRSs is about five times that of NSP-ZF-PA with combining all small IRSs as a single large IRS. Thus, a dramatic rate enhancement may be achieved by multiple distributed IRSs.</description>

Abstract: In this paper a novel NLOS (Non-Line-of-Sight) identification technique is proposed. In comparison to other methods described in the literature, it discerns a situation when the delayed direct path component is available from when it's totally blocked and introduced biases are much higher and harder to mitigate. In the method, NLOS identification is performed using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm based on various signal features. The paper includes description of the method and the results of performed experiment.</description>

      <title>Edge-Efficient Deep Learning Models for Automatic Modulation Classification: A Performance Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent advancement in deep learning (DL) for automatic modulation classification (AMC) of wireless signals has encouraged numerous possible applications on resource-constrained edge devices. However, developing optimized DL models suitable for edge applications of wireless communications is yet to be studied in depth. In this work, we perform a thorough investigation of optimized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) developed for AMC using the three most commonly used model optimization techniques: a) pruning, b) quantization, and c) knowledge distillation. Furthermore, we have proposed optimized models with the combinations of these techniques to fuse the complementary optimization benefits. The performances of all the proposed methods are evaluated in terms of sparsity, storage compression for network parameters, and the effect on classification accuracy with a reduction in parameters. The experimental results show that the proposed individual and combined optimization techniques are highly effective for developing models with significantly less complexity while maintaining or even improving classification performance compared to the benchmark CNNs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven deep learning (DL) techniques developed for automatic modulation classification (AMC) of wireless signals are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This poses a severe security threat to the DL-based wireless systems, specifically for edge applications of AMC. In this work, we address the joint problem of developing optimized DL models that are also robust against adversarial attacks. This enables efficient and reliable deployment of DL-based AMC on edge devices. We first propose two optimized models using knowledge distillation and network pruning, followed by a computationally efficient adversarial training process to improve the robustness. Experimental results on five white-box attacks show that the proposed optimized and adversarially trained models can achieve better robustness than the standard (unoptimized) model. The two optimized models also achieve higher accuracy on clean (unattacked) samples, which is essential for the reliability of DL-based solutions at edge applications.</description>

      <title>Prediction from compression for models with infinite memory, with applications to hidden Markov and renewal processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the problem of predicting the next symbol given a sample path of length n, whose joint distribution belongs to a distribution class that may have long-term memory. The goal is to compete with the conditional predictor that knows the true model. For both hidden Markov models (HMMs) and renewal processes, we determine the optimal prediction risk in Kullback- Leibler divergence up to universal constant factors. Extending existing results in finite-order Markov models [HJW23] and drawing ideas from universal compression, the proposed estimator has a prediction risk bounded by redundancy of the distribution class and a memory term that accounts for the long-range dependency of the model. Notably, for HMMs with bounded state and observation spaces, a polynomial-time estimator based on dynamic programming is shown to achieve the optimal prediction risk {\Theta}(log n/n); prior to this work, the only known result of this type is O(1/log n) obtained using Markov approximation [Sha+18]. Matching minimax lower bounds are obtained by making connections to redundancy and mutual information via a reduction argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Covert channel networks are a well-known method for circumventing the security measures organizations put in place to protect their networks from adversarial attacks. This paper introduces a novel method based on bit-rate modulation for implementing covert channels between devices connected over a wide area network. This attack can be exploited to exfiltrate sensitive information from a machine (i.e., covert sender) and stealthily transfer it to a covert receiver while evading network security measures and detection systems. We explain how to implement this threat, focusing specifically on covert channel networks and their potential security risks to network information transmission. The proposed method leverages bit-rate modulation, where a high bit rate represents a '1' and a low bit rate represents a '0', enabling covert communication. We analyze the key metrics associated with covert channels, including robustness in the presence of legitimate traffic and other interference, bit-rate capacity, and bit error rate. Experiments demonstrate the good performance of this attack, which achieved 5 bps with excellent robustness and a channel capacity of up to 0.9239 bps/Hz under different noise sources. Therefore, we show that bit-rate modulation effectively violates network security and compromises sensitive data.</description>

      <title>EMF-Aware Power Control for Massive MIMO: Cell-Free versus Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impressive growth of wireless data networks has recently led to increased attention to the issue of electromagnetic pollution. Specific absorption rates and incident power densities have become popular indicators for measuring electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure. This paper tackles the problem of power control in user-centric cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems under EMF constraints. Specifically, the power allocation maximizing the minimum data rate across users is derived for both the uplink and the downlink under EMF constraints. The developed solution is also applied to a cellular mMIMO system and compared to other benchmark strategies. Simulation results prove that EMF safety restrictions can be easily met without jeopardizing the minimum data rate, that the CF-mMIMO outperforms the multi-cell massive MIMO deployment, and that the proposed power control strategy greatly improves the system fairness.</description>

      <title>Achieving Gaussian Vector Broadcast Channel Capacity with Scalar Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A coding scheme with scalar lattices is applied to K-receiver, Gaussian, vector broadcast channels with K independent messages, one for each receiver. The method decomposes each receiver channel into parallel scalar channels with known interference and applies dirty paper coding with a modulo interval, amplitude shift keying (ASK), and probabilistic shaping to each scalar channel. The achievable rate tuples include all points inside the capacity region by choosing truncated Gaussian shaping, large ASK alphabets, and large modulo intervals.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Computing the Augustin--Csisz\'ar Mutual Information and Lapidoth--Pfister Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Augustin--Csisz{\' a}r mutual information (MI) and Lapidoth--Pfister MI are well-known generalizations of the Shannon MI, but do not have known closed-form expressions, so they need to be calculated by solving optimization problems. In this study, we propose alternating optimization algorithms for computing these types of MI and present proofs of their global convergence properties. We also provide a novel variational characterization of the Augustin--Csisz{\' a}r MI that is similar to that of the Sibson MI.</description>

      <title>On Target Detection in the Presence of Clutter in Joint Communication and Sensing Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works on joint communication and sensing (JCAS) cellular networks have proposed to use time division mode (TDM) and concurrent mode (CM), as alternative methods for sharing the resources between communication and sensing signals. While the performance of these JCAS schemes for object tracking and parameter estimation has been studied in previous works, their performance on target detection in the presence of clutter has not been analyzed. In this paper, we propose a detection scheme for estimating the number of targets in JCAS cellular networks that employ TDM or CM resource sharing. The proposed detection method allows for the presence of clutter and/or temporally correlated noise. This scheme is studied with respect to the JCAS trade-off parameters that allow to control the time slots in TDM and the power resources in CM allocated to sensing and communications. The performance of two fundamental transmit beamforming schemes, typical for JCAS, is compared in terms of the receiver operating characteristics curves. Our results indicate that in general the TDM scheme gives a somewhat better detection performance compared to the CM scheme, although both schemes outperform existing approaches provided that their respective trade-off parameters are tuned properly.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Identification Capacity of AWGN Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the second-order randomized identification capacity (RID capacity) of the Additive White Gaussian Noise Channel (AWGNC). On the one hand, we obtain a refined version of Hayashi's theorem to prove the achievability part. On the other, we investigate the relationship between identification and channel resolvability, then we propose a finer quantization method to prove the converse part. Consequently, the second-order RID capacity of the AWGNC has the same form as the second-order transmission capacity. The only difference is that the maximum number of messages in RID scales double exponentially in the blocklength.</description>

      <title>Sequential Outlier Hypothesis Testing under Universality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit sequential outlier hypothesis testing and derive bounds on the achievable exponents. Specifically, the task of outlier hypothesis testing is to identify the set of outliers that are generated from an anomalous distribution among all observed sequences where most are generated from a nominal distribution. In the sequential setting, one obtains a sample from each sequence per unit time until a reliable decision could be made. We assume that the number of outliers is known while both the nominal and anomalous distributions are unknown. For the case of exactly one outlier, our bounds on the achievable exponents are tight, providing exact large deviations characterization of sequential tests and strengthening a previous result of Li, Nitinawarat and Veeravalli (2017). In particular, we propose a sequential test that has bounded average sample size and better theoretical performance than the fixed-length test, which could not be guaranteed by the corresponding sequential test of Li, Nitinawarat and Veeravalli (2017). Our results are also generalized to the case of multiple outliers.</description>

      <title>Message-Passing on Hypergraphs: Detectability, Phase Transitions and Higher-Order Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are widely adopted tools to examine systems with higher-order interactions. Despite recent advancements in methods for community detection in these systems, we still lack a theoretical analysis of their detectability limits. Here, we derive closed-form bounds for community detection in hypergraphs. Using a Message-Passing formulation, we demonstrate that detectability depends on hypergraphs' structural properties, such as the distribution of hyperedge sizes or their assortativity. Our formulation enables a characterization of the entropy of a hypergraph in relation to that of its clique expansion, showing that community detection is enhanced when hyperedges highly overlap on pairs of nodes. We develop an efficient Message-Passing algorithm to learn communities and model parameters on large systems. Additionally, we devise an exact sampling routine to generate synthetic data from our probabilistic model. With these methods, we numerically investigate the boundaries of community detection in synthetic datasets, and extract communities from real systems. Our results extend the understanding of the limits of community detection in hypergraphs and introduce flexible mathematical tools to study systems with higher-order interactions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization With Across-Task Transferable Max-Value Entropy Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many applications, ranging from logistics to engineering, a designer is faced with a sequence of optimization tasks for which the objectives are in the form of black-box functions that are costly to evaluate. For example, the designer may need to tune the hyperparameters of neural network models for different learning tasks over time. Rather than evaluating the objective function for each candidate solution, the designer may have access to approximations of the objective functions, for which higher-fidelity evaluations entail a larger cost. Existing multi-fidelity black-box optimization strategies select candidate solutions and fidelity levels with the goal of maximizing the information accrued about the optimal value or solution for the current task. Assuming that successive optimization tasks are related, this paper introduces a novel information-theoretic acquisition function that balances the need to acquire information about the current task with the goal of collecting information transferable to future tasks. The proposed method includes shared inter-task latent variables, which are transferred across tasks by implementing particle-based variational Bayesian updates. Experimental results across synthetic and real-world examples reveal that the proposed provident acquisition strategy that caters to future tasks can significantly improve the optimization efficiency as soon as a sufficient number of tasks is processed.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Constructing 6G Near-Field Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Near-field propagation, particularly that enabled by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), has emerged as a promising research topic in recent years. However, a comprehensive literature review on RIS-based near-field technologies is still lacking. This article aims to fill this gap by providing a brief overview of near-field concepts and a systematic survey of the state-of-the-art RIS-based near-field technologies. The focus is on three key aspects: the construction of ubiquitous near-field wireless propagation environments using RIS, the enabling of new near-field paradigms for 6G networks through RIS, and the challenges faced by RIS-based near-field technologies. This technical review intends to facilitate the development and innovation of RIS-based near-field technologies.</description>
