      <title>Gen4D: Synthesizing Humans and Scenes in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lack of input data for in-the-wild activities often results in low performance across various computer vision tasks. This challenge is particularly pronounced in uncommon human-centric domains like sports, where real-world data collection is complex and impractical. While synthetic datasets offer a promising alternative, existing approaches typically suffer from limited diversity in human appearance, motion, and scene composition due to their reliance on rigid asset libraries and hand-crafted rendering pipelines. To address this, we introduce Gen4D, a fully automated pipeline for generating diverse and photorealistic 4D human animations. Gen4D integrates expert-driven motion encoding, prompt-guided avatar generation using diffusion-based Gaussian splatting, and human-aware background synthesis to produce highly varied and lifelike human sequences. Based on Gen4D, we present SportPAL, a large-scale synthetic dataset spanning three sports: baseball, icehockey, and soccer. Together, Gen4D and SportPAL provide a scalable foundation for constructing synthetic datasets tailored to in-the-wild human-centric vision tasks, with no need for manual 3D modeling or scene design.</description>

      <title>IGSM: Improved Geometric and Sensitivity Matching for Finetuning Pruned Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models achieve realistic outcomes across a wide range of generative tasks, but their high computational cost remains a major barrier to deployment. Model pruning has emerged as a promising strategy to reduce inference cost and enable lightweight diffusion models. While effective, pruned diffusion models are proned to quality reduction due to limited capacity. A key limitation of current pruning approaches is that pruned models are finetuned using the same objective as the dense model, typically denoising score matching (DSM). Since the dense model is accessible during finetuning, it warrants a more effective approach for knowledge transfer from the dense to the pruned model. Motivated by this aim, we revisit the finetuning stage and propose IGSM (\textbf{I}mproved \textbf{G}eometric and \textbf{S}ensitivity \textbf{M}atching), a general-purpose finetuning framework that introduces a second-order Jacobian projection loss inspired by Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents (FTLE). IGSM efficiently captures and aligns the geometric and the temporal dynamics of pruned models with their dense teachers using scalable second-order projections. Our approach is architecture-agnostic and applies to both U-Net- and Transformer-based diffusion models. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CelebA, LSUN-Church, and LSUN-Bedroom show that IGSM consistently narrows the performance gap between pruned and dense models, substantially improving sample quality.

      <title>AI-powered Contextual 3D Environment Generation: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of high-quality 3D environments is crucial for industries such as gaming, virtual reality, and cinema, yet remains resource-intensive due to the reliance on manual processes. This study performs a systematic review of existing generative AI techniques for 3D scene generation, analyzing their characteristics, strengths, limitations, and potential for improvement. By examining state-of-the-art approaches, it presents key challenges such as scene authenticity and the influence of textual inputs. Special attention is given to how AI can blend different stylistic domains while maintaining coherence, the impact of training data on output quality, and the limitations of current models. In addition, this review surveys existing evaluation metrics for assessing realism and explores how industry professionals incorporate AI into their workflows. The findings of this study aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape and serve as a foundation for future research on AI-driven 3D content generation. Key findings include that advanced generative architectures enable high-quality 3D content creation at a high computational cost, effective multi-modal integration techniques like cross-attention and latent space alignment facilitate text-to-3D tasks, and the quality and diversity of training data combined with comprehensive evaluation metrics are critical to achieving scalable, robust 3D scene generation.</description>

      <title>ODE-GS: Latent ODEs for Dynamic Scene Extrapolation with 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ODE-GS, a novel method that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting with latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to forecast dynamic 3D scenes far beyond the time span seen during training. Existing neural rendering systems - whether NeRF- or 3DGS-based - embed time directly in a deformation network and therefore excel at interpolation but collapse when asked to predict the future, where timestamps are strictly out-of-distribution. ODE-GS eliminates this dependency: after learning a high-fidelity, time-conditioned deformation model for the training window, we freeze it and train a Transformer encoder that summarizes past Gaussian trajectories into a latent state whose continuous evolution is governed by a neural ODE. Numerical integration of this latent flow yields smooth, physically plausible Gaussian trajectories that can be queried at any future instant and rendered in real time. Coupled with a variational objective and a lightweight second-derivative regularizer, ODE-GS attains state-of-the-art extrapolation on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks, improving PSNR by up to 10 dB and halving perceptual error (LPIPS) relative to the strongest baselines. Our results demonstrate that continuous-time latent dynamics are a powerful, practical route to photorealistic prediction of complex 3D scenes.</description>

      <title>Neural Visibility Cache for Real-Time Light Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct illumination with many lights is an inherent component of physically-based rendering, remaining challenging, especially in real-time scenarios. We propose an online-trained neural cache that stores visibility between lights and 3D positions. We feed light visibility to weighted reservoir sampling (WRS) to sample a light source. The cache is implemented as a fully-fused multilayer perceptron (MLP) with multi-resolution hash-grid encoding, enabling online training and efficient inference on modern GPUs in real-time frame rates. The cache can be seamlessly integrated into existing rendering frameworks and can be used in combination with other real-time techniques such as spatiotemporal reservoir sampling (ReSTIR).</description>

      <title>SurGSplat: Progressive Geometry-Constrained Gaussian Splatting for Surgical Scene Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intraoperative navigation relies heavily on precise 3D reconstruction to ensure accuracy and safety during surgical procedures. However, endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including sparse features and inconsistent lighting, which render many existing Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-based methods inadequate and prone to reconstruction failure. To mitigate these constraints, we propose SurGSplat, a novel paradigm designed to progressively refine 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) through the integration of geometric constraints. By enabling the detailed reconstruction of vascular structures and other critical features, SurGSplat provides surgeons with enhanced visual clarity, facilitating precise intraoperative decision-making. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SurGSplat achieves superior performance in both novel view synthesis (NVS) and pose estimation accuracy, establishing it as a high-fidelity and efficient solution for surgical scene reconstruction. More information and results can be found on the page https://surgsplat.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Hardware Accelerated Neural Block Texture Compression with Cooperative Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an extension to the neural texture compression method of Weinreich and colleagues [2024]. Like them, we leverage existing block compression methods which permit to use hardware texture filtering to store a neural representation of physically-based rendering (PBR) texture sets (including albedo, normal maps, roughness, etc.). However, we show that low dynamic range block compression formats still make the solution viable. Thanks to this, we show that we can achieve higher compression ratio or higher quality at fixed compression ratio. We improve performance at runtime using a tile based rendering architecture that leverage hardware matrix multiplication engine. Thanks to all this, we render 4k textures sets (9 channels per asset) with anisotropic filtering at 1080p using only 28MB of VRAM per texture set at 0.55ms on an Intel B580.</description>

      <title>NAT: Neural Acoustic Transfer for Interactive Scenes in Real Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous acoustic transfer methods rely on extensive precomputation and storage of data to enable real-time interaction and auditory feedback. However, these methods struggle with complex scenes, especially when dynamic changes in object position, material, and size significantly alter sound effects. These continuous variations lead to fluctuating acoustic transfer distributions, making it challenging to represent with basic data structures and render efficiently in real time. To address this challenge, we present Neural Acoustic Transfer, a novel approach that utilizes an implicit neural representation to encode precomputed acoustic transfer and its variations, allowing for real-time prediction of sound fields under varying conditions. To efficiently generate the training data required for the neural acoustic field, we developed a fast Monte-Carlo-based boundary element method (BEM) approximation for general scenarios with smooth Neumann conditions. Additionally, we implemented a GPU-accelerated version of standard BEM for scenarios requiring higher precision. These methods provide the necessary training data, enabling our neural network to accurately model the sound radiation space. We demonstrate our method's numerical accuracy and runtime efficiency (within several milliseconds for 30s audio) through comprehensive validation and comparisons in diverse acoustic transfer scenarios. Our approach allows for efficient and accurate modeling of sound behavior in dynamically changing environments, which can benefit a wide range of interactive applications such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and advanced audio production.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Triangle Mesh, Material, and Light from Neural Fields with Neural Radiance Cache</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional inverse rendering techniques are based on textured meshes, which naturally adapts to modern graphics pipelines, but costly differentiable multi-bounce Monte Carlo (MC) ray tracing poses challenges for modeling global illumination. Recently, neural fields has demonstrated impressive reconstruction quality but falls short in modeling indirect illumination. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet efficient inverse rendering framework that combines the strengths of both methods. Specifically, given pre-trained neural field representing the scene, we can obtain an initial estimate of the signed distance field (SDF) and create a Neural Radiance Cache (NRC), an enhancement over the traditional radiance cache used in real-time rendering. By using the former to initialize differentiable marching tetrahedrons (DMTet) and the latter to model indirect illumination, we can compute the global illumination via single-bounce differentiable MC ray tracing and jointly optimize the geometry, material, and light through back propagation. Experiments demonstrate that, compared to previous methods, our approach effectively prevents indirect illumination effects from being baked into materials, thus obtaining the high-quality reconstruction of triangle mesh, Physically-Based (PBR) materials, and High Dynamic Range (HDR) light probe.</description>

      <title>Spatially-Embedded Lens Visualization: A Design Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lens visualization has been a prominent research area in the visualization community, fueled by the continuous need to mitigate visual clutter and occlusion resulting from the increase in data volume. Interactive lenses for spatial data, particularly, challenge designers to conceive design strategies to support the analysis of high-density, multifaceted data with spatial referents. Despite their relevance, there is a lack of systematic understanding regarding the various design elements that compose spatially-embedded lens visualizations. To fill in this gap, we unify these components under a common hood in the form of a design space, which we propose in this paper. Building our knowledge on top of the initial insights gained from Tominski et al.'s survey [57], we construct a design space spanning 7 dimensions through our analysis of 45 papers published in the visualization community over the past 15 years. We describe each design dimension through representative examples and examine the range of design choices available within each, discussing their benefits and pitfalls that affect lens performance and usability. In doing so, we offer a cohesive catalog of considerations for designers-both when examining existing lenses and when conceptualizing novel spatially-embedded lens visualizations. We conclude by shedding light on regions of the design space that remain largely understudied, revealing open opportunities for future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of generating temporal object intrinsics -- temporally evolving sequences of object geometry, reflectance, and texture, such as a blooming rose -- from pre-trained 2D foundation models. Unlike conventional 3D modeling and animation techniques that require extensive manual effort and expertise, we introduce a method that generates such assets with signals distilled from pre-trained 2D diffusion models. To ensure the temporal consistency of object intrinsics, we propose Neural Templates for temporal-state-guided distillation, derived automatically from image features from self-supervised learning. Our method can generate high-quality temporal object intrinsics for several natural phenomena and enable the sampling and controllable rendering of these dynamic objects from any viewpoint, under any environmental lighting conditions, at any time of their lifespan.

      <description>arXiv:2501.00625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently released open-source pre-trained foundational image segmentation and object detection models (SAM2+GroundingDINO) allow for geometrically consistent segmentation of objects of interest in multi-view 2D images. Users can use text-based or click-based prompts to segment objects of interest without requiring labeled training datasets. Gaussian Splatting allows for the learning of the 3D representation of a scene's geometry and radiance based on 2D images. Combining Google Earth Studio, SAM2+GroundingDINO, 2D Gaussian Splatting, and our improvements in mask refinement based on morphological operations and contour simplification, we created a pipeline to extract the 3D mesh of any building based on its name, address, or geographic coordinates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06805v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models capable of producing high-quality contents such as images, videos, and audio, demonstrating their potential to revolutionize digital content creation. However, these capabilities come at the cost of their significant computational resources and lengthy generation time, underscoring the critical need to develop efficient techniques for practical deployment. In this survey, we provide a systematic and comprehensive review of research on efficient diffusion models. We organize the literature in a taxonomy consisting of three main categories, covering distinct yet interconnected efficient diffusion model topics from algorithm-level, system-level, and framework perspective, respectively. We have also created a GitHub repository where we organize the papers featured in this survey at https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/Efficient-Diffusion-Model-Survey. We hope our survey can serve as a valuable resource to help researchers and practitioners gain a systematic understanding of efficient diffusion model research and inspire them to contribute to this important and exciting field.</description>
