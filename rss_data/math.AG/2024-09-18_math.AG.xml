      <title>A stacky approach to $p$-adic Hodge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the stacky approach to $p$-adic cohomology theories recently developed by Drinfeld and Bhatt--Lurie to generalise known comparison theorems in $p$-adic Hodge theory so as to accommodate coefficients. More precisely, we establish a comparison between the rational crystalline cohomology of the special fibre and the rational $p$-adic \'etale cohomology of the arithmetic generic fibre of any proper $p$-adic formal scheme $X$ which allows for coefficients in any crystalline local system on the generic fibre of $X$; moreover, we also prove a comparison between the Nygaard filtration and the Hodge filtration for coefficients in an arbitrary gauge in the sense of Bhatt--Lurie. In the process, we develop a stacky approach to diffracted Hodge cohomology as introduced by Bhatt--Lurie, establish a version of the Beilinson fibre square of Antieau--Mathew--Morrow--Nikolaus with coefficients in the proper case and prove a comparison between syntomic cohomology and $p$-adic \'etale cohomology with coefficients in an arbitrary $F$-gauge. This work is the author's master's thesis at the University of Bonn.</description>

      <title>Statistics of Moduli Spaces of vector bundles over hyperelliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an asymptotic formula for the number of $\mathbb{F}_{q}$-rational points over a fixed determinant moduli space of stable vector bundles of rank $r$ and degree $d$ over a smooth, projective curve $X$ of genus $g \geq 2$ defined over $\mathbb{F}_{q}.$
  Further, we study the distribution of the error term when $X$ varies over a family of hyperelliptic curves. We then extend the results to the Seshadri desingularisation of the moduli space of semi-stable vector bundles of rank $2$ with trivial determinant, and also to the moduli space of rank $2$ stable Higgs bundles.</description>

      <title>Topological K-theory of quasi-BPS categories for Higgs bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper, we introduced quasi-BPS categories for moduli stacks of semistable Higgs bundles. Under a certain condition on the rank, Euler characteristic, and weight, the quasi-BPS categories (called BPS in this case) are non-commutative analogues of Hitchin integrable systems. We proposed a conjectural equivalence between BPS categories which swaps Euler characteristics and weights. The conjecture is inspired by the Dolbeault Geometric Langlands equivalence of Donagi--Pantev, by the Hausel--Thaddeus mirror symmetry, and by the $\chi$-independence phenomenon for BPS invariants of curves on Calabi-Yau threefolds.
  In this paper, we show that the above conjecture holds at the level of topological K-theories. When the rank and the Euler characteristic are coprime, such an isomorphism was proved by Groechenig--Shen. Along the way, we show that the topological K-theory of BPS categories is isomorphic to the BPS cohomology of the moduli of semistable Higgs bundles.</description>

      <title>Colengths of fractional ideals and Tjurina number of a reducible plane curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we refine a formula for the Tjurina number of a reducible algebroid plane curve defined over $\mathbb C$ obtained in the more general case of complete intersection curves in [1]. As a byproduct, we answer the affirmative to a conjecture proposed by A. Dimca in [7]. Our results are obtained by establishing more manageable formulas to compute the colengths of fractional ideals of the local ring associated with the algebroid (not necessarily a complete intersection) curve with several branches. We then apply these results to the Jacobian ideal of a plane curve over $\mathbb C$ to get a new formula for its Tjurina number and a proof of Dimca's conjecture. We end the paper by establishing a connection between the module of K\"ahler differentials on the curve modulo its torsion, seen as a fractional ideal, and its Jacobian ideal, explaining the relation between the present approach and that of [1].</description>

      <title>Existence of a unique solution to parametrized systems of generalized polynomial equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider solutions to parametrized systems of generalized polynomial equations (with real exponents) in $n$ positive variables, involving $m$ monomials with positive parameters; that is, $x\in\mathbb{R}^n_&gt;$ such that ${A \, (c \circ x^B)=0}$ with coefficient matrix $A\in\mathbb{R}^{l \times m}$, exponent matrix $B\in\mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$, parameter vector $c\in\mathbb{R}^m_&gt;$, and componentwise product $\circ$.
  As our main result, we characterize the existence of a unique solution (modulo an exponential manifold) for all parameters in terms of the relevant geometric objects of the polynomial system, namely the $\textit{coefficient polytope}$ and the $\textit{monomial dependency subspace}$. We show that unique existence is equivalent to the bijectivity of a certain moment/power map, and we characterize the bijectivity of this map using Hadamard's global inversion theorem. Furthermore, we provide sufficient conditions in terms of sign vectors of the geometric objects, thereby obtaining a multivariate Descartes' rule of signs for exactly one solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that Schubert varieties in flag manifolds are uniquely determined by their equivariant cohomology classes, as well as a stronger result that replaces Schubert varieties with closures of Bialynicki-Birula cells under suitable conditions. This is used to prove that any two-pointed curve neighborhood representing a quantum cohomology product with a Seidel class is a Schubert variety.</description>

      <title>$L^2$-vanishing theorem and a conjecture of Koll\'ar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1995, Koll\'ar conjectured that a complex projective $n$-fold $X$ with generically large fundamental group has Euler characteristic $\chi(X, K_X)\geq 0$. In this paper, we confirm the conjecture assuming $X$ has linear fundamental group, i.e., there exists an almost faithful representation $\pi_1(X)\to {\rm GL}_N(\mathbb{C})$. We deduce the conjecture by proving a stronger $L^2$ vanishing theorem: for the universal cover $\widetilde{X}$ of such $X$, its $L^2$-Dolbeaut cohomology $H_{(2)}^{n,q}(\widetilde{X})=0$ for $q\neq 0$. The main ingredients of the proof are techniques from the linear Shafarevich conjecture along with some analytic methods.</description>

      <title>Generating Functions for Line Bundle Cohomology Dimensions on Complex Projective Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the possibility of constructing multivariate generating functions for all cohomology dimensions of all holomorphic line bundles on certain complex projective varieties of Fano, Calabi-Yau and general type in various dimensions and Picard numbers. Most of the results are conjectural and rely on explicit cohomology computations. We first propose a generating function for the Euler characteristic of all holomorphic line bundles on complete intersections in products of projective spaces and toric varieties. This generating function is constructed by expanding the Hilbert-Poincare series associated with the coordinate ring of the variety around all possible combinations of zero and infinity and then summing up the resulting contributions with alternating signs. Similar generating functions are proposed for the individual cohomology dimensions of all holomorphic line bundles on certain complete intersections, including examples of Mori and non-Mori dream spaces. Surprisingly, the examples studied indicate that a single generating function encodes both the zeroth and all higher cohomologies upon expansion around different combinations of zero and infinity, raising the question whether such generating functions determine the variety uniquely.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic degree and its application to Zariski dense orbit conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for a dominant rational self-map $f$ on a quasi-projective variety defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, there is a point whose $f$-orbit is well-defined and its arithmetic degree is arbitrary close to the first dynamical degree of $f$. As an application, we prove that Zariski dense orbit conjecture holds for a birational map defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ such that the first dynamical degree is strictly larger than the third dynamical degree. In particular, the conjecture holds for birational maps on threefolds with first dynamical degree larger than $1$.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Multigraded Regularity and Virtual Resolutions on Products of Projective Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.10705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the relationship between multigraded Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity, truncations, Betti numbers, and virtual resolutions on a product of projective spaces $X$. After proving a uniqueness theorem for certain minimal virtual resolutions, we show that the multigraded regularity region of a module $M$ is determined by the minimal graded free resolutions of the truncations $M_{\geq\mathbf d}$ for $\mathbf d\in\operatorname{Pic} X$. Further, by relating the minimal graded free resolutions of $M$ and $M_{\geq\mathbf d}$ we provide a new bound on multigraded regularity of $M$ in terms of its Betti numbers. Using this characterization of regularity and this bound we also compute the multigraded Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity for a wide class of complete intersections in products of projective spaces.</description>

      <title>The tropical $n$-gonal construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.02267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a purely tropical analogue of Donagi's $n$-gonal construction and investigate its combinatorial properties. The input of the construction is a harmonic double cover of an $n$-gonal tropical curve. For $n = 2$ and a dilated double cover, the output is a tower of the same type, and we show that the Prym varieties of the two double covers are dual tropical abelian varieties. For $n=3$ and a free double cover, the output is a tetragonal tropical curve with dilation profile nowhere $(2,2)$ or $(4)$, and we show that the construction can be reversed. Furthermore, the Prym variety of the double cover and the Jacobian of the tetragonal curve are isomorphic as principally polarized tropical abelian varieties. Our main tool is tropical homology theory, and our proofs closely follow the algebraic versions.</description>

      <title>The Tensor as an Informational Resource</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A tensor is a multidimensional array of numbers that can be used to store data, encode a computational relation and represent quantum entanglement. In this sense a tensor can be viewed as valuable resource whose transformation can lead to an understanding of structure in data, computational complexity and quantum information.
  In order to facilitate the understanding of this resource, we propose a family of information-theoretically constructed preorders on tensors, which can be used to compare tensors with each other and to assess the existence of transformations between them. The construction places copies of a given tensor at the edges of a hypergraph and allows transformations at the vertices. A preorder is then induced by the transformations possible in a given growing sequence of hypergraphs. The new family of preorders generalises the asymptotic restriction preorder which Strassen defined in order to study the computational complexity of matrix multiplication.
  We derive general properties of the preorders and their associated asymptotic notions of tensor rank and view recent results on tensor rank non-additivity, tensor networks and algebraic complexity in this unifying frame. We hope that this work will provide a useful vantage point for exploring tensors in applied mathematics, physics and computer science, but also from a purely mathematical point of view.</description>

      <title>Solving the area-length systems in discrete gravity using homotopy continuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Area variables are intrinsic to connection formulations of general relativity, in contrast to the fundamental length variables prevalent in metric formulations. Within 4D discrete gravity, particularly based on triangulations, the area-length system establishes a relationship between area variables associated with triangles and the edge length variables. This system is comprised of polynomial equations derived from Heron's formula, which relates the area of a triangle to its edge lengths.
  Using tools from numerical algebraic geometry, we study the area-length systems. In particular, we show that given the ten triangular areas of a single 4-simplex, there could be up to 64 compatible sets of edge lengths. Moreover, we show that these 64 solutions do not, in general, admit formulae in terms of the areas by analyzing the Galois group, or monodromy group, of the problem. We show that by introducing additional symmetry constraints, it is possible to obtain such formulae for the edge lengths. We take the first steps toward applying our results within discrete quantum gravity, specifically for effective spin foam models.</description>
