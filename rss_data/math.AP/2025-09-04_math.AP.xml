      <title>From Age-Structured Trophic Networks to Applied Control : Stabilization and Harvesting Strategies for Non-Transitive Competition and the Dynamics of Mosquitoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a nonlinear age-structured multi-species model that serves as a unifying framework for ecological and biotechnological systems in complex environments (microbial communities, bioreactors, etc.). The formulation incorporates nonlocal intra- and interspecific interactions modulated by environmental covariates; under general assumptions on mortality, reproduction rates and interaction kernels, we establish existence, uniqueness and positivity of solutions. We illustrate the model's practical relevance along two lines: (i) multi-species examples, notably a non-transitive (cyclic) competition model, for which we show that, under the model assumptions, a control applied to a single species can achieve global stabilization of the system; furthermore, verification of the Kalman condition in this context provides an essential theoretical prerequisite and highlights that this single control acts indirectly on all other species; and (ii) the population dynamics of malaria-vector mosquitoes, for which we develop two control strategies (biological and genetic) and, in the biological-control scenario, prove global asymptotic stability of the aquatic compartment by constructing an explicit Lyapunov function. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results and compare the effectiveness of the proposed strategies in reducing vector density and malaria transmission.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusive fractional dynamics: Unveiling regularity results in systems with general positive self-adjoint operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the following fractional order in time Cauchy problem \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} \mathbb{D}_{t}^{\alpha }u(t)+Au(t)=f(u(t)), &amp; 1&lt;\alpha &lt;2, \\ u(0)=u_{0},\,\,\,u^{\prime }(0)=u_{1}. &amp; \end{cases}% \end{equation*}% where $\mathbb{D}_{t}^{\alpha }u(\cdot )$ is the Caputo time-fractional derivative of order $\alpha\in (1, 2)$ of the function $u$. Such problems are increasingly used in concrete models in applied sciences, notably phenomena with memory effects. We obtain results on existence and regularity of weak and strong energy solutions assuming that $A$ is any positive self-adjoint operator in a Hilbert space, when the nonlinearity $f\in C^{1}({\mathbb{R}}) $ satisfies suitable growth conditions. Our aim is to obtain regularity results {without} assuming that the operator $A$ has compact resolvent readily extending our recent results from our previous paper \cite{AGKW}. Examples of operators $A$ are considered, mainly differential operators such as Schr\"odinger operators, as well as various nonlocal operators.</description>

      <title>Modeling of radiating curved cables via coupled telegrapher's and Maxwell's equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electromagnetic interactions of cable harnesses in the time domain. We present a novel model that allows for curved cables, extending the standard assumptions typically made in transmission line modeling. The cables are described by the telegrapher's equations, the classical model for transmission lines, driven by input signals implemented through appropriate boundary conditions, such as imposed voltages at cable ends. The cables interact via electromagnetic radiation; the latter is determined by Maxwell's equations. This interaction is incorporated into the model through boundary conditions imposed on the electromagnetic field. The resulting coupling between the transmission lines and Maxwell's equations is energetically consistent. In particular, we show that the coupled system satisfies a global power balance.</description>

      <title>On stable solutions to the Allen-Cahn equation with bounded energy density in $\mathbb{R}^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that stable solutions $u:\mathbb{R}^4\to (-1,1)$ to the Allen-Cahn equation with bounded energy density (or equivalently, with cubic energy growth) are one-dimensional.
  This is known to entail important geometric consequences, such as robust curvature estimates for stable phase transitions, and the multiplicity one and Morse index conjectures of Marques-Neves for Allen-Cahn approximations of minimal hypersurfaces in closed 4-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Nonunique tangent maps at isolated singularities of minimizing $p$-harmonic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of ``tangent maps'' at singular points of energy minimizing maps plays an important role in our understanding of the fine structure of the singular set. This note presents the first example of a minimizing (not just stationary) $p$-harmonic map with nonunique tangent maps at an isolated singularity. We construct a $n$-dimensional manifold $N$ such that for every admissible tuple $p&lt; m\le n+2$, there exists a map from $B_1^m$ into $N$ that minimizes the $p$-energy, has an isolated singularity at the origin and admits a continuum of distinct tangent maps. The construction builds upon and extends B.~ White's example for $p=2$ in the stationary case.</description>

      <title>Sampling methods for the inverse cavity scattering problem of biharmonic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the inverse problem of qualitatively recovering a clamped cavity in a thin elastic plate using far-field measurements. We present a strengthened analysis of the linear sampling method by carefully examining the range of the far-field operator and employing the reciprocity relation of the biharmonic far-field pattern. In addition, we implement both the linear sampling method for reconstructing the cavity and the extended sampling method for localizing the cavity under limited-aperture data. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of both methods.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of measures with density bounds in a H\"older anisotropic setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the regularity of the support of a Radon measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ for which anisotropic versions of its $n$-dimensional density ratio and its doubling character are assumed to converge with H\"older rate. We show that in either case, if the support of $\mu$ is flat enough, then it is a $C^{1,\gamma}$ $n$-dimensional submanifold of $\mathbb R^{n+1}$, for some $\gamma\in (0,1)$. If the flatness assumption is dropped, then the support of $\mu$ is the union of a $C^{1,\gamma}$ $n$-dimensional submanifold of $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ and a set of $n$-Hausdorff measure zero.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate $L^2$-contraction and time-asymptotic stability of large shock for scalar viscous conservation laws with polynomial flux. For the strictly convex flux $f(u)=u^p $ with $2\leq p \leq 4$, we can prove $L^2$-contraction and time-asymptotic stability of arbitrarily large viscous shock profile in $H^1$-framework by using $a$-contraction method with time-dependent shift and suitable weight function. Additionally, if the initial perturbation belongs to $L^1$, then $L^2$ time-asymptotic decay rate $t^{-\frac{1}{4}}$ can be obtained.</description>

      <title>A note on Wang's conjecture for harmonic functions with nonlinear boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain some Liouville type theorems for positive harmonic functions on compact Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and strictly convex boundary and partially verifies Wang's conjecture (J. Geom. Anal. 31 (2021)).
  For the specific manifold $\mathbb{B}^n$, we present a new proof of this conjecture, which has been resolved by Gu-Li (Math. Ann. 391 (2025)). Our proof is based on a general principle of applying the P-function method to such uniqueness results. As a further application of this method, we obtain some Liouville type results for nonnegative solutions of equations with both a nonlinear source term and a nonlinear boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Boundary layer effects induced by the fluid in a chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the boundary layer problem on a chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes system modelling the boundary layer formation of aerobic bacteria in fluids. Completing this system with Neumann boundary conditions on oxygen, we show that gradients of its second solution component in the half plane of $\mathbb{R}^2$ possess boundary layer effects as the oxygen diffusion rate goes to zero. However, neglecting the influence of the fluid, gradients of solutions to the chemotaxis-only subsystem no longer present such boundary layer effects. It seems that the boundary layer effect for the chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes system under Neumann boundary conditions on oxygen is induced by the presence of fluids.45</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note reviews a recent contribution about the Fisher information for the space-homogeneous Boltzmann equation by L. Silvestre, C. Villani and the author (arXiv, 2024). This classical functional from information theory is shown to be nonincreasing along the flow of the non-linear PDE for all physically relevant particle interactions. The proof consists in establishing a new functional inequality on the sphere of Log-Sobolev type. This new a priori estimate on solutions yields global-in-time well posedness of the equation, in particular in the case of very singular interactions, a left open question up to this work.

      <title>Range characterization of the ray transform on Sobolev spaces of symmetric tensor fields in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ray transform $I_m$ integrates a symmetric $m$ rank tensor field $f$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ over lines. In the case of $n\ge3$, the range characterization of the operator $I_m$ on weighted Sobolev spaces $H^{s}_t({{\mathbb R}}^n;S^m{{\mathbb R}}^n)$ was obtained in [V. Krishnan and V. Sharafutdinov. Range characterization of ray transform on Sobolev spaces of symmetric tensor fields. Inverse Problems and Imaging, 18(6), 1272--1293, 2024]. Here we obtain a range characterization result in higher order weighted Sobolev spaces in two dimensions. Range characterization in the case of $n=2$ is very different from that for $n\ge3$, and this allows us to obtain such a result in higher order weighted Sobolev spaces $H^{r,s}_t(\mathbb{R}^2)$ for any real $r$. Nevertheless, our main tool is again the Reshetnyak formula stating that $\lVert I_mf\rVert_{H^{(r,s+1/2)}_{t+1/2}(T{{\mathbb S}}^{n-1})}=\lVert f\rVert_{H^{(r,s)}_t({{\mathbb R}}^n;S^m{{\mathbb R}}^n)}$ for a solenoidal tensor field $f$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the boundedness of the imaginary powers of four generalized diffusion operators. This key property, which implies the maximal regularity property, allows us to solve both the linear and semilinear Cauchy problems associated with each operator. Our approach relies on semigroup theory, functional calculus, operator sum theory and R-boundedness techniques to establish the boundedness of the imaginary powers of generalized diffusion operators. We then apply the Dore-Venni theorem to solve the linear problem, obtaining a unique solution with maximal regularity. Finally, we tackle the semilinear problem and prove the existence of a unique global solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an example of the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation, the mean field Langevin dynamics recently attracts attention due to its connection to (noisy) gradient descent on infinitely wide neural networks in the mean field regime, and hence the convergence property of the dynamics is of great theoretical interest. In this paper, In the continuity of [1, 2], we are interested by the long-time behavior and uniform in time propagation of chaos by synchronous coupling for mean-field Langevin dynamics (over- and under-damped).</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Keller-Segel equations with weak dissipation in Besov spaces: Global well-posedness and blow-up criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the Cauchy problem for weakly dissipative hyperbolic Keller-Segel (HKS) equations in both non-critical and critical inhomogeneous Besov spaces. We first show that the problem admits a unique global strong solution if either the dissipation parameter $\lambda$ is sufficiently large or the initial data norm is sufficiently small. This provides a partial affirmative answer to the open question of global well-posedness in Besov spaces left by \cite{Zhang2022,Zhou2021,Meng2024}. An interesting observation is that these results can be extended to HKS equations with time-dependent parameters involving the weakly dissipative HKS equations as a special case, where global solvability depends solely on the $L^1$-integrability of the variable coefficients. Furthermore, we derive two types of blow-up criteria for strong solutions in both critical and non-critical Besov spaces, and explicitly characterize the lower bound of blow-up time. These findings partly clarify how time-dependent parameters (especially, the dissipation parameter $\lambda$) guarantee global existence of solutions.</description>

Abstract: We derive a priori interior Hessian estimates and regularity for the sigma-2 Hessian equation $\sigma_{2}(D^2u)=f(x,u,Du)$ with positive $C^{1,1}$ right hand side in dimension 4. In higher dimensions, the same result holds under an additional dynamic semi-convexity condition on solutions. This generalizes Qiu's and Shankar-Yuan's results.</description>

      <title>A novel approach to study the wellposedness of the 3D fluid-2D plate interaction PDE System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a certain fluid-structure interaction (FSI) system with a view of obtaining an alternative methodology for establishing its strongly continuous semigroup wellposedness. (Semigroup generation for this FSI was originally considered in Avalos-Clark (2014).) The FSI model under consideration describes the vibrations of an incompressible fluid within a 3D cavity as it interacts with the elastic membrane on the ``free" upper boundary of the cavity. Such coupled PDE systems appear in variety of natural settings such as biomedicine, aeroelasticity, and fluid dynamics.
  Our proof of $C_0$-semigroup wellposedness is based on a proper application of Lumer Phillips Theorem. In this regard, our main challenge is to show the maximality of the corresponding semigroup generator. To this end, we develop a ``nonstandard" inf-sup approach which avoids the use of technical nonlocal maps in the associated bilinear forms--unlike the earlier paper Avalos-Clark (2014)--and allows for the solution of the fluid and plate solution variables simultanously. Our new inf-sup strategy will lead to a more efficient mixed finite element method (FEM) for approximating solutions to the FSI problem, inasmuch our novel variational formulation avoids bilinear forms which are free from the computationally-intensive nonlocal solution operators invoked in Avalos-Clark (2014). We also perform numerical tests based on this formulation using a benchmark problem
  and present numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Local boundary conditions in nonlocal hyperelasticity via heterogeneous horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of variational problems with integral functionals involving nonlocal gradients. These models have been recently proposed as refinements of classical hyperelasticity, aiming for an effective framework to capture also discontinuous and singular material effects. Specific to our set-up is a space-dependent interaction range that vanishes at the boundary of the reference domain. This ensures that the nonlocal operator depends only on values within the domain and localizes to the classical gradient at the boundary, which allows for a seamless integration of nonlocal modeling with local boundary values. The main contribution of this work is a comprehensive theory for the newly introduced associated Sobolev spaces, including the rigorous treatment of a trace operator and Poincar\'e inequalities. A central aspect of our technical approach lies in exploiting connections with pseudo-differential operator theory. As an application, we establish the existence of minimizers for functionals with quasiconvex or polyconvex integrands depending on heterogeneous nonlocal gradients, subject to local Dirichlet, Neumann or mixed-type boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: In the paper, we consider Br\"{u}ck conjecture as the solutions of first-order partial differential equations in several complex variables. Our results ensure that Br\"{u}ck conjecture in $\mathbb{C}^m$ is valid under some additional conditions. In pursuit of this goal, we have also established the Borel-Caratheodory theorem in $\mathbb{C}^m$ and derived several fundamental results concerning order and hyper-order into higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>On the Spectrum of Schr\"{o}dinger Operators Interacting at Two Distinct Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schr\"{o}dinger operators of the form $\Delta - W$ on $L^2_{\text{rad}}(\mathbb{R}^3)$, the space of radially symmetric square integrable functions are relevant in a variety of physical contexts. The potential $W$ is taken to be radially symmetric (i.e. $W(x) = W(|x|)$) and to decompose into two components with distinct spatial scales: $W=W_\varepsilon= V_0+V_{1,\varepsilon}$. The second component $V_{1,\varepsilon}(|x|) = \varepsilon^2V_1(\varepsilon |x|)$ represents a scaled potential that becomes increasingly delocalized as $\varepsilon \to 0$. We will assume that both potentials $V_0(r), V_1(r)$ exhibit certain decay properties as $r \to \infty$. We show how the eigenvalue count on the positive real axis is built out of the spectra associated with the two reduced eigenvalue problems on their separate scales. The result is that the total number of eigenvalues of $\Delta - W$ is the sum of the number of positive eigenvalues of $\Delta - V_0$ and $\Delta - V_1$. Our analysis combines dynamical systems techniques with a separation of scales argument, providing a novel framework for studying spectral properties of differential operators where multiple spatial scales interact.</description>

      <title>On linking numbers and Biot-Savart kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a compact manifold, the solutions of the initial value problem for the heat equation with currential initial conditions are smooth families of forms for $t&gt;0$. If the initial condition is an exact submanifold $L$ then the integral in $t$ of this family gives a smooth form $\Omega$ on the complement of $L$ such that $\omega:=d^*\Omega$ is a solution for the exterior derivative equation $d\omega=L$. We introduce, for small $t$, an asymptotic approximation of these solutions in order to show that $d^*\Omega$ is extendible to the oriented blow-up of $L$ in codimension $1$ and $3$ and also $2$ when $L$ is minimal. When $L$ is the diagonal in $M\times M$ we adapt these ideas to obtain a differential linking form for any compact, ambient Riemannian manifold $M$ of dimension $3$. This coincides up to sign with the kernel of the Biot-Savart operator $d^*G$ and recovers the well-known Gauss formula for linking numbers in $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present and analyze an integral equation method for the scattering of a non-periodic source from a geometry consisting of two semi-infinite, periodic structures glued together in two dimensions. The two structures may involve a periodic wall, several layers of transmission surfaces with a shared period, or periodic sets of obstacles. This integral equation is posed on the infinite interface between the two periodic structures using kernels built out of the Green's function for each structure. To combat the slow decay of the Green's function, we also show that our integral equation can be analytically continued into the complex plane, where it can be truncated with exponential accuracy. A careful analysis of the domain Green's functions far from the periodic structure is then used to prove that the analytically continued equation is Fredholm index zero. Finally, we show that the solution we generate satisfies a radiation condition and demonstrate an efficient and high order solver for this problem.</description>

      <title>Local Well-Posedness for the Bartnik Stationary Extension Problem near Schwarzschild Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Bartnik stationary extension conjecture, which arises from the definition of the spacetime Bartnik mass for a compact region in a general initial data set satisfying the dominant energy condition. This conjecture posits the existence and uniqueness (up to isometry) of an asymptotically flat stationary vacuum spacetime containing an initial data set $(M, \mathfrak{g}, \Pi)$ that realizes prescribed Bartnik boundary data on $\partial M$, consisting of the induced metric, mean curvature, and appropriate components of the spacetime extrinsic curvature $\Pi$.
  Building on the analytic framework developed in arXiv:2411.02801 for the static case, we show that, in a double geodesic gauge, the stationary vacuum Einstein equations reduce to a coupled system comprising elliptic and transport-type equations, with the genuinely stationary contributions encoded in an additional boundary value problem for a $1$-form $\theta$. Our approach employs both a geodesic gauge for the quotient metric $g$ in the quotient formalism and a $\theta$-geodesic gauge for the $1$-form $\theta$.
  We establish local well-posedness for the Bartnik stationary metric extension problem for Bartnik data sufficiently close to that of any coordinate sphere in a Schwarzschild ${t=0}$ slice, including data with arbitrarily small mean curvature. A key feature of our framework is that the linearized equations decouple: the equations for the metric and potential reduce to the previously solved static case, while the boundary value problem for $\theta$ is treated independently. We prove solvability of this boundary value problem in the Bochner-measurable function spaces adapted to the coupled system developed in arXiv:2411.02801, establishing uniform estimates for the vector spherical harmonic decomposition of $\theta$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.14740v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the principal eigenvalue $\mu(\mathscr{F}_k^-,E)$ of the fully nonlinear operator
  \[
  \mathscr{F}_k^-[u] = \mathcal{P}_k^-(\nabla^2 u) - h |\nabla u|
  \] on a set $E \Subset \mathbb{R}^n$, where $h \in [0,\infty)$ and $\mathcal{P}_k^-(\nabla^2 u)$ is the sum of the smallest $k$ eigenvalues of the Hessian $\nabla^2 u$. We prove a lower estimate for $\mu(\mathscr{F}_k^-,E)$ in terms of a generalized Hausdorff measure $\mathscr{H}_\Psi(E)$, for suitable $\Psi$ depending on $k$, moving some steps in the direction of the conjecturally sharp estimate
  \[
  \mu(\mathscr{F}_k^-,E) \ge C \mathscr{H}^k(E)^{-2/k}.
  \] The theorem is used to study the spectrum of bounded submanifolds in $\mathbb{R}^n$, improving on our previous work in the direction of a question posed by S.T. Yau. In particular, the result applies to solutions of Plateau's problem for CMC surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence and spectral stability of periodic traveling wave solutions for the regularized Camassa-Holm equation. To establish the existence of periodic waves, we employ tools from bifurcation theory to construct solutions with the zero-mean property. We also prove that such waves may not exist for the well-known Camassa-Holm equation. Regarding spectral stability, we analyze the difference between the number of negative eigenvalues of the second variation of the Lyapunov functional at the wave, restricted to the space of zero-mean periodic functions, and the number of negative eigenvalues of the matrix formed from the tangent space associated with the low-order conserved quantities of the evolution model. Finally, we address the problem of orbital stability as a consequence of the spectral stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a modified Ricci flow, as well as a quasi-normalized Ricci flow, on arbitrary weighted graph. Each of these two flows has a unique global solution. In particular, these global existence and uniqueness results do not require an exit condition proposed by Bai et al in a recent work [2]. As applications, these two Ricci flows are applied to community detection for complex networks, including Karate Club, American football games, Facebook, as well as artificial networks. In our algorithms, unlike in [5,15], there is no need to perform surgery at every iteration, only one surgery needs to be performed after the last iteration. From three commonly used criteria for evaluating community detection algorithms, ARI, NMI and Q, we conclude that our algorithms outperform existing algorithms, including Ollivier's Ricci flow [5], normalized Ollivier's Ricci flow and normalized Lin-Lu-Yau's Ricci flow [15]. The codes for our algorithms are available at https://github.com/mjc191812/Modified-Ricci-Flow.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in an inverse problem for the active scalar equations with fractional dissipation on the torus. We perform a second order linearization to relate our model to the linear fractional diffusion equation. Our approach to solving the inverse problem relies on nonlocal phenomena such as the unique continuation property of the fractional Laplacian and its associated Runge approximation property. A remarkable feature of our model is that the divergence-free structure in the nonlinear term plays an important role in both forward and inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Dissipation via time-modulated velocity fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by mixing processes in analytical laboratories, this work investigates enhanced dissipation in non-autonomous flows. We study the evolution of concentrations governed by the advection-diffusion equation, where the velocity field is modelled as the product of a shear flow and a time-dependent modulation function $\xi(t)$. The main objective of this paper is to derive quantitative estimates for the energy decay rates, which are shown to depend sensitively on the properties of $\xi$. We identify a class of time-dependent functions that are bounded by increasing functions, for which we demonstrate super-enhanced dissipation, characterized by energy decay rates faster than those observed in autonomous cases. Additionally, we explore the case of velocity fields that may be switched on and off over time. Here, the dissipation rates are comparable to those of autonomous flows. To illustrate our results, we analyse two prototypical flows of this class: one exhibiting a gradual turn-on and turn-off phase, and another that undergoes a significant acceleration following a slow initial activation phase. Both results are achieved through the application of the hypocoercivity framework, adapted to an augmented functional with time-dependent weights. These weights are designed to dynamically counteract the potential growth of $\xi$, ensuring robust decay estimates.</description>

      <title>Soliton Dynamics and Modulation Instability in the (3+1)-dimensional ZK equation: A Lie Symmetry Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07682v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The core focus of this research work is to obtain invariant solutions and conservation laws of the (3+1)-dimensional ZK equation, a higher-dimensional generalization of the Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) equation, which describes the phenomenon of wave stability and soliton propagation. Lie symmetry analysis has been applied to derive infinitesimal generators and classify the optimal subalgebras. Utilizing them, we construct exact invariant solutions that reveal how waves retain their shape as they travel, how they interact in space, and the impact of magnetic fields on wave propagation. Further, by implementing the traveling wave transformation, we derive additional exact solutions, including those exhibiting kink-type solitons. It also concludes with the conservation laws and the nonlinear self-adjointness property. Our examination is broadened to cover modulation instability and gain spectrum. To contextualize our results, we compare the solutions obtained from the Lie symmetry method with those derived using the modified simple equation (MSE) method and other symbolic techniques reported in recent literature. To validate the accuracy of the analytical solutions obtained via Lie symmetry, a numerical method is implemented. A review of the ZK equation's physical background and mathematical complexity is explored, emphasizing the limitations of symbolic approaches.</description>

      <title>Representation and Stability Analysis of 1D PDEs with Periodic Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22896v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PDEs with periodic boundary conditions are frequently used to model processes in large spatial environments, assuming solutions to extend periodically beyond some bounded interval. However, solutions to these PDEs often do not converge to a unique equilibrium, but instead converge to non-stationary trajectories existing in the nullspace of the spatial differential operator (e.g. $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$). To analyse this convergence behaviour, in this paper, it is shown how such trajectories can be modeled for a broad class of linear, 2nd order, 1D PDEs with periodic as well as more general boundary conditions, using the Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation. In particular, it is first shown how any PDE state satisfying these boundary conditions can be uniquely expressed in terms of two components, existing in the image and the nullspace of the differential operator $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$, respectively. An equivalent representation of linear PDEs is then derived as a PIE, explicitly defining the dynamics of both state components. Finally, a notion of exponential stability is defined that requires only one of the state components to converge to zero, and it is shown how this stability notion can be tested by solving a linear operator inequality. The proposed methodology is applied to examples of heat and wave equations, demonstrating that exponential stability can be verified with tight bounds on the rate of decay.</description>

      <title>Existence and order of the self--binding transition in non--local non--linear Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of non--linear and non--local functionals giving rise to the Choquard equation with a suitably regular interaction potential, modelling, i.e., gases with impurities and axion stars. We study how existence of minimizers depends on the coupling constant, and find that there is a critical interaction strength needed for the minimizers to exist, both in dimensions two and three. In $d=3$, a minimizer exists also at the critical coupling but none do in $d=2$ under suitable assumptions on the potential. We also establish that in $d=3$ there exist other critical points beyond the global minimizer.</description>

      <title>The existence and local uniqueness of the eigenfunctions of the non-linear operator $ \Delta_H u^{n}$ in the hyperbolic Poincar\'e half-plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we find locally an eigenfunctions for a particular nonlinear hyperbolic differential operator $\Delta_H u^{n}$, where $\Delta_H$ is the hyperbolic Laplacian in the half-plane of Poincair\'e. We have proved that these eigenfunctions are an analytic and non-exact whose coefficients satisfy a specific algebraic recursive rule. The existence of these eigenfunctions allows us to find non-exact solutions respecting the spatial coordinate of nonlinear diffusive PDEs on the Poincair\'e half-plane, which could describe a possible one-dimensional physical model.</description>

      <title>Dispersive analysis for one-dimensional charge transfer models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study one-dimensional linear Schr\"odinger equations with multiple moving potentials, known as transfer charge models. Focusing on the non-self-adjoint setting that arises in the study of solitons, we systematically develop the scattering theory and establish dispersive estimates under the assumption that the potentials move at significantly different velocities, even in the presence of unstable modes. In particular, we prove the existence of wave operators, asymptotic completeness, and pointwise decay of solutions, without requiring the absence of threshold resonances. Our analysis set up the fundamental work for studying the nonlinear dynamics of multi-solitons, including asymptotic stability and collisions.</description>

      <title>Scattering for the Klein-Gordon-Zakharov system in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Klein-Gordon-Zakharov system in two spatial dimensions, an important model in plasma physics. For small, smooth, and spatially localized initial data, we establish the global existence of solutions and characterize their sharp long-time behavior, including sharp time decay and scattering properties. A particularly interesting phenomenon is that the Klein-Gordon component exhibits modified scattering for certain initial data, while for others it undergoes linear scattering-a dichotomy highlighting delicate long-range interaction effects.
  The major obstacles are lack of symmetry and weak decay of the solution in two dimensions. To overcome these, we introduce a novel nonlinear transformation of the wave component and reinterpret the nonlinear coupling as a perturbation of the mass term in the Klein-Gordon equation. The proof employs a combination of physical space and frequency space methods.</description>

      <title>Improved stability threshold for 2D Navier-Stokes Couette flow in an infinite channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear stability of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations around the Couette shear flow in the channel domain $\mathbb{R}\times[-1,1]$ subject to Navier slip boundary conditions. We establish a quantitative stability threshold for perturbations of the initial vorticity $\omega_{in}$, showing that stability holds for perturbations of order $\nu^{1/2}$ measured in an anisotropic Sobolev space. This sharpens the recent work of Arbon and Bedrossian [Comm. Math. Phys., 406 (2025), Paper No. 129] who proved stability under the threshold $\nu^{1/2}(1+\ln(1/\nu))^{-1/2}$. Our result removes the logarithmic loss and identifies the natural scaling $\nu^{1/2}$ as the critical size of perturbations for nonlinear stability in this setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, by using the spectral theory of functions and properties of evolution semigroups, we establish conditions on the existence, and uniqueness of asymptotic 1-periodic solutions to a class of abstract differential equations with infinite delay of the form \begin{equation*} \frac{d u(t)}{d t}=A u(t)+L(u_t)+f(t) \end{equation*} where $A$ is the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup of linear operators, $L$ is a bounded linear operator from a phase space $\mathscr{B}$ to a Banach space $X$, $u_t$ is an element of $\mathscr{B}$ which is defined as $u_t(\theta)=u(t+\theta)$ for $\theta \leq 0$ and $f$ is asymptotic 1-periodic in the sense that $\lim\limits_{t \rightarrow \infty}(f(t+1)-$ $f(t))=0$. A Lotka-Volterra model with diffusion and infinite delay is considered to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Initial singularities of positive solutions of the Heat equation on Stratified Lie groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14051v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(\mathbb{G},\circ)$ be a stratified Lie group. We estimate the Hausdorff dimension (with respect to the Carnot-Carath\'eodory metric) of the singular sets in $\mathbb{G}$, where a positive solution of the Heat equation corresponding to a sub-Laplacian, blows up faster than a prescribed rate along normal limits, in terms of the homogeneous dimension of $\mathbb{G}$ and the rate of the blowup parameter. This generalizes a classical result of Watson for the Euclidean Heat. We also obtain the corresponding sharpness result, which is new even for $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

Abstract: This article investigates the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions to nonlinear stochastic reaction-diffusion-advection equations (SRDAEs) with spatially homogeneous colored noises and infinitesimal generators of subordinate Brownian motions in mixed norm $L_q(L_p)$-spaces. We introduce a new condition (strongly reinforced Dalang's condition) on colored noise, which facilitates a deeper understanding of the complicated relation between nonlinearities and stochastic forces. Additionally, we establish the space-time H\"older type regularity of solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Caffarelli-Hardt-Simon used the minimal surface equation on the Simons cone $C(S^3\times S^3)$ to generate newer examples of minimal hypersurfaces with isolated singularities. Hardt-Simon proved that every area-minimizing quadratic cone $\mathcal{C}$ having only an isolated singularity can be approximated by a unique foliation of $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ by smooth, area-minimizing hypersurfaces asymptotic to $\mathcal C$. This paper uses methods similar to Caffareli-Hardt-Simon to solve the minimal surface equation for the Hardt-Simon surfaces in the sphere for some boundary values. We use gluing methods to construct minimal surfaces over Hardt-Simon surfaces and near quadratic cones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend representation formulas for functions in Hardy classes of solutions to higher-order iterated Vekua equations to Hardy classes of bicomplex-valued functions that solve a bicomplex version of the Vekua equation or its higher-order generalizations. Using these representations, we show that functions in these bicomplex-valued Hardy classes have nontangential boundary values and boundary values in the sense of distributions.</description>
