      <title>On the Nonexistence of Global Solutions for Nonlocal Parabolic Equations with Forcing Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to analyze the well-posedness and blow-up behavior of solutions to the nonlocal semilinear parabolic equation with a forcing term: \[ \partial_t u - \Delta u = \|u(t)\|_{q}^\alpha |u|^p + t^{\varrho} \mathbf{w}(x) \quad \text{in} \quad \mathbb{R}^N \times (0, \infty), \]
  where $N \geq 1$, $p, q \geq 1$, $\alpha \geq 0$, $\varrho &gt; -1$, and $\mathbf{w}(x)$ is a suitably given continuous function.
  The novelty of this work, compared to previous studies, lies in considering a nonlocal nonlinearity $\|u(t)\|_{q}^\alpha |u|^p$ and a forcing term $t^{\varrho} \mathbf{w}(x)$ that depend on both time and space variables. This combination introduces new challenges in understanding the interplay between the nonlocal structure of the equation and the spatio-temporal forcing term.
  Under appropriate assumptions, we establish the global existence of solutions for small initial data in Lebesgue spaces when the exponent $p$ exceeds a critical value. In contrast, we show that the global existence cannot hold for $p$ below this critical value, provided the additional condition $\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \mathbf{w}(x) \, dx &gt; 0$ is satisfied. The main challenge in this analysis lies in managing the complex interaction between the nonlocal nonlinearity and the forcing term, which significantly influences the behavior of solutions.</description>

      <title>Positive singular solutions of a certain elliptic PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence of positive singular solutions for a system of partial differential equations on a bounded domain. Our approach is based on analyzing the solution of the equation \begin{equation} \label{base equation} \left\{ \begin{array}{lr} -\Delta w = | \nabla w |^p &amp; \text{in}~~ B_1 \backslash \{0\},\\ w = 0 &amp; \text{on}~~ \partial B_1, \end{array} \right. \end{equation} and using its properties to study positive singular solutions of its perturbations on $ B_1 $, the unit ball centered at the origin in $\mathbb{R}^N$, under the assumptions $N \geq 3$ and $\frac{N}{N-1} &lt; p &lt; 2$ . Specifically, we consider the system \begin{equation} \label{main equation of the thesis} \left\{ \begin{array}{lr} -\Delta u = (1+\kappa_1(x)) | \nabla v |^p &amp; \text{in}~~ B_1 \backslash \{0\},\\ -\Delta v = (1+\kappa_2(x)) | \nabla u |^p &amp; \text{in}~~ B_1 \backslash \{0\},\\ u = v = 0 &amp; \text{on}~~ \partial B_1. \end{array} \right. \end{equation} Here, $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$ are non-negative, continuous functions satisfying $\kappa_1(0) = \kappa_2(0) = 0$ . The goal of this work is to establish the existence of positive singular solutions for this equation within the given domain.</description>

      <title>Green's function estimates for time measurable parabolic operators on polyhedrons and polyhedral cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide Green's function estimates for parabolic operators on polyhedrons and polyhedral cones in $\mathbb{R}^3$. These estimates incorporate mixed weights, which include appropriate powers of the distances to the vertices, the edges, and the boundary of the domains. The allowable ranges for the weight parameters are explicitly determined by the geometry of the domains.</description>

      <title>Velocity Averaging for the Wigner Kinetic Equation in the Semiclassical Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses the possibility of applying the velocity averaging theorems in [F. Golse, P.-L. Lions, B. Perthame, R. Sentis: J. Funct. Anal. 76(1):110--125, 1988] to the Wigner equation governing the quantum evolution of the Wigner transform of quantum density operators. Our first main results address the case of the Wigner function of a special class of density operators associated to mixed states, whose Hilbert-Schmidt norm is of order $\hbar^{d/2}$, where $d$ is the space dimension and $\hbar$ the reduced Planck constant. In space dimension $d=1$, we prove that the density function belongs to the Sobolev space $H^s(\mathbb R)$ for some $s&gt;0$. In the case of pure states, we first obtain a characterization of the Wigner transform of rank-one quantum density operators, and apply this characterization (1) to analyze a rather general setting in which velocity averaging cannot apply to the Wigner functions of a family of rank-one density operators whose evolution is governed by the von Neumann equation, and (2) to obtain a quick derivation of Madelung's system of quantum hydrodynamic equations. This derivation provides a physical explanation of one key assumption used in the proof of the negative result (1) described above.</description>

      <title>Extended convexity and uniqueness of minimizers for interaction energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear interpolation convexity (LIC) has served as the crucial condition for the uniqueness of interaction energy minimizers. We introduce the concept of the LIC radius which extends the LIC condition. Uniqueness of minimizer up to translation can still be guaranteed if the LIC radius is larger than the possible support size of any minimizer. Using this approach, we obtain uniqueness of minimizer for power-law potentials $W_{a,b}({\bf x}) = \frac{|{\bf x}|^a}{a} - \frac{|{\bf x}|^b}{b},\,-d&lt;b&lt;2$ with $a$ slightly smaller than 2 or slightly larger than 4. The estimate of LIC radius for $a$ slightly smaller than 2 is done via a Poincar\'{e}-type inequality for signed measures. To handle the case where $a$ slightly larger than 4, we truncate the attractive part of the potential at large radius and prove that the resulting potential has positive Fourier transform. We also propose to study the logarithmic power-law potential $W_{b,\ln}({\bf x}) = \frac{|{\bf x}|^b}{b}\ln|{\bf x}|$. We prove its LIC property for $b=2$ and give the explicit formula for minimizer. We also prove the uniqueness of minimizer for $b$ slightly less than 2 by estimating its LIC radius.</description>

      <title>Structure stability of steady supersonic shear flow with inflow boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence and zero viscous limit of smooth solutions to steady compressible Navier-Stokes equations near plane shear flow between two moving parallel walls. Under the assumption $0&lt;L\ll1$, we prove that for any plane supersonic shear flow $\mathbf{U}^0=(\mu(x_2),0)$, there exist smooth solutions near $\mathbf{U}^0$ to steady compressible Navier-Stokes equations in a 2-dimension domain $\Omega=(0,L)\times (0,2)$. Moreover, based on the uniform-in-$\varepsilon$ estimates, we establish the zero viscosity limit of the solutions obtained above to the solutions of the steady Euler equations.</description>

      <title>Dual Curvature Density Equation with Group Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the general Lp dual curvature density equation under a group symmetry assumption. This geometric partial differential equation arises from the general Lp dual Minkowski problem of prescribing the Lp dual curvature measure of convex bodies. It is a Monge-Ampere type equation on the unit sphere. If the density function of the dual curvature measure is invariant under a closed subgroup of the orthogonal group, the geometric partial differential equation is solved in this paper for certain range of negative p using a variational method. This work generalizes recent results on the Lp dual Minkowski problem of origin-symmetric convex bodies.</description>

      <title>Second-order monotonicity conditions and mean field games with volatility control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript we study the well-posedness of the master equations for mean field games with volatility control. This infinite dimensional PDE is nonlinear with respect to both the first and second-order derivatives of its solution. For standard mean field games with only drift control, it is well-known that certain monotonicity condition is essential for the uniqueness of mean field equilibria and for the global well-posedness of the master equations. To adapt to the current setting with volatility control, we propose a new notion called second-order monotonicity conditions. Surprisingly, the second-order Lasry-Lions monotonicity is equivalent to its standard (first-order) version, but such an equivalency fails for displacement monotonicity. When the Hamiltonian is separable and the data are Lasry-Lions monotone, we show that the Lasry-Lions monotonicity propagates and the master equation admits a unique classical solution. This is the first work for the well-posedness, both local and global, of master equations when the volatility is controlled.</description>

      <title>Inverse random source problem for Maxwell equations in an inhomogeneous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the inverse random source problem of the stochastic Maxwell equations driven by white noise in an inhomogeneous background medium. The well-posedness is established for the direct source problem, and the estimates and regularity of the solution are obtained. A logarithmic stability estimate is established for the inverse problem of determining the strength of the random source. The analysis only requires the random Dirichlet data at a fixed frequency.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and classification of positive solutions of some weighted elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the weighted elliptic equation \begin{equation} -div(|x|^{-2a}\nabla u)=|x|^{-bp}|u|^{p-2}u~~~\mbox{in}~\mathbb{R}^N ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(0.1)\end{equation} with $N\geq 2$, which arises from the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities. Under the assumptions of finite energy and $a_1+a_2=N-2$, for nonnegative solutions we prove the equivalence between equation (0.1) with $a=a_1$ and equation (0.1) with $a=a_2$. Without finite energy assumptions, for $2\leq p&lt;2^*$ we give the optimal parameter range in which nonnegative solutions of (0.1) in $\mathbf{L}^\infty_{Loc}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ must be radially symmetric, and give a complete classification for these solutions in this range.</description>

      <title>Analysis of linear Boussinesq-type models coupled with static interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a new approach to analyze the coupling of linear Boussinesq and Saint-Venant shallow water wave equations in the case where the interface remains at a constant position in space. We propose a one-way coupling model as a reference, which allows us to obtain an analytical solution, prove the well-posedness of the original coupled model and compute what we call the coupling error-a quantity that depends solely on the choice of transmission conditions at the interface. We prove that this coupling error is asymptotically small for a certain class of data and discuss its role as a proxy for the full error with respect to the 3D water wave problem. Additionally, we highlight that this error can be easily computed in other scenarios. We show that the coupling error consists of reflected waves and argue that this explains some previously unexplained spurious oscillations reported in the literature. Finally, we prove the well-posedness of the half-line linear Boussinesq problem.</description>

      <title>On a non-local phase-field model for tumour growth with single-well Lennard-Jones potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we develop a comprehensive and rigorous analytical framework for a non-local phase-field model that describes tumour growth dynamics. The model is derived by coupling a non-local Cahn-Hilliard equation with a parabolic reaction-diffusion equation, which accounts for both phase segregation and nutrient diffusion. Previous studies have only considered symmetric potentials for similar models. However, in the biological context of cell-to-cell adhesion, single-well potentials, like the so-called Lennard-Jones potential, seem physically more appropriate. The Cahn-Hilliard equation with this kind of potential has already been analysed. Here, we take a step forward and consider a more refined model. First, we analyse the model with a viscous relaxation term in the chemical potential and subject to suitable initial and boundary conditions. We prove the existence of solutions, a separation property for the phase variable, and a continuous dependence estimate with respect to the initial data. Finally, via an asymptotic analysis, we recover the existence of a weak solution to the initial and boundary value problem without viscosity, provided that the chemotactic sensitivity is small enough.</description>

      <title>Sediment Concentration Estimation via Multiscale Inverse Problem and Stochastic Homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we contribute to the broader understanding of inverse problems by introducing a versatile multiscale modeling framework tailored to the challenges of sediment concentration estimation. Specifically, we propose a novel approach for sediment concentration measurement in water flow, modeled as a multiscale inverse medium problem. To address the multiscale nature of the sediment distribution, we treat it as an inhomogeneous random field and use the homogenization theory in deriving the effective medium model. The inverse problem is formulated as the reconstruction of the effective medium model, specifically, the sediment concentration, from partial boundary measurements. Additionally, we develop numerical algorithms to improve the efficiency and accuracy of solving this inverse problem. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and methods in producing accurate sediment concentration estimates, offering new insights into sediment concentration measurement in complex environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with nonzero conditions at infinity in $\R^2$. We investigate the existence of traveling waves that are periodic in the direction transverse to the direction of propagation and minimize the energy when the momentum is kept fixed. We show that for any given value of the momentum, there is a critical value of the period such that traveling waves with period smaller than the critical value are one-dimensional, and those with larger periods depend on two variables.</description>

      <title>Global existence of small data weak solutions to the semilinear wave equations with time-dependent scale-invariant damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the global existence of small data weak solutions to the $n-$dimensional semilinear wave equation $\partial_t^2u-\Delta u+\frac{\mu}{t}\partial_tu=|u|^p$ with time-dependent scale-invariant damping, where $n\geq 2$, $t\geq 1$, $\mu\in(0,1)\cup(1,2]$ and $p&gt;1$. This equation can be changed into the semilinear generalized Tricomi equation $\partial_t^2u-t^m\Delta u=t^{\alpha(m)}|u|^p$, where $m=m(\mu)&gt;0$ and $\alpha(m)\in\Bbb R$ are two suitable constants. At first, for the more general semilinear Tricomi equation $\partial_t^2v-t^m\Delta v=t^{\alpha}|v|^p$ with any fixed constant $m&gt;0$ and arbitrary parameter $\alpha\in\Bbb R$, we shall show that in the case of $\alpha\leq -2$, $n\geq 3$ and $p&gt;1$, the small data weak solution $v$ exists globally; in the case of $\alpha&gt;-2$, through determining the conformal exponent $p_{conf}(n,m,\alpha)&gt;1$, the global small data weak solution $v$ exists when some extra restrictions of $p\geq p_{conf}(n,m,\alpha)$ are given. Returning to the original equation $\partial_t^2u-\Delta u+\frac{\mu}{t}\partial_tu=|u|^p$, the corresponding global existence results on the small data solution $u$ can be obtained.</description>

      <title>Existence and multiplicity of normalized solutions for $(2,q)$-Laplacian equations with generic double-behaviour nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study {existence and multiplicity} of normalized solutions for the following $(2, q)$-Laplacian equation
  \begin{equation*}\label{Eq-Equation1}
  \left\{\begin{array}{l}
  -\Delta u-\Delta_q u+\lambda u=f(u) \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^N ,
  \int_{\mathbb{R}^N}u^2 d x=c^2,
  \end{array}\right.
  \end{equation*}
  where $1&lt;q&lt;N$, $N\geq3$, $\Delta_q=\operatorname{div}\left(|\nabla u|^{q-2} \nabla u\right)$ denotes the $q$-Laplacian operator, $\lambda$ is a Lagrange multiplier and $c&gt;0$ is a constant. The nonlinearity $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is continuous, with mass-subcritical growth at the origin, mass-supercritical growth at infinity, and is more general than the sum of two powers. Under different assumptions, we prove the existence of a locally least-energy solution and the existence of a second solution with higher energy.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction along a geodesic from sphere data in Finsler geometry and anisotropic elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.10383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dix formulated the inverse problem of recovering an elastic body from the measurements of wave fronts of point sources. We geometrize this problem in the context of seismology, leading to the geometrical inverse problem of recovering a Finsler manifold from certain sphere data in a given open subset of the manifold. We solve this problem locally along any geodesic through the measurement set.</description>

      <title>Positive-density ground states of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03495v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii equation at positive density, that is, for a bounded solution not tending to 0 at infinity. We focus on infinite ground states, which are by definition minimizers of the energy under local perturbations. When the Fourier transform of the interaction potential takes negative values we prove the existence of a phase transition at high density, where the constant solution ceases to be a ground state. The analysis requires mixing techniques from elliptic PDE theory and statistical mechanics, in order to deal with a large class of interaction potentials.</description>

      <title>Convergence in total variation for the kinetic Langevin algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove non asymptotic total variation estimates for the kinetic Langevin algorithm in high dimension when the target measure satisfies a Poincar\'e inequality and has gradient Lipschitz potential. The main point is that the estimate improves significantly upon the corresponding bound for the non kinetic version of the algorithm, due to Dalalyan. In particular the dimension dependence drops from $O(n)$ to $O(\sqrt n)$.</description>

      <title>Critical quasilinear equations on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate critical quasilinear elliptic partial differential equations on a complete Riemannian manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature. By exploiting a new and sharp nonlinear Kato inequality and establishing some Cheng-Yau type gradient estimates for positive solutions, we classify positive solutions to the critical $p$-Laplace equation and show rigidity concerning the ambient manifold. Our results extend and improve some previous conclusions in the literature. Similar results are obtained for solutions to the quasilinear Liouville equation involving the $n$-Laplace operator, where $n$ corresponds to the dimension of the ambient manifold.</description>
