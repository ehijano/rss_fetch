      <title>Universally Baire sets in $2^{\kappa}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the basic theory of universally Baire sets of $2^\omega$ to a theory of universally Baire subsets of $2^\kappa$. We show that the fundamental characterizations of the property of being universally Baire have natural generalizations that can be formulated also for subsets of $2^\kappa$, in particular we provide four equivalent uniform definitions in the parameter $\kappa$ (for $\kappa$ an infinite cardinal) characterizing for each such $\kappa$ the class of universally Baire subsets of $2^\kappa$. For $\kappa=\omega$, these definitions bring us back to the original notion of universally Baire sets of reals given by Feng, Magidor and Woodin [2].</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this text is to present, in a technically accessible way, Tarski's definition of truth, the indefinability theorem, and to discuss two aspects of Tarski's work on truth, namely, whether or not the definition captures the notion of truth as correspondence, and Kripke's objection to the hierarchy of languages.</description>

      <title>Constant power maps on Hardy fields and transseries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{T}$ be the differential field of logarithmic-exponential transseries. We consider the expansion of $\mathbb{T}$ by the binary map that sends a real number $r$ and a positive transseries $f$ to the transseries $f^r$. Building on recent work of Aschenbrenner, van den Dries, and van der Hoeven, we show that this expansion is model complete, and we give an axiomatization of the theory of this expansion that is effective relative to the theory of the real exponential field. We show that maximal Hardy fields, equipped with the same map $(f,r)\mapsto f^r$, enjoy the same theory as $\mathbb{T}$, and we use this to establish a transfer theorem between Hardy fields and transseries.</description>

      <title>The GCH Failing at a Measurable Cardinal Implies Mitchell's K Exists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that the consistency strength of the GCH failing at a measurable cardinal is the existence of a cardinal $\kappa$ with $o(\kappa)=\kappa^{++}$. As the literature does not contain more than a proof sketch of the lower bound of this equiconsistency, we give an expository proof which fills in the details in order to fill this gap in the literature.</description>

      <title>Motivic Mellin transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work brings Mellin transforms into the realm of motivic integration. The new, larger class of motivic functions is stable under motivic Mellin and Fourier transforms, with general Fubini results and change of variables formulas. It specializes to $p$-adic integrals and $p$-adic Mellin transforms uniformly in $p$, with transfer principles between zero and positive characteristic local fields. In particular, it generalizes previous set-ups of motivic integration with Fubini from among others [16, 17, 18, 29, 9] and simplifies some aspects on the way by using the ideas of [10].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the theory of illfounded and cyclic proofs for the propositional {modal $\mu$-calculus}. A fine analysis of {provability} for classical and intuitionistic modal logic provides a novel bridge between finitary, cyclic and illfounded conceptions of proof and re-enforces the importance of two normal form theorems for the logic: guardedness and disjunctiveness.</description>

      <title>Decomposition horizons and a characterization of stable hereditary classes of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notions of bounded-size and quasibounded-size decompositions with bounded treedepth base classes are central to the structural theory of graph sparsity introduced by two of the authors years ago, and provide a characterization of both classes with bounded expansions and nowhere dense classes. Strong connections of this theory with model theory led to considering first-order transductions, which are logically defined graph transformations, and to initiate a comparative study of combinatorial and model theoretical properties of graph classes, with an emphasis on the model theoretical notions of dependence (or NIP) and stability. In this paper, we first prove that every hereditary class with quasibounded-size decompositions with dependent (resp.\ stable) base classes is itself dependent (resp.\ stable). This result is obtained in a more general study of ``decomposition horizons'', which are class properties compatible with quasibounded-size decompositions. We deduce that hereditary classes with quasibounded-size decompositions with bounded shrubdepth base classes are stable. In the second part of the paper, we prove the converse. Thus, we characterize stable hereditary classes of graphs as those hereditary classes that admit quasibounded-size decompositions with bounded shrubdepth base classes. This result is obtained by proving that every hereditary stable class of graphs admits almost nowhere dense quasi-bush representations, thus answering positively a conjecture of Dreier et al. These results have several consequences. For example, we show that every graph $G$ in a stable, hereditary class of graphs $\mathscr C$ has a clique or a stable set of size $\Omega_{\mathscr C,\epsilon}(|G|^{1/2-\epsilon})$, for every $\epsilon&gt;0$, which is tight in the sense that it cannot be improved to $\Omega_{\mathscr C}(|G|^{1/2})$.</description>

      <title>A correspondence between the time and space complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the correspondence between the time and space recognition complexity of languages. For this purpose, we will code the long-continued computations of deterministic two-tape Turing machines by the relatively short-length quantified Boolean formulae. The modified Meyer and Stockmeyer method will appreciably be used for this simulation. It will be proved using this modeling that the complexity classes Deterministic Exponential Time and Deterministic Polynomial Space coincide. It will also be proven that any language recognized in polynomial time can be recognized in almost logarithmic space. Furthermore, this allows us slightly to improve the early founded lower complexity bound of decidable theories that are nontrivial relative to some equivalence relation (this relation may be equality) -- each of these theories is consistent with the formula, which asserts that there are two non-equivalent elements.
  Keywords: computational complexity, the coding of computations through formulae, exponential time, polynomial space, the lower complexity bound of the language recognition</description>
