      <title>Comparative Analysis of Personalized Voice Activity Detection Systems: Assessing Real-World Effectiveness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voice activity detection (VAD) is a critical component in various applications such as speech recognition, speech enhancement, and hands-free communication systems. With the increasing demand for personalized and context-aware technologies, the need for effective personalized VAD systems has become paramount. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of Personalized Voice Activity Detection (PVAD) systems to assess their real-world effectiveness. We introduce a comprehensive approach to assess PVAD systems, incorporating various performance metrics such as frame-level and utterance-level error rates, detection latency and accuracy, alongside user-level analysis. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, we provide a thorough understanding of the strengths and limitations of various PVAD variants. This paper advances the understanding of PVAD technology by offering insights into its efficacy and viability in practical applications using a comprehensive set of metrics.</description>

      <title>GenDistiller: Distilling Pre-trained Language Models based on an Autoregressive Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained speech language models such as HuBERT and WavLM leverage unlabeled speech data for self-supervised learning and offer powerful representations for numerous downstream tasks. Despite the success of these models, their high requirements for memory and computing resource hinder their application on resource restricted devices. Therefore, this paper introduces GenDistiller, a novel knowledge distillation framework which generates the hidden representations of the pre-trained teacher model directly by a much smaller student network. The proposed method takes the previous hidden layer as history and implements a layer-by-layer prediction of the teacher model autoregressively. Experiments on SUPERB reveal the advantage of GenDistiller over the baseline distilling method without an autoregressive framework, with 33% fewer parameters, similar time consumption and better performance on most of the SUPERB tasks. Ultimately, the proposed GenDistiller reduces the size of WavLM by 82%.</description>

      <title>The Second DISPLACE Challenge : DIarization of SPeaker and LAnguage in Conversational Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DIarization of SPeaker and LAnguage in Conversational Environments (DISPLACE) 2024 challenge is the second in the series of DISPLACE challenges, which involves tasks of speaker diarization (SD) and language diarization (LD) on a challenging multilingual conversational speech dataset. In the DISPLACE 2024 challenge, we also introduced the task of automatic speech recognition (ASR) on this dataset. The dataset containing 158 hours of speech, consisting of both supervised and unsupervised mono-channel far-field recordings, was released for LD and SD tracks. Further, 12 hours of close-field mono-channel recordings were provided for the ASR track conducted on 5 Indian languages. The details of the dataset, baseline systems and the leader board results are highlighted in this paper. We have also compared our baseline models and the team's performances on evaluation data of DISPLACE-2023 to emphasize the advancements made in this second version of the challenge.</description>

      <title>Multi-Channel Multi-Speaker ASR Using Target Speaker's Solo Segment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of multi-channel, multi-speaker Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), the task of discerning and accurately transcribing a target speaker's speech within background noise remains a formidable challenge. Traditional approaches often rely on microphone array configurations and the information of the target speaker's location or voiceprint. This study introduces the Solo Spatial Feature (Solo-SF), an innovative method that utilizes a target speaker's isolated speech segment to enhance ASR performance, thereby circumventing the need for conventional inputs like microphone array layouts. We explore effective strategies for selecting optimal solo segments, a crucial aspect for Solo-SF's success. Through evaluations conducted on the AliMeeting dataset and AISHELL-1 simulations, Solo-SF demonstrates superior performance over existing techniques, significantly lowering Character Error Rates (CER) in various test conditions. Our findings highlight Solo-SF's potential as an effective solution for addressing the complexities of multi-channel, multi-speaker ASR tasks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Personalization of Amplification in Hearing Aids via Multi-band Bayesian Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalization of the amplification function of hearing aids has been shown to be of benefit to hearing aid users in previous studies. Several machine learning-based personalization approaches have been introduced in the literature. This paper presents a machine learning personalization approach with the advantage of being efficient in its training based on paired comparisons which makes it practical and field deployable. The training efficiency of this approach is the result of treating frequency bands independent of one another and by simultaneously carrying out Bayesian machine learning in each band across all of the frequency bands. Simulation results indicate that this approach leads to an estimated hearing preference function close to the true hearing preference function in fewer number of paired comparisons relative to the previous machine learning approaches. In addition, a clinical experiment conducted on eight subjects with hearing impairment indicate that this training efficient personalization approach provides personalized gain settings which are on average six times more preferred over the standard prescriptive gain settings.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Byte-level Representation for End-to-end ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to optimizing a byte-level representation for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR). Byte-level representation is often used by large scale multilingual ASR systems when the character set of the supported languages is large. The compactness and universality of byte-level representation allow the ASR models to use smaller output vocabularies and therefore, provide more flexibility. UTF-8 is a commonly used byte-level representation for multilingual ASR, but it is not designed to optimize machine learning tasks directly. By using auto-encoder and vector quantization, we show that we can optimize a byte-level representation for ASR and achieve better accuracy. Our proposed framework can incorporate information from different modalities, and provides an error correction mechanism. In an English/Mandarin dictation task, we show that a bilingual ASR model built with this approach can outperform UTF-8 representation by 5% relative in error rate.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Framework for the Assessment of the Schizophrenia Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel multimodal framework to distinguish between different symptom classes of subjects in the schizophrenia spectrum and healthy controls using audio, video, and text modalities. We implemented Convolution Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory based unimodal models and experimented on various multimodal fusion approaches to come up with the proposed framework. We utilized a minimal Gated multimodal unit (mGMU) to obtain a bi-modal intermediate fusion of the features extracted from the input modalities before finally fusing the outputs of the bimodal fusions to perform subject-wise classifications. The use of mGMU units in the multimodal framework improved the performance in both weighted f1-score and weighted AUC-ROC scores.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Deep Speech Separation in Clustered Ad Hoc Distributed Microphone Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ad-hoc distributed microphone environments, where microphone locations and numbers are unpredictable, present a challenge to traditional deep learning models, which typically require fixed architectures. To tailor deep learning models to accommodate arbitrary array configurations, the Transform-Average-Concatenate (TAC) layer was previously introduced. In this work, we integrate TAC layers with dual-path transformers for speech separation from two simultaneous talkers in realistic settings. However, the distributed nature makes it hard to fuse information across microphones efficiently. Therefore, we explore the efficacy of blindly clustering microphones around sources of interest prior to enhancement. Experimental results show that this deep cluster-informed approach significantly improves the system's capacity to cope with the inherent variability observed in ad-hoc distributed microphone environments.</description>

      <title>Low algorithmic delay implementation of convolutional beamformer for online joint source separation and dereverberation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blind-audio-source-separation (BASS) techniques, particularly those with low latency, play an important role in a wide range of real-time systems, e.g., hearing aids, in-car hand-free voice communication, real-time human-machine interaction, etc. Most existing BASS algorithms are deduced to run on batch mode, and therefore large latency is unavoidable. Recently, some online algorithms were developed, which achieve separation on a frame-by-frame basis in the short-time-Fourier-transform (STFT) domain and the latency is significantly reduced as compared to those batch methods. However, the latency with these algorithms may still be too long for many real-time systems to bear. To further reduce latency while achieving good separation performance, we propose in this work to integrate a weighted prediction error (WPE) module into a non-causal sample-truncating-based independent vector analysis (NST-IVA). The resulting algorithm can maintain the algorithmic delay as NST-IVA if the delay with WPE is appropriately controlled while achieving significantly better performance, which is validated by simulations.</description>

      <title>Perceiver-Prompt: Flexible Speaker Adaptation in Whisper for Chinese Disordered Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered speech recognition profound implications for improving the quality of life for individuals afflicted with, for example, dysarthria. Dysarthric speech recognition encounters challenges including limited data, substantial dissimilarities between dysarthric and non-dysarthric speakers, and significant speaker variations stemming from the disorder. This paper introduces Perceiver-Prompt, a method for speaker adaptation that utilizes P-Tuning on the Whisper large-scale model. We first fine-tune Whisper using LoRA and then integrate a trainable Perceiver to generate fixed-length speaker prompts from variable-length inputs, to improve model recognition of Chinese dysarthric speech. Experimental results from our Chinese dysarthric speech dataset demonstrate consistent improvements in recognition performance with Perceiver-Prompt. Relative reduction up to 13.04% in CER is obtained over the fine-tuned Whisper.</description>

      <title>Period Singer: Integrating Periodic and Aperiodic Variational Autoencoders for Natural-Sounding End-to-End Singing Voice Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Period Singer, a novel end-to-end singing voice synthesis (SVS) model that utilizes variational inference for periodic and aperiodic components, aimed at producing natural-sounding waveforms. Recent end-to-end SVS models have demonstrated the capability of synthesizing high-fidelity singing voices. However, owing to deterministic pitch conditioning, they do not fully address the one-to-many problem. To address this problem, we present the Period Singer architecture, which integrates variational autoencoders for the periodic and aperiodic components. Additionally, our methodology eliminates the dependency on an external aligner by estimating the phoneme alignment through a monotonic alignment search within note boundaries. Our empirical evaluations show that Period Singer outperforms existing end-to-end SVS models on Mandarin and Korean datasets. The efficacy of the proposed method was further corroborated by ablation studies.</description>

      <title>Understanding Pedestrian Movement Using Urban Sensing Technologies: The Promise of Audio-based Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While various sensors have been deployed to monitor vehicular flows, sensing pedestrian movement is still nascent. Yet walking is a significant mode of travel in many cities, especially those in Europe, Africa, and Asia. Understanding pedestrian volumes and flows is essential for designing safer and more attractive pedestrian infrastructure and for controlling periodic overcrowding. This study discusses a new approach to scale up urban sensing of people with the help of novel audio-based technology. It assesses the benefits and limitations of microphone-based sensors as compared to other forms of pedestrian sensing. A large-scale dataset called ASPED is presented, which includes high-quality audio recordings along with video recordings used for labeling the pedestrian count data. The baseline analyses highlight the promise of using audio sensors for pedestrian tracking, although algorithmic and technological improvements to make the sensors practically usable continue. This study also demonstrates how the data can be leveraged to predict pedestrian trajectories. Finally, it discusses the use cases and scenarios where audio-based pedestrian sensing can support better urban and transportation planning.</description>

      <title>ROAR: Reinforcing Original to Augmented Data Ratio Dynamics for Wav2Vec2.0 Based ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While automatic speech recognition (ASR) greatly benefits from data augmentation, the augmentation recipes themselves tend to be heuristic. In this paper, we address one of the heuristic approach associated with balancing the right amount of augmented data in ASR training by introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) based dynamic adjustment of original-to-augmented data ratio (OAR). Unlike the fixed OAR approach in conventional data augmentation, our proposed method employs a deep Q-network (DQN) as the RL mechanism to learn the optimal dynamics of OAR throughout the wav2vec2.0 based ASR training. We conduct experiments using the LibriSpeech dataset with varying amounts of training data, specifically, the 10Min, 1H, 10H, and 100H splits to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method under different data conditions. Our proposed method, on average, achieves a relative improvement of 4.96% over the open-source wav2vec2.0 base model on standard LibriSpeech test sets.</description>

      <title>Detecting the terminality of speech-turn boundary for spoken interactions in French TV and Radio content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition Relevance Places are defined as the end of an utterance where the interlocutor may take the floor without interrupting the current speaker --i.e., a place where the turn is terminal. Analyzing turn terminality is useful to study the dynamic of turn-taking in spontaneous conversations. This paper presents an automatic classification of spoken utterances as Terminal or Non-Terminal in multi-speaker settings. We compared audio, text, and fusions of both approaches on a French corpus of TV and Radio extracts annotated with turn-terminality information at each speaker change. Our models are based on pre-trained self-supervised representations. We report results for different fusion strategies and varying context sizes. This study also questions the problem of performance variability by analyzing the differences in results for multiple training runs with random initialization. The measured accuracy would allow the use of these models for large-scale analysis of turn-taking.</description>

      <title>Whisper-Flamingo: Integrating Visual Features into Whisper for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition and Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) uses lip-based video to improve performance in noise. Since videos are harder to obtain than audio, the video training data of AVSR models is usually limited to a few thousand hours. In contrast, speech models such as Whisper are trained with hundreds of thousands of hours of data, and thus learn a better speech-to-text decoder. The huge training data difference motivates us to adapt Whisper to handle video inputs. Inspired by Flamingo which injects visual features into language models, we propose Whisper-Flamingo which integrates visual features into the Whisper speech recognition and translation model with gated cross attention. Our audio-visual Whisper-Flamingo outperforms audio-only Whisper on English speech recognition and En-X translation for 6 languages in noisy conditions. Moreover, Whisper-Flamingo is a versatile model and conducts all of these tasks using one set of parameters, while prior methods are trained separately on each language.</description>

      <title>Inclusive ASR for Disfluent Speech: Cascaded Large-Scale Self-Supervised Learning with Targeted Fine-Tuning and Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems often falter while processing stuttering-related disfluencies -- such as involuntary blocks and word repetitions -- yielding inaccurate transcripts. A critical barrier to progress is the scarcity of large, annotated disfluent speech datasets. Therefore, we present an inclusive ASR design approach, leveraging large-scale self-supervised learning on standard speech followed by targeted fine-tuning and data augmentation on a smaller, curated dataset of disfluent speech. Our data augmentation technique enriches training datasets with various disfluencies, enhancing ASR processing of these speech patterns. Results show that fine-tuning wav2vec 2.0 with even a relatively small, labeled dataset, alongside data augmentation, can significantly reduce word error rates for disfluent speech. Our approach not only advances ASR inclusivity for people who stutter, but also paves the way for ASRs that can accommodate wider speech variations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop two complementary advances for training no-reference (NR) speech quality estimators with independent datasets. Multi-dataset finetuning (MDF) pretrains an NR estimator on a single dataset and then finetunes it on multiple datasets at once, including the dataset used for pretraining. AlignNet uses an AudioNet to generate intermediate score estimates before using the Aligner to map intermediate estimates to the appropriate score range. AlignNet is agnostic to the choice of AudioNet so any successful NR speech quality estimator can benefit from its Aligner. The methods can be used in tandem, and we use two studies to show that they improve on current solutions: one study uses nine smaller datasets and the other uses four larger datasets. AlignNet with MDF improves on other solutions because it efficiently and effectively removes misalignments that impair the learning process, and thus enables successful training with larger amounts of more diverse data.</description>

      <title>Speech ReaLLM -- Real-time Streaming Speech Recognition with Multimodal LLMs by Teaching the Flow of Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Speech ReaLLM, a new ASR architecture that marries "decoder-only" ASR with the RNN-T to make multimodal LLM architectures capable of real-time streaming. This is the first "decoder-only" ASR architecture designed to handle continuous audio without explicit end-pointing. Speech ReaLLM is a special case of the more general ReaLLM ("real-time LLM") approach, also introduced here for the first time. The idea is inspired by RNN-T: Instead of generating a response only at the end of a user prompt, generate after every input token received in real time (it is often empty). On Librispeech "test", an 80M Speech ReaLLM achieves WERs of 3.0% and 7.4% in real time (without an external LM or auxiliary loss). This is only slightly above a 3x larger Attention-Encoder-Decoder baseline. We also show that this way, an LLM architecture can learn to represent and reproduce the flow of time; and that a pre-trained 7B LLM can be fine-tuned to do reasonably well on this task.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Large Language Models with Fusion Low Rank Adaptation for Device Directed Speech Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for human-like conversations, they are primarily pre-trained on text data. Incorporating audio or video improves performance, but collecting large-scale multimodal data and pre-training multimodal LLMs is challenging. To this end, we propose a Fusion Low Rank Adaptation (FLoRA) technique that efficiently adapts a pre-trained unimodal LLM to consume new, previously unseen modalities via low rank adaptation. For device-directed speech detection, using FLoRA, the multimodal LLM achieves 22% relative reduction in equal error rate (EER) over the text-only approach and attains performance parity with its full fine-tuning (FFT) counterpart while needing to tune only a fraction of its parameters. Furthermore, with the newly introduced adapter dropout, FLoRA is robust to missing data, improving over FFT by 20% lower EER and 56% lower false accept rate. The proposed approach scales well for model sizes from 16M to 3B parameters.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Retrieval For Large Language Model Based Speech Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval is a widely adopted approach for improving language models leveraging external information. As the field moves towards multi-modal large language models, it is important to extend the pure text based methods to incorporate other modalities in retrieval as well for applications across the wide spectrum of machine learning tasks and data types. In this work, we propose multi-modal retrieval with two approaches: kNN-LM and cross-attention techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our retrieval approaches empirically by applying them to automatic speech recognition tasks with access to external information. Under this setting, we show that speech-based multi-modal retrieval outperforms text based retrieval, and yields up to 50 % improvement in word error rate over the multi-modal language model baseline. Furthermore, we achieve state-of-the-art recognition results on the Spoken-Squad question answering dataset.</description>

      <title>Frequency-mix Knowledge Distillation for Fake Speech Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the telephony scenarios, the fake speech detection (FSD) task to combat speech spoofing attacks is challenging. Data augmentation (DA) methods are considered effective means to address the FSD task in telephony scenarios, typically divided into time domain and frequency domain stages. While each has its advantages, both can result in information loss. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel DA method, Frequency-mix (Freqmix), and introduce the Freqmix knowledge distillation (FKD) to enhance model information extraction and generalization abilities. Specifically, we use Freqmix-enhanced data as input for the teacher model, while the student model's input undergoes time-domain DA method. We use a multi-level feature distillation approach to restore information and improve the model's generalization capabilities. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on ASVspoof 2021 LA dataset, showing a 31\% improvement over baseline and performs competitively on ASVspoof 2021 DF dataset.</description>

      <title>SHMamba: Structured Hyperbolic State Space Model for Audio-Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) task holds significant potential for applications. Compared to traditional unimodal approaches, the multi-modal input of AVQA makes feature extraction and fusion processes more challenging. Euclidean space is difficult to effectively represent multi-dimensional relationships of data. Especially when extracting and processing data with a tree structure or hierarchical structure, Euclidean space is not suitable as an embedding space. Additionally, the self-attention mechanism in Transformers is effective in capturing the dynamic relationships between elements in a sequence. However, the self-attention mechanism's limitations in window modeling and quadratic computational complexity reduce its effectiveness in modeling long sequences. To address these limitations, we propose SHMamba: Structured Hyperbolic State Space Model to integrate the advantages of hyperbolic geometry and state space models. Specifically, SHMamba leverages the intrinsic properties of hyperbolic space to represent hierarchical structures and complex relationships in audio-visual data. Meanwhile, the state space model captures dynamic changes over time by globally modeling the entire sequence. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive curvature hyperbolic alignment module and a cross fusion block to enhance the understanding of hierarchical structures and the dynamic exchange of cross-modal information, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHMamba outperforms previous methods with fewer parameters and computational costs. Our learnable parameters are reduced by 78.12\%, while the average performance improves by 2.53\%. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among all current major methods and is more suitable for practical application scenarios.</description>

      <title>Vec-Tok-VC+: Residual-enhanced Robust Zero-shot Voice Conversion with Progressive Constraints in a Dual-mode Training Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot voice conversion (VC) aims to transform source speech into arbitrary unseen target voice while keeping the linguistic content unchanged. Recent VC methods have made significant progress, but semantic losses in the decoupling process as well as training-inference mismatch still hinder conversion performance. In this paper, we propose Vec-Tok-VC+, a novel prompt-based zero-shot VC model improved from Vec-Tok Codec, achieving voice conversion given only a 3s target speaker prompt. We design a residual-enhanced K-Means decoupler to enhance the semantic content extraction with a two-layer clustering process. Besides, we employ teacher-guided refinement to simulate the conversion process to eliminate the training-inference mismatch, forming a dual-mode training strategy. Furthermore, we design a multi-codebook progressive loss function to constrain the layer-wise output of the model from coarse to fine to improve speaker similarity and content accuracy. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that Vec-Tok-VC+ outperforms the strong baselines in naturalness, intelligibility, and speaker similarity.</description>

      <title>MMM: Multi-Layer Multi-Residual Multi-Stream Discrete Speech Representation from Self-supervised Learning Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech discrete representation has proven effective in various downstream applications due to its superior compression rate of the waveform, fast convergence during training, and compatibility with other modalities. Discrete units extracted from self-supervised learning (SSL) models have emerged as a prominent approach for obtaining speech discrete representation. However, while discrete units have shown effectiveness compared to spectral features, they still lag behind continuous SSL representations. In this work, we propose MMM, a multi-layer multi-residual multi-stream discrete units extraction method from SSL. Specifically, we introduce iterative residual vector quantization with K-means for different layers in an SSL model to extract multi-stream speech discrete representation. Through extensive experiments in speech recognition, speech resynthesis, and text-to-speech, we demonstrate the proposed MMM can surpass or on-par with neural codec's performance under various conditions.</description>

      <title>Personalized Speech Enhancement Without a Separate Speaker Embedding Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalized speech enhancement (PSE) models can improve the audio quality of teleconferencing systems by adapting to the characteristics of a speaker's voice. However, most existing methods require a separate speaker embedding model to extract a vector representation of the speaker from enrollment audio, which adds complexity to the training and deployment process. We propose to use the internal representation of the PSE model itself as the speaker embedding, thereby avoiding the need for a separate model. We show that our approach performs equally well or better than the standard method of using a pre-trained speaker embedding model on noise suppression and echo cancellation tasks. Moreover, our approach surpasses the ICASSP 2023 Deep Noise Suppression Challenge winner by 0.15 in Mean Opinion Score.</description>

      <title>An efficient text augmentation approach for contextualized Mandarin speech recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although contextualized automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are commonly used to improve the recognition of uncommon words, their effectiveness is hindered by the inherent limitations of speech-text data availability. To address this challenge, our study proposes to leverage extensive text-only datasets and contextualize pre-trained ASR models using a straightforward text-augmentation (TA) technique, all while keeping computational costs minimal. In particular, to contextualize a pre-trained CIF-based ASR, we construct a codebook using limited speech-text data. By utilizing a simple codebook lookup process, we convert available text-only data into latent text embeddings. These embeddings then enhance the inputs for the contextualized ASR. Our experiments on diverse Mandarin test sets demonstrate that our TA approach significantly boosts recognition performance. The top-performing system shows relative CER improvements of up to 30% on rare words and 15% across all words in general.</description>

      <title>Impact of Speech Mode in Automatic Pathological Speech Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic pathological speech detection approaches yield promising results in identifying various pathologies. These approaches are typically designed and evaluated for phonetically-controlled speech scenarios, where speakers are prompted to articulate identical phonetic content. While gathering controlled speech recordings can be laborious, spontaneous speech can be conveniently acquired as potential patients navigate their daily routines. Further, spontaneous speech can be valuable in detecting subtle and abstract cues of pathological speech. Nonetheless, the efficacy of automatic pathological speech detection for spontaneous speech remains unexplored. This paper analyzes the influence of speech mode on pathological speech detection approaches, examining two distinct categories of approaches, i.e., classical machine learning and deep learning. Results indicate that classical approaches may struggle to capture pathology-discriminant cues in spontaneous speech. In contrast, deep learning approaches demonstrate superior performance, managing to extract additional cues that were previously inaccessible in non-spontaneous speech</description>

      <title>Towards Effective and Efficient Non-autoregressive Decoding Using Block-based Attention Mask</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel non-autoregressive (NAR) block-based Attention Mask Decoder (AMD) that flexibly balances performance-efficiency trade-offs for Conformer ASR systems. AMD performs parallel NAR inference within contiguous blocks of output labels that are concealed using attention masks, while conducting left-to-right AR prediction and history context amalgamation between blocks. A beam search algorithm is designed to leverage a dynamic fusion of CTC, AR Decoder, and AMD probabilities. Experiments on the LibriSpeech-100hr corpus suggest the tripartite Decoder incorporating the AMD module produces a maximum decoding speed-up ratio of 1.73x over the baseline CTC+AR decoding, while incurring no statistically significant word error rate (WER) increase on the test sets. When operating with the same decoding real time factors, statistically significant WER reductions of up to 0.7% and 0.3% absolute (5.3% and 6.1% relative) were obtained over the CTC+AR baseline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a robust and large-scale multilingual speech recognition model, Whisper has demonstrated impressive results in many low-resource and out-of-distribution scenarios. However, its encoder-decoder structure hinders its application to streaming speech recognition. In this paper, we introduce Simul-Whisper, which uses the time alignment embedded in Whisper's cross-attention to guide auto-regressive decoding and achieve chunk-based streaming ASR without any fine-tuning of the pre-trained model. Furthermore, we observe the negative effect of the truncated words at the chunk boundaries on the decoding results and propose an integrate-and-fire-based truncation detection model to address this issue. Experiments on multiple languages and Whisper architectures show that Simul-Whisper achieves an average absolute word error rate degradation of only 1.46% at a chunk size of 1 second, which significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art baseline.</description>

      <title>UniAudio 1.5: Large Language Model-driven Audio Codec is A Few-shot Audio Task Learner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Large Language models (LLMs) have demonstrated supreme capabilities in text understanding and generation, but cannot be directly applied to cross-modal tasks without fine-tuning. This paper proposes a cross-modal in-context learning approach, empowering the frozen LLMs to achieve multiple audio tasks in a few-shot style without any parameter update. Specifically, we propose a novel and LLMs-driven audio codec model, LLM-Codec, to transfer the audio modality into the textual space, \textit{i.e.} representing audio tokens with words or sub-words in the vocabulary of LLMs, while keeping high audio reconstruction quality. The key idea is to reduce the modality heterogeneity between text and audio by compressing the audio modality into a well-trained LLMs token space. Thus, the audio representation can be viewed as a new \textit{foreign language}, and LLMs can learn the new \textit{foreign language} with several demonstrations. In experiments, we investigate the performance of the proposed approach across multiple audio understanding and generation tasks, \textit{e.g.} speech emotion classification, audio classification, text-to-speech generation, speech enhancement, etc. The experimental results demonstrate that the LLMs equipped with the proposed LLM-Codec, named as UniAudio 1.5, prompted by only a few examples, can achieve the expected functions in simple scenarios. It validates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed cross-modal in-context learning approach. To facilitate research on few-shot audio task learning and multi-modal LLMs, we have open-sourced the LLM-Codec model.</description>

      <title>On the Evaluation of Speech Foundation Models for Spoken Language Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Spoken Language Understanding Evaluation (SLUE) suite of benchmark tasks was recently introduced to address the need for open resources and benchmarking of complex spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks, including both classification and sequence generation tasks, on natural speech. The benchmark has demonstrated preliminary success in using pre-trained speech foundation models (SFM) for these SLU tasks. However, the community still lacks a fine-grained understanding of the comparative utility of different SFMs. Inspired by this, we ask: which SFMs offer the most benefits for these complex SLU tasks, and what is the most effective approach for incorporating these SFMs? To answer this, we perform an extensive evaluation of multiple supervised and self-supervised SFMs using several evaluation protocols: (i) frozen SFMs with a lightweight prediction head, (ii) frozen SFMs with a complex prediction head, and (iii) fine-tuned SFMs with a lightweight prediction head. Although the supervised SFMs are pre-trained on much more speech recognition data (with labels), they do not always outperform self-supervised SFMs; the latter tend to perform at least as well as, and sometimes better than, supervised SFMs, especially on the sequence generation tasks in SLUE. While there is no universally optimal way of incorporating SFMs, the complex prediction head gives the best performance for most tasks, although it increases the inference time. We also introduce an open-source toolkit and performance leaderboard, SLUE-PERB, for these tasks and modeling strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes joint speaker feature learning methods for zero-shot adaptation of audio-visual multichannel speech separation and recognition systems. xVector and ECAPA-TDNN speaker encoders are connected using purpose-built fusion blocks and tightly integrated with the complete system training. Experiments conducted on LRS3-TED data simulated multichannel overlapped speech suggest that joint speaker feature learning consistently improves speech separation and recognition performance over the baselines without joint speaker feature estimation. Further analyses reveal performance improvements are strongly correlated with increased inter-speaker discrimination measured using cosine similarity. The best-performing joint speaker feature learning adapted system outperformed the baseline fine-tuned WavLM model by statistically significant WER reductions of 21.6% and 25.3% absolute (67.5% and 83.5% relative) on Dev and Test sets after incorporating WavLM features and video modality.</description>

      <title>One-pass Multiple Conformer and Foundation Speech Systems Compression and Quantization Using An All-in-one Neural Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel one-pass multiple ASR systems joint compression and quantization approach using an all-in-one neural model. A single compression cycle allows multiple nested systems with varying Encoder depths, widths, and quantization precision settings to be simultaneously constructed without the need to train and store individual target systems separately. Experiments consistently demonstrate the multiple ASR systems compressed in a single all-in-one model produced a word error rate (WER) comparable to, or lower by up to 1.01\% absolute (6.98\% relative) than individually trained systems of equal complexity. A 3.4x overall system compression and training time speed-up was achieved. Maximum model size compression ratios of 12.8x and 3.93x were obtained over the baseline Switchboard-300hr Conformer and LibriSpeech-100hr fine-tuned wav2vec2.0 models, respectively, incurring no statistically significant WER increase.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Synthesizer for Efficient Multilingual Speech to Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce DiffuseST, a low-latency, direct speech-to-speech translation system capable of preserving the input speaker's voice zero-shot while translating from multiple source languages into English. We experiment with the synthesizer component of the architecture, comparing a Tacotron-based synthesizer to a novel diffusion-based synthesizer. We find the diffusion-based synthesizer to improve MOS and PESQ audio quality metrics by 23\% each and speaker similarity by 5\% while maintaining comparable BLEU scores. Despite having more than double the parameter count, the diffusion synthesizer has lower latency, allowing the entire model to run more than 5$\times$ faster than real-time.</description>

      <title>Variational Auto-Encoder Based Variability Encoding for Dysarthric Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.09422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dysarthric speech recognition is a challenging task due to acoustic variability and limited amount of available data. Diverse conditions of dysarthric speakers account for the acoustic variability, which make the variability difficult to be modeled precisely. This paper presents a variational auto-encoder based variability encoder (VAEVE) to explicitly encode such variability for dysarthric speech. The VAEVE makes use of both phoneme information and low-dimensional latent variable to reconstruct the input acoustic features, thereby the latent variable is forced to encode the phoneme-independent variability. Stochastic gradient variational Bayes algorithm is applied to model the distribution for generating variability encodings, which are further used as auxiliary features for DNN acoustic modeling. Experiment results conducted on the UASpeech corpus show that the VAEVE based variability encodings have complementary effect to the learning hidden unit contributions (LHUC) speaker adaptation. The systems using variability encodings consistently outperform the comparable baseline systems without using them, and" obtain absolute word error rate (WER) reduction by up to 2.2% on dysarthric speech with "Very lowintelligibility level, and up to 2% on the "Mixed" type of dysarthric speech with diverse or uncertain conditions.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Deep Neural Network Acoustic Modelling Approaches for Low Resource Accented Mandarin Speech Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.09432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mandarin Chinese language is known to be strongly influenced by a rich set of regional accents, while Mandarin speech with each accent is quite low resource. Hence, an important task in Mandarin speech recognition is to appropriately model the acoustic variabilities imposed by accents. In this paper, an investigation of implicit and explicit use of accent information on a range of deep neural network (DNN) based acoustic modelling techniques is conducted. Meanwhile, approaches of multi-accent modelling including multi-style training, multi-accent decision tree state tying, DNN tandem and multi-level adaptive network (MLAN) tandem hidden Markov model (HMM) modelling are combined and compared in this paper. On a low resource accented Mandarin speech recognition task consisting of four regional accents, an improved MLAN tandem HMM systems explicitly leveraging the accent information was proposed and significantly outperformed the baseline accent independent DNN tandem systems by 0.8%-1.5% absolute (6%-9% relative) in character error rate after sequence level discriminative training and adaptation.</description>

      <title>Frame-Wise Breath Detection with Self-Training: An Exploration of Enhancing Breath Naturalness in Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems that can synthesize natural breath is essential for human-like voice agents but requires extensive manual annotation of breath positions in training data. To this end, we propose a self-training method for training a breath detection model that can automatically detect breath positions in speech. Our method trains the model using a large speech corpus and involves: 1) annotation of limited breath sounds utilizing a rule-based approach, and 2) iterative augmentation of these annotations through pseudo-labeling based on the model's predictions. Our detection model employs Conformer blocks with down-/up-sampling layers, enabling accurate frame-wise breath detection. We investigate its effectiveness in multi-speaker TTS using text transcripts with detected breath marks. The results indicate that using our proposed model for breath detection and breath mark insertion synthesizes breath-contained speech more naturally than a baseline model.</description>

      <title>VoiceCraft: Zero-Shot Speech Editing and Text-to-Speech in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce VoiceCraft, a token infilling neural codec language model, that achieves state-of-the-art performance on both speech editing and zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) on audiobooks, internet videos, and podcasts. VoiceCraft employs a Transformer decoder architecture and introduces a token rearrangement procedure that combines causal masking and delayed stacking to enable generation within an existing sequence. On speech editing tasks, VoiceCraft produces edited speech that is nearly indistinguishable from unedited recordings in terms of naturalness, as evaluated by humans; for zero-shot TTS, our model outperforms prior SotA models including VALLE and the popular commercial model XTTS-v2. Crucially, the models are evaluated on challenging and realistic datasets, that consist of diverse accents, speaking styles, recording conditions, and background noise and music, and our model performs consistently well compared to other models and real recordings. In particular, for speech editing evaluation, we introduce a high quality, challenging, and realistic dataset named RealEdit. We encourage readers to listen to the demos at https://jasonppy.github.io/VoiceCraft_web.</description>

      <title>To what extent can ASV systems naturally defend against spoofing attacks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current automatic speaker verification (ASV) task involves making binary decisions on two types of trials: target and non-target. However, emerging advancements in speech generation technology pose significant threats to the reliability of ASV systems. This study investigates whether ASV effortlessly acquires robustness against spoofing attacks (i.e., zero-shot capability) by systematically exploring diverse ASV systems and spoofing attacks, ranging from traditional to cutting-edge techniques. Through extensive analyses conducted on eight distinct ASV systems and 29 spoofing attack systems, we demonstrate that the evolution of ASV inherently incorporates defense mechanisms against spoofing attacks. Nevertheless, our findings also underscore that the advancement of spoofing attacks far outpaces that of ASV systems, hence necessitating further research on spoofing-robust ASV methodologies.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Learning for Deep Neural Network Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.07460v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key task for speech recognition systems is to reduce the mismatch between training and evaluation data that is often attributable to speaker differences. Speaker adaptation techniques play a vital role to reduce the mismatch. Model-based speaker adaptation approaches often require sufficient amounts of target speaker data to ensure robustness. When the amount of speaker level data is limited, speaker adaptation is prone to overfitting and poor generalization. To address the issue, this paper proposes a full Bayesian learning based DNN speaker adaptation framework to model speaker-dependent (SD) parameter uncertainty given limited speaker specific adaptation data. This framework is investigated in three forms of model based DNN adaptation techniques: Bayesian learning of hidden unit contributions (BLHUC), Bayesian parameterized activation functions (BPAct), and Bayesian hidden unit bias vectors (BHUB). In the three methods, deterministic SD parameters are replaced by latent variable posterior distributions for each speaker, whose parameters are efficiently estimated using a variational inference based approach. Experiments conducted on 300-hour speed perturbed Switchboard corpus trained LF-MMI TDNN/CNN-TDNN systems suggest the proposed Bayesian adaptation approaches consistently outperform the deterministic adaptation on the NIST Hub5'00 and RT03 evaluation sets. When using only the first five utterances from each speaker as adaptation data, significant word error rate reductions up to 1.4% absolute (7.2% relative) were obtained on the CallHome subset. The efficacy of the proposed Bayesian adaptation techniques is further demonstrated in a comparison against the state-of-the-art performance obtained on the same task using the most recent systems reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>COSMIC: Data Efficient Instruction-tuning For Speech In-Context Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a cost-effective method to integrate speech into a large language model (LLM), resulting in a Contextual Speech Model with Instruction-following/in-context-learning Capabilities (COSMIC) multi-modal LLM. Using GPT-3.5, we generate Speech Comprehension Test Question-Answer (SQA) pairs from speech transcriptions for supervised instruction tuning. With under 30 million trainable parameters and only 450 hours of English speech data, COSMIC demonstrates emerging capabilities in instruction-following and in-context learning. Equipped with such capabilities, COSMIC achieves a maximum 33.18 BLEU score in 0-shot EN-to-X speech to text translation (S2TT) and a significant boost in the 1-shot setting. Additionally, there is an average 25.8\% relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction for 1-shot cross-domain adaptation. COSMIC exhibits a significant automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy gain in contextual biasing tasks due to its instruction-following capability.</description>

      <title>SimpleSpeech: Towards Simple and Efficient Text-to-Speech with Scalar Latent Transformer Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a simple and efficient Non-Autoregressive (NAR) text-to-speech (TTS) system based on diffusion, named SimpleSpeech. Its simpleness shows in three aspects: (1) It can be trained on the speech-only dataset, without any alignment information; (2) It directly takes plain text as input and generates speech through an NAR way; (3) It tries to model speech in a finite and compact latent space, which alleviates the modeling difficulty of diffusion. More specifically, we propose a novel speech codec model (SQ-Codec) with scalar quantization, SQ-Codec effectively maps the complex speech signal into a finite and compact latent space, named scalar latent space. Benefits from SQ-Codec, we apply a novel transformer diffusion model in the scalar latent space of SQ-Codec. We train SimpleSpeech on 4k hours of a speech-only dataset, it shows natural prosody and voice cloning ability. Compared with previous large-scale TTS models, it presents significant speech quality and generation speed improvement. Demos are released.</description>

      <title>Improving Zero-Shot Chinese-English Code-Switching ASR with kNN-CTC and Gated Monolingual Datastores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The kNN-CTC model has proven to be effective for monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, its direct application to multilingual scenarios like code-switching, presents challenges. Although there is potential for performance improvement, a kNN-CTC model utilizing a single bilingual datastore can inadvertently introduce undesirable noise from the alternative language. To address this, we propose a novel kNN-CTC-based code-switching ASR (CS-ASR) framework that employs dual monolingual datastores and a gated datastore selection mechanism to reduce noise interference. Our method selects the appropriate datastore for decoding each frame, ensuring the injection of language-specific information into the ASR process. We apply this framework to cutting-edge CTC-based models, developing an advanced CS-ASR system. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of our gated datastore mechanism in enhancing the performance of zero-shot Chinese-English CS-ASR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Respiratory sound classification (RSC) is challenging due to varied acoustic signatures, primarily influenced by patient demographics and recording environments. To address this issue, we introduce a text-audio multimodal model that utilizes metadata of respiratory sounds, which provides useful complementary information for RSC. Specifically, we fine-tune a pretrained text-audio multimodal model using free-text descriptions derived from the sound samples' metadata which includes the gender and age of patients, type of recording devices, and recording location on the patient's body. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ICBHI dataset, surpassing the previous best result by a notable margin of 1.17%. This result validates the effectiveness of leveraging metadata and respiratory sound samples in enhancing RSC performance. Additionally, we investigate the model performance in the case where metadata is partially unavailable, which may occur in real-world clinical setting.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Understand Spatial Audio?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores enabling large language models (LLMs) to understand spatial information from multichannel audio, a skill currently lacking in auditory LLMs. By leveraging LLMs' advanced cognitive and inferential abilities, the aim is to enhance understanding of 3D environments via audio. We study 3 spatial audio tasks: sound source localization (SSL), far-field speech recognition (FSR), and localisation-informed speech extraction (LSE), achieving notable progress in each task. For SSL, our approach achieves an MAE of $2.70^{\circ}$ on the Spatial LibriSpeech dataset, substantially surpassing the prior benchmark of about $6.60^{\circ}$. Moreover, our model can employ spatial cues to improve FSR accuracy and execute LSE by selectively attending to sounds originating from a specified direction via text prompts, even amidst overlapping speech. These findings highlight the potential of adapting LLMs to grasp physical audio concepts, paving the way for LLM-based agents in 3D environments.</description>

      <title>AV-GS: Learning Material and Geometry Aware Priors for Novel View Acoustic Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Novel view acoustic synthesis (NVAS) aims to render binaural audio at any target viewpoint, given a mono audio emitted by a sound source at a 3D scene. Existing methods have proposed NeRF-based implicit models to exploit visual cues as a condition for synthesizing binaural audio. However, in addition to low efficiency originating from heavy NeRF rendering, these methods all have a limited ability of characterizing the entire scene environment such as room geometry, material properties, and the spatial relation between the listener and sound source. To address these issues, we propose a novel Audio-Visual Gaussian Splatting (AV-GS) model. To obtain a material-aware and geometry-aware condition for audio synthesis, we learn an explicit point-based scene representation with an audio-guidance parameter on locally initialized Gaussian points, taking into account the space relation from the listener and sound source. To make the visual scene model audio adaptive, we propose a point densification and pruning strategy to optimally distribute the Gaussian points, with the per-point contribution in sound propagation (e.g., more points needed for texture-less wall surfaces as they affect sound path diversion). Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our AV-GS over existing alternatives on the real-world RWAS and simulation-based SoundSpaces datasets.</description>
