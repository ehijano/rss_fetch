      <title>Earthquake body wave extraction using sparsity-promoting polarization filtering in the time-frequency domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic waves generated by earthquakes consist of multiple phases that carry critical information about Earth's internal structure as they propagate through heterogeneous media. These phases provide constraints from different regions of the Earth, such as the crust, mantle, and even the cores. The choice of phase depends on the study target and scientific objective: surface waves are suited for imaging shallow structures, whereas body waves yield higher-resolution information at depth. A key challenge in body-wave studies is that the low-amplitude P and S arrivals are often masked by surface waves overlapping in both time and frequency. Although body waves typically contain higher-frequency content, their spectral overlap with surface waves limits the effectiveness of conventional filtering approaches. Addressing this issue requires advanced signal-processing techniques. One such method, Sparsity-Promoting Time-Frequency Filtering (SP-TFF, Mohammadigheymasi et al., 2022), exploits high-resolution polarization information in the time-frequency domain. SP-TFF integrates amplitude, directivity, and rectilinearity to enhance phase discrimination. Here, we further develop SP-TFF by designing a filter set tailored to isolate body-wave arrivals otherwise masked by high-amplitude surface waves. The directivity filters are constructed from predicted seismic ray incidence angles, enabling focused extraction of body-wave energy and suppression of interfering phases. We evaluate the method on both synthetic tests and waveform data from the Mw 7.0 Guerrero, Mexico, earthquake of September 8, 2021, recorded by the United States National Seismic Network (USNSN). Our results show that SP-TFF provides a robust computational framework for automated body-wave extraction, integrating polarization-informed filtering into seismological data-processing pipelines.</description>

      <title>Tsunami modeling with dynamic seafloors: a high-order solver validated with shallow water benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent scientific studies have suggested that, in certain physical configurations, the time-dependent behavior of earthquake rupture and seafloor (bathymetry) motion can leave observable near-field signatures in tsunami wave generation and propagation. However, dynamic ground movement is often neglected in conventional tsunami models, which commonly assume instantaneous ground displacement (sourcing). This work introduces a pseudo-spectral algorithm for the solution of the nonlinear shallow water equations with timedependent seafloor displacement and velocity. Based on a Fourier continuation (FC) methodology for the accurate trigonometric interpolation of a non-periodic function, the solver provides high-order convergence in space and time; mild (linear) Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) constraints for explicit time integration; and results that are effectively free of numerical dispersion (or ''pollution'') errors. Such properties enable the efficient and robust resolution of the different space-time scales involved modeling tsunamis generated by dynamic earthquake ground motion (including over long distances). Numerical experiments attesting to accuracy and computational performance are presented with direct comparisons to high-order finite difference methodologies. The solver is physically validated by a number of classical and semi-classical benchmark cases based on simulated or experimental data. Additionally, a seismologically realistic, first-of-its-kind parametric study based on earthquake speed is introduced, whose results-easily facilitated by the FC-based approach proposed herein, with minimal numerical tuning-further demonstrate the potential importance of (and the motivation herein for) incorporating time-dependent seafloor behavior in quantitative tsunami hazard assessment.</description>

      <title>Direct Estimation of Earthquake Source Properties from a Single CCTV Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a direct measurement of the slip-rate function from a natural coseismic rupture, recorded on March 28, 2025, during the $M_w$ 7.7 Mandalay earthquake (Myanmar). This measurement was made on video footage of the surface rupture captured by a security camera located only meters away from the fault trace. Using direct image analysis, we measured the relative slip at each time step and deduced the slip rate. Our results show a local slip duration of 1.4 s and cumulative slip of $\sim$3 m, during which surface slip velocity peaked at $\sim$3.5 m/s with passage of the rupture front. These findings demonstrate the pulse-like nature of the seismic rupture, at the location of the recording. Using slip-pulse elastodynamic rupture models, we obtain the complete mechanical properties of this pulse, including the energy release rate.</description>
