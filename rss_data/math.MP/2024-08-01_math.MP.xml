      <title>Exact surface energies and boundary excitations of the Izergin-Korepin model with generic boundary fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Izergin-Korepin model is an integrable model with the simplest twisted quantum affine algebra $U_q(A_2^{(2)})$ symmetry. Applying the $t-W$ method, we derive the homogeneous zero roots Bethe ansatz equations and the corresponding zero root patterns of the Izergin-Korepin model with generic integrable boundaries. Based on these results, we analytically compute the surface energies and boundary excitations in different regimes of boundary parameters of the model. It is shown that in some regimes, correlation effect appears between two boundary fields.</description>

      <title>A network based approach for unbalanced optimal transport on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural network approach to address the dynamic unbalanced optimal transport problem on surfaces with point cloud representation. For surfaces with point cloud representation, traditional method is difficult to apply due to the difficulty of mesh generating. Neural network is easy to implement even for complicate geometry. Moreover, instead of solving the original dynamic formulation, we consider the Hamiltonian flow approach, i.e. Karush-Kuhn-Tucker system. Based on this approach, we can exploit mathematical structure of the optimal transport to construct the neural network and the loss function can be simplified. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted for surfaces with different geometry. We also test the method for point cloud with noise, which shows stability of this method. This method is also easy to generalize to diverse range of problems.</description>

      <title>Kramers-Kronig relations via Laplace formalism and $L^1$ integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kramers-Kronig relations link the real and imaginary part of the Fourier transform of a well-behaved causal transfer function describing a linear, time-invariant system. From the physical point of view, according to the Kramers-Kronig relations, absorption and dispersion become two sides of the same coin. Due to the simplicity of the assumptions underlying them, the relations are a cornerstone of physics. The rigorous mathematical proof was carried out by Titchmarsh in 1937 and just requires the transfer function to be square-integrable ($L^2$), or equivalently that the impulse response of the system at hand has a finite energy. Titchmarsh's proof is definitely not easy, thus leading to crucial steps that are often overlooked by instructors and, occasionally, prompting some authors to attempt shaky shortcuts. Here we share a rigorous mathematical proof that relies on the Laplace formalism and requires a slightly stronger assumption on the transfer function, namely its being Lebesgue-integrable ($L^1$). While the result is not as general as Titchmarsh's proof, its enhanced simplicity makes a deeper knowledge of the mathematical aspects of the Kramers-Kronig relations more accessible to the audience of physicists.</description>

      <title>A framework for semi-universality: Semi-universality of 3-qudit SU(d)-invariant gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuits with symmetry-respecting gates have attracted broad interest in quantum information science. While recent work has developed a theory for circuits with Abelian symmetries, revealing important distinctions between Abelian and non-Abelian cases, a comprehensive framework for non-Abelian symmetries has been lacking. In this work, we develop novel techniques and a powerful framework that is particularly useful for understanding circuits with non-Abelian symmetries. Using this framework we settle an open question on quantum circuits with SU(d) symmetry. We show that 3-qudit SU(d)-invariant gates are semi-universal, i.e., generate all SU(d)-invariant unitaries, up to certain constraints on the relative phases between sectors with inequivalent representation of symmetry. Furthermore, we prove that these gates achieve full universality when supplemented with 3 ancilla qudits. Interestingly, we find that studying circuits with 3-qudit gates is also useful for a better understanding of circuits with 2-qudit gates. In particular, we establish that even though 2-qudit SU(d)-invariant gates are not themselves semi-universal, they become universal with at most 11 ancilla qudits. Additionally, we investigate the statistical properties of circuits composed of random SU(d)-invariant gates. Our findings reveal that while circuits with 2-qudit gates do not form a 2-design for the Haar measure over SU(d)-invariant unitaries, circuits with 3-qudit gates generate a t-design, with t that is quadratic in the number of qudits.</description>

      <title>Lax formulation of 3--component KP hierarchy by Shiota construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is quite basic in integrable systems to deriving Lax equations from bilinear equations. For multi--component KP theory, corresponding Lax structures are mainly constructed by matrix pseudo-differential operators for fixed discrete variables, or by matrix difference operators for even-component cases. Here we use Shiota method to construct Lax structure of 3-component KP hierarchy and its reduction by introducing two shift operators $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$, where relations among different discrete variables can be easily found. We believe the results here are quite typical for general multi-component KP theory, which may be helpful for general cases.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many new renormalization group flows between Virasoro minimal models from non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the study of non-invertible symmetries, we propose there exist infinitely many new renormalization group flows between Virasoro minimal models $\mathcal{M}(kq + I, q) \to\mathcal{M}(kq-I, q)$ induced by $\phi_{(1,2k+1)}$. They vastly generalize the previously proposed ones $k=I=1$ by Zamolodchikov, $k=1, I&gt;1$ by Ahn and L\"assig, and $k=2$ by Dorey et al. All the other $\mathbb{Z}_2$ preserving renormalization group flows sporadically known in the literature (e.g. $\mathcal{M}(10,3) \to \mathcal{M}(8,3)$ studied by Klebanov et al) fall into our proposal (e.g. $k=3, I=1$). We claim our new flows give a complete understanding of the renormalization group flows between Virasoro minimal models that preserve a modular tensor category with the $SU(2)_{q-2}$ fusion ring.</description>

      <title>Comparing a gauge-invariant formulation and a "conventional complete gauge-fixing approach" for $l=0,1$ mode perturbations on the Schwarzschild background spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comparison of the gauge-invariant formulation for $l=0,1$-mode perturbations on the Schwarzschild background spacetime proposed in [K.~Nakamura, Class. Quantum Grav. {\bf 38} (2021), 145010.] and a ``conventional complete gauge-fixing approach'' in which we use the spherical harmonic functions $Y_{lm}$ as the scalar harmonics from the starting point is discussed. Although it is often said that ``gauge-invariant formulations in general-relativistic perturbations are equivalent to complete gauge-fixing approaches,'' as the result of this comparison, we conclude that the derived solutions through the proposed gauge-invariant formulation and those through a ``conventional complete gauge-fixing approach'' are different. It is pointed out that there is a case where the boundary conditions and initial conditions are restricted in a conventional complete gauge-fixing approach.</description>

      <title>Long-time Asymptotics for the Ablowitz-Ladik system with present of solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate some problems about the initial-value problem of the focusing Ablowitz-Ladik system, and the initial data belongs to a discrete weighted $\ell^2$ space. On the one hand, we have proved the global well-posedness for the initial-value problem. Utilizing the fact that the initial data belongs to the discrete weighted $\ell^2$ space, we construct a Riemann-Hilbert problem for the initial-value problem. By Fredholm theory, the Riemann-Hilbert problem is uniquely solved with the jump contour consisting of three circles that all center around the origin. On the other hand, based on the global well-posedness and the Riemann-Hilbert problem, we allow the solution to have the higher-order solitons, and then analyze the long-time asymptotics for the solution in different sectors on the upper-half plane.</description>

      <title>Elastic bodies with kinematic constraints on many small regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the equilibrium of hyperelastic solids subjected to kinematic constraints on many small regions, which we call perforations.
  Such constraints on the displacement $u$ are given in the quite general form $u(x) \in F_x$, where $F_x$ is a closed set, and thus comprise confinement conditions, unilateral constraints, controlled displacement conditions, etc., both in the bulk and on the boundary of the body. The regions in which such conditions are active are assumed to be so small that they do not produce an overall rigid constraint, but still large enough so as to produce a non-trivial effect on the behaviour of the body. Mathematically, this is translated in an asymptotic analysis by introducing two small parameters: $\varepsilon$, describing the distance between the elements of the perforation, and $\delta$, the size of the element of the perforation. We find the critical scale at which the effect of the perforation is non-trivial and express it in terms of a $\Gamma$-limit in which the constraints are relaxed so that, in their place, a penalization term appears in the form of an integral of a function $\varphi(x,u)$. This function is determined by a blow-up procedure close to the perforation and depends on the shape of the perforation, the constraint $F_x$, and the asymptotic behaviour at infinity of the strain energy density $\sigma$. We give a concise proof of the mathematical result and numerical studies for some simple yet meaningful geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recently proven presence of ultrametricity in physical models (certain spin glasses) and the very recent study of Turing patterns on locally ultrametric state spaces, first non-autonomous diffusion operators on such spaces, where finitely many compact p-adic spaces are joined by a graph structure, are studied, including their Dirichlet and van Neumann eigenvalues. Secondly, the Cauchy problem for the heat equation associated with these operators is solved, its solution approximated by Trotter products, and thirdly, the corresponding Feller property as well as the Markov property (a Hunt process) is established.</description>

      <title>Towards $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal higher-spin theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three years ago, we proposed free off-shell models for ${\mathcal N}=2$ superconformal higher-spin multiplets in arbitrary conformally flat backgrounds, constructed conserved conformal higher-spin supercurrents for a massless hypermultiplet, and sketched the Noether procedure to generate its cubic couplings to the superconformal higher-spin multiplets. This paper is devoted to completing the Noether procedure. Specifically, we: (i) describe the unique off-shell primary extensions of the conformal higher-spin supercurrents; (ii) embed the off-shell superconformal prepotentials given in arXiv:2104.10416 into primary unconstrained isotwistor multiplets; and (iii) present the unique gauge transformations of the hypermultiplet and the isotwistor prepotentials. An extension of the Noether procedure beyond the cubic level is also sketched, following the earlier ${\mathcal N}=1$ superconformal approach of arXiv:2208.07783. Our construction is based on making use of the polar hypermultiplet within the projective-superspace setting.</description>

      <title>Integrability of the multi-species ASEP with long-range jumps on $\mathbb{Z}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let us consider a two-sided multi-species stochastic particle model with finitely many particles on $\mathbb{Z}$ defined as follows. Suppose that each particle is labelled by a positive integer $l$ and waits a random time exponentially distributed with rate $1$. It then chooses the right direction to jump with probability $p$ or the left direction with probability $q=1-p$. If the particle chooses the right direction, it jumps to the nearest site occupied by a particle $l'&lt;l$ (with the convention that an empty site is considered as a particle with labelled $0$). If the particle chooses the left direction, it follows the rule of the multi-species totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (mTASEP). We show that this model is integrable and provide the exact formula of the transition probability using the Bethe ansatz.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck Shenanigans: Permutons from pipe dreams via integrable probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study random permutations arising from reduced pipe dreams. Our main model is motivated by Grothendieck polynomials with parameter $\beta=1$ arising in K-theory of the flag variety. The probability weight of a permutation is proportional to the principal specialization (setting all variables to 1) of the corresponding Grothendieck polynomial. By mapping this random permutation to a version of TASEP (Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process), we describe the limiting permuton and fluctuations around it as the order $n$ of the permutation grows to infinity. The fluctuations are of order $n^{\frac13}$ and have the Tracy-Widom GUE distribution, which places this algebraic (K-theoretic) model into the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class.
  We also investigate non-reduced pipe dreams and make progress on a recent open problem on the asymptotic number of inversions of the resulting permutation. Inspired by Stanley's question for the maximal value of principal specializations of Schubert polynomials, we resolve the analogous question for $\beta=1$ Grothendieck polynomials, and provide bounds for general $\beta$.</description>

Abstract: We study Schr\"odinger operators on compact finite metric graphs subject to $\delta'$-coupling conditions. Based on a novel modified local Weyl law, we derive an explicit expression for the limiting mean eigenvalue distance of two different self-adjoint realisations on a given graph. Furthermore, using this spectral comparison result, we also study the limiting mean eigenvalue distance comparing $\delta'$-coupling conditions to so-called anti-Kirchhoff conditions, showing divergence and thereby confirming a numerical observation in [arXiv:2212.12531].

      <title>Minimal Quantum Circuits for Simulating Fibonacci Anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fibonacci topological order is the prime candidate for the realization of universal topological quantum computation. We devise minimal quantum circuits to demonstrate the non-Abelian nature of the doubled Fibonacci topological order, as realized in the Levin-Wen string net model. Our circuits effectively initialize the ground state, create excitations, twist and braid them, all in the smallest lattices possible. We further design methods to determine the fusion amplitudes and braiding phases of multiple excitations by carrying out a single qubit measurement. We show that the fusion channels of the doubled Fibonacci model can be detected using only three qubits, twisting phases can be measured using five, and braiding can be demonstrated using nine qubits. These designs provide the simplest possible settings for demonstrating the properties of Fibonacci anyons and can be used as realistic blueprints for implementation on many modern quantum architectures.</description>

      <title>A concrete construction of a topological operator in factorization algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Factorization algebras play a central role in the formulation of quantum field theories given by Kevin Costello and his collaborators. In this paper, we propose a concrete construction of a topological operator in their formulation. We focus on a shift symmetry of a one-dimensional massless scalar theory. And we give some discussions of $\mathbb{Z}$-gauging of it, i.e., compact scalar theory and its $\theta$-vacuum.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamics of charged dual-unitary circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between symmetries and entanglement in out-of-equilibrium quantum systems is currently at the centre of an intense multidisciplinary research effort. Here we introduce a setting where these questions can be characterised exactly by considering dual-unitary circuits with an arbitrary number of $U(1)$ charges. After providing a complete characterisation of these systems we show that one can introduce a class of solvable states, which extends that of generic dual unitary circuits, for which the non-equilibrium dynamics can be solved exactly. In contrast to the known class of solvable states, which relax to the infinite temperature state, these states relax to a family of non-trivial generalised Gibbs ensembles. The relaxation process of these states can be simply described by a linear growth of the entanglement entropy followed by saturation to a non-maximal value but with maximal entanglement velocity. We then move on to consider the dynamics from non-solvable states, combining exact results with the entanglement membrane picture we argue that the entanglement dynamics from these states is qualitatively different from that of the solvable ones. It shows two different growth regimes characterised by two distinct slopes, both corresponding to sub-maximal entanglement velocities. Moreover, we show that non-solvable initial states can give rise to the quantum Mpemba effect, where less symmetric initial states restore the symmetry faster than more symmetric ones.</description>

      <title>Quantitative disorder effects in low-dimensional spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.01711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Imry-Ma phenomenon, predicted in 1975 by Imry and Ma and rigorously established in 1989 by Aizenman and Wehr, states that first-order phase transitions of low-dimensional spin systems are `rounded' by the addition of a quenched random field to the quantity undergoing the transition. The phenomenon applies to a wide class of spin systems in dimensions $d\le 2$ and to spin systems possessing a continuous symmetry in dimensions $d\le 4$.
  This work provides quantitative estimates for the Imry--Ma phenomenon: In a cubic domain of side length $L$, we study the effect of the boundary conditions on the spatial and thermal average of the quantity coupled to the random field. We show that the boundary effect diminishes at least as fast as an inverse power of $\log\log L$ for general two-dimensional spin systems and for four-dimensional spin systems with continuous symmetry, and at least as fast as an inverse power of $L$ for two- and three-dimensional spin systems with continuous symmetry. Specific models of interest for the obtained results include the two-dimensional random-field $q$-state Potts and Edwards-Anderson spin glass models, and the $d$-dimensional random-field spin $O(n)$ models ($n\ge 2$) in dimensions $d\le 4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Olshanski twisted Yangian based models, known as one-dimensional "soliton non-preserving" open spin chains, by means of algebraic Bethe ansatz. The even case, when the bulk symmetry is $\mathfrak{gl}_{2n}$ and the boundary symmetry is $\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}$ or $\mathfrak{gl}_{2n}$, was studied in arXiv:1710.08409. In the present work, we focus on the odd case, when the bulk symmetry is $\mathfrak{gl}_{2n+1}$ and the boundary symmetry is $\mathfrak{so}_{2n+1}$. We explicitly construct Bethe vectors and present a more symmetric form of the trace formula. We use the composite model approach and $Y(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$-type recurrence relations to obtain recurrence relations for twisted Yangian based Bethe vectors, for both even and odd cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of the Dirac hamiltonian in one space dimension for a single electron in the electrostatic potential of a point nucleus, in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation where the nucleus is assumed fixed at the origin. The potential is screened at large distances so that it goes to zero exponentially at spatial infinity. We show that the hamiltonian is essentially self-adjoint, the essential spectrum has the usual gap $(-mc^2,mc^2)$ in it, and that there are only finitely many eigenvalues in that gap, corresponding to ground and excited states for the system. We find a one-to-one correspondence between the eigenfunctions of this hamiltonian and the heteroclinic saddle-saddle connectors of a certain dynamical system on a finite cylinder. We use this correspondence to study how the number of bound states changes with the nuclear charge.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry of moduli spaces of local systems and representation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:1904.10491v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let G be a split semi-simple adjoint group, and S a colored decorated surface, given by an oriented surface with punctures, special boundary points, and a specified collection of boundary intervals.
  We introduce a moduli space P(G,S) parametrizing G-local system on S with some boundary data, and prove that it carries a cluster Poisson structure, equivariant under the action of the cluster modular group M(G,S), containing the mapping class group of S, the group of outer automorphisms of G, and the product of Weyl / braid groups over punctures / boundary components. We prove that the dual moduli space A(G,S) carries a M(G,S)-equivariant cluster structure, and the pair (A(G,S), P(G,S)) is a cluster ensemble. These results generalize the works of V. Fock &amp; the first author, and of I. Le.
  We quantize cluster Poisson varieties X for any Planck constant h s.t. h&gt;0 or |h|=1. First, we define a *-algebra structure on the Langlands modular double A(h; X) of the algebra of functions on X. We construct a principal series of representations of the *-algebra A(h; X), equivariant under a unitary projective representation of the cluster modular group M(X). This extends works of V. Fock and the first author when h&gt;0.
  Combining this, we get a M(G,S)-equivariant quantization of the moduli space P(G,S), given by the *-algebra A(h; P(G,S)) and its principal series representations. We construct realizations of the principal series *-representations. In particular, when S is punctured disc with two special points, we get a principal series *-representations of the Langlands modular double of the quantum group Uq(g).
  We conjecture that there is a nondegenerate pairing between the local system of coinvariants of oscillatory representations of the W-algebra and the one provided by the projective representation of the mapping class group of S.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03075v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the tasks of learning quantum states, measurements and channels generated by continuous-variable (CV) quantum circuits. This family of circuits is suited to describe optical quantum technologies and in particular it includes state-of-the-art photonic processors capable of showing quantum advantage. We define classes of functions that map classical variables, encoded into the CV circuit parameters, to outcome probabilities evaluated on those circuits. We then establish efficient learnability guarantees for such classes, by computing bounds on their pseudo-dimension or covering numbers, showing that CV quantum circuits can be learned with a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the circuit's size, i.e., the number of modes. Our results show that CV circuits can be trained efficiently using a number of training samples that, unlike their finite-dimensional counterpart, does not scale with the circuit depth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.07471v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for internal topological symmetries in quantum field theory, including "noninvertible symmetries" and "categorical symmetries". This leads to a calculus of topological defects which takes full advantage of well-developed theorems and techniques in topological field theory. Our discussion focuses on finite symmetries, and we give indications for a generalization to other symmetries. We treat quotients and quotient defects (often called "gauging" and "condensation defects"), finite electromagnetic duality, and duality defects, among other topics. We include an appendix on finite homotopy theories, which are often used to encode finite symmetries and for which computations can be carried out using methods of algebraic topology. Throughout we emphasize exposition and examples over a detailed technical treatment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding degrees of freedom in classical mechanics is fundamental to characterizing physical systems. Counting them is usually easy, especially if we can assign them a clear meaning. However, the precise definition of a degree of freedom is not usually presented in first-year physics courses since it requires mathematical knowledge only learned in more advanced courses. In this paper, we use a pedagogical approach motivated by simple but non-trivial mechanical examples to define degrees of freedom and configuration spaces. We highlight the role that topology plays in understanding these ideas.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of block Toeplitz determinants with piecewise continuous symbols</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the asymptotics of the block Toeplitz determinants $\det T_n(\phi)$ as $n\to\infty$ for $N\times N$ matrix-valued piecewise continuous functions $\phi$ with a finitely many jumps under mild additional conditions. In particular, we prove that $$
  \det T_n(\phi) \sim G^n n^\Omega E\quad {\rm as}\ n\to \infty, $$ where $G$, $E$, and $\Omega$ are constants that depend on the matrix symbol $\phi$ and are described in our main results. Our approach is based on a new localization theorem for Toeplitz determinants, a new method of computing the Fredholm index of Toeplitz operators with piecewise continuous matrix-valued symbols, and other operator theoretic methods. As an application of our results, we consider piecewise continuous symbols that arise in the study of entanglement entropy in quantum spin chain models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the global and local topological properties of multi-lepton patterns reconstructed at the detectors. We investigate the sensitivity of Forman Ricci curvature distributions and persistent homology features to kinematic cuts, integrated luminosity, and scales of maximum filtration. We find that these topological properties are efficient enough in discriminating the BSM scenarios from the SM background, particularly when the BSM scenarios possess a massive invisible particle. We also find that the topological properties exhibit a scaling behaviour with integrated luminosity. This exploratory study suggests that the topological features can potentially supplement the traditional cut-and-count analyses in search of new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the spectral theory of soliton condensates - a special limit of soliton gases - for the focusing NLS (fNLS). In particular, we analyze the kinetic equation for the fNLS circular condensate, which represents the first example of an explicitly solvable fNLS condensate with nontrivial large scale space-time dynamics. Solution of the kinetic equation was obtained by reducing it to Whitham type equations for the endpoints of spectral arcs. We also study the rarefaction and dispersive shock waves for circular condensates, as well as calculate the corresponding average conserved quantities and the kurtosis. We want to note that one of the main objects of the spectral theory - the nonlinear dispersion relations - is introduced in the paper as some special large genus (thermodynamic) limit the Riemann bilinear identities that involve the quasimomentum and the quasienergy meromorphic differentials.</description>

Abstract: Our motivation is to consider an electromagnetic Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}_q$, depending on a parameter such that, for $q=1$ it corresponds to the Born-Infeld Lagrangian density and for $q=2$ it restores the Maxwell one. The model in the presence of given charge and current densities is investigated. We solve the pure magnetostatic problem for $q\in(6/5,2)$. We also study the electrostatic problem in the presence of an assigned magnetic field for $q\in[1,2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum information processing and computing tasks can be understood as quantum networks, comprising quantum states and channels and possible physical transformations on them. It is hence pertinent to estimate the change in informational content of quantum processes due to physical transformations they undergo. The physical transformations of quantum states are described by quantum channels, while the transformations of quantum channels are described by quantum superchannels. In this work, we determine fundamental limitations on how well the physical transformation on quantum channels can be undone or reversed, which are of crucial interest to design and benchmark quantum information and computation devices. In particular, we refine (strengthen) the quantum data processing inequality for quantum channels under the action of quantum superchannels. We identify a class of quantum superchannels, which appears to be the superchannel analogue of subunital quantum channels, under the action of which the entropy of an arbitrary quantum channel is nondecreasing. We also provide a refined inequality for the entropy change of quantum channels under the action of an arbitrary quantum superchannel.</description>

Abstract: For $R&gt;0$, we give a rigorous probabilistic construction on the cylinder $\mathbb{R} \times (\mathbb{R}/(2\pi R\mathbb{Z}))$ of the (massless) Sinh-Gordon model. In particular we define the $n$-point correlation functions of the model and show that these exhibit a scaling relation with respect to $R$. The construction, which relies on the massless Gaussian Free Field, is based on the spectral analysis of a quantum operator associated to the model. Using the theory of Gaussian multiplicative chaos, we prove that this operator has discrete spectrum and a strictly positive ground state.</description>

Abstract: We construct the generalized $\beta$ and $(q,t)$-deformed partition functions through $W$ representations, where the expansions are respectively with respect to the generalized Jack and Macdonald polynomials labeled by $N$-tuple of Young diagrams. We find that there are the profound interrelations between our deformed partition functions and the $4d$ and $5d$ Nekrasov partition functions. Since the corresponding Nekrasov partition functions can be given by vertex operators, the remarkable connection between our $\beta$ and $(q,t)$-deformed $W$-operators and vertex operators is revealed in this paper. In addition, we investigate the higher Hamiltonians for the generalized Jack and Macdonald polynomials.</description>
