      <title>A New Brain Network Construction Paradigm for Brain Disorder via Diffusion-based Graph Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain network analysis plays an increasingly important role in studying brain function and the exploring of disease mechanisms. However, existing brain network construction tools have some limitations, including dependency on empirical users, weak consistency in repeated experiments and time-consuming processes. In this work, a diffusion-based brain network pipeline, DGCL is designed for end-to-end construction of brain networks. Initially, the brain region-aware module (BRAM) precisely determines the spatial locations of brain regions by the diffusion process, avoiding subjective parameter selection. Subsequently, DGCL employs graph contrastive learning to optimize brain connections by eliminating individual differences in redundant connections unrelated to diseases, thereby enhancing the consistency of brain networks within the same group. Finally, the node-graph contrastive loss and classification loss jointly constrain the learning process of the model to obtain the reconstructed brain network, which is then used to analyze important brain connections. Validation on two datasets, ADNI and ABIDE, demonstrates that DGCL surpasses traditional methods and other deep learning models in predicting disease development stages. Significantly, the proposed model improves the efficiency and generalization of brain network construction. In summary, the proposed DGCL can be served as a universal brain network construction scheme, which can effectively identify important brain connections through generative paradigms and has the potential to provide disease interpretability support for neuroscience research.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based Inference of Developmental EEG Maturation with the Spectral Graph Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02524</link>

Abstract: The spectral content of macroscopic neural activity evolves throughout development, yet how this maturation relates to underlying brain network formation and dynamics remains unknown. Here, we assess the developmental maturation of electroencephalogram spectra via Bayesian model inversion of the spectral graph model, a parsimonious whole-brain model of spatiospectral neural activity derived from linearized neural field models coupled by the structural connectome. Simulation-based inference was used to estimate age-varying spectral graph model parameter posterior distributions from electroencephalogram spectra spanning the developmental period. This model-fitting approach accurately captures observed developmental electroencephalogram spectral maturation via a neurobiologically consistent progression of key neural parameters: long-range coupling, axonal conduction speed, and excitatory:inhibitory balance. These results suggest that the spectral maturation of macroscopic neural activity observed during typical development is supported by age-dependent functional adaptations in localized neural dynamics and their long-range coupling across the macroscopic structural network.</description>

      <title>AutoRG-Brain: Grounded Report Generation for Brain MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiologists are tasked with interpreting a large number of images in a daily base, with the responsibility of generating corresponding reports. This demanding workload elevates the risk of human error, potentially leading to treatment delays, increased healthcare costs, revenue loss, and operational inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we initiate a series of work on grounded Automatic Report Generation (AutoRG), starting from the brain MRI interpretation system, which supports the delineation of brain structures, the localization of anomalies, and the generation of well-organized findings. We make contributions from the following aspects, first, on dataset construction, we release a comprehensive dataset encompassing segmentation masks of anomaly regions and manually authored reports, termed as RadGenome-Brain MRI. This data resource is intended to catalyze ongoing research and development in the field of AI-assisted report generation systems. Second, on system design, we propose AutoRG-Brain, the first brain MRI report generation system with pixel-level grounded visual clues. Third, for evaluation, we conduct quantitative assessments and human evaluations of brain structure segmentation, anomaly localization, and report generation tasks to provide evidence of its reliability and accuracy. This system has been integrated into real clinical scenarios, where radiologists were instructed to write reports based on our generated findings and anomaly segmentation masks. The results demonstrate that our system enhances the report-writing skills of junior doctors, aligning their performance more closely with senior doctors, thereby boosting overall productivity.</description>
