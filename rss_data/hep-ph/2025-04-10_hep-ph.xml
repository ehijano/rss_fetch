      <title>Entanglement and pair production in intense electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spin correlations between electron-positron pairs created from a photon when it scatters in a high-intensity laser pulse via the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process. We find that the spin states of the generated electron-positron pair can exhibit strong entanglement, with the degree being sensitive to the photon energy, laser intensity, and the relative polarisation of the photon and laser pulse. Photons with a high degree of polarisation can create strongly entangled pairs, and this entanglement can be maintained in the high-intensity (non-perturbative) regime. We find that if the photons are provided by a Compton source, strongly spin-entangled electron-positron pairs can be generated with technology available today.</description>

      <title>The Drell-Yan Process at NNLL$^\prime$+NNLO using Rapidity Dependent Jet Vetoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results for the Drell-Yan process $pp \to Z/\gamma^* + X \to l^+l^- + X$ in the presence of the rapidity dependent jet vetoes $\mathcal{T}_{Bj}$ and $\mathcal{T}_{Cj}.$ These observables provide a tighter veto at central rapidities than at forward rapidities. Our predictions contain a resummation of large logarithms of the veto scale over the hard scale, matched to fixed order in perturbation theory; we present results at both NLL$^\prime$+NLO and NNLL$^\prime$+NNLO. Uncertainty estimates are provided that contain both resummation and fixed-order uncertainties; we find that using a standard profile scale variation procedure for the former seems to underestimate the uncertainty, particularly at NLL$^\prime$+NLO. Consequently, we modify the procedure to avoid cancellation of scale variations between partonic channels, and verify that the uncertainties from this method are reasonable using a simplified version of the Theory Nuisance Parameter (TNP) method. We then find that the uncertainty decreases going from the NLL$^\prime$+NLO to the NNLL$^\prime$+NNLO predictions, and obtain an uncertainty at the level of $1-3\%$ in the NNLL$^\prime$+NNLO predictions when the veto scale is of $\mathcal{O}(10 \text{ GeV})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We relate the Polyakov and anti-Polyakov loops, which determine how energetically costly it is to bring an external static quark or antiquark probe into a bath of quarks and gluons, to the ability of that same medium to provide the conditions for the formation of meson-like or baryon-like configurations that would screen the probes.</description>

      <title>Three-Loop QCD corrections to the production of a Higgs boson and a Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute three-loop QCD corrections to the scattering amplitude of a Higgs boson and three partons interfered with its tree level counterpart. Specifically, we derive our results in the generalized leading color limit. Our results are represented in terms of so-called multiple polylogarithms and thus ready for use in phenomenological predictions. We provide the three-loop amplitudes necessary to compute the production cross section of a Higgs boson and a hadronic jet at hadron colliders and the decay probability of a Higgs boson to three hadronic jets at lepton colliders.</description>

      <title>Axionless Solution to the Strong CP Problem -- two-zeros textures of the quark and lepton mass matrices and neutrino CP violation --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CP invariance is a very attractive solution to the strong CP problem in QCD. This solution requires the vanishing ${\rm arg}\,[{\rm det}\, M_d\, {\rm det} M_u]$, where the $M_d$ and $M_u$ are the mass matrices for the down- and up-type quarks. It happens if we have several zeros in the quark mass matrices. We proceed a systematic construction, in this paper, of two zeros textures for the down-type quark mass matrix while the mass matrix for the up-type quarks is always diagonal. We find only three types of the mass matrices can explain the observed CKM matrix, the masses of the quarks and the charged leptons and the small enough vacuum angle $\theta &lt; 10^{-10}$. We extend the mass construction to the neutrino sector and derive predictions on the CP violating parameter $\delta_{CP}$ in the neutrino oscillation and the mass parameter $m_{\beta\beta}$. It is extremely remarkable that the normal (NH) and inverted (IH) hierarchies in the neutrino masses are equally possible in the case where we introduce only two right-handed neutrinos $N$s. Furthermore, we have a strict prediction on the $\delta_{CP} \simeq 200^\circ$ or $250^\circ$ in the NH case. If it is the case we can naturally explain the positive sign of the baryon asymmetry in the present universe.</description>

      <title>Searching for the dark photon at the Future Circular Lepton Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of future electroweak precision measurements at the Future Circular Lepton Collider (FCC-ee), we consider recent proposals aimed at finding signatures of physics beyond the Standard Model. In particular, we focus on recent novel suggestions for very precise direct measurements of $\alpha_{\rm e m}(M_Z^2)$. It is shown that at a level of precision of order $10^{-5}$, the effects of a dark photon may be very significant.</description>

      <title>Hunting axion dark matter signatures in low-frequency terrestrial magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Earth's natural environment can serve as a powerful probe for ultralight axion dark matter. In the presence of global geomagnetic fields, the axions with masses ranging from $10^{-15}\,{\rm eV}-10^{-13}\,{\rm eV}$ induce electromagnetic waves in the (sub-) extremely low-frequency band ($0.3-30\,{\rm Hz}$) through the axion-photon coupling. We predict the amplitude of induced magnetic fields in the Earth-ionosphere cavity, taking the finite conductivity of the atmosphere into account. This allows us to constrain the axion-photon coupling parameter, $g_{\rm a\gamma}$, from the long-term monitoring data of the low-frequency magnetic fields, resulting in a significant improvement from the previous constraints down to $g_{\rm a\gamma} \lesssim 4\times10^{-13}\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for axion mass $\sim 3 \times 10^{-14}\,{\rm eV}$.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning in the Hunt for Heavy Charged Higgs Bosons at Gamma-Gamma Colliders in the Type III Two Higgs Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a detailed exploration of charged Higgs boson masses $M_{H^{\pm}}$ within the range of $100-190~GeV$. This investigation is grounded in the benchmark points that comply with experimental constraints, allowing us to systematically account for uncertainties inherent in the analysis. Our results indicate significant production prospects for the process $H^{+}H^{-} \rightarrow \tau \nu_{\tau} \tau \nu_{\tau}$, which could provide essential insights into the properties of $H^{\pm}$ bosons. By examining these decay channels, we aim to illuminate the interplay between the charged Higgs boson and the established Standard Model. The research uses machine learning methods like Boosted Decision Trees (BDT) and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), as well as Likelihood and LikelihoodD, to improve the identification of heavy charged Higgs bosons compared to Standard Model backgrounds at a 3.0 TeV $\gamma\gamma$ collider with an integrated luminosity of $\mathcal{L}_{int}=3000~fb^{-1}$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Les Houches returned to an in-person format in 2023 and the bi-yearly tradition of updating the standard model precision wishlist has continued. In this work we review recent progress (since Les Houches 2021) in fixed-order computations for LHC applications. In addition, necessary ingredients for such calculations such as parton distribution functions, amplitudes, and subtraction methods are discussed. Finally, we indicate processes and missing higher-order corrections that are required to reach the theoretical accuracy that matches the anticipated experimental precision.</description>

      <title>Axion production from electron-nucleon scattering in chiral effective theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06786v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the axion production from the electron-nucleon scattering, i.e., the $eN\to e N a$ processes, being $N$ the proton and neutron. We simultaneously include three different types of axion interaction couplings within the chiral effective field theory, namely the axion-nucleon-nucleon couplings $g_{aNN}$, axion-photon-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ and axion-photon-vector meson resonances couplings $g_{\rho a\gamma}$ and $g_{\omega a\gamma}$. Vast inputs from the lattice QCD and hadron phenomenological studies are used to fix the unknown couplings. The relative strengths of different axion interactions in the $eN\to e N a$ processes are then revealed. We provide detailed predictions for the differential cross sections with respect to various angles and axion energy, as well as the total cross sections, both for the Kim-Shifman-Vainstein-Zakharov (KSVZ) and Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky (DFSZ) axion models.</description>

      <title>Investigation of triply heavy spin-3/2 baryons in their ground and excited states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the masses and residues of triply heavy baryons with spin-3/2, including $\Omega^*_{ccc}$, $\Omega^*_{ccb}$, $\Omega^*_{bbc}$ and $\Omega^*_{bbb}$, using the QCD sum rules method. Our calculations primarily focus on obtaining the masses of the first three resonances, that is, the ground state (1S), the first orbital excited state (1P), and the first radial excited state (2S), for the mentioned baryons. We additionally determine the residues of these baryons, which serve as key parameters for studying their possible decay channels and interactions with other particles. To achieve higher accuracy compared to previous studies, we consider nonperturbative operators up to eight mass dimensions. We present our calculated outcomes in two distinct energy schemes, referred to as pole and $\mathrm{\overline{MS}}$. Given the absence of experimental data for these states, we compare our results with previous theoretical calculations that are reported in relevant studies employing various approaches. These results may provide valuable insights for experimental groups searching for the triply heavy baryons.</description>

      <title>New physics particles mixing with mesons: production in the fragmentation chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of extensions to the Standard Model adds hypothetical long-lived particles (LLPs) that have mass- or kinetic-mixing with neutral mesons, such as pions or rho mesons. The mixing can contribute significantly to the production of LLPs at proton accelerator experiments, and no consistent description of these production modes exists in the literature. In this paper, we develop a framework for studying different LLPs - dark photons, vector mediators coupled to the baryon current, and axion-like particles with different coupling patterns. In particular, we implement the production mechanisms in \texttt{PYTHIA8}, study how the overall flux and kinematic distributions depend on the LLP's mass, and compare various sub-processes where the mixing contributes - proton bremsstrahlung, meson decay, and production in the fragmentation chain. We find that our new description of LLP production predicts an integrated flux that differs from current approaches by one to two orders of magnitude, and highlight the unavoidable theoretical uncertainties coming from poor knowledge of the properties of heavy mesons.</description>

      <title>High-order fluctuations of temperature in hot QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the temperature fluctuations in hot quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter. A new thermodynamic state function is introduced to describe the mean transverse momentum fluctuations of charged particles in heavy-ion collisions, enabling analytic expressions for the temperature fluctuations of different orders. This formalism is applied to the QCD thermodynamics described by a 2+1 flavor low energy effective field theory within the functional renormalization group approach. It is found that the temperature fluctuations are suppressed remarkably as the matter is evolved from the phase of hadron resonance gas to the quark-gluon plasma phase with increasing temperature or baryon chemical potential, which is attributed to the significant increase of the heat capacity of matter. Furthermore, the same mechanism leads to a negative skewness in the temperature fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Decays $\tau \to \pi \pi \eta\nu_\tau$ and $\tau \to \pi\eta\eta\nu_\tau$ in the extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of the extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, the processes $\tau \to \pi \pi \eta(\eta')\nu_\tau$ and $\tau \to \pi\eta\eta(\eta')\nu_\tau$ are considered taking into account mesons in the ground and first radially excited intermediate states. It is shown that in the processes $\tau \to \pi \pi \eta(\eta')\nu_\tau$ the vector channel is dominant, and in the processes $\tau \to \pi\eta\eta(\eta')\nu_\tau$ the main contribution is given by the axial vector channel. The scalar meson $a_0$ plays a dominant role in processes with two $\eta$-mesons in the final state. The significance of the relative phase between the ground and first radially excited states for these processes is shown. The obtained results for the $\tau \to \pi \pi \eta\nu_\tau$ process are in satisfactory agreement with the recent experimental data from BaBar and CMD-3, which differ from the averaged values given in the PDG tables.</description>

      <title>Constraining Mixed Dark Matter models with high redshift Lyman-alpha forest data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study sets new constraints on Cold+Warm Dark Matter (CWDM) models by leveraging the small-scale suppression of structure formation imprinted in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Using the Sherwood-Relics suite, we extract high-fidelity flux power spectra from simulated Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data, spanning a broad range of cosmologies and thermal histories. This enables precise constraints on the warm dark matter (WDM) fraction, $f_{\mathrm{WDM}}$, and the mass of the WDM particle, $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}$. A key advancement of our analysis is the integration of a neural network emulator directly at the likelihood level, significantly accelerating Bayesian parameter inference. With new observations of high-redshift ($z$ = 4.2$-$5.0) quasar spectra from UVES and HIRES, we establish stringent upper limits: for $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}$ = 1 keV, we find $f_{\mathrm{WDM}} &lt; 0.16$ (2$\sigma$), with constraints loosening to 35\%, 50\%, and 67\% for $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}$ = 2, 3, and 4 keV, respectively. Our results for pure WDM reaffirm the lower bounds of previous work. Crucially, we account for the fixed resolution of simulations and the impact of patchy reionization, demonstrating their minimal influence on mixed dark matter constraints. This robustness paves the way for tighter bounds with improved statistical samples in the future. Our findings suggest that CWDM models can naturally accommodate mild suppression of matter clustering in the high redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ forest 1D flux power, potentially offering a resolution to some of the ongoing cosmological tensions at low redshifts, namely the $S_{8}$ tension.</description>

Abstract: One of the important features of nuclear forces is their strong repulsive nature at short ($\le 0.5-0.6$~Fm) distances which prevents atomic nuclei from collapsing, thus guarantying the stability for the visible matter. However the dynamical nature of this repulsion (referred to as a nuclear core) is as elusive as ever. We present the study of nuclear dynamics at extremely large internal momenta in the deuteron dominated by the nuclear core. It is demonstrated that the paradigm shift in the description of the deuteron consisting of proton and neutron to the description of the deuteron as a pseudo-vector composite system in which proton and neutron is observed in high energy electro-disintegration processes results in the emergence of a new structure. We demonstrate that this new structure can exist only if it emerges from pre-existing non-nucleonic component in the deuteron. The study of the dynamics of the predicted new structure is presented focusing on the question if it allows to understand the anomaly observed in the recent experiment at Jefferson Lab that probed deuteron structure at internal momenta above 800 MeV/c.</description>

      <title>Graviton stimulated emission in squeezed vacuum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of gravitons in a squeezed vacuum state in a thermal radiation background. Unlike traditional treatments that rely on the Boltzmann equation, we employ the Heisenberg equation and average it over general quantum states. In contrast to the usual Boltzmann-based descriptions, our approach captures the subtleties arising from quantum coherence in different number eigenstates, which is essential for soft graviton modes in the squeezed vacuum state. Our new method successfully reproduces the previous one-loop results within the in-in formalism when the expansion parameter is small and deviates significantly as the parameter increases, indicating that our results extend beyond the one-loop in-in formalism. We examine the implications of graviton emission effects stimulated by quantum coherence in both flat and expanding backgrounds. In the flat background, it is found that backreaction of radiation on the spacetime dynamics is crucial for significant stimulated emission. In the expanding background, to avoid the subtleties associated with superhorizon modes, we investigate the effect of emission within the horizon immediately after reheating and find a significant effect. We examined the IR graviton evolution from a symmetry perspective and propose a regularization prescription to eliminate the secular growth problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2024, the SHiP experiment, together with the associated Beam Dump Facility (BDF) under the auspices of the High Intensity ECN3 (HI-ECN3) project, was selected for the future physics exploitation of the ECN3 experimental facility at the SPS. The SHiP experiment is a general-purpose intensity-frontier setup designed to search for physics beyond the Standard Model in the domain of Feebly Interacting Particles at the GeV-scale. It comprises a multi-system apparatus that provides discovery sensitivity to both decay and scattering signatures of models with feebly interacting particles, such as dark-sector mediators, both elastic and inelastic light dark matter, as well as millicharged particles. The experiment will also be able to perform both Standard Model measurements and Beyond Standard Model searches with neutrino interactions. In particular, it will have access to unprecedented statistics of tau and anti-tau neutrinos. The construction plan foresees commissioning of the facility and detector, and start of operation in advance of Long Shutdown 4, with a programme of exploration for 15 years of data taking. By exploring unique regions of parameter space for feebly interacting particles in the GeV/c$^2$ mass range, the SHiP experiment will complement ongoing searches at the LHC and searches at future colliders.</description>

      <title>Universal profile for cosmic birefringence tomography with radio galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to tomographically probe cosmic birefringence using radio galaxies. We show that the redshift evolution of the cosmic birefringence angle induced by a slow-rolling pseudoscalar field, which is a candidate for dynamical dark energy, is independent of the detailed model of the pseudoscalor field. This universal profile evolves predominantly at $z\lesssim10$. In contrast, if the origin is a dark matter-like pseudscalor field, the resulting birefringence angle tends to be negligible in the low-redshift regime. This new insight provides a strong motivation to independently test the cosmic birefringence using polarized astrophysical sources such as radio galaxies. We find that a sample size of $\order{10^5-10^6}$ is required to distinguish the profiles, which is achievable with ongoing and upcoming radio surveys such as ASKAP or SKA.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Assisted Unfolding for Neutrino Cross-section Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The choice of unfolding method for a cross-section measurement is tightly coupled to the model dependence of the efficiency correction and the overall impact of cross-section modeling uncertainties in the analysis. A key issue is the dimensionality used in unfolding, as the kinematics of all outgoing particles in an event typically affect the reconstruction performance in a neutrino detector. OmniFold is an unfolding method that iteratively reweights a simulated dataset, using machine learning to utilize arbitrarily high-dimensional information, that has previously been applied to proton-proton and proton-electron datasets. This paper demonstrates OmniFold's application to a neutrino cross-section measurement for the first time using a public T2K near detector simulated dataset, comparing its performance with traditional approaches using a mock data study.</description>

      <title>Antikaon condensed dense matter in neutron star with SU(3) flavour symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of massive pulsars suggest that the central density of neutron stars can exceed several times the nuclear saturation density, which is a favourable environment for the appearance of exotic states such as strange and non-strange baryons, meson condensates, and deconfined quark matter. The antikaon condensate is the most studied and plausible candidate among meson condensates. However, little is known about the exact interaction mechanisms between antikaons and mediator mesons. In this work, we aim to determine hadron couplings in the mesonic sector using SU(3) flavour symmetry. Among the three key parameters we calculate $\theta_v$, the mixing angle between the octet meson $\omega_8$ and the singlet meson $\phi_1$; the ratio of the octet to singlet couplings $z$; and leave the weight factor that balances the symmetric and antisymmetric couplings $\alpha_v$ as a free parameter to explore its impact on the system. Using this approach, we derive the couplings for antikaon interactions with both singlet and octet mesons in the nonet vector meson family and examine the corresponding implications for dense matter featuring antikaon condensation. Our findings reveal that the equation of state for dense matter becomes progressively stiffer with increasing values of $\alpha_v$, which delays the onset of antikaon condensation and increases the maximum achievable mass of neutron stars. This establishes a lower bound for $\alpha_v$ that is consistent with the observed minimum masses of pulsars.</description>

      <title>Holographic hybrid stars with slow phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $D_3$-$D_7$ holographic model is used to describe the core of the hybrid star, composed by quark matter, while its crust is modeled from a hadronic relativistic mean field (RMF) model capable of reproducing low-energy nuclear physics data as well as some astrophysical observations. The $D_3$-$D_7$ brane configuration and the RMF model lead to an equation of state that is used to solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations. For different model parameters, the mass-radius diagram is presented. The conditions for the dynamic stability of stellar configurations are discussed, considering the radial oscillation criterion for hybrid stars with slow phase transitions. Strikingly, it is shown that the models generate stable star configurations with a core of quarks. We compare our results with NICER observational data for the pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620 and show that the compact stars generated from this method fall within the corresponding observational regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements at the Large Hadron Collider have observed entanglement in the spins of $t\bar t$ pairs. The effects of radiation, which are expected to lead to quantum decoherence and a reduction of entanglement, are generally neglected in such measurements. In this letter we calculate the effects of decoherence from various different types of radiation for a maximally entangled pair of fermions -- a bipartite system of qubits in a Bell state. We identify the Kraus operators describing the evolution of the open quantum system with the integrated Altarelli-Parisi splitting functions.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Search with a Resonantly-Coupled Hybrid Spin System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in tabletop quantum sensor technology have enabled searches for nongravitational interactions of dark matter (DM). Traditional axion DM experiments rely on sharp resonance, resulting in extensive scanning time to cover a wide mass range. In this work, we present a broadband approach in an alkali-${}^{21}$Ne spin system. We identify two distinct hybrid spin-coupled regimes: a self-compensation (SC) regime at low frequencies and a hybrid spin resonance (HSR) regime at higher frequencies. By utilizing these two distinct regimes, we significantly enhance the bandwidth of ${}^{21}$Ne nuclear spin compared to conventional nuclear magnetic resonance, while maintaining competitive sensitivity. We present a comprehensive broadband search for axion-like dark matter, covering 5 orders of magnitude of Compton frequencies range within $[10^{-2}, \, 10^3]$ Hz. We set new constraints on the axion dark matter interactions with neutrons and protons, accounting for the effects of DM stochasticity. For the axion-neutron coupling, our results reach a low value of $|g_{ann}|\le 3\times 10^{-10}$ in the frequency range $[2\times 10^{-2}, \, 4]$ Hz surpassing astrophysical limits and providing the strongest laboratory constraints in the $[10, \, 100]$ Hz range. For the axion-proton coupling, we offer the best terrestrial constraints for the frequency ranges $[2\times 10^{-2}, \, 5]$Hz and $[16, \, 7\times 10^{2}]$ Hz.</description>

Abstract: We fit the invariant mass distribution of ${X(3872)}\rightarrow{J}/{\psi}\pi^+\pi^-$ from LHCb using the propagator for S-wave near-threshold states in effective field theory. In this way, we can directly determine the $Z$ which measures the projection of the bound state on the compact state in ${X(3872)}$. Consequently, the structure of ${X(3872)}$ can be elucidated. Moreover, the fitting result also can describe well the data for ${X(3872)}\rightarrow{D}^{0}\overline{D}^{0*}$ from Belle experiment, which demonstrate the reliability of our fitting. The fitting indicates that $Z$ is a non-vanishing value within error, which supports that $X(3872)$ has a compact short-distant core.</description>

      <title>Does the Sun have a Dark Disk?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sun is not quite a perfect sphere, and its oblateness, thought to be induced through its rotation, has been measured using optical observations of its radius. Its gravitational quadrupole moment can then be deduced using solar models, or through helioseismology, and it can also be determined from measurements of its gravitational effects on Mercury's orbit. The various assessments do not appear to agree, with the most complete and precise orbital assessments being in slight excess of other determinations. This may speak to the existence of a non-luminous disk or ring, where we also note evidence for a circumsolar dust ring within Mercury's orbit from the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) mission. Historically, too, a protoplanetary disk may have been key to reconciling the Sun's metallicity with its neutrino yield. The distribution of the non-luminous mass within Mercury's orbit can modify the relative size of the optical and orbital quadrupole moments in different ways. We develop how we can use these findings to limit the mass of a dark disk, ring, or halo in the immediate vicinity of the Sun, and we note how future observational studies of the inner solar system can not only refine these constraints but also help to identify and to assess the mass of its dark-matter component.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise measurement of the antineutrino spectra produced by isotope fission in reactors is of great significance for studying neutrino oscillations, refining nuclear databases, and addressing the reactor antineutrino anomaly. In this paper, we report a method that utilizes a feedforward neural network (FNN) model to decompose the prompt energy spectrum observed in a short-baseline reactor neutrino experiment and extract the antineutrino spectra produced by the fission of major isotopes such as $^{235}$U, $^{238}$U, $^{239}$Pu, and $^{241}$Pu in the nuclear reactor. We present two training strategies for the model and compare them with the traditional $\chi^2$ minimization method by applying them to the same set of pseudo-data corresponding to a total exposure of $(2.9\times 5\times 1800)~\rm{GW_{th}\cdot tonnes\cdot days}$. The results show that the FNN model not only converges faster and better during the fitting process but also achieves relative errors of less than 1\% in the $2-8$ MeV range in the extracted spectra, outperforming the $\chi^2$ minimization method. The feasibility and superiority of this method were validated in the study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a review and statistical analysis of the evidence supporting the existence of a cosmological constant in the early 1990s, before its discovery made with distant supernovae in 1998. The earlier evidence was derived from newly precise measurements of the Universe, including its mass density, the Hubble constant, the age of the oldest stars, the filamentary large-scale structure, and the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background. These measurements created tension for models assuming the cosmological constant was zero. This tension was alleviated by several insightful papers published before 1996, which proposed a cosmological constant that increased the expansion rate. Statistical analysis here shows that the probability of the cosmological constant being zero was demonstrably less than a few percent. Some models identified a best-fit value close to the modern estimate of Omega_Lambda ~ 0.7.</description>

      <title>Long-lived Sterile Neutrino Searches at Future Muon Colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the potential of studying sterile neutrinos at a future high-energy muon collider, where these particles can generate small active neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism and exhibit long-lived particle signatures. A Dirac sterile neutrino model with ${\rm U(1)}_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ symmetry is introduced, where the heavy right-handed neutrino ($N_R$) produces tiny active neutrino masses, and the light left-handed neutrino ($N_L$) naturally behaves as a long-lived particle. The ${\rm U(1)}_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge symmetry also enhances sterile neutrino pair production at a future high-energy muon collider. Using the displaced vertex method, the muon collider can search for heavy sterile neutrino, especially for $m_L&gt; m_W$. We find that a muon collider with $\sqrt{s} = 3~ (10)$ TeV and luminosity $L=1~(10)$ ab$^{-1}$ can probe $N_L$ masses of $m_L \in [100,~1500~(5000)]$ GeV and mixing angles $\theta_{\nu L} \in [10^{-13},~10^{-6}]$.</description>

Abstract: An analysis is presented based on models of the intrinsic transverse momentum (intrinsic $k_\mathrm{T}$) of partons in nucleons by studying the dilepton transverse momentum in Drell-Yan events. Using parameter tuning in event generators and existing data from fixed-target experiments and from hadron colliders, our investigation spans three orders of magnitude in center-of-mass energy and two orders of magnitude in dilepton invariant mass. The results show an energy-scaling behavior of the intrinsic $k_\mathrm{T}$ parameters, independent of the dilepton invariant mass at a given center-of-mass energy.</description>

      <title>Nature of X(3872) from recent BESIII data: Considering the universal feature of an S-wave threshold resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the recent data from the BESIII collaboration on the $X(3872)$ state in the $J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ and $D^0\bar{D}^0\pi^0$ decay channels. The quantum number and mass of the $X(3872)$ state allow us to exploit the universal feature of the very near-threshold $D\bar D^*$ scattering in the $S$ wave. The analysis of $J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ data and $D^0\bar{D}^0\pi^0$ data separately as well as the combined analysis of these data together, all support the conclusion that $X(3872)$ is an extremely weakly bound charm meson molecule.</description>

Abstract: Leptoquarks are known to generate a wide range of potentially observable phenomena, and have been searched for in different experiments. We show that the observed baryon asymmetry and neutrino mass scale can both be simultaneously produced in a model featuring scalar leptoquarks while avoiding existing experimental constraints and potentially leading to future observable signatures.</description>

      <title>New Physics effects with right-handed neutrinos in semileptonic decay $B_c^+ \to B_s \mu^+ \nu_{\mu}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the Standard Model with the general effective Hamiltonian for the quark level transition $c \to s \ell \nu$ with a complete set of four fermion operators including right-handed neutrinos. The current experimental measurements in charm decays are compatible with the Standard Model predictions and are used to constrain the new physics. With the available experimental data, we fit a $\chi^2$ function to get the best-fit values of the NP WCs. We investigate the impact of allowed new physics in the observables such as differential branching fraction, forward-backward asymmetry, lepton polarization asymmetry, and convexity parameter in the semileptonic decay $B_c^+ \to B_s \mu^+ \nu_{\mu}$. The different types of new physics scenarios have significant effects on these considered observables. The future experimental information of these observables can help to disentangle the structure of new physics.</description>

      <title>Point Cloud Deep Learning Methods for Particle Shower Reconstruction in the DHCAL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11208v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precision measurement of hadronic final states presents complex experimental challenges. The study explores the concept of a gaseous Digital Hadronic Calorimeter (DHCAL) and discusses the potential benefits of employing Graph Neural Network (GNN) methods for future collider experiments. In particular, we use GNN to describe calorimeter clusters as point clouds or a collection of data points representing a three-dimensional object in space. Combined with Graph Attention Transformers (GATs) and DeepSets algorithms, this results in an improvement over existing baseline techniques for particle identification and energy resolution. We discuss the challenges encountered in implementing GNN methods for energy measurement in digital calorimeters, e.g., the large variety of hadronic shower shapes and the hyper-parameter optimization. We also discuss the dependency of the measured performance on the angle of the incoming particle and on the detector granularity. Finally, we highlight potential future directions and applications of these techniques.</description>

      <title>Impact of resummation on the production and experimental bounds of scalar high-electric-charge objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A one-loop Dyson-Schwinger-like resummation scheme is applied to scalar High-Electric-Charge compact Objects (HECOs), extending previous work on spin-1/2 case. The electromagnetic interactions of HECOs are considered within the framework of strongly coupled scalar Quantun Electrodynamics. The resummation amounts to determining non-trivial ultraviolet (UV) fixed points, at which the effective Lagrangian, which will lead to the pertinent predictions on the cross sections, is computed. In contrast to the fermionic HECO case, in which the fixed point structure was determined solely by the interactions of the HECOs with the photon field, in the scalar case the existence of non-trivial UV fixed points requires the presence of additional strong self interactions among the HECOs. Our resummation scheme, which is notably different from a lattice strong-coupling approach, makes the computation of the pertinent scalar-HECO-production cross sections reliable, thus allowing revisiting the mass bounds obtained from searches for such objects in current or future colliders. Our MadGraph implementation of the results leads to enhanced (up to ~30%) lower bounds on the mass of scalar HECOs, as compared to those extracted from the tree-level processes typically used in LHC collider searches by ATLAS and MoEDAL experiments.</description>

      <title>Dark photons from dineutron decays in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we focus on the process in which two neutrons are allowed to transit into two dark photons ($nn \rightarrow VV$) via new Higgs-like scalar bosons. This process violates the baryon number ($\mathcal{B}$) by two units ($|\Delta \mathcal{B}| = 2$). Since neutron stars may contain a large number of neutrons, the effects of the $nn \rightarrow VV$ process can be greatly enhanced inside a neutron star. This process could result in non-trivial effects that are different from previous studies and can be explored through an astrophysical observation. Furthermore, because of this process, a large number of dark photons that may be dark matter candidates can be emitted from the interior of the neutron star. The energy spectrum of the emitted dark photons shows a particular pattern that can be uniquely determined by the mass and radius of the neutron star and can be explored in future experiments. The joint analysis of this process, which combines astrophysics and particle phenomenology, could provide an excellent opportunity for the study of the $\mathcal{B}$-violating effects.</description>

      <title>Photon self-interaction through gravitons and axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose to employ the concept of photon self-interaction for axion detection. In particular, we derive the interaction Hamiltonian for photons via axions in a ring cavity. We show that when the incoming photons are considered in plane-wave basis, the interaction vanishes. However, when the realistic case of photon wavepackets are assumed, a self-interaction whose strength is proportional to the size of the wavepacket and the cavity length exists. Under specific conditions, we find that the axion-mediated interaction dominates the gravitationally induced self-interaction. We discuss the implications of this setup for axion detection, focusing on the range of axion mass, $10^{-10}~\text{eV}&lt;m_a&lt;10^{-4}~\text{eV}$ for which the best accuracy of coupling constants is constrained in some cases to $g_{a\gamma \gamma}&gt; 9 \times 10^{-12}~ \text{GeV}^{-1}$.</description>

Abstract: That chiral symmetry is a crucial feature of the strong force was realized before the discovery of Quantum Chromodynamics. However, the full power it exerts on the structure of the nucleon became apparent only afterwards. We present a high-level and somewhat personal overview of its role in almost every aspect of proton structure, from its mass and spin to the asymmetry of its antimatter content and its strange quark content. The lessons learned from studying the proton are also vital with respect to the modern challenge of the nature of baryon excited states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the climate crisis intensifies, understanding the environmental impact of professional activities is paramount, especially in sectors with historically significant resource utilisation. This includes High Energy Physics (HEP) and related fields, which investigate the fundamental laws of our universe. As members of the young High Energy Physicists (yHEP) association, we investigate the CO$_2$-equivalent emissions generated by HEP-related research on a personalised per-researcher level, for four distinct categories: Experiments, tied to collaborations with substantial infrastructure; Institutional, representing the resource consumption of research institutes and universities; Computing, focussing on simulations and data analysis; and Travel, covering professional trips to conferences, etc. The findings are integrated into a tool for self-evaluation, the Know-your-footprint (Kyf) calculator, allowing the assessment of the personal and professional footprint and optionally sharing the data with the yHEP association. The study aims to heighten awareness, foster sustainability, and inspire the community to adopt more environmentally responsible research practices urgently.</description>

      <title>Evolution and detection of vector superradiant instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight vectors can extract energy and angular momentum from a Kerr black hole (BH) due to superradiant instability, resulting in the formation of a BH-condensate system. In this work, we carefully investigate the evolution of this system numerically with multiple superradiant modes. Simple formulas are obtained to estimate important timescales, maximum masses of different modes, as well as the BH mass and spin at various times. Due to the coexistence of modes with small frequency differences, the BH-condensate system emits gravitational waves with a unique beat signature, which could be directly observed by current and projected interferometers. Besides, the current BH spin-mass data from the binary BH merger events already exclude the vector mass in the range $5\times 10^{-15}\ \mathrm{eV} &lt;\mu&lt; 9\times 10^{-12}\ \mathrm{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Lattice simulations of axion-U(1) inflation: gravitational waves, magnetic fields, and scalar statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically study axion-U(1) inflation, focusing on the regime where the coupling between axions and gauge fields results in significant backreaction from the amplified gauge fields during inflation. These amplified gauge fields not only generate high-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), but also enhance spatial inhomogeneities in the axion field. GWs serve as key probe for constraining the coupling strength between the axion and gauge fields. We find that, when backreaction is important during inflation, the constraints on the coupling strength due to GW overproduction are relaxed compared to previous studies, in which backreaction matters only after inflation. Moreover, our results suggest that the probability density function (PDF) of axion fluctuations tends toward a Gaussian distribution even in cases where gauge field backreaction is important only after inflation. This aligns with previous studies where the same effect was observed for cases with strong backreaction during inflation. This finding can be crucial for future studies of primordial black hole (PBH) formation, which can further constrain the coupling strength. We also calculate the spectrum of the produced magnetic fields in this model and find that their strength is compatible with the observed lower limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of a gas-sampling Digital Hadronic Calorimeter (DHCAL), we explore the potential of using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for hadron energy reconstruction and Particle Identification (PID) in future collider experiments. For PID, we achieved classification efficiencies exceeding 50% for neutrons and pions, with notably higher efficiencies for kaons and protons. Protons exhibited the highest efficiency of 77%, followed by neutral kaons. The energy resolution for these hadrons is studied in the energy range of 1 -- 50 GeV, with a further investigation into the resolution as a function of the incoming particle's angle and readout granularity, focusing on charged pions. Compared to traditional analysis methods, our results indicate that improved performance can be achieved even with coarser detector granularity, potentially making future DHCAL systems more cost-effective.</description>

      <title>Chiral and isospin breaking in the two-flavor Schwinger Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Schwinger model with two massive fermions is a nontrivial theory for which no analytical solution is known. The strong coupling limit of the theory allows for different semiclassical approximations to extract properties of its low-lying spectrum. In particular, analytical results exist for the fermion condensate, the fermion mass dependence of the pseudoscalar meson mass or its decay constant. These approximations, nonetheless, are not able to quantitatively predict isospin breaking effects in the light spectrum, for example. In this paper we use lattice simulations to test various analytical predictions, and study isospin breaking effects from nondegenerate quark masses. We also introduce a low-energy effective field theory based on a nonlinear $\sigma$ model with a dilaton field, which leads to the correct fermion mass dependence of the pion mass, the correct $\sigma$-to-$\pi$ mass ratio and a prediction of the isospin breaking effects, which we test numerically.</description>

      <title>Extending Israel-Stewart theory: Causal bulk viscosity at large gradients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a class of relativistic fluid models for cold and dense matter with bulk viscosity, whose equilibrium equation of state is polytropic. These models reduce to Israel-Stewart theory for small values of the viscous stress $\Pi$. However, when $\Pi$ becomes comparable to the equilibrium pressure $P$, the evolution equations "adjust" to prevent the onset of far-from-equilibrium pathologies that would otherwise plague Israel-Stewart. Specifically, the equations of motion remain symmetric hyperbolic and causal at all times along any continuously differentiable flow, and across the whole thermodynamic state space. This means that, no matter how fast the fluid expands or contracts, the hydrodynamic equations are always well-behaved (away from singularities). The second law of thermodynamics is enforced exactly. Near equilibrium, these models can accommodate an arbitrarily complicated dependence of the bulk viscosity coefficient $\zeta$ on both density and temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The color-flavor locked phase of high density QCD admits non-Abelian vortices, that are superfluid vortices with confined color-magnetic fluxes. Vortex solutions were thus far constructed in an axially symmetric Ansatz with common vortex winding in the left- and right-handed diquark condensates. In this paper, we explore vortex solutions without any Ansatz. In addition to axially symmetric configurations known before, we find that the axial symmetry is broken in certain parameter regions; in one case a single vortex is split into two chiral non-Abelian vortices, i.e. vortices with winding only in the left or right-handed diquark condensate, and they are connected by one or two domain walls forming a non-Abelian vortex molecule. In the other case, a chiral non-Abelian vortex molecule is confined inside a domain wall elongated to spatial infinity.</description>

Abstract: A recent observation by Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) mounted on NASA's New Horizons yielded the most accurate measurement of the cosmic optical background (COB). The reported COB intensity is $11.16\pm 1.35$ $\mathrm{nW/m^2/sr}$ at a pivot wavelength $ \lambda_{piv} = 0.608 \, \mu\mathrm{m}$ observed in the range $( 0.4 \mu\mathrm{m} \lesssim \lambda \lesssim 0.9 \, \mu\mathrm{m} )$. After subtracting the measured intensity from the deep Hubble Space Telescope count, diffused galactic light, and scattered light from bright star foregrounds, an anomalous intensity $2.99 \pm 2.03~\mathrm{nW/m^2/sr}$ has been found. We considered radiatively decaying sterile neutrinos of mass scales keV and eV, as dark matter candidate and as dark radiation respectively, that could contribute to this anomalous reported intensity. Using this, we derive upper bounds on sterile-to-sterile and active-to-sterile transition magnetic dipole moments. We find that sterile neutrinos with mass of $\mathcal{O}(\rm keV)$ scale take values of the transition magnetic moment in the range $ 3\times 10^{-12}\,\mu_{B} - 10^{-9}\,\mu_{B}$, whereas for mass of $\mathcal{O}(\rm eV)$ scale the transition magnetic moment in the range $3\times 10^{-13}\,\mu_{B} - 10^{-12}\,\mu_{B}$, here $\mu_B$ is Bohr magneton.</description>

      <title>First law of de Sitter thermodynamics</title>

Abstract: The de Sitter state has a special symmetry: it is homogeneous, and its curvature is constant in space. Since all the points in the de Sitter space are equivalent, this state is described by local thermodynamics. This state has the local temperature $T=H/\pi$ (which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature), the local entropy density, the local energy density, and also the local gravitational degrees of freedom -- the scalar curvature ${\cal R}$ and the effective gravitational coupling $K$. On the other hand, there is the cosmological horizon, which can be also characterized by the thermodynamic relations. We consider the connections between the local thermodynamics and the thermodynamics of the cosmological horizon. In particular, there is the holographic connection between the entropy density integrated over the Hubble volume and the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of the horizon, $S_{\rm volume}=S_{\rm horizon}=A/4G$. We also consider the first law of thermodynamics in these two approaches. In the local thermodynamics, on the one hand, the first law is valid for an arbitrary volume $V$ of de Sitter space. On the other hand, the first law is also applicable to the thermodynamics of the horizon. In both cases, the temperature is the same. This consideration is extended to the contracting de Sitter with its negative entropy, $S_{\rm volume}=S_{\rm horizon}=-A/4G$.</description>
