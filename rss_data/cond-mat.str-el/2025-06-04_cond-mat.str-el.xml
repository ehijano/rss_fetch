      <title>Anyon superconductivity and plateau transitions in doped fractional quantum anomalous Hall insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments reported evidence of superconductivity and re-entrant integer quantum anomalous Hall (RIQAH) insulator upon doping the $\nu_e = 2/3$ fractional quantum anomalous Hall states (FQAH) in twisted MoTe${}_2$, separated by narrow resistive regions. Anyons of a FQAH generally have a finite effective mass, and when described by anyon-flux composite fermions (CF), experience statistical magnetic fields with a commensurate filling. Here, we show that most of the experimental observations can be explained by invoking the effects of disorder on the Landau-Hofstadter bands of CFs. In particular, by making minimal assumptions about the anyon energetics and dispersion, we show that doping anyons drives plateau transitions of CFs into integer quantum Hall states, which physically corresponds to either to a superconductor or to a RIQAH phase. We develop a dictionary that allows us to infer the response in these phases and the critical regions from the knowledge of the response functions of the plateau transitions. In particular, this allows us to relate the superfluid stiffness of the superconductor to the polarizability of CFs. As a first step towards a quantitative understanding, we borrow results from the celebrated integer quantum Hall plateau transitions to make quantitative prediction for the critical behavior of the superfluid stiffness, longitudinal and Hall conductivity, and response to out-of-plane magnetic field, all of which agree reasonably well with the experimental observations. Our results provide strong support for anyon superconductivity being the mechanism for the observed superconductor in the vicinity of the $\nu_e = 2/3$ FQAH insulator.</description>

      <title>Classical spin liquids from frustrated Ising models in hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic Ising models on frustrated lattices can realize classical spin liquids, with highly degenerate ground states and, possibly, fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. Motivated by the recent interest in many-body system in negatively curved space, we study hyperbolic frustrated Ising models. Specifically, we consider nearest-neighbor Ising models on tesselations with odd-length loops in two-dimensional hyperbolic space. For finite systems with open boundaries we determine the ground-state degeneracy exactly, and we perform extensive finite-temperature Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain thermodynamic data as well as correlation functions. We show that the shape of the boundary, constituting an extensive part of the system, can be used to control low-energy states: Depending on the boundary, we find ordered or disordered ground states. Our results demonstrate how geometric frustration acts in curved space to produce classical spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Anyon delocalization transitions out of a disordered FQAH insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the experimental discovery of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect, we develop a theory of doping-induced transitions out of the $\nu = 2/3$ lattice Jain state in the presence of quenched disorder. We show that disorder strongly affects the evolution into the conducting phases described in our previous work. The delocalization of charge $2/3$ anyons leads to a chiral topological superconductor through a direct second order transition for a smooth random potential with long wavelength modulations. The longitudinal resistance has a universal peak at the associated quantum critical point. For short wavelength disorder, this transition generically splits into three distinct ones with intermediate insulating topological phases. If instead, the charge $1/3$ anyon delocalizes, then at low doping the result is a Reentrant Integer Quantum Hall state with $\rho_{xy} = h/e^2$. At higher doping this undergoes a second transition to a Fermi liquid metal. We show that this framework provides a plausible explanation for the complex phase diagram recently observed in twisted MoTe$_2$ near $\nu = 2/3$ and discuss future experiments that can test our theory in more detail.</description>

      <title>Line shapes in time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy explored by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is a powerful technique for investigating the dynamics of excited carriers in quantum materials. Typically, data analysis proceeds via the inspection of time distribution curves (TDCs), which represent the time-dependent photoemission intensity in a region of interest -- often chosen somewhat arbitrarily -- in energy-momentum space. Here, we employ $k$-means, an unsupervised machine learning technique, to systematically investigate trends in TDC line shape for quasi-free-standing monolayer graphene and for a simple analytical model. Our analysis reveals how finite energy and time resolution can affect the TDC line shape. We discuss how this can be taken into account in a quantitative analysis, and under what conditions the time-dependent photoemission intensity after laser excitation can be approximated by a simple exponential decay.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium transport through the Hubbard dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a computationally efficient approach to study the time- and energy-resolved spectral properties of a two-site Hubbard model using the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism. By employing the iterative generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz ($i$GKBA) within a time-linear framework, we avoid the computational cost of solving the full two-time Kadanoff-Baym equations. Spectral information is extracted by coupling the system to multiple narrow-band leads, establishing a direct analogy to photoemission experiments. Our results reveal correlation-induced shifts and broadenings of spectral features, along with a suppression of transient current oscillations. This approach provides a promising avenue for analyzing correlated electron dynamics in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-chain multichannel Kondo model via image impurity boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the signature observables for the electronic multichannel Kondo model is the impurity entropy, which was claimed to be found in $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg chain with open boundary condition (OBC) and periodic boundary condition (PBC), respectively for the one-channel and two-channel case. However, it is not clear how to generalize OBC and PBC in Heisenberg chains to find the multichannel Kondo impurity entropy with more than two channels. In this paper, we demonstrate that the correct boundary condition for realizing multichannel Kondo physics in Heisenberg chains is the image impurity boundary condition (IIBC), which yields the expected impurity entropy, $\ln[(\sqrt{5}+1)/2]$ for the three-channel case and $\ln\sqrt{3}$ for the four-channel case. Moreover, the IIBC reduces to OBC for the one-channel case and to PBC for the two-channel case. With IIBC, the finite-size scaling of the impurity entropy and the total spin both match the finite-temperature correction in the electronic multichannel Kondo model. Additionally, we show that the XXZ anisotropy reduces the impurity entropy through a power law of the effective Luttinger liquid parameter.</description>

      <title>Identification of gapless phases by squaring a twist operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general necessary condition for a spin chain with SO(3) spin-rotation symmetry to be gapped. Specifically, we prove that the ground state(s) of an SO(3)-symmetric gapped spin chain must be spin singlet(s), and the expectation value of the square of a twist operator asymptotically approaches unity in the thermodynamic limit, where finite-size corrections are inversely proportional to the square root of the system size. This theorem provides (i) supporting evidence for various conjectured gapped phases, and (ii) a sufficient criterion for identifying gapless spin chains. We verify our theorem by numerical simulations for a variety of spin models and show that it offers a novel efficient way to identify gapless phases in spin chains with spin-rotation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Electronic structures and magnetism in van der Waals flat-band material Ni$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of magnetism in two-dimensional materials has garnered significant interest, driven by fundamental investigations into low-dimensional magnetic phenomena and their potential for applications in spintronic devices. Through dynamical mean-field theory calculations, we demonstrate that Ni$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$ exhibits flat-band characteristics resulting from the geometric frustration of its layered triangular lattice. These flat bands are further renormalized due to moderate electronic correlation. Our calculations reveal that the magnetic order of Ni atoms is significantly influenced by both the Coulomb interaction and Hund's coupling, indicating that the physics of Ni atoms is situated in an intermediate region between Hundness and Mottness. Additionally, our results show that Ni atoms experience significant spin fluctuations in their local moments, maintaining paramagnetism at low temperatures. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of vacancies, finding a substantial suppression of the density of states at the Fermi level. The physical mechanisms uncovered by our study provide a comprehensive understanding of the novel properties exhibited by this type of material.</description>

      <title>Spatial correlations of charge density wave order across the transition in 2H-NbSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge density waves (CDWs) involve coupled amplitude and phase degrees of freedom, but direct access to local amplitude correlations remains experimentally challenging. Here, we report cryogenic four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) measurements of CDW ordering in 2H-NbSe2, enabled by liquid helium-based cooling down to 20 K. By mapping the spatial distribution of CDW superlattice intensities at nanometer-scale resolution and analyzing their autocorrelations, we extract the temperature-dependent correlation length associated with the local amplitude of the CDW order parameter, independent of global phase coherence. Our results reveal that weak short-range amplitude correlations persist above the transition temperature, and grow significantly upon cooling, reaching approximately 150 nm at 20 K. These findings demonstrate clear deviations from mean-field expectations and establish 4D-STEM as a powerful tool for probing spatially inhomogeneous electronic order in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-protected electronic metastability in an optically driven cuprate ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically excited quantum materials exhibit nonequilibrium states with remarkable emergent properties, but these phenomena are usually transient, decaying on picosecond timescales and limiting practical applications. Advancing the design and control of nonequilibrium phases requires the development of targeted strategies to achieve long-lived, metastable phases. Here, we report the discovery of symmetry-protected electronic metastability in the model cuprate ladder Sr$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$. Using femtosecond resonant x-ray scattering and spectroscopy, we show that this metastability is driven by a transfer of holes from chain-like charge reservoirs into the ladders. This ultrafast charge redistribution arises from the optical dressing and activation of a hopping pathway that is forbidden by symmetry at equilibrium. Relaxation back to the ground state is hence suppressed after the pump coherence dissipates. Our findings highlight how dressing materials with electromagnetic fields can dynamically activate terms in the electronic Hamiltonian, and provide a rational design strategy for nonequilibrium phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Topology meets symmetry breaking: Hidden order, intrinsically gapless topological states and finite-temperature topological transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of phase transitions driven by topological defects, the classification of phases of matter has been significantly extended beyond Ginzburg and Landau's paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB). In particular, intrinsic and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) orders have been discovered in (mostly gapped) quantum many-body ground states. However, these are commonly viewed as zero-temperature phenomena, and their robustness in a gapless ground state or against thermal fluctuations remains challenging to tackle. Here we introduce an explicit construction for SPT-type states with hidden order associated with SSB: They feature (quasi) long-range correlations along appropriate edges, but short-range order in the bulk; ground state degeneracy associated with SSB; and non-local string order in the bulk. We apply our construction to predict two types of finite-temperature SPT transitions, in the Ising and BKT class respectively, where the usual signs of criticality appear despite the absence of a diverging correlation length in the bulk. While the state featuring hidden Ising order is gapped, the other SPT state associated with the BKT-SPT transition has hidden $U(1)$, or XY-order and constitutes an intrinsically gapless SPT state, associated with a gapless Goldstone mode. Specifically, in this work we discuss spins with global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $U(1)$ symmetry coupled to link variables constituting a loop gas model. By mapping this system to an Ising-gauge theory, we demonstrate that one of the SPT phases we construct corresponds to the Higgs-SPT phase at $T=0$ -- which we show here to remain stable at finite temperature. Our work paves the way for a more systematic search for hidden order SPT phases, including in gapless systems, and raises the question if a natural (finite-$T$) spin liquid candidate exists that realizes hidden order in the Higgs-SPT class.</description>

      <title>Anomalous magnetic response in the Au-Al-Gd 1/1 quasicrystal approximant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic response of the Tsai-type 1/1 Au-Al-Gd approximant crystals (ACs) was quantitatively investigated in terms of the magnetic entropy change ($\Delta S_{M}$) for different magnetic ground states. A comprehensive $\Delta S_{M}$ map over a wide electron concentration range has been established, demonstrating the detailed variation of $\Delta S_{M}$ across the entire magnetic phase diagram in the Tsai-type 1/1 ACs. Near the boundaries of the ferromagnetic (FM) phase, a clear deviation from the mean-field theory (MFT) was observed in both the Curie temperature ($T_{C}$) and magnetic field ($H$) dependences of the maximum magnetic entropy change ($\Delta S_{M}^{max}$). Contrary to general expectations, a high $\Delta S_{M}^{max}$ (7.2 J/K mol-Gd under a 5 T field variation), even comparable to those of candidate materials for low-temperature magnetic refrigeration, was obtained within the antiferromagnetic (AFM) region near the FM / AFM phase boundary. The unexpected enhancement of $\Delta S_{M}^{max}$ toward the AFM region under high magnetic fields indicates an anomalous magnetic response in the present Tsai-type 1/1 AC, which is presumably associated with the breakdown of the MFT. The present finding suggests that tuning the magnetic ground state across the phase boundary is an effective strategy to enhance $\Delta S_{M}$, even in general rare-earth intermetallic compounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation on quantum computers is strongly constrained by gate counts, motivating techniques to reduce circuit depths. While tensor networks are natural competitors to quantum computers, we instead leverage them to support circuit design, with datasets of tensor networks enabling a unitary synthesis inspired by quantum machine learning. For a target simulation in the thermodynamic limit, translation invariance is exploited to significantly reduce the optimization complexity, avoiding a scaling with system size. Our approach finds circuits to efficiently prepare ground states, and perform time evolution on both infinite and finite systems with substantially lower gate depths than conventional Trotterized methods. In addition to reducing CNOT depths, we motivate similar utility for fault-tolerant quantum algorithms, with a demonstrated $5.2\times$ reduction in $T$-count to realize $e^{-iHt}$. The key output of our approach is the optimized unit-cell of a translation invariant circuit. This provides an advantage for Hamiltonian simulation of finite, yet arbitrarily large, systems on real quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlation beyond entanglement: Holographic discord and multipartite generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While entanglement is a cornerstone of quantum theory and holography, quantum correlations arising from superposition, such as quantum discord, offer a broader perspective that has remained largely unexplored in holography. We construct gravity duals of quantum discord and classical correlation. In both holographic systems and Haar random states, discord exceeds entanglement, revealing an additional quantum correlation linked to the Markov gap and non-distillable entanglement, suggesting holographic states are intrinsically non-bipartite. In black hole setups, discord can increase despite decoherence and persists beyond the sudden death of distillable entanglement. Motivated by the holographic formula, we define reflected discord -- an optimization-free boundary quantity based on reflected entropy -- which remains effective even outside the holographic regime. We also propose several multipartite generalizations of discord, including a holography-inspired one based on multi-entropy. These results provide new tools for quantifying quantum correlations beyond entanglement in strongly coupled many-body systems and offer a novel approach to multipartite correlation measures.</description>

      <title>Reentrant localization in a quasiperiodic chain with correlated hopping sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic systems are known to exhibit localization transitions in low dimensions, wherein all electronic states become localized beyond a critical disorder strength. Interestingly, recent studies have uncovered a reentrant localization (RL) phenomenon: upon further increasing the quasiperiodic disorder strength beyond the localization threshold, a subset of previously localized states can become delocalized again within a specific parameter window. While RL transitions have been primarily explored in systems with simple periodic modulations, such as dimerized or long-range hopping integrals, the impact of more intricate or correlated hopping structures on RL behavior remains largely elusive. In this work, we investigate the localization behavior in a one-dimensional lattice featuring staggered, correlated on-site potentials following the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model, along with off-diagonal hopping modulations structured according to quasiperiodic Fibonacci and Bronze Mean sequences. By systematically analyzing the fractal dimension, inverse participation ratio, and normalized participation ratio, we demonstrate the occurrence of RL transitions induced purely by the interplay between quasiperiodic on-site disorder and correlated hopping. Our findings highlight the crucial role of underlying structural correlations in governing localization-delocalization transitions in low-dimensional quasiperiodic systems, where the correlated disorder manifests in both diagonal and off-diagonal terms.</description>

      <title>Integrals of motion as slow modes in dissipative many-body operator dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02970v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Lindbladian operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems with one or more integrals of motion (IOM), subject to weak local dissipation. We demonstrate that IOMs with small support become slow modes of these dynamics, in the sense that their Frobenius norm decays more slowly compared to generic operators. As a result, the eigenoperators of such Lindbladians with slowest decay rates have a large overlap with the IOMs of the underlying Hamiltonian. We demonstrate this correspondence between slow modes and IOMs numerically for a number of many-body models, and further corroborate it with perturbative arguments. These results open up a new method for the identification of IOMs, and provide insights into the dissipative many-body dynamics.</description>

Abstract: While experimental advancements continue to expand the capabilities to control and probe non-equilibrium quantum matter at an unprecedented level, the numerical simulation of the dynamics of correlated quantum systems remains a pivotal challenge - especially in intermediate spatial dimensions. Neural quantum states are emerging as a new computational tool to investigate the time evolution of many-body quantum systems in previously inaccessible regimes. We review the recent progress in the field with a focus on the different time propagation methods, an overview of the reported applications, and a discussion of the major current challenges.</description>

Abstract: Square lattice Hubbard models with tunable hopping ratio $t'/t$ are highly promising for realizing a variety of quantum phases and for shedding light on key puzzles in correlated quantum materials, including higher-temperature superconductivity. We show that twisted square lattice homo-bilayers generically offer such tunability when the flat bands originate from the corner of the Brillouin zone. We reveal an emergent symmetry at low twist-angles, absent in single layers, that necessitates the vanishing of nearest neighbor hopping ($t=0$). This symmetry can be lifted by an inter-layer displacement field or by an in-plane magnetic field, introducing tunable $t$ and anisotropy, allowing access to a wide range of $t'/t$ ratios for correlated electrons on a moir\'e square lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incompressible insulating phases of electronic systems at partial filling of a lattice are often associated with charge ordering that breaks lattice symmetry. The resulting phases have an enlarged unit cell with an effective integer filling. Here we explore the possibility of insulating states - which we dub "Quantum Charge Liquids" (QCL) - at partial lattice filling that preserve lattice translation symmetry. Such QCL phases must necessarily either have gapped fractionally charged excitations and associated topological order or have gapless neutral excitations. We establish some general constraints on gapped fermionic QCL phases that restrict the nature of their topological order. We prove a number of results on the minimal topological order that is consistent with the lattice filling. In particular we show that at rational fillings $\nu = p/q$ with $q$ an even integer the minimal ground state degeneracy on a torus of the fermionic QCL is $4q^2$, 4 times larger than that of the bosonic QCL at the same filling. We comment on models and physical systems which may host fermionic QCL phases and discuss the phenomenology of these phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a deformation of the 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory that preserves the non-invertible Wegner duality symmetry at the self-dual point. We identify a frustration-free point along this deformation where there are nine exactly degenerate ground states (on a periodic cubic lattice) even at finite volume. One of these ground states is a trivial product state and the rest are the topologically-ordered ground states of the 3+1d toric code. We also prove that the frustration-free point is gapped in the thermodynamic limit. Our model, therefore, realizes a gapped phase with spontaneously broken Wegner duality symmetry. Furthermore, by imposing the Gauss law constraints energetically, all the above features can be realized on a tensor product Hilbert space. Finally, we discuss a generalization of this deformation to the 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_N$ gauge theory and conjecture the possible phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Density Matrix Renormalization Group simulations of the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard chain implementing the full SU(N) symmetry via Semi-Standard Young Tableaux and Unitary Group Subduction Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed an efficient method for performing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard chain with open boundary conditions, fully leveraging the SU(N) symmetry of the problem. This method extends a previously developed approach for the SU(N) Heisenberg model and relies on the systematic use of the semi-standard Young tableaux (SSYT) basis in a DMRG algorithm `a la White. Specifically, the method aligns the site-by-site growth process of the infinite-size part of the DMRG, in its original formulation, with the site-by-site construction of the SSYT (or Gelfand-like) basis, based on the chain of unitary subgroups $U(1)\subset U(2) \subset U(3) \subset U(4)\cdots $. We give special emphasis to the calculation of the symmetry-resolved reduced matrix elements of the hopping terms between the left and the right block, which makes direct use of the basis of SSYT and of the Gelfand-Tsetlin coefficients, offering a computational advantage in scaling with N compared to alternative methods that rely on summing over Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Focusing on the model with homogeneous hopping between nearest neighbors, we have calculated the ground state energy as a function of U, i.e the atom-atom interaction amplitude, up to N=6 for filling 1/N (one particle per site in average), and for one atom (resp. hole) away from filling 1/N, alllowing us to compute the charge gaps, and to estimate in the thermodynamical limit, the critical value $U_c$, separating the Mott insulator from the metallic phase. Central charges c are extracted from the entanglement entropy using the Calabrese-Cardy formula, and are consistent with the theoretical predictions: c=N-1, expected from the $SU(N)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten CFTs in the spin sector for the Mott phase, and c=N in the metallic phase, reflecting the presence of one additional (charge) gapless critical mode.</description>

      <title>Fractional Chern Insulator and Quantum Anomalous Hall Crystal in Twisted MoTe$_2$</title>

Abstract: Recent experimental advances have uncovered fractional Chern insulators in twisted MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) systems, posing significant theoretical challenges in understanding the interaction effects and correlated topological phases. Here, we construct a realistic moir\'e lattice model tailored for tMoTe$_2$ and conduct investigations using state-of-the-art tensor-network methods. Our ground-state calculations reveal a rich array of interaction- and filling-dependent phases, including the FCI, Chern insulator, and generalized Wigner crystal, etc., explaining recent experimental observations. Moreover, we reveal quantum anomalous Hall crystals exhibiting integer Hall conductivity at fractional moir\'e unit cell fillings, which opens new avenues for experimental exploration in tMoTe$_2$. In the FCI phase, dynamical simulations reveal a single-particle continuum with a finite charge gap, indicating the presence of fractional charge excitations. Moreover, our finite-temperature calculations determine the characteristic temperatures for charge activation and ferromagnetic (FM) transitions, consistent with experiments. We find that the charge gap is significantly larger than the energy scales of both thermal activation and FM transitions, explaining recent experimental observations. Overall, by integrating ground-state, finite-temperature, and dynamical tensor-network calculations on the real-space model, we establish a theoretical framework for understanding and exploring correlated topological phases in tMoTe$_2$ and related systems.</description>

Abstract: The phase diagrams of arbitrary number $N_{\text{w}}$ of diagonally and perpendicularly coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger wires have been identified. The diagonally coupled wires have rich topological phase diagrams exhibiting insulating phases with winding numbers $0\leq w \leq N_{\text{w}}$ and topological critical lines restricted by the reflection mirror symmetry. They exhibit completely flat bands at specific values of model parameters indicated by lines in the phase diagrams. Even number of perpendicularly coupled wires exhibit either gapless or trivial topological phases. Odd number of perpendicularly coupled wires additionally exhibit nontrivial topological phases with winding number $w=1$. Due to the mirror reflection symmetry, their gapless regions can be topologically nontrivial. They reveal coherent confined correlations in the odd indexed wires with strong wire-wire coupling away from the gapless regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lieb-Mattis theorem orders the lowest-energy states of total spin $s$ of a system of $P$ interacting fermions. We generalize these predictions to fermionic mixtures of $P$ particles with more than $N=2$ spinor components/species in the thermodynamic limit $P\to\infty$. The lowest-energy state inside each permutation symmetry sector $h$, arising in the $P$-fold tensor product decomposition, is well approximated by a U$(N)$ coherent (quasi-classical, variational) state, specially in the limit $P\to\infty$. In particular, the ground state of the system belongs the most symmetric (dominant Young tableau $h_0$) configuration. We exemplify our construction with the $N=3$ level Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, with a previous motivation on pairing correlations and U$(N)$-invariant quantum Hall ferromagnets. In the limit $P\to\infty$, each lowest-energy state within each permutation symmetry sector $h$ undergoes a quantum phase transition for a critical value $\lambda_c(h)$ of the exchange coupling constant $\lambda$, depending on $h$. This generalizes standard quantum phase transitions and their phase diagrams corresponding to the ground state belonging to the most symmetric sector $h_0$.</description>

      <title>The SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard Model on two sites: Bethe Ansatz solution and Quantum Phase Transition of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model in the large-N limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) on two sites, where N is the number of flavors of each fermion, corresponds to an exactly solvable two-level many-boson model that Richardson [J. Math. Phys. 9, 1327 (1968)] analytically solved long ago. We express the Bethe ansatz solutions as a function of the physical parameters of the SU(N) FHM, and recast its eigenvalues and eigenstates in terms of the Richardson pair energies and creation operators. In this context, the connection with the well-studied Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model, known as equivalent to the Richardson model, is established and serves as a guideline to the prediction of some N-body physics phenomena in the two-site SU(N) FHM with N particles. In particular, the LMG second-order quantum phase transition (QPT) is shown to occur in the SU(N) FHM for an attractive density-density interaction U equal to U_c=-1/(2N), in units of the (absolute value of the) tunneling amplitude between the two sites. We show the finite-size energies, the gap, and the kinetic energy, which all reveal the transition, as a function of U for values of N from N = 3 to N = 36, suggesting that the QPT could be experimentally achieved with current technologies involving SU(N) ultracold atoms or molecules. Finally, we show the entanglement entropy of the first site with respect to the second, and it scales like N at the transition, in contrast with several two-mode models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a local decoder for the 2D toric code using ideas from the hierarchical classical cellular automata of Tsirelson and G\'acs. Our decoder is a circuit of strictly local quantum operations preserving a logical state for exponential time in the presence of circuit-level noise without the need for non-local classical computation or communication. Our construction is not translation invariant in spacetime, but can be made time-translation invariant in 3D with stacks of 2D toric codes. This solves the open problem of constructing a local topological quantum memory below four dimensions.</description>

      <title>V. J. Emery and P. W. Anderson's views and related issues regarding the basics of cuprates: a re-look</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1991, V. J. Emery in his important review article entitled "Some aspects of the theory of high temperature superconductors"\cite{emery1} argued against the Zhang-Rice reduction of three-band to an effective one-band model. In his words "...therefore it seems that the simple $t-J$ model does not account for the properties of high temperature superconductors". Over approximately 35 years after the initial debates\cite{debates} much has happened in the field pertaining to this topic. Even though it is one of the most discussed issue, a comprehensive account and the required resolution are lacking. Connected to the debate over one-band versus three-band models is another discussion: the one-component versus two-component model for cuprates. The two-component model is most strongly advocated by Barzykin and Pines\cite{bp}. In this article the author attempts a perspective and a re-look on some of these issues. After an analysis of a large body of literature, author finds that V. J. Emery's criticism of the Zhang-Rice reduction was correct. Many central experimental features of cuprates cannot be rationalized within the one-band model, and Johnston-Nakano scaling is one such example. Other examples are also discussed. Author introduces a simple-minded toy model to illustrate the core issues involved.</description>
