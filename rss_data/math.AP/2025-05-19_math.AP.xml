      <title>Sharp asymptotics for the KPP equation with some front-like initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study sharp asymptotics for the KPP equation under front-like initial data of types $\mathcal{O}(x^{k+1}e^{-\lambda_*x})$ and $\mathcal{O}(x^{\boldsymbol{\nu}} e^{-\lambda x})$ as $x$ tends to infinity, with $0&lt;\lambda&lt;\lambda_*=\sqrt{f'(0)}$ and $k, \boldsymbol{\nu}\in\mathbb{R}$. For the former type initial data, we prove that the position of the level sets is asymptotically $c_*t+\frac{k}{2\lambda_*}\ln t+\mathcal{O}(1)$ if $k&gt;-3$, while $c_*t-\frac{3}{2\lambda_*}\ln t+\frac{1}{\lambda_*}\ln\ln t+\mathcal{O}(1)$ if $k=-3$, where $c_*=2\lambda_*$. In contrast, we retrieve Bramson's $o(1)$ result if $k&lt; -3$. Regarding the latter type initial data, we show that the level sets behave asymptotically like $ct+\frac{\boldsymbol{\nu}}{\lambda}\ln t$ up to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ error in general setting, with $c=\lambda+f'(0)/\lambda$. Under the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ results, the "convergence along level sets" results are also demonstrated. Moreover, we further refine the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ results above to the "convergence to a traveling wave" results provided that initial data decay like certain multiple of the above rates, which confirms, for general KPP nonlinearities, a conjecture in the probabilistic work of Berestycki-Brunet-Harris-Roberts (Commun. Math. Phys. 349, 857-893, 2017).</description>

      <title>Existence of solutions to the semilinear damped wave equation with non-$L^2$ slowly decaying data : polynomial nonlinearity case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem of the semilinear damped wave equation with polynomial nonlinearity, and establish the local and global existence of the solution for slowly decaying initial data not belonging to $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ in general. Our approach is based on the $L^p$-$L^q$ estimates of linear solutions and the fractional Leibniz rule in suitable homogeneous Besov spaces.</description>

      <title>Regularity estimates for fully nonlinear dead-core problems with a Hamiltonian Term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a problem involving fully nonlinear elliptic operators with Hamiltonian, which can present a singularity or degenerate as the gradient approaches the origin. The model studied here, allows the appearance of plateau zones, i.e. unknown regions of the domain in which the non-negative solutions vanishes. We show an improvement in regularity along the free boundary of the problem, and with some hypotheses on the exponents of the equation we proved the optimality of the growth rate with the help of the non-degeneracy also obtained here. In addition, some more applications of the growth results on the free boundary are obtained, such as: the positivity of solutions and also information on the Hausdorff measure of the boundary of the coincidence set.</description>

      <title>A sufficient condition for absence of mass quantization in chemotaxis system with local sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze blowup solutions in infinite time of the Neumann boundary value problem for the fully parabolic chemotaxis system with local sensing: \begin{equation*} \begin{cases}
  u_t = \Delta(e^{-v}u)\qquad &amp;\mathrm{in}\ \Omega \times (0,\infty),
  v_t = \Delta v -v + u\qquad &amp;\mathrm{in}\ \Omega \times (0,\infty), \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $\Omega$ is a ball in two-dimensional space and with nonnegative radially symmetric initial data. In the case of the Keller--Segel system which has a similar mathematical structure with our system, it was shown that the solutions blow up in finite time if and only if $L\log L$ for the first component $u$ diverges in finite time. On the other hand, focusing on the variational structure induced by a signal-dependent motility function $e^{-v}$, we show that an unboundedness of $\int_\Omega e^v dx$ for the second component $v$ gives rise to blowup solutions in infinite time under the assumption of radial symmetry. Moreover we prove mass concentration phenomena at the origin. It is shown that the radially symmetric solutions of our system develop a singularity like a Dirac delta function in infinite time. Here we investigate the weight of this singularity. Consequently it is shown that mass quantization may not occur; that is, the weight of the singularity can exceed $8\pi$ under the assumption of a uniform-in-time lower bound for the Lyapunov functional. This type of behavior cannot be observed in the Keller--Segel system.</description>

      <title>On the propagation of high regularity for the logarithmic Schr{\"o}dinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate both the instantaneous loss and the persistence of high regularity for the one-dimensional logarithmic Schr{\"o}dinger equation in symmetric domains under various boundary conditions. We show that for a broad class of odd initial data, the $H^s$-norm of solutions exhibits instantaneous blow-up for all $s &gt; 7/2 $. Conversely, we establish that $H^3$-regularity is preserved for solutions that are odd with first-order cancellation, non-vanishing behavior away from the origin and Neumann boundary conditions on symmetric bounded domains. These theoretical results are further supported and illustrated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Boundary Stabilization of Quasilinear Parabolic PDEs that Blow Up in Open Loop for Arbitrarily Small Initial Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10935v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for stabilization, with an estimate of the region of attraction, of quasilinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) that exhibit finite-time blow-up phenomena when null boundary inputs are imposed. Using Neumann-type boundary controllers, which are cubic polynomials in boundary measurements, we ensure L2 exponential stability of the origin with an estimate of the region of attraction, boundedness and exponential decay towards zero of the state's max norm, well-posedness, as well as positivity of solutions starting from positive initial conditions. Unlike existing methods, our approach handles nonlinear state-dependent diffusion, convection, and reaction terms. In many cases, our estimate of the size of the region of attraction is shown to expand unboundedly as diffusion increases. Our controllers can be implemented as Neumann, Dirichlet, or mixed-type boundary conditions. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of our approach in preventing finite-time blow up.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convexity of solutions to boundary value problems for fully nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations (such as real or complex $k$-Hessian equations) is a challenging topic. In this paper, we establish the power convexity of solutions to the Dirichlet problem for the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation on bounded, smooth, strictly convex domain in $\mathbb{C}^2$. Our approach is based on the constant rank theorem and the deformation process.</description>

      <title>Remarks on criticality theory for Schr\"odinger operators and its application to wave equations with potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give an alternative perspective of the criticality theory for (nonnegative) Schr\"odinger operators. Schr\"odinger operator $S=-\Delta+V$ is classified as subcritical/critical in terms of the existence/nonexistence of a positive Green function for the associated elliptic equation $Su=f$. Such a property strongly affects to the large-time behavior of solutions to the parabolic equation $\partial_tv+Sv=0$. In this paper, we propose a remarkable quantity in terms of the structure of Hilbert lattices, which keeps some important properties including the notion of criticality theory. As an application, we study the large-time behavior of solutions to the hyperbolic equation $\partial_t^2w+Sw=0$.</description>

      <title>Extremals for Poincar\'e-Sobolev sharp constants in Steiner symmetric sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove existence of minimizers for the sharp Poincar\'e-Sobolev constant in general Steiner symmetric sets, in the subcritical and superhomogeneous regime. The sets considered are not necessarily bounded, thus the relevant embeddings may suffer from a lack of compactness. We prove existence by means of an elementary compactness method. We also prove an exponential decay at infinity for minimizers, showing that in the case of Steiner symmetric sets the relevant estimates only depend on the underlying geometry. Finally, we illustrate the optimality of the existence result, by means of some examples.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Love waves in linear elastic isotropic Cosserat materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of Love waves in an isotropic half-space modelled as a linear {elastic isotropic} Cosserat material. To this aim, we show that a method commonly used to study Rayleigh wave propagation is also applicable to the analysis of Love wave propagation. This approach is based on the explicit solution of an algebraic Riccati equation, which operates independently of the traditional Stroh formalism. The method provides a straightforward numerical algorithm to determine the wave amplitudes and speed{s}. Beyond its numerical simplicity, the method guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a subsonic wave speed, addressing a problem that remains unresolved in most Cosserat solids generalised {continua} theories. Although often overlooked, proving the existence of an admissible solution is, in fact, the key point that validates or invalidates the entire analytical approach used to derive the equation determining the wave speed. Interestingly, the Love waves does not need the artificial introduction of a surface layer.</description>

Abstract: We study the spectral properties of a Schr\"odinger operator, in presence of a confining potential given by the distance squared from a fixed compact potential well. We prove continuity estimates on both the eigenvalues and the eigenstates, lower bounds on the ground state energy, regularity and integrability properties of eigenstates. We also get explicit decay estimates at infinity, by means of elementary nonlinear methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a general compressible MHD system, where the magnetic field propagates in a heterogeneous medium. Using suitable penalization in terms of the transport coefficients we perform several singular limits. As a result we obtain:
  1. A rigorous justification of physically grounded boundary conditions for the compressible MHD system on a bounded domain.
  2. Existence of weak solutions for arbitrary finite energy initial data in the situation the Maxwell induction equation holds also outside the fluid domain.
  3. A suitable theoretical platform for numerical experiments on domains with geometrically complicated boundaries.</description>

      <title>Global Regularity to the liquid crystal flows of Q-tensor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a forced incompressible Navier-Stokes equation coupled with a parabolic type equation of Q-tensors in a domain $U\subset\R^3.$ In the case $U$ is bounded, we prove the existence of a global strong solution when the initial data are sufficiently small, improving a result in Xiao's paper [J. Differ. Equations 2017]. The key tool of the proof is a {maximum principle.} Then, we establish also a result of continuous dependence of solutions on the
  initial data. Finally, if $U=\R^3,$ based on a result of Du, Hu and Wang [Arch. Rational Mech. Anal. 2020], we give an interesting regularity criterium just via the $\dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}$ norm of $u$ and the $L^\infty$ norm of the initial data $Q_0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the time-dependent compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the low Mach number regime inside a family of domains $(\Omega_\varepsilon)_{\varepsilon &gt; 0}$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Assuming that $\lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \Omega_\varepsilon = \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ in a suitable sense, we show that in the limit the fluid flow inside $\Omega$ is governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes-Brinkman equations, provided the latter one admits a strong solution. The abstract convergence result is complemented with a stochastic homogenization result for randomly perforated domains in the critical regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a semicontinuity-based existence theory in $\mathrm{BV}$ for a general class of scalar linear-growth variational integrals with additional signed-measure terms. The results extend and refine previous considerations for anisotropic total variations and area-type cases, and they pave the way for a variational approach to the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations, which involve the signed measure as right-hand-side datum.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Pseudo-modes of Schr\"odinger Operators with Complex Potentials: A Focus on Resolvent Norm Estimates and Spectral Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the pseudo-modes of the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator with complex potentials, focusing on the behavior of the resolvent norm along specific curves in the complex plane and assessing the stability of the spectrum under small perturbations. The study builds upon previous work of E.B. Davies, L.S. Boulton, and N. Trefethen, specifically examining the resolvent norm of the complex harmonic oscillator along curves of the form $z_{\eta }= b\eta + c\eta ^{p} $ where $ b &gt; 0$, $ \frac{1}{3}&lt; p &lt;3 $ independent of $\eta&gt; 0$. The present work narrows the focus to the case where $p = \frac{1}{3}$. Numerical computations of pseudo-eigenvalues are performed to verify spectral instability.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quasineutral limit for the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system in the framework of analytic regularity. Following the high regularity approach introduced by Grenier [44] for the Vlasov-Poisson system, we construct local-in-time solutions with analytic bounds uniform in the quasineutrality parameter $\varepsilon$. In contrast to the electrostatic case, the presence of a magnetic field and a solenoidal electric component leads to new oscillatory effects that require a refined decomposition of the electromagnetic fields and the introduction of dispersive correctors. We show that, after appropriate filtering, solutions converge strongly as $\varepsilon$ tends to zero to a limiting system describing kinetic electron magnetohydrodynamics (e-MHD). This is the first strong convergence result for the Vlasov-Maxwell system in the quasineutral limit under analytic regularity assumptions, providing a rigorous justification for the e-MHD reduction, widely used in modelling plasmas in tokamaks and stellarators.</description>

      <title>Variational structure of Fokker-Planck equations with variable mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Fokker--Planck equations with symmetric, positive definite mobility matrices capturing diffusion in heterogeneous environments. A weighted Wasserstein metric is introduced for which these equations are gradient flows. This metric is shown to emerge from an optimal control problem in the space of probability densities for a class of variable mobility matrices, with the cost function capturing the work dissipated via friction. Using the Nash-Kuiper isometric embedding theorem for Riemannian manifolds, we demonstrate the existence of optimal transport maps. Additionally, we construct a time-discrete variational scheme, establish key properties for the associated minimizing problem, and prove convergence to weak solutions of the associated Fokker-Planck equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a numerical method for simulation of wall-bounded incompressible turbulent flows by integrating the technology of random vortex method with the core idea of Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Specifically, we utilize the filtering function in LES, interpreted as spatial averaging, along with the integral representation theorem for parabolic equations,to achieve a closure numerical scheme which may be used for calculating solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. This approach circumvents the challenge associated with handling the non-locally integrable 3-dimensional integral kernel in the random vortex method and facilitates the computation of numerical solutions for flow systems via Monte-Carlo method. Comprehensive numerical simulations are carried out for turbulent and laminar flows in full space and wall-bounded space, considering both two-dimensional and three-dimensional cases, thereby demonstrating the validity and effectiveness of the method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the parabolic stochastic quantization equation associated to the $\Phi_2^4$ model on the torus in a spatial white noise environment. We study the long time behavior of this heat equation with independent multiplicative white noise and additive spacetime white noise, which is a singular SPDE in a singular environement and requires two different renormalization procedures. We prove that the solution is global in time with a strong a priori $L^p$ bound independent of the initial data in $C^{-\varepsilon}$ for large $p$. The quenched solution given the environment is shown to be an infinite dimensional Markov process which satisfies the strong Feller property. We prove exponential convergence to a unique invariant measure using a Doeblin criterion for the transition semigroup. In particular, our work is a generalization of a previous work by Tsatsoulis and Weber in a case which is not translation invariant hence the method makes no use of the reversibility of the dynamics or the explicit knowledge of the invariant measure and it is therefore in principle applicable to situations where these are not available such as the vector-valued case.</description>

      <title>On Kerr black hole formation with complete apparent horizon and a new approach toward Penrose inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arising from admissible extended scale-critical short-pulse initial data, we show that 3+1 dimensional Einstein vacuum equations admit dynamical Kerr black hole formation solutions. Our hyperbolic arguments combine the scale-critical gravitational-collapse result by An--Luk with the recent breakthrough by Klainerman--Szeftel on proving nonlinear Kerr stability with small angular momentum, which requires us to perform various specific coordinate changes and frame transformations. Furthermore, allowing large spacetime angular momentum, with new elliptic arguments and precise leading order calculations, we also solve the apparent horizon in Kerr black hole formation spacetimes (including Klainerman--Szeftel's Kerr stability spacetimes) and conduct an exploration, detailing the emergence, evolution, asymptotics and final state of the apparent horizon. Building on our analysis, without time symmetric assumption, we then put forward a new mathematical framework and prove both the dynamical Penrose inequality and the spacetime Penrose inequality in our black-hole formation spacetimes and in the perturbative regime of subextremal Kerr black holes. Collectively, without assuming any symmetry, we extend Christodoulou's celebrated trapped surface formation theorem to a black hole formation result.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider axisymmetric, swirl-free solutions of the Euler equation in four and higher dimensions. We show that in dimension $d\geq 4$, axisymmetric, swirl-free solutions of the Euler equation have properties which could allow finite-time singularity formation of a form that is excluded when $d=3$, and we prove a conditional blowup result for axisymmetric, swirl-free solutions of the Euler equation in dimension $d\geq 4$. The condition which must be imposed on the solution in order to imply blowup becomes weaker as $d\to +\infty$, suggesting the dynamics are becoming much more singular as the dimension increases.</description>

Abstract: In a fractional Sobolev space $H^\frac{7}{4}(\mathbb{R}^2)$, we prove the desired low-regularity ill-posedness results for the 2D compressible Euler equations and the 2D ideal compressible MHD system. For the Euler equations, it is sharp with respect to the regularity of the fluid velocity and density. The mechanism behind the obtained ill-posedness is the instantaneous shock formation.</description>

      <title>A well-posedness result for the compressible two-fluid model with density-dependent viscosity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12525v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a system of PDEs describing the motion of two compressible viscous fluids occupying the whole space $\mathbb R^d\;(d\in \{2,3\}$). The two phases of the mixture are separated by a $\mathscr{C}^{1+\alpha}$-regular sharp interface $\mathcal{C}$ across which the density can experience jumps. We prove the existence of a unique local-in-time solution assuming that the initial density is $\alpha$-H\"older continuous on both sides of $\mathcal{C}$. The initial velocity belongs to the Sobolev space $H^1(\mathbb R^d)$, and the divergence of the initial stress tensor belongs to $L^2(\mathbb R^d)$. The later assumption expresses somehow the continuity of the stress tensor. This result is more general than the one by Tani [32], as it allows for less regular initial data and furthermore it can serve as a building block for the construction of global-in-time solutions.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the bacterial run-and-tumble kinetic model : quantitative and strong convergence results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the past century, biologists and mathematicians investigated two mechanisms underlying bacteria motion: the run phase during which bacteria move in straight lines and the tumble phase in which they change their orientation. When surrounded by a chemical attractant, experiments show that bacteria increase their run time as moving up concentration gradients, leading to a biased random walk towards favorable regions. This observation raises the following question, which has drawn intense interest from both biological and mathematical communities: what cellular mechanisms enable bacteria to feel concentration gradients\,? In this article, we investigate an asymptotic regime that was proposed to explain this ability thanks to internal mechanisms. More precisely, we derive the run-and-tumble kinetic equation with concentration's gradient dependent tumbling rate from a more comprehensive model, which incorporates internal cellular mechanisms. Our result improves on previous investigations, as we obtain strong convergence towards the gradient dependent kinetic model with quantitative and formally optimal convergence rates. The main ingredient consists in identifying a set of coordinates for the internal cellular dynamics in which concentration gradients arise explicitly. Then, we use relative entropy methods in order to capture quantitative measurement of the distance between the model incorporating cellular mechanisms and the one with concentration gradient dependent tumbling rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework for constructing a first-order hyperbolic system whose solution approximates that of a desired higher-order evolution equation. Constructions of this kind have received increasing interest in recent years, and are potentially useful as either analytical or computational tools for understanding the corresponding higher-order equation. We perform a systematic analysis of a family of linear model equations and show that for each member of this family there is a stable hyperbolic approximation whose solution converges to that of the model equation in a certain limit. We then show through several examples that this approach can be applied successfully to a very wide range of nonlinear PDEs of practical interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behavior of shallow water waves propagating over bathymetry that varies periodically in one direction and is constant in the other. Plane waves traveling along the constant direction are known to evolve into solitary waves, due to an effective dispersion. We apply multiple-scale perturbation theory to derive an effective constant-coefficient system of equations, showing that the transversely-averaged wave approximately satisfies a Boussinesq-type equation, while the lateral variation in the wave is related to certain integral functions of the bathymetry. Thus the homogenized equations not only accurately describe these waves but also predict their full two-dimensional shape in some detail. Numerical experiments confirm the good agreement between the effective equations and the variable-bathymetry shallow water equations.</description>

      <title>Comparison Between Effective and Individual Growth Rates in a Heterogeneous Population</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Is there an advantage to heterogeneity in a population where individuals grow and divide by fission? This is a broad question, to which there is no easy universal answer. This article aims to provide a quantitative answer in the specific context of growth rate heterogeneity by comparing the fitness of homogeneous versus heterogeneous populations. We focus on size-structured populations, where the growth rate of each individual is set at birth by heredity and/or random mutations. The fitness (or Malthus parameter, or effective fitness) of such heterogeneous population is defined by its long-term behaviour, and we introduce the effective growth rate as the individual growth rate in the homogeneous population with the same fitness. We derive analytical formulae linking effective and individual growth rates in two paradigmatic cases: first, constant growth and division rates, second, linear growth rates and uniform fragmentation. Surprisingly, these two cases yield similar expressions. Then, by comparing the fitness and the effective growth rates of populations with different degrees of heterogeneity or different laws of heredity/mutation to those of average homogeneous populations, we quantitatively investigate the combined influence of heredity and heterogeneity, and revisit previous results stating that heterogeneity is beneficial in the case of strong heredity.</description>

      <title>Schauder estimates for elliptic equations degenerating on lower dimensional manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we begin exploring a local regularity theory for elliptic equations having coefficients which are degenerate or singular on some lower dimensional manifold $$ -\mathrm{div}(|y|^aA(x,y)\nabla u)=|y|^af+\mathrm{div}(|y|^aF)\qquad\mathrm{in \ } B_1\subset\mathbb R^d, $$ where $z=(x,y)\in\mathbb R^{d-n}\times\mathbb R^n$, $2\leq n\leq d$ are two integers and $a\in\mathbb R$. Such equations are a prototypical example of elliptic equations spoiling their uniform ellipticity on the (possibly very) thin characteristic manifold $\Sigma_0=\{|y|=0\}$ of dimension $0\leq d-n\leq d-2$, having $$\lambda|y|^a|\xi|^2\leq |y|^aA(x,y)\xi\cdot\xi\leq\Lambda|y|^a|\xi|^2.$$ Whenever $a+n&gt;0$, the weak solutions with a homogeneous conormal boundary condition at $\Sigma_0$ are provided to be $C^{0,\alpha}$ or even $C^{1,\alpha}$ regular up to $\Sigma_0$. Our approach relies on a regularization-approximation scheme which employs domain perforation, very fine blow-up procedures, and a new Liouville theorem in the perforated space. Our theory extends to the case of equations degenerating on suitably smooth curved manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the averaging effect of a highly oscillating external force on the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations. We show that, as long as the force time-average decays over time, if the frequency and amplitude of the oscillating force grow, then the corresponding solutions to Navier-Stokes equations converge (in a suitable topology) to the solution of the homogeneous equations with same initial data. Our approach involves reformulating the system as an abstract evolution equation in a Banach space, and then proving continuous dependence of solutions on both initial conditions and the external forcing.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we improve the $L^p$-Rellich and Hardy-Rellich inequalities in the setting of radial Baouendi-Grushin vector fields. We establish an identity relating the subcritical and critical Hardy inequalities, thereby demonstrating their equivalence. Moreover, we obtain improved versions of these inequalities via an analysis of extremizer stability. In the higher-order setting, we derive Hardy-Rellich type inequalities involving all radial operators in the Grushin framework and prove that all resulting constants are sharp. Finally, for the $L^2$-higher-order cases, we compute exact remainder terms by establishing identities rather than inequalities.</description>

      <title>Convergence of approximate solutions constructed by the finite volume method for the moisture transport model in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a nonlinear parabolic equation in the one dimensional interval. The equation was proposed as a mathematical model for moisture transport in porous media. Its features are that the diffusion coefficient depends on the unknown function and the boundary condition is not monotone. Namely, our equation is regarded as the pseudo monotone type. The aim of this paper is to prove the convergence of approximate solutions constructed by the finite volume method. Also, we establish the uniqueness of solutions by the dual equation method.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a finite volume scheme and dissipative measure-valued-strong stability for a hyperbolic-parabolic cross-diffusion system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article is concerned with the development of a theoretical framework of global measure-valued solutions for a class of hyperbolic-parabolic cross-diffusion systems, and its application to the convergence analysis of a fully discrete finite-volume scheme. After introducing an appropriate notion of dissipative measure-valued solutions to the PDE system, a numerical scheme is proposed which is shown to generate, in the continuum limit, a dissipative measure-valued solution. The parabolic density part of the limiting measure-valued solution is atomic and converges to its constant state for long times. Furthermore, it is proved that whenever the PDE system possesses a strong solution, the convergence of the approximation scheme holds in the strong sense. The results are based on Young measure theory and a weak-strong stability estimate combining Shannon and Rao entropies. The convergence of the numerical scheme is achieved by means of discrete entropy dissipation inequalities and an artificial diffusion, which vanishes in the continuum limit.</description>

      <title>Fine properties of nonlinear potentials and a unified perspective on monotonicity formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We rigorously show that a large family of monotone quantities along the weak inverse mean curvature flow is the limit case of the corresponding ones along the level sets of $p$-capacitary potentials. Such monotone quantities include Willmore and Minkowski-type functionals on Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. In $3$-dimensional manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature, we also recover the monotonicity of the Hawking mass and its nonlinear potential theoretic counterparts. This unified view is built on a refined analysis of $p$-capacitary potentials. We prove that they strongly converge in $W^{1,q}_{\mathrm{loc}}$ as $p\to 1^+$ to the inverse mean curvature flow and their level sets are curvature varifolds. Finally, we also deduce a Gauss-Bonnet-type theorem for level sets of $p$-capacitary potentials.</description>

      <title>The Whitney method of fundamental solutions with Lusin wavelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the theoretical foundation for a variant of the method of fundamental solutions (MFS), where the source points $\{q_j\}_{j=1}^\infty$ accumulate towards the domain in a Whitney fashion, meaning that their separation is proportional to the distance to the domain. We prove that the normalized Lusin wavelets $\psi_j(w) = b_j(w-q_j)^{-2}$ constitute a generalized basis, known as a frame, for the Hardy subspace of $L_2$-traces of holomorphic functions on the domain. Consequently, our method, where $\psi_j$ are used as basis functions in the MFS, enables a numerically stable approximation of solutions to Laplace boundary value problems, even when the solutions lack analytic continuation across the boundary. Despite the source points accumulating towards the domain, our computations achieve at least 12 digits of accuracy uniformly up to the boundary, including cases when the solution lacks analytic continuation or when the boundary has corners.</description>

      <title>On continual classes of evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0501038</link>
      <description>arXiv:nlin/0501038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The original Miura transformation, considered as a nonlinear potential transformation, is applicable to a continual class of evolution equations, not only to discrete integrable equations and their hierarchies. The same continual class of evolution equations appears from a different problem, namely, from the gauge-invariant description of a zero-curvature representation with a definite x-part containing no essential parameter.</description>
