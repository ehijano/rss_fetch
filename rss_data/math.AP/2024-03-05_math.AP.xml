      <title>Sharp-interface limits for brittle fracture via the inverse-deformation formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive sharp-interface models for one-dimensional brittle fracture via the inverse-deformation approach. Methods of Gamma-convergence are employed to obtain the singular limits of previously proposed models. The latter feature a local, non-convex stored energy of inverse strain, augmented by small interfacial energy, formulated in terms of the inverse-strain gradient. They predict spontaneous fracture with exact crack-opening discontinuities, without the use of damage (phase) fields or pre-existing cracks; crack faces are endowed with a thin layer of surface energy. The models obtained herewith inherit the same properties, except that surface energy is now concentrated at the crack faces. Accordingly, we construct energy-minimizing configurations. For a composite bar with a breakable layer, our results predict a pattern of equally spaced cracks whose number is given as an increasing function of applied load.</description>

      <title>On complex algebraic singularities of some genuinely nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we highlight a new phenomenon of complex algebraic singularity formation for solutions of a large class of genuinely nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). We start from a unique Cauchy datum, which is holomorphic ramified around the smooth locus and is sufficiently singular. Then, we expect the existence of a solution which should be holomorphic ramified around the singular locus S defined by the vanishing of the discriminant of an algebraic equation. Notice, moreover, that the monodromy of the Cauchy datum is Abelian, whereas one of the solutions is non-Abelian. Moreover, the singular locus S depends on the Cauchy datum in contrast to the Leray principle (stated for linear problems only). This phenomenon is due to the fact that the PDE is genuinely nonlinear and that the Cauchy datum is sufficiently singular. First, we investigate the case of the inviscid Burgers equation. Later, we state a general conjecture that describes the expected phenomenon. We view this Conjecture as a working programme allowing us to develop interesting new Mathematics. We also state another Conjecture 2, which is a particular case of the general Conjecture but keeps all the flavour and difficulty of the subject. Then, we propose a new algorithm with a map F such that a fixed point of F would give a solution to the problem associated with Conjecture 2. Then, we perform convincing, elaborate numerical tests that suggest that a Banach norm should exist for which the mapping F should be a contraction so that the solution (with the above specific algebraic structure) should be unique. This work is a continuation of Leichtnam (1993).</description>

      <title>The sequence of pseudo-equilibria describes the long-time behaviour of the NNLIF model with large delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a wide range of mathematical models that describe populations of large numbers of neurons. In this article, we focus on nonlinear noisy leaky integrate and fire (NNLIF) models that describe neuronal activity at the level of the membrane potential of neurons. We introduce a set of novel states, which we call "pseudo-equilibria", and give evidence of their defining role in the behaviour of the NNLIF system when a significant synaptic delay is considered. The advantage is that these states are determined solely by the system's parameters and are derived from a sequence of firing rates that result from solving a recurrence equation. We propose a new strategy to show convergence to an equilibrium for a weakly connected system with large transmission delay, based on following the sequence of pseudo-equilibria. Unlike with the direct entropy dissipation method, this technique allows us to see how a large delay favours convergence. We also present a detailed numerical study to support our results. This study explores the overall behaviour of the NNLIF system and helps us understand, among other phenomena, periodic solutions in strongly inhibitory networks.</description>

      <title>Jumps and cusps: a new revival effect in local dispersive PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the presence of a non-trivial revival effect in the solution of linear dispersive boundary value problems for two benchmark models which arise in applications: the Airy equation and the dislocated Laplacian Schr{\"o}dinger equation. In both cases, we consider boundary conditions of Dirichlet-type. We prove that, at suitable times, jump discontinuities in the initial profile are revived in the solution not only as jump discontinuities but also as logarithmic cusp singularities. We explicitly describe these singularities and show that their formation is due to interactions between the symmetries of the underlying spatial operators with the periodic Hilbert transform.</description>

      <title>Plane-polarised finite-amplitude shear waves in deformed incompressible materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how two finite-amplitude, transverse, plane body waves may be superposed to propagate in a deformed hyperelastic incompressible solid. We find that the equations of motion reduce to a well-determined system of partial differential equations, making the motion controllable for all solids. We find that in deformed Mooney-Rivlin materials, they may travel along any direction and be polarised along any transverse direction, an extension of a result by Boulanger and Hayes [Quart. J. Mech. Appl. Math. 45 (1992) 575]. Furthermore, their motion is governed by a linear system of partial differential equations, making the Mooney-Rivlin special in that respect. We select another model to show that for other materials, the equations are nonlinear. We use asymptotic equations to reveal the onset of nonlinearity for the waves, paying particular attention to how close the propagation direction is to the principal axes of pre-deformation.</description>

      <title>Longtime behavior of semilinear multi-term fractional in time diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, the initial-boundary value problems to a semilinear integro-differential equation with multi-term fractional Caputo derivatives are analyzed. A particular case of this equation models oxygen diffusion through capillaries. Under proper assumptions on the coefficients and a nonlinearity, the longtime behavior (as $t\to+\infty$) of a solution is discussed. In particular, the existence of absorbing sets in suitable functional spaces is established.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions of quasilinear Schr\"odinger equations with a general nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with solutions of the following quasilinear Schr\"odinger equations \begin{eqnarray*} -{\mathrm{div}}\left(\varphi^{2}(u) \nabla u\right)+\varphi(u) \varphi^{\prime}(u)|\nabla u|^{2}+\lambda u=f(u), \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^{N} \end{eqnarray*} with prescribed mass $$ \int_{\mathbb{R}^{N}} u^{2} \mathrm{d}x=c, $$ where $N\ge 3, c&gt;0$, $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ appears as the Lagrange multiplier and $\varphi\in C ^{1}(\mathbb{R} ,\mathbb{R}^{+})$. The nonlinearity $f \in C\left ( \mathbb{R}, \, \mathbb{R} \right )$ is allowed to be mass-subcritical, mass-critical and mass-supercritical at origin and infinity. Via a dual approach, the fixed point index and a global branch approach, we establish the existence of normalized solutions to the problem above. The results extend previous results by L. Jeanjean, J. J. Zhang and X.X. Zhong to the quasilinear case.</description>

      <title>Maximal $L_1$-regularity for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the compressible Stokes equations with non-slip boundary conditions in the half space $\mathbb{R}^N_{+}$, which is a linearized system of the Navier-Stokes equations describing compressible viscous fluid motion. We prove the generation of a continous analytic semigroup associated with this compressible Stokes system with non-slip boundary conditions in the half space $\mathbb{R}^N_{+}$ and its $L_1$ in time maximal regularity. We choose the Besov space $\mathcal{H}^s_{q,r} = B^{s+1}_{q,r}(\mathbb{R}^N_{+})\times B^s_{q,r}(\mathbb{R}^N_{+})^N$ as an underlying space for the fluid domain, where $1 &lt; q &lt; \infty$, $1\leq r &lt; \infty$, and $-1+1/q &lt; s &lt; 1/q$. Then, we prove the generation of a continuous analytic semigroup $\{T(t)\}_{t\geq 0}$ on $\mathcal{H}^s_{q,r}$. Moreover, $\{T(t)\}_{t\geq 0}$ admits the
  $L_1$ in time maximal regularity on $\mathcal{H}^s_{q,1}(\mathbb{R}^N_{+})$. Namely, we have $$\int_0^\infty e^{-\gamma t} \|T(t)(\rho_0, \mathbf{u}_0)\|_{B^{s+1}_{q,1}(\mathbb{R}^N_{+})\times B^{s+2}_{q,1}(\mathbb{R}^N_{+})}\,d t \leq C\|(\rho_0, \mathbf{u}_0)\|_{\mathcal{H}^s_{q,1}(\mathbb{R}^N_{+})}$$ for any $(\rho_0, \mathbf{u}_0) \in \mathcal{H}^s_{q,1}(\mathbb{R}^N_{+})$. Our approach is to prove the existence of the resolvent in $\mathcal{H}^s_{q,1}$ and some new estimates for the resolvent by using $B^{s+1}_{q,1}(\mathbb{R}^N_{+}) \times B^{s\pm\sigma}_{q,1}(\mathbb{R}^N_{+})$ norms for some small $\sigma &gt; 0$ satisfying the condition $-1+1/q &lt; s-\sigma &lt; s &lt; s+\sigma &lt; 1/q$.</description>

      <title>Analytic shape recovery of an elastic inclusion from elastic moment tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an analytic non-iterative approach for recovering a planar isotropic elastic inclusion embedded in an unbounded medium from the elastic moment tensors (EMTs), which are coefficients for the multipole expansion of field perturbation caused by the inclusion. EMTs contain information about the inclusion's material and geometric properties and, as is well known, the inclusion can be approximated by a disk from leading-order EMTs. We define the complex contracted EMTs as the linear combinations of EMTs where the expansion coefficients are given from complex-valued background polynomial solutions. By using the layer potential technique for the Lam\'{e} system and the theory of conformal mapping, we derive explicit asymptotic formulas in terms of the complex contracted EMTs for the shape of the inclusion, treating the inclusion as a perturbed disk. These formulas lead us to an analytic non-iterative algorithm for elastic inclusion reconstruction using EMTs. We perform numerical experiments to demonstrate the validity and limitations of our proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by conjectures in Mirror Symmetry, we continue the study of the real Monge--Amp\`ere operator on the boundary of a simplex. This can be formulated in terms of optimal transport, and we consider, more generally, the problem of optimal transport between symmetric probability measures on the boundary of a simplex and of the dual simplex. For suitably regular measures, we obtain regularity properties of the transport map, and of its convex potential. To do so, we exploit boundary regularity results for optimal transport maps by Caffarelli, together with the symmetries of the simplex.</description>

      <title>On the maximum principle for general linear elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider maximum principles and related estimates for linear second order elliptic partial differential operators in n-dimensional Euclidean space, which improve previous results, with H-J Kuo, through sharp Lp dependence on the drift coefficient b. As in our previous work, the ellipticity is determined through the principal coefficient matrix A lying in sub-cones of the positive cone, which are dual cones of the Garding k-cones. Our main results are maximum principles for bounded domains, which extend those of Aleksandrov in the case k = n, together with extensions to unbounded domains, depending on appropriate integral norms of A, and corresponding local maximum principles. We also consider applications to local estimates in the uniformly elliptic case, including extensions of the Krylov-Safonov Holder and Harnack estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the propagation of acoustic waves in a medium with a periodic array of small inclusions of arbitrary shape. The inclusion size $a$ is much smaller than the array period. We show that global gaps do not exist if $a$ is small enough. The notion of local gaps which depends on the choice of the wave vector $\bk$ is introduced and studied. We determine analytically the location of local gaps for the Dirichlet and transmission problems.</description>

      <title>Motion of sharp interface of Allen-Cahn equation with anisotropic nonlinear diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Allen-Cahn equation with nonlinear anisotropic diffusion and derive anisotropic direction-dependent curvature flow under the sharp interface limit. The anisotropic curvature flow was already studied, but its derivation is new. We prove both generation and propagation of the interface. For the proof we construct sub- and super-solutions applying the comparison theorem. The problem discussed in this article naturally appeared in the study of the interacting particle systems, especially of non-gradient type. The Allen-Cahn equation obtained from systems of gradient type has a simpler nonlinearity in diffusion and leads to isotropic mean-curvature flow. We extend those results to anisotropic situations.</description>

      <title>Regularity of the free boundary for a semilinear vector-valued minimization problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following semilinear vector-valued minimization problem
  $$\min\left\{\int_{D}({|\nabla\mathbf{u}|}^2 + F(|\mathbf{u}|))dx: \ \ \mathbf{u}\in W^{1,2}(D; \mathbb{R}^m) \ \text{and} \ \mathbf{u}=\mathbf{g}\ \text{on} \ \partial D\right\},$$ where $\mathbf{u}: D\to \mathbb{R}^m$ ($ m\geq 1$) is a vector-valued function, $D\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ ($n\geq 2$) is a bounded Lipschitz domain, $\mathbf{g}\in W^{1,2}(D; \mathbb{R}^m)$ is a given vector-valued function and $F:[0, \infty)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a given function. This minimization problem corresponds to the following semilinear elliptic system
  \begin{equation*}
  \Delta\mathbf{u}=\frac{1}{2}F'(|\mathbf{u}|)\cdot\frac{\mathbf{u}}{|\mathbf{u}|}\chi_{\{|\mathbf{u}|&gt;0\}},

where $\chi_A$ denotes the characteristic function of the set A. The linear case that $F'\equiv 2$ was studied in the previous elegant work by Andersson, Shahgholian, Uraltseva and Weiss [Adv. Math 280, 2015], in which an epiperimetric inequality played a crucial role to indicate an energy decay estimate and the uniqueness of blow-up limit. However, this epiperimetric inequality cannot be directly applied to our case due to the more general non-degenerate and non-homogeneous term $F$ which leads to Weiss' boundary adjusted energy does not have scaling properties. Motivated by the linear case, when $F$ satisfies some assumptions, we establish successfully a new epiperimetric inequality, it can deal with term which is not scaling invariant in Weiss' boundary adjusted energy. As an application of this new epiperimetric inequality, we conclude that the free boundary $D\cap \partial\{|\mathbf{u}|&gt;0\}$ is a locally $C^{1,\beta}$ surface near the regular points for some $\beta\in (0,1)$.</description>

      <title>Local existence of classical solution to the chemotaxis-shallow water system with vacuum in $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the chemotaxis-shallow water system in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We establish the local existence of classical solution without assuming the initial height is small or has a small perturbation near a constant. The far field behavior of the height is a constant which could be either vacuum or non-vacuum. The initial data is allowed vacuum and the spatial measure of the set of vacuum can be arbitrarily large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is proved in \cite[J. Funct. Anal., 2020]{AP} that the Cauchy problem for some Oldroyd-B model is well-posed in $\B^{d/p-1}_{p,1}(\R^d) \times \B^{d/p}_{p,1}(\R^d)$ with $1\leq p&lt;2d$. In this paper, we prove that the Cauchy problem for the same Oldroyd-B model is ill-posed in $\B^{d/p-1}_{p,r}(\R^d) \times \B^{d/p}_{p,r}(\R^d)$ with $1\leq p\leq \infty$ and $1&lt; r\leq\infty$ due to the lack of continuous dependence of the solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of ground state solutions for a $(p,q)$-Laplacian system with $p,q&gt;1$ and potential wells on a weighted locally finite graph $G=(V,E)$. By making use of the method of Nehari manifold and the Lagrange multiplier rule, we prove that if the nonlinear term $F$ takes on the super-$(p, q)$-linear growth and the potential functions $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ satisfy some suitable conditions, then for any fixed parameter $\lambda\geq1$, the system is provided with a ground state solution $(u_\lambda, v_\lambda)$. Additionally, we set up the convergence property of the solutions set $\{(u_\lambda, v_\lambda)\}$ when $\lambda \rightarrow +\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper deals with a modified Serre-Green-Naghdi (mSGN) system that has been introduced by Clamond et al. to improve the dispersion relation. We present a precise blow-up scenario of the mSGN equations and we prove the existence of a class of solutions that develop singularities in finite time. All the presented results hold also for the Serre-Green-Naghdi system with weak surface tension.</description>

      <title>On a Hamiltonian regularization of scalar conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Hamiltonian regularization of scalar conservation laws, which is parametrized by $\ell &gt; 0$ and conserves an $H^1$ energy. We prove the existence of global weak solutions for this regularization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that as $\ell$ approaches zero, the unique entropy solution of the original scalar conservation law is recovered, providing justification for the regularization. This regularization belongs to a family of non-diffusive, non-dispersive regularizations that were initially developed for the shallow-water system and extended later to the Euler system. This paper represents a validation of this family of regularizations in the scalar case.</description>

Abstract: The system under study is a solute-solvent-structure (SSS) interaction problem for the interaction of a dilute three-dimensional Oldroyd-B polymeric fluid with a two-dimensional viscoelastic shell. We show that a unique global strong solution to this system exists under the condition that the classical Ladyzhenskaya--Prodi--Serrin criterion holds for the velocity field and that the shell displacement is essentially bounded in time with values in the space of continuously differentiable functions. No requirement is needed for the polymer number density and the extra stress tensor for the solute component.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the collision of two nearly equal solitary waves for the Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the collision of two solitary waves for the Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation in dimension $2$ and $3$. We describe the evolution of the solution behaving as a sum of $2$-solitary waves of nearly equal speeds at time $t=-\infty$ up to time $t=+\infty$. We show that this solution behaves as the sum of two modulated solitary waves and an error term which is small in $H^1$ for all time $t \in \mathbb R$. Finally, we also prove the stability of this solution for large times around the collision.
  The proofs are a non-trivial extension of the ones of Martel and Merle for the quartic generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation to higher dimensions. First, despite the non-explicit nature of the solitary wave, we construct an approximate solution in an intrinsic way by canceling the error to the equation only in the natural directions of scaling and translation. Then, to control the difference between a solution and the approximate solution, we use a modified energy functional and a refined modulation estimate in the transverse variable. Moreover, we rely on the hamiltonian structure of the ODE governing the distance between the waves, which cannot be approximated by explicit solutions, to close the bootstrap estimates on the parameters. We hope that the techniques introduced here are robust and will prove useful in studying the collision phenomena for other focusing non-linear dispersive equations with non-explicit solitary waves.</description>

      <title>Non-degeneracy, stability and symmetry for the fractional Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractional Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality states that $$ \int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \frac{(u(x)-u(y))^2}{|x|^\alpha |x-y|^{n+2s} |y|^\alpha} \mathrm{d} x \, \mathrm{d} y
  \geq \Lambda_{n, s, p, \alpha,\beta}
  \|u |x|^{-\beta}\|_{L^p}^2, $$ for $0&lt;s&lt;\min\{1, n/2\}$, $2&lt;p&lt;2^*_s$, and $\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb R$ so that $\beta-\alpha = s - n\big(\frac12 - \frac1p\big)$ and $-2s &lt; \alpha &lt; \frac{n-2s}{2}$.
  Continuing the program started in Ao et al. (2022), we establish the non-degeneracy and sharp quantitative stability of minimizers for $\alpha\ge 0$. Furthermore, we show that minimizers remain symmetric when $\alpha&lt;0$ for $p$ very close to $2$.
  Our results fit into the more ambitious goal of understanding the symmetry region of the minimizers of the fractional Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality.
  We develop a general framework to deal with fractional inequalities in $\mathbb R^n$, striving to provide statements with a minimal set of assumptions. Along the way, we discover a Hardy-type inequality for a general class of radial weights that might be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, the existence, uniqueness, and positivity of solutions, as well as the asymptotic behavior through a finite fractal dimensional global attractor for a general Advection-Diffusion-Reaction (ADR) equation, are investigated. Our findings are innovative, as we employ semigroups and global attractors theories to achieve these results. Also, an analytical solution of a two-dimensional Advection-Diffusion Equation is presented. And finally, two Explicit Finite Difference schemes are used to simulate solutions in the two- and three-dimensional cases. The numerical simulations are conducted with predefined initial and Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trace-dev-div inequality in $H^s$ controls the trace in the norm of $H^s$ by that of the deviatoric part plus the $H^{s-1}$ norm of the divergence of a quadratic tensor field different from the constant unit matrix. This is well known for $s=0$ and established for orders $0\le s\le 1$ and arbitrary space dimension in this note. For mixed and least-squares finite element error analysis in linear elasticity, this inequality allows to establish robustness with respect to the Lam\'e parameter $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Tiny fluctuations of the averaging process around its degenerate steady state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze nonequilibrium fluctuations of the averaging process on $\mathbb T_\varepsilon^d$, a continuous degenerate Gibbs sampler running over the edges of the discrete $d$-dimensional torus. We show that, if we start from a smooth deterministic non-flat interface, recenter, blow-up by a non-standard CLT-scaling factor $\theta_\varepsilon=\varepsilon^{-(d/2+1)}$, and rescale diffusively, Gaussian fluctuations emerge in the limit $\varepsilon\to 0$. These fluctuations are purely dynamical, zero at times $t=0$ and $t=\infty$, and non-trivial for $t\in (0,\infty)$. We fully determine the correlation matrix of the limiting noise, non-diagonal as soon as $d\ge 2$. The main technical challenge in this stochastic homogenization procedure lies in a LLN for a weighted space-time average of squared discrete gradients. We accomplish this through a Poincar\'e inequality with respect to the underlying randomness of the edge updates, a tool from Malliavin calculus in Poisson space. This inequality, combined with sharp gradients' second moment estimates, yields quantitative variance bounds without prior knowledge of the limiting mean. Our method avoids higher (e.g., fourth) moment bounds, which seem inaccessible with the present techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1706.01282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1904, Prandtl introduced his famous boundary layer in order to describe the behavior of solutions of Navier Stokes equations near a boundary as the viscosity goes to $0$. His Ansatz has later been justified for analytic data by R.E. Caflisch and M. Sammartino. In this paper, we prove that his expansion is false, up to $O(\nu^{1/4})$ order terms in $L^\infty$ norm, in the case of solutions with Sobolev regularity, even in cases where the Prandlt's equation is well posed in Sobolev spaces.
  In addition, we also prove that monotonic boundary layer profiles, which are stable when $\nu = 0$, are nonlinearly unstable when $\nu &gt; 0$, provided $\nu$ is small enough, up to $O(\nu^{1/4})$ terms in $L^\infty$ norm.</description>

      <title>Liouville-type theorems, radial symmetry and integral representation of solutions to Hardy-H\'enon equations involving higher order fractional Laplacians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.09441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study nonnegative solutions to the following Hardy-H\'enon type equations involving higher order fractional Laplacians $$ (-\Delta)^\sigma u = |x|^{-\alpha}u^{p} ~~~~~~ \mbox{in} ~ \mathbb{R}^n \backslash \{0\} $$ with a possible singularity at the origin, where $\sigma$ is a real number satisfying $0 &lt; \sigma &lt; n/2$, $-\infty &lt; \alpha &lt; 2\sigma$ and $p&gt;1$. By a more direct approach without using the super poly-harmonic properties, we establish an integral representation for nonnegative solutions to the above higher order fractional equations whether the singularity $\{0\}$ is removable or not. As the first application, we prove an optimal Liouville-type theorem for the above equations with removable singularity for all $\sigma \in (0, n/2)$ when $$ 1 &lt; p &lt; p_{\sigma,\alpha}^*:=\frac{n+2\sigma -2\alpha}{n-2\sigma} ~~~ \mbox{and} ~~~ -\infty &lt; \alpha &lt; 2\sigma. $$ This, in particular, covers a gap occurring for non-integral $\sigma \in (1, n/2)$ and $\alpha \in (0, 2\sigma)$ in the current literature. As the second application, we show the radial symmetry of solutions in the critical case or in the case when the origin is a non-removable singularity. Such radial symmetry would be useful in studying the singular Yamabe-type problems.</description>

      <title>Delta-convex structure of the singular set of distance functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.10449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the distance function from any closed subset of any complete Finsler manifold, we prove that the singular set is equal to a countable union of delta-convex hypersurfaces up to an exceptional set of codimension two. In addition, in dimension two, the whole singular set is equal to a countable union of delta-convex Jordan arcs up to isolated points. These results are new even in the standard Euclidean space and shown to be optimal in view of regularity.</description>

      <title>Chemotaxis systems with singular sensitivity and logistic source: Boundedness, persistence, absorbing set, and entire solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.00096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the following parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis system with singular sensitivity and logistic source, \begin{equation} \begin{cases} u_t=\Delta u-\chi\nabla\cdot (\frac{u}{v} \nabla v)+u(a(t,x)-b(t,x) u), &amp; x\in \Omega,\cr 0=\Delta v- \mu v+ \nu u, &amp; x\in \Omega, \cr \frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial n}=0, &amp; x\in\partial\Omega, \end{cases} \end{equation} where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is a smooth bounded domain, $a(t,x)$ and $b(t,x)$ are positive smooth functions, and $\chi$, $\mu$ and $\nu$ are positive constants. In the very recent paper [25], we proved that for given nonnegative initial function $0\not\equiv u_0\in C^0(\bar \Omega)$ and $s\in\mathbb{R}$, (0.1) has a unique globally defined classical solution $(u(t,x;s,u_0),v(t,x;s,u_0))$ with $u(s,x;s,u_0)=u_0(x)$, provided that $a_{\inf}=\inf_{t\in\mathbb{R},x\in\Omega}a(t,x)$ is large relative to $\chi$ and $u_0$ is not small. In this paper, we further investigate qualitative properties of globally defined positive solutions of (0.1) under the assumption that $a_{\inf}$ is large relative to $\chi$ and $u_0$ is not small. Among others, we provide some concrete estimates for $\int_\Omega u^{-p}$ and $\int_\Omega u^q$ for some $p&gt;0$ and $q&gt;\max\{2,N\}$ and prove that any globally defined positive solution is bounded above and below eventually by some positive constants independent of its initial functions. We prove the existence of a ``rectangular'' type bounded invariant set (in $L^q$) which eventually attracts all the globally defined positive solutions. We also prove that (0.1) has a positive entire classical solution $(u^*(t,x),v^*(t,x))$, which is periodic in $t$ if $a(t,x)$ and $b(t,x)$ are periodic in $t$ and is independent of $t$ if $a(t,x)$ and $b(t,x)$ are independent of $t$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.05860v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Lorentzian metric independent of the time variable in the cylinder $\mathbb{R}\times\Omega$ where $x_0\in\mathbb{R}$ is the time variable and $\Omega$ is a bounded smooth domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We consider forward null-geodesics in $\mathbb{R}\times \Omega$ starting on $\mathbb{R}\times\partial\Omega$ at $t=0$ and leaving $\mathbb{R}\times\Omega$ at some later time. We prove the following rigidity result: If two Lorentzian metrics are close enough in some norm and if corresponding null-geodesics have equal lengths then the metrics are equal.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.08717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a family of nonlinear damped wave equations indexed by a parameter $\epsilon &gt;0$ and forced by a space-time white noise on the two dimensional torus, with polynomial and sine nonlinearities. We show that as $\epsilon \to 0$, the solutions to these equations converge to the solution of the corresponding two dimensional stochastic quantization equation. In the sine nonlinearity case, the convergence is proven over arbitrary large times, while in the polynomial case, we prove that this approximation result holds over arbitrary large times when the parameter $\epsilon$ goes to zero even with a lack of suitable global well-posedness theory for the corresponding wave equations.</description>

      <title>Improved bilinear Strichartz estimates with application to the well-posedness of periodic generalized KdV type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We improve our previous result [L. Molinet and T. Tanaka, Unconditional well-posedness for some nonlinear periodic one-dimensional dispersive equations, J. Funct. Anal. 283 (2022), 109490] on the Cauchy problem for one dimensional dispersive equations with a quite general nonlinearity in the periodic setting. Under the same hypotheses that the dispersive operator behaves for high frequencies as a Fourier multiplier by $ i |\xi|^\alpha \xi $, with $ 1 \le \alpha\le 2 $, and that the nonlinear term is of the form $ \partial_x f(u) $ where $f $ is a real analytic function whose Taylor series around the origin has an infinite radius of convergence, we prove the unconditional LWP of the Cauchy problem in $H^s(\mathbb{T}) $ for $ s\ge 1-\frac{\alpha}{4} $ with $ s&gt;1/2 $. It is worth noticing that this result is optimal in the case $\alpha=2$ (generalized KdV equation) in view of the restriction $ s&gt;1/2 $ for the continuous injection of $ H^s(\mathbb{T}) $ into $ L^\infty(\mathbb{T}) $. Our main new ingredient is the remplacement of improved Strichartz estimates by improved bilinear estimates in the treatment of the worst resonant interactions. Such improved bilinear estimates already appeared in the work of Hani in the context of Schr\"odinger equations on a compact manifold. Finally note that this enables us to derive global existence results for $ \alpha \in [4/3,2] $.</description>

      <title>Calderon-Zygmund estimates for stochastic elliptic systems on bounded Lipschitz domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concerned with elliptic operators with stationary random coefficients of integrable correlations and bounded Lipschitz domains, arising from stochastic homogenization theory, this paper is mainly devoted to studying Calder\'on-Zygmund estimates. As an application, we obtain the homogenization error in the sense of oscillation and fluctuation, respectively. These results are optimal up to a quantity $O(\ln(1/\varepsilon))$, which is caused by the quantified sublinearity of correctors in dimension two and the less smoothness of the boundary. In this paper, we find a novel form of \emph{minimal radius}, which is proved to be a suitable tool for quantitative stochastic homogenization on boundary value problems, when we adopt Gloria-Neukamm-Otto's strategy originally inspired by the pioneering work of Naddaf and Spencer.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear enhanced dissipation in viscous Burgers type equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.16839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a class of infinite mass functions for which solutions of the viscous Burgers equation decay at a better rate than solution of the heat equation for initial data in this class. In other words, we show an enhanced dissipation coming from a nonlinear transport term. We compute the asymptotic profile in this class for both equations. For the viscous Burgers equation, the main novelty is the construction and description of a time dependent profile with a boundary layer, which enhanced the dissipation. This profile will be stable up to a computable nonlinear correction depending on the perturbation. We also extend our results to other convection-diffusion equations.</description>

Abstract: In this follow up paper, we focus on the viscous Burgers equation. There, using the Hopf-Cole transformation, we compute the long time behavior of solutions for some classes of infinite mass initial datas. We show that an enhanced dissipation effect occurs generically, that is the decay rate in time is better than if we considered instead the heat equations for the same inital value. We also show the existence of a kind of global attractor per class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study various properties of the gradients of solutions to harmonic functions on Lipschitz surfaces. We improve an exponential bound of Naber and Valtorta on the size of the superlevel sets for the frequency function to a sharp quadratic bound in this setting using complex analytic tools. We also develop a propagation of smallness for gradients of harmonic functions, settling an open question in this setting. Finally, we extend the estimate on superlevel sets of the frequency to more general divergence-form elliptic PDEs with bounded drift terms at the cost of a subpolynomial factor.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness and scattering of the defocusing energy-critical inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with radial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the defocusing energy-critical inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (INLS) $iu_t + \Delta u = |x|^{-b}|u|^{k}u$ in $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^{n}$ where $n \geq 3$, $0&lt;b&lt;\min(2, n/2)$, and $k=(4-2b)/(n-2)$. We show that for every spherically symmetric initial data $\phi \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$, or preferably $\dot{H}^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$, the solution is globally well-posed and scatters for every such $n$ and $b$ except for $n=4$ with $1\leq b&lt;2$ and $n=5$ with $1/2\leq b\leq 5/4$. We mainly apply the arguments of Tao (2005), but inspired by the work of Aloui and Tayachi (2021), we utilize Lorentz spaces to define spacetime norms. This method is distinct from the widespread concentration compactness principle and establishes a quantitative bound for the solution's spacetime norm. The bound has an exponential form $C\exp(CE[\phi]^C)$ in terms of the energy $E[\phi]$, similar to Tao's work.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, an integrated theory of the probe and singular sources methods for an inverse obstacle problem governed by the Stokes system in a bounded domain is developed. The main results consist of: the probe method for the Stokes system; the singular sources method by using the notion of the probe method; the completely integrated version of the probe and singular sources methods. In establishing the singular sources method, a third indicator function which is called the IPS function plays the central role.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the stability for 2-D plane Poiseuille flow $(1-y^2,0)$ in a channel $\mathbb{T}\times (-1,1)$ with Navier-slip boundary condition. We prove that if the initial perturbation for velocity field $u_0$ satisfies that $\|u_0\|_{H^{\frac{7}{2}+}} \leq \epsilon_1 \nu^{2/3}$ for some suitable small $0&lt;\epsilon_1 \ll 1$ independent of viscosity coefficient $\nu$, then the solution to the Navier-Stokes equations is global in time and does not transit from the plane Poiseuille flow. This result improves the result of \cite{DL1} from $3/4$ to $2/3$.</description>

Abstract: We consider a parabolic-elliptic type of Keller-Segel equations with generalized diffusion and logistic source under homogeneous Neumann-Neumann boundary conditions. We construct bounded weak solutions globally in time in an unbalanced optimal transport framework, provided that the magnitude of the chemotactic sensitivity can be restricted depending on parameters. In the case of subquadratic degradation of the logistic source, we quantify the chemotactic sensitivity, in particular, in terms of the power of degradation and the pointwise bound of the initial density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Focused on elliptic operators with stationary random coefficients of integrable correlations, stemming from stochastic homogenization theory, this paper primarily aims to investigate boundary estimates. As practical applications, we establish decay estimates for Green functions in both the quenched and annealed senses, as well as, some useful annealed estimates (including CLT-scaling) for boundary correctors. By extending Bella-Giunti-Otto's lemma in \cite{Bella-Giunti-Otto17} (to the version with a boundary condition), we ultimately obtain an error estimate for two-scale expansions of Green functions at mixed derivatives level, and thereby build connections to other interesting fields.</description>

      <title>Vector Valued G\aa rding Inequality for pseudo-differential operators on compact homogeneous manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove sufficient conditions in order to obtain a sharp G\aa rding inequality for pseudo-differential operators acting on vector-valued functions on compact Lie groups. As a consequence, we obtain a sharp G\aa rding inequality for compact homogeneous vector bundles and compact homogeneous manifolds. The sharp G\aa rding inequality is the strongest lower bound estimate known to hold for systems on $\mathbb{R}^n$, and the aim of this paper is to extend this property to systems on compact Lie groups and compact homogeneous manifolds. Our results extend previous works by Lax and Nirenberg [Comm. Pure Appl. Math., Vol. 8, 129-209, (1966)], and by Ruzhansky and Turunen [J. Funct. Anal., Vol. 267, 144-172, (2011)]. As an application, we establish existence and uniqueness of solution to a class of systems of initial value problems of pseudo-differential equations on compact Lie groups and compact homogeneous manifolds.</description>

      <title>Spectral bounds for exit times on metric measure Dirichlet spaces and applications</title>

Abstract: Assuming the heat kernel on a doubling Dirichlet metric measure space has a generalized sub-Gaussian bound, we prove an asymptotically sharp spectral upper bound on the survival probability of the associated diffusion process. As a consequence, we can show that the supremum of the mean exit time over all starting points is finite if and only if the bottom of the spectrum is positive. Among several applications, we show that the spectral upper bound on the survival probability implies a bound for the Hot Spots constant for Riemannian manifolds. Our results apply to many interesting examples including Carnot groups, sub-Riemannian manifolds with transverse symmetries, and fractals.</description>

      <title>Rigidity and compactness with constant mean curvature in warped product manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03499v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the rigidity of rectifiable boundaries with constant distributional mean curvature in the Brendle class of warped product manifolds (which includes important models in General Relativity, like the deSitter--Schwarzschild and Reissner--Nordstrom manifolds). As a corollary we characterize limits of rectifiable boundaries whose mean curvatures converge, as distributions, to a constant. The latter result is new, and requires the full strength of distributional CMC-rigidity, even when one considers smooth boundaries whose mean curvature oscillations vanish in arbitrarily strong $C^k$-norms.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously recovering running cost and Hamiltonian in Mean Field Games system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and study several inverse problems for the mean field games (MFG) system in a bounded domain. Our focus is on simultaneously recovering the running cost and the Hamiltonian within the MFG system by the associated boundary observation. There are several technical novelties that make the study intriguing and challenging. First, the MFG system couples two nonlinear parabolic PDEs with one moving forward and the other one moving backward in time. Second, there is a probability density constraint on the population distribution of the agents. Third, the simultaneous recovery of two coupling factors within the MFG system is technically far from being trivial. Fourth, we consider both cases that the running cost depends on the population density locally and non-locally, and the two cases present different technical challenges for the inverse problem study. We develop two mathematical strategies that can ensure the probability constraint as well as effectively tackle the inverse problems, which are respectively termed as high-order variation and successive linearisation. In particular, the high-order variation method is new to the literature, which demonstrates a novel concept to examine the inverse problems by non-negative inputs only. We believe the methods developed can find applications to inverse problems in other contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper extends and complements the existing theory for the parabolic Muckenhoupt weights motivated by one-sided maximal functions and a doubly nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation of $p$-Laplace type. The main results include characterizations for the limiting parabolic $A_\infty$ and $A_1$ classes by applying an uncentered parabolic maximal function with a time lag. Several parabolic Calder\'on-Zygmund decompositions, covering and chaining arguments appear in the proofs.</description>

      <title>Local isometric immersions and breakdown of manifolds determined by Cauchy problems of the Degasperis-Procesi equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that both local and non-local formulations of the Degasperis-Procesi equation possess a pseudospherical nature. As a result, solutions determined by Cauchy problems with non-trivial initial data and a minimal specific regularity define an orthonormal coframe for a pseudospherical metric within a designated strip. While the region is entirely described by the initial condition, the one-forms are determined by the corresponding solutions. Moreover, we establish that any non-trivial initial condition yields a second fundamental form, which is locally determined within the strip. The surface may collapse within a finite-height strip when the initial condition leads to wave breaking. We determine conditions for the coframe to be defined on the upper plane. We investigate possible integrability structures related to the triad of fundamental one-forms.</description>

      <title>On Arnold's Transversality Conjecture for the Laplace-Beltrami Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the structure of the set of Riemannian metrics on a connected manifold such that the corresponding Laplace-Beltrami operator has an eigenvalue of a given multiplicity. We introduce a simple geometric condition on metrics and show it is equivalent to the strong Arnold hypothesis, which essentially posits that multiple Laplace eigenvalues split up under perturbation like those of symmetric matrices. We prove our condition is satisfied except on a set of infinite codimension, and use this to obtain non-crossing rules for Laplace eigenvalues. Furthermore, we show that our condition is satisfied on all metrics admitting eigenvalues of multiplicity at most seven, and exhibit examples of metrics violating it.</description>

      <title>Linear-Quadratic Mean Field Games in Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper represents the first attempt to develop a theory for linear-quadratic mean field games in possibly infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. As a starting point, we study the case, considered in most finite dimensional contributions on the topic, where the dependence on the distribution enters just in the objective functional through the mean. This feature allows, similarly to the finite dimensional case, to reduce the usual mean field game system to a Riccati equation and a forward-backward coupled system of abstract evolution equations. Such system is completely new in infinite dimension and no results have been proved on it so far. We show existence and uniqueness of solutions for such system, applying a delicate approximation procedure. We apply the results to a production output planning problem with delay in the control variable.</description>

      <title>Extended Flow Matching: a Method of Conditional Generation with Generalized Continuity Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of conditional generation is one of the most important applications of generative models, and numerous methods have been developed to date based on the celebrated diffusion models, with the guidance-based classifier-free method taking the lead. However, the theory of the guidance-based method not only requires the user to fine-tune the "guidance strength," but its target vector field does not necessarily correspond to the conditional distribution used in training. In this paper, we develop the theory of conditional generation based on Flow Matching, a current strong contender of diffusion methods. Motivated by the interpretation of a probability path as a distribution on path space, we establish a novel theory of flow-based generation of conditional distribution by employing the mathematical framework of generalized continuity equation instead of the continuity equation in flow matching. This theory naturally derives a method that aims to match the matrix field as opposed to the vector field. Our framework ensures the continuity of the generated conditional distribution through the existence of flow between conditional distributions. We will present our theory through experiments and mathematical results.</description>
