      <title>Sudakov evolution without unitarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for sampling singular functions defined on (nested) multi-particle phase spaces, based on a generalisation of parton-shower phase-space generation techniques. At the heart of the method are three key ingredients: 1) the Sudakov sampling by which shower-style calculations sweep across phase space in an ordered manner, from hard to soft; 2) the sequential nesting of multiparticle phase spaces; and 3) the factorisations obeyed by singular multiparton amplitudes on the edges of these phase spaces. We demonstrate a C++ implementation of the proposed algorithm, dubbed Sunshine, for hadronic Z decays, and use it to test the tree-level accuracy of the Vincia sector shower through $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$.</description>

      <title>Searching for Di-Higgs Signatures of Light Charged Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excess in $t\to b\overline{b}c$ observed by ATLAS points towards a charged Higgs boson with a mass around 130$\,$GeV, consistent with the expectations from the $B$ anomalies, i.e.$~R_{D^{(*)}}$ and $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ data. As a non-minimal flavour structure is required for an explanation of these observables, this points towards a two-Higgs-doublet model with generic Yukawa couplings. Such a scenario predicts a sizable cross section for the pair production of the charged Higgs at the Large Hadron Collider, which can be tested by recasting SM di-Higgs searches. While the predicted event rate is even higher than the one of SM Higgs pair production, the smaller efficiency (w.r.t.$~$SM Higgs pair production) reduces the signal yield. Nonetheless, dedicated searches can probe most of the interesting parameter space and lead to a discovery with Run-3 or High-Luminosity LHC data.</description>

      <title>QCD antenna radiative spectrum in dense media: accounting for full jet-medium interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the double differential inclusive spectrum for the emission of a soft gluon from a color-singlet $q\bar q$ pair traversing a dense QCD medium. Our results extend the existing literature by simultaneously incorporating both single hard and multiple soft gluon exchanges between the jet and the medium -- an essential ingredient for a complete phenomenological description of jet quenching. Using the Improved Opacity Expansion framework, we provide an analytically tractable treatment, reducing the full cross-section to a set of simple expressions. Our analysis demonstrates that rare hard (Moli\`ere) scatterings significantly modify the gluon spectrum at large angles, accelerating the loss of color coherence between the initial quarks. We further quantify whether the modifications are driven by an overall weakening of the interference term, or by more detailed modifications to the fragmentation pattern. Our results provide a direct input for phenomenological jet quenching studies, offering new insights into the role of color decoherence in QCD matter.</description>

      <title>Entanglement, Trace Anomaly and Confinement in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate confinement in QCD as an entropic surface phenomenon. Quark and gluon quantum information is localized on a two-dimensional transverse sheet of radius $R_{\mathrm{EE}}$ where the von Neumann entropy of the vacuum attains its maximum. Lattice QCD determinations of scalar (trace) gravitational form factors fix both $R_{\mathrm{EE}}$ and the transverse trace-anomaly density $\rho_h(R_{\mathrm{EE}})$ with percent-level accuracy, enabling a parameter-free mechanical entropy $S_{\mathrm{EE}}(y)=c_h\,y$ that grows linearly with rapidity $y$. The associated entropy gradient changes sign at $R_{\mathrm{EE}}$: it repels color fields for $r&lt;R_{\mathrm{EE}}$ and attracts them for $r&gt;R_{\mathrm{EE}}$, trapping partons at all scales -- UV and IR -- in contrast to Wilson's area law, which probes only long distances. Squaring the entropy density, as required by unitarity, yields $\sigma\propto y^{\delta}$. World data demand $\delta=2$ for elastic $pp\,(p\bar p)$ scattering and heavy-quark photoproduction, but a softer $\delta=0.387$ for $\phi$ photoproduction, all two orders of magnitude below the Froissart--Martin bound. These results provide the first confinement criterion derived directly from nonperturbative QCD, unifying the trace anomaly, entanglement entropy, and high-energy scattering within a single quantitative framework.</description>

      <title>Discovering the underlying analytic structure within Standard Model constants using artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a search for underlying analytic structures among the fundamental parameters of the Standard Model (SM) using symbolic regression and genetic programming. We identify the simplest analytic relationships connecting pairs of these constants and report several notable observations based on about a thousand expressions with relative precision better than 1%. These results may serve as valuable inputs for model builders and artificial intelligence methods aimed at uncovering hidden patterns among the SM constants, or potentially used as building blocks for a deeper underlying law that connects all parameters of the SM through a small set of fundamental constants.</description>

      <title>Anti-Electron Neutrinos at High-Energy Neutrino Experiments: Identification Strategies and Physics Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing and proposed high energy neutrino experiments have excellent muon charge identification capabilities, enabling the distinction of $\nu_\mu$ and $\bar \nu_\mu$ charged current interactions. In contrast, distinguishing electrons and positrons from $\nu_e$ and $\bar \nu_e$ interactions is typically impossible, as they quickly interact within the characteristically dense detector material and fail to reach the spectrometer. In this letter, we propose a compact and cost-effective plastic target, placed right before the spectrometer, to maximize the rate of electrons and positrons that reach the spectrometer before interacting. We demonstrate that, when installed at the FASER experiment, the Forward Physics Facility, or SHiP, this setup could enable the first separate measurement of $\nu_e$ and $\bar\nu_e$ cross sections at high energy. Additionally, this setup opens new opportunities to study forward particle production at collider neutrino experiments, such as constraining forward $\Lambda$ hyperon production, and, by reducing flux uncertainties, significantly improve limits on non-standard neutrino interactions in neutral currents.</description>

      <title>Earth-Scattering Induced Modulation in Low-Threshold Dark Matter Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter particles with sufficiently large interactions with ordinary matter can scatter in the Earth before reaching and scattering in a detector. This induces a modulation in the signal rate with a period of one sidereal day. We calculate this modulation for sub-GeV dark matter particles that interact either with a heavy or an ultralight dark-photon mediator and investigate the resulting signal in low-threshold detectors consisting of silicon, xenon, or argon targets. The scattering in the Earth is dominated by dark matter scatters off nuclei, while the signal in the detector is easiest to observe from dark matter scattering off electrons. We investigate the properties of the modulation signal and provide projections of the sensitivity of future experiments. We find that a search for a modulation signal can probe new regions of parameter space near the energy thresholds of current experiments, where the data are typically dominated by backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Searching for long-lived light neutralinos from $B$-meson decays with baryonic R-parity violation at Belle II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a supersymmetry scenario with R-parity violation (RPV), neutralinos with GeV-scale mass, which are necessarily bino-like, are allowed by all constraints and can be produced in association with a baryon in $B$-meson decays via certain $\bar U \bar D \bar D$ operators. In this work, we investigate this scenario with two non-vanishing RPV couplings at the low-energy scale. With one RPV coupling governing the neutralino production rate and another determining its lifetime, this scenario can lead to observable signals with displaced-vertex signatures in the tracking volume of $B$-factories. To maximize the sensitivity to such signals, we develop a new partial-reconstruction technique that yields high efficiency and utilizes most of the decays of relatively heavy, long-lived particles, achieving much better sensitivity than standard full reconstruction. We consider potential background sources and devise selection criteria to suppress their event yields to very low levels. Using a parameterized model of the detector, we estimate in detail the displaced-vertex reconstruction efficiency as a function of neutralino lifetime and mass. For squark masses beyond the LHC limits, we calculate the signal sensitivity of Belle II, showing that large regions of the parameter space can be probed beyond the current bounds.</description>

      <title>Unified study of two-meson and axion-meson production from semileptonic tau decays within resonance chiral framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out the joint study of the semileptonic tau decays into the two-meson and axion-meson channels, viz. $\tau^-\to (P_1P_2)^-\nu_\tau$ and $\tau^-\to \pi^-(K^-) a\nu_\tau$ within the framework of resonance chiral theory by including the model-independent axion-gluon-gluon interaction. By utilizing the $\pi^0$-$\eta$-$\eta'$-axion mixing matrix elements from recent studies, we calculate the pertinent two-pseudoscalar boson form factors. To simultaneously fit the experimental spectra measured in the Cabibbo allowed $\tau^-\to \pi^-\pi^0\nu_\tau$ process and also the Cabibbo suppressed $\tau^-\to(K_S\pi^-, K^-\eta)\nu_\tau$ ones, we determine all the relevant hadron resonance parameters. Then we give predictions to the spectra and branching ratios for various channels, such as $\tau^-\to(\pi^-\eta,\pi^-\eta',K^-\eta',\pi^-a,K^-a)\nu_\tau$. We also calculate the forward-backward asymmetries for all the aforementioned channels. The interplay between the scalar and vector form factors for different observables is analyzed in detail. Our theoretical predictions supply useful guidance to the future tau experiments, such as those at Belle-II, Super Tau-Charm Facility and Tera-Z factory of Circular Electron-Positron Collider.</description>

      <title>Susceptibilities of rotating quark matter in Fourier-Bessel basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze various two-point correlation functions of fermionic bilinears in a rotating finite-size cylinder at finite temperatures, with a focus on susceptibility functions. Due to the noninvariance of radial translation, the susceptibility functions are constructed using the Dirac propagator in the Fourier-Bessel basis instead of the plane-wave basis. As a specific model to demonstrate the susceptibility functions in an interacting theory, we employ the two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. We show that the incompatibility between the mean-field analysis and the Fourier-Bessel basis is evaded under the local density approximation, and derive the resummation formulas of susceptibilities with the help of a Ward-Takahashi identity. The resulting formulation reveals the rotational effects on meson, baryon number, and topological susceptibilities, as well as the moment of inertia. Our results may serve a useful benchmark for future lattice QCD simulations in rotating frames.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced inclusive cross sections in hadronic collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss inclusive electromagnetic dissociation processes in proton--proton ($pp$) and proton--nucleus ($pA$) scattering at the LHC where one or both of the protons dissociate. These processes which involve the exchange of a virtual photon in the $t$--channel are calculable in terms of deep inelastic structure functions (virtual photoabsorption cross sections). For the $pA \to XA$ reaction there emerges the possibility of measuring the total photoabsorption cross section on the proton at very high energies.</description>

      <title>QCD phase transition at finite temperature and chemical potential with the non-extensive statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the application of the non-extensive correction to the equation of state (EoS) in the parton (hadron resonance) gas at high (low) temperature and a smooth interpolation of these two equation of states, a non-extensive version of EoS is constructed to investigate the properties of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase transition at finite temperature ($T$) and chemical potential ($\mu$). It is based on non-extensive statistics and characterized by a non-extensivity parameter $q$, which measures the degrees of deviation from the thermal equilibrium. We explore the QCD phase transition with $\mu=0$ MeV in the chiral and non-chiral limit cases, as well as the transition with finite $\mu$ in the non-chiral limit case. It is found that the dimensionless thermodynamic quantities such as the entropy density, the pressure, the energy density, the specific heat at constant volume and the trace anomaly are sensitive to the deviation of $q$ from unity and they become large both in the hadronic and quark-gluon plasma (QGP) phases with the increase of $q$. In the chiral limit case, the sound velocity squared ($(c_s^2)_q$) is insensitive to the deviation. However, in the non-chiral limit case, this deviation leads to nontrivial corrections of $(c_s^2)_q$ in the vicinity of the critical point ($T_c$) and at lower temperatures. Moreover, these dimensionless thermodynamic quantities are sensitive to the deviation of $\mu$ from zero and they become large both in the hadronic and QGP phases with the increase of $\mu$. However, for $(c_s^2)_q$, it increases in the vicinity of $T_c$ and decreases at lower temperature. Finally, we observe that our results in the non-chiral limit case with $q=1$ agree well with those from the Lattice QCD, the hadron resonance gas model, and the Thermal-Fist fit to the hadron yields in high energy nuclear collisions in the low temperature region up to $T\sim 150$ MeV.</description>

      <title>A Non-Inflationary Axion and ALP Misalignment Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on considerations of quantum gravity, global symmetries which lead to axions as pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons after low scale symmetry breaking cannot be exact at the Planck scale. Here, we show that Planck-suppressed terms which yield this symmetry breaking may provide a non-inflationary misalignment mechanism which can generate coherent oscillations of the axion and axion-like particle (ALP) fields at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Burgers equation for the bulk viscous pressure of quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dissipative properties of relativistic strongly interacting nuclear matter significantly influence the damping of stellar oscillations and density fluctuations during compact star mergers. In this work, we derive the evolution equation for the bulk viscous pressure in unpaired quark matter under small deviations from equilibrium. Our analysis reveals that it behaves like a two-component Burgers fluid. We identify four key transport coefficients -- two relaxation times and two bulk viscosity coefficients -- expressed in terms of equilibrium parameters and electroweak nonleptonic and semi-leptonic decay rates. The transport coefficients are evaluated for two distinct equations of state: one based on perturbative quantum chromodynamics and the other on a modified MIT bag model, valid in different density regimes. We also determine the temperature and density region where nonleptonic electroweak processes dominate the dissipation. Our formulation establishes a new way of describing bulk viscous effects in quark matter, applicable for numerical simulations of compact star mergers.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate molecular states formed by bottom mesons and multistrange baryons from both octet and decuplet flavor representations, using the local hidden gauge approach combined with coupled-channel Bethe-Salpeter equations. Focusing on strangeness sectors \(S = -1\) to \(-4\), we predict several bound states in the \(S=-1, I=1/2,~3/2\) and \(S=-2, I=0\) sectors. No bound states are found in other isospin channels, where the interaction is repulsive, nor in higher strangeness sectors. The binding energies are analyzed under different values of the cutoff regularization parameters, providing estimates of theoretical uncertainties. This study provides concrete predictions to support future experimental investigations and improve understanding of heavy-flavor multistrange exotic hadrons.</description>

      <title>Interplay of prompt and non-prompt photons in photon-triggered jet observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt photons are important yet challenging to observe in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, as they are produced in the early stages and traverse almost the entire QGP medium without interaction. Experimental analyses typically employ isolation cuts, in the hope to identify prompt photons. Most theoretical studies consider only events with actual prompt photons, assuming no contribution from isolated non-prompt photons to reduce computational cost. For the first time, we present a study that compares simulation results generated using inclusive (bremsstrahlung) and prompt-photon events with multiple experimental observables for both $p-p$ and $Pb-Pb$ collisions at $5.02$ TeV. Simulations are carried out using the multi-stage JETSCAPE framework tuned to describe the quenching of jets and hadrons. Isolated non-prompt photons are generated in hard photon bremsstrahlung, where the photon is radiated at a sufficient angle to the jet. Several photon triggered jet and jet substructure observables show significant contributions from inclusive photons, yielding an improvement in comparison with experimental data. Novel photon triggered jet substructure observables are also expected to show new structures, yet to be detected in experiment. This effort examines the significance of isolated non-prompt photons using parameters tuned for a simultaneous description of the leading hadron and jet spectrum, and thus provides an independent verification of the multistage evolution framework.</description>

      <title>Connecting t-channel Dark Matter Models to the Standard Model Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between simplified dark matter models featuring a $t$-channel scalar mediator and the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We focus on scenarios with fermionic dark matter interacting with leptons, under the assumption of Minimal Flavor Violation. The dimension-six SMEFT Wilson coefficients are computed in the Warsaw basis at one loop, with the aid of Matchete. Assuming a compressed mass spectrum for the dark matter and the mediator, we incorporate coannihilations, Sommerfeld enhancement, and bound-state effects in the relic density calculation. We then analyze the interplay between the dark matter energy density, global SMEFT fits, and direct detection constraints. Our results show that SMEFT bounds, though loop-suppressed, can meaningfully constrain the parameter space for $m_\chi \gtrsim 0.5$ TeV and $\mathcal{O}(1)$ portal couplings.</description>

      <title>Light Neutral Higgs-Boson Production at $e^+e^-$ Colliders in the Complex MSSM and NMSSM: A Full One-Loop Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For future precision analyses of the Higgs boson at $\approx 125$ GeV, $h_{125}$, a precise knowledge of its production and decay properties is mandatory. While in the Standard Model (SM) these calculations are quite advanced, in many models beyond the SM (BSM) a precise calculation is missing so far. We present the calculation of the Higgs-strahlung cross-sections at $e^+e^-$ colliders for the light neutral Higgs boson production in the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric SM (NMSSM) with complex parameters (cNMSSM). The evaluation is based on a full one-loop calculation of the production mechanism $e^+e^- \to h_1 Z$, including soft, hard, and collinear photon radiation. The dependence of the Higgs boson production cross-sections on the relevant cNMSSM parameters is analyzed numerically. In certain scenarios we find sizable corrections to the Higgs-strahlung cross-section. Normally, they reach about $10%$ of the tree-level results, but can also exceed 20%. Finally, the calculation is compared to the corresponding one in the Minimal Supersymmetric SM (MSSM). The knowledge of the full one-loop contributions to the Higgs-boson production is particularly important for a sound theoretical intemeasurements at future $e^+e^-$ colliders such as the ILC, CLIC, LCF, FCC-ee, or CEPC. It is planned to implement the evaluation of the Higgs boson production cross-sections into an add-on package to the code FeynHiggs.</description>

      <title>New Constraints on Neutrino-Dark Matter Interactions: A Comprehensive Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the interactions of neutrinos with the dark sector within the simplified model framework. We first derive the exact analytic formulas for the differential scattering cross sections of neutrinos with scalar, fermion, and vector dark matter (DM) for light dark sector models with mediators of different types. We then implement the full catalog of constraints on the parameter space of the neutrino-DM and neutrino-mediator couplings and masses, including cosmological and astrophysical bounds coming from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, Cosmic Microwave Background, DM and neutrino self-interactions, DM collisional damping, and astrophysical neutrino sources, as well as laboratory constraints from 3-body meson decays and invisible $Z$ decays. We find that most of the benchmarks in the DM mass-coupling plane adopted in previous studies to get an observable neutrino-DM interaction effect are actually ruled out by a combination of the above-mentioned constraints, especially the laboratory ones which are robust against astrophysical uncertainties and independent of the cosmological history. To illustrate the consequences of our new results, we take the galactic supernova neutrinos in the MeV energy range as a concrete example and highlight the difficulties in finding any observable effect of neutrino-DM interactions. Finally, we identify new benchmark points potentially promising for future observational prospects of the attenuation of the galactic supernova neutrino flux and comment on their implications for the detection prospects in future large-volume neutrino experiments such as JUNO, Hyper-K, and DUNE. We also comment on the ultraviolet-embedding of the effective neutrino-DM couplings.</description>

      <title>Quantum stress-energy at timelike boundaries: testing a new beyond-$\Lambda$CDM parameter with cosmological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the basic cosmological effects of a population of timelike boundaries -- a form of nontrivial spacetime topology -- containing a boundary layer of quantum stress energy. This accumulation of vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields can be consistently negative and UV sensitive, providing an additional source of cosmic energy density strong enough to compete with matter and dark energy. For boundary conditions enabling a solution with fixed comoving boundary size, this effect contributes a qualitatively new term to the Friedmann equation determining the expansion history, scaling like $-1/a$ for scale factor $a$. It naturally dominates at relatively late times ($a\approx1/2$), while leaving intact well-measured early universe physics such as big bang nucleosynthesis and recombination. For a wide window of parameters, the boundaries can be larger than the Planck length throughout their history, back through the start of inflation at any viable scale. We analyze CMB and BAO data sets (Planck, ACT, and DESI) allowing for this component, finding a slight preference ($\sim 2\sigma$) and a relaxation of current tensions in the data (including the neutrino mass) in a physical manner. This novel parameter fits into a larger space of physical parameters beyond-$\Lambda$CDM that may serve this role, including negative spatial curvature, which may also be motivated by topological considerations and chaotic dynamics. Finally, we comment on additional phenomenological prospects for testing for this form of topology in the universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper we have presented a general formalism for computing Feynman diagrams for scalar fields in curved spacetime at any loop order using heat kernel methods. The main technique used is the expansion of the fully off-diagonal heat kernel in Riemann normal coordinates. In this work we extend this to include fields of nonzero spin, in particular spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ fermions.</description>

      <title>Coexisting Flux String Vacua from Numerical K\"ahler Moduli Stabilisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of K\"ahler moduli stabilisation in Type IIB flux compactifications, combining advanced numerical techniques with analytical methods. Our JAX-based computational framework enables efficient scanning of the UV parameter space, while incorporating $\alpha'$ corrections, loop and non-perturbative effects, as well as uplift contributions to the scalar potential. The implementation features rigorous vacuum validation protocols derived from analytic results. We apply our methods to explicit flux compactifications on more than 80,000 Calabi-Yau threefolds with $h^{1,1}\leq 6$ K\"ahler moduli. By systematically scanning over a wide range of values of the flux superpotential $W_0$ and the string coupling $g_s$, we find explicit realisations of every established K\"ahler moduli stabilisation scenario: for $10^{-15} \leq |W_0| \leq 10^{-2}$ we obtain both KKLT-like and K\"ahler uplifted vacua, while for the broader range $10^{-1} \leq |W_0| \leq 10^2$ we recover LVS as well as LVS-like hybrid solutions. Notably, we discover significant parameter regions where multiple vacua coexist within a single flux potential, including novel configurations pairing AdS, Minkowski, and dS minima with different volume hierarchies. These findings enable, for the first time, the analysis of vacuum decay processes within fixed flux configurations, complementing the established theory of transitions between distinct flux vacua and decays towards decompactification.</description>

      <title>Testing Nambu-Goto approximation of cosmic string by lattice field simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise calculation of gravitational wave (GW) and particle emissions from cosmic string networks is of significant theoretical and experimental interest. In this Letter, we perform numerical simulations of near-global and local string networks, comparing the GW spectra predictions from both lattice field simulation and the Nambu-Goto (NG) approximation methods. We find the discrepancy between the GW spectra computed via the NG approximation and the lattice field simulation is negligible for near-global string and grow with increasing gauge coupling. Additionally, we confirm that particle emission significantly dominates energy emission, with the ratio of GW energy to particle energy approximately $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$ for both near-global and local string scenarios.</description>

      <title>Ultralight fuzzy dark matter review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter refers to the lightest potential dark matter candidates. We will focus on the mass range that has been studied using astrophysical and cosmological observations, corresponding to a mass $10^{-24} \, \mathrm{eV} \lesssim m \lesssim 10^{-18} \, \mathrm{eV}$. We will discuss the motivations for this mass range. The most studied model in this range corresponds to a minimally coupled, single, classical, spin-0 field comprising all dark matter. However, the work exploring extensions of this model (for example, higher spin, self-coupled, multiple field, and mixed models) will be one of the focuses of this review. The phenomenology associated with ultralight dark matter is rich and includes linear effects on the primordial power spectrum, core structures forming at the center of halos, nonlinear effects resulting in heating of stellar distributions, and non-relativistic effects relating to pulsar signals and black hole superradiance, to name a few. This set of effects has been studied using an equally extensive set of numerical tools. We will summarize the most common ones and discuss their applications and limitations. Ultralight dark matter also has a wide variety of observational constraints, including halo mass functions, the Lyman-alpha forest, halo density profiles, stellar dynamics, and black hole spins. We will review them focusing on the observations made, the method of study, and the major systematics. We will end with a discussion of the current status of the field and future work needed.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the potential experimental relevance of magnetically affected heavy-quark diffusion, we consider here a five-dimensional nonlinear Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton model to not only holographically model the QCD thermodynamics in a magnetic background, but also to probe the charged inner structure of a heavy quarkonium. The dual model's gravitational equations of motion can be solved in analytical form via the potential reconstruction method. Using a variety of tools -- spectral functions, hydrodynamic expansions or hanging strings -- we study the anisotropic diffusion constants and heavy-quark number susceptibility, each time reporting closed form expressions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of phase transitions between different quark matter phases occurring within quark stars, giving rise to the hybrid quark stars (HybQSs). Utilizing a well-established general parameterization of interacting quark matter, we construct quark star models featuring sharp first-order quark-quark phase transitions of various types, in contrast to the hadron-quark transition in conventional hybrid stars. We systematically investigate how recent observations, such as the pulsar mass measurements $M_{\rm TOV}\gtrsim2M_{\odot}$ and the GW170817's tidal deformability bound $\Lambda_{1.4M_{\odot}}&lt;800$, constrain the viable parameter space. We also identified twin stars in some of the HybQS parameter space. This work unveils new possibilities of phase transitions and the resulting new types of compact stars in realistic astrophysical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dark photon dark matter constraints and a tentative signal at the TASEH experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark photon is a well motivated candidate for the dark matter which comprises most of the mass of our visible Universe, leading to worldwide experimental and observational efforts towards its discovery. A primary tool in this search is the cavity haloscope, which facilitates resonantly enhanced conversion to photons from both dark photons and axions. In this context, limits from axion search experiments are often directly converted into dark photon constraints, without re-analyzing the original data. However, this rescaling may not fully capture all of the relevant physics due to various reasons. By re-examining data taken by the Taiwan Axion Search Experiment with Haloscope (TASEH) experiment, we derive a world-leading constraint on the dark photon parameter space, excluding $|\epsilon|\gtrsim2\times10^{-14}$ in the $19.46 - 19.84\,\mu$eV mass range, which exceeds the naive `rescaling limit' by roughly one order of magnitude. In this data, we also identify a tentative signal with a local significance of 4.7$\sigma$, previously disregarded due to an axion-specific veto, corresponding to a dark photon with mass $m_X \simeq 19.5\,\mu$eV ($f_X\simeq 4.71$ GHz) and kinetic mixing $\epsilon \simeq 2.2\times10^{-15}$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signatures of Periodic Motion near Higher-Derivative Einstein-\AE ther Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-derivative modifications of general relativity are generically expected from effective field theory approaches to quantum gravity, and they arise naturally in Lorentz-violating theories such as Einstein-Ether gravity. In this work, we investigate black hole spacetimes within Einstein-Ether theory supplemented by quadratic curvature corrections, including terms proportional to $R^2$, $R_{\mu\nu} R^{\mu\nu}$, and $R_{\mu\nu\lambda\rho} R^{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}$. We derive the corrected static, spherically symmetric metric perturbatively and examine its effects on the geodesic structure and gravitational wave emission. In particular, we analyze periodic timelike orbits in this background and compute the associated tensor-mode gravitational waveforms using the quadrupole approximation. Our results demonstrate that even small higher-derivative corrections can induce distinguishable shifts in the orbital dynamics and imprint characteristic phase modulations and harmonic deformations in the gravitational wave signal. These effects modify the frequency spectrum and amplitude envelope of $h_{+}$ and $h_{\times}$ in a manner sensitive to the coupling constants $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$, and the Ether parameter $c_{13}$. The resulting signatures provide a potential observational window into ultraviolet deviations from general relativity and Lorentz symmetry in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>SPARSE: Scattering Poles and Amplitudes from Radial Schr\"odinger Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm for the solution of a three-dimensional, two-body Schr\"odinger equation for scattering states. The equation is first reduced to a system of coupled radial Schr\"odinger equations. The system of differential equations is approximated as an ordinary linear nonhomogeneous system using the finite difference method. Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed at the origin and at an arbitrary large radius. The physical $K$-matrix for real energies is calculated from the numerical solutions of this system by comparison to the analytical real solutions for large distances. Scattering amplitudes are calculated from the physical $K$-matrix. Scattering poles are obtained by extrapolating the $K$-matrix to complex energies.</description>

      <title>On probing turbulence in core-collapse supernovae in upcoming neutrino detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino propagation through a turbulent medium can be highly non-adiabatic leading to distinct signatures in the survival probabilities. A core-collapse supernova can be host to a number of hydrodynamic instabilities which occur behind the shockfront. Such instabilities between the forward shock and a possible reverse shock can lead to cascades introducing turbulence in the associated matter profile, which can imprint itself in the neutrino signal. In this work, we consider realistic matter profiles and seed in the turbulence using a randomization scheme to study its effects on neutrino propagation in an effective two-flavor framework. We focus on the potential of upcoming neutrino detectors - DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande to constrain the parameters characterizing turbulence in a supernova. We find that these experiments can effectively constrain the parameter space for the amplitude of the spectra, they will only have mild sensitivity to the spectral index, and cannot inform on deviations from the usual Kolmogorov $5/3$ inverse power law. Furthermore, we also confirm that the double-dip feature, originally predicted in the neutrino spectra associated with forward and reverse shocks, can be completely washed away in the presence of turbulence, leading to total flavor depolarization.</description>

      <title>When The Standard Model Higgs Meets Its Lighter 95 GeV Twin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent reports from the Large Hadron Collider indicate two excesses: one in the lighter Higgs mass region around 95 GeV, and another in the rare $Z \gamma$ final state of the Standard Model (SM) 125 GeV Higgs decay. These anomalies are analyzed within the minimal gauged two-Higgs-doublet model (G2HDM). A viable parameter space in G2HDM is identified that can account for both excesses. Within the viable parameter space, we find a strong correlation between the signal strengths of the SM 125 GeV Higgs decays into $\gamma \gamma$ and $Z \gamma$ modes. However, this correlation does not extend to the lighter 95 GeV Higgs.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Ray Cooling in Active Galactic Nuclei as a New Probe of Inelastic Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel way to probe inelastic dark matter using cosmic-ray (CR) cooling in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Dark matter (DM) in the vicinity of supermassive black holes may scatter off CRs, resulting in the rapid cooling of CRs for sufficiently large cross sections. This in turn can alter the high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray fluxes detected from these sources. We show that AGN cooling bounds obtained through the multimessenger data of NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056 allow to reach unprecedently large mass splittings for inelastic DM ($\gtrsim$ TeV), orders of magnitude larger than those probed by direct detection experiments and DM capture in neutron stars. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cooling bounds from AGNs can probe thermal light DM with small mass splittings. This provides novel and complementary constraints in parts of a parameter space accessible solely by colliders and beam dump experiments.</description>

      <title>Preponderant Orbital Polarization in Relativistic Magnetovortical Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish thermodynamic stability and gauge invariance in the magnetovortical matter of Dirac fermions under the coexistent rotation and strong magnetic field. The corresponding partition function reveals that the orbital contribution to bulk thermodynamics preponderates over the conventional contribution from anomaly-related spin effects. This orbital preponderance macroscopically manifests itself in the sign inversion of the induced charge and current in the magnetovortical matter, and can be tested experimentally as the flip of the angular momentum polarization of magnetovortical matter when the magnetic field strength is increased.</description>

      <title>No-quenching baseline for energy loss signals in oxygen-oxygen collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we perform computations of inclusive jet, and semi-inclusive jet-hadron cross sections for minimum bias oxygen-oxygen collisions at RHIC and LHC collision energies. We compute the no-quenching baseline for the jet nuclear modification factor $R_\mathrm{AA}$ and jet-, and hadron-triggered semi-inclusive nuclear modification factors $I_\mathrm{AA}$. We do this with state-of-the-art nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs), next-to-leading-order matrix elements, parton shower, and hadronization. We observe deviations from unity due to cold-nuclear matter effects, even without quenching. We demonstrate that the parton distribution uncertainties constitute a significant obstacle in detecting energy loss in small collision systems. Hadron-triggered observables are particularly sensitive to uncertainties due to correlations between the trigger and analyzed particles. For jet-triggered $I_\mathrm{AA}$, there exists a kinematic window in which nPDF and scale uncertainties cancel dramatically while showing little sensitivity to parton shower and hadronization models, addressing a major limiting factor for energy loss discovery in small systems.</description>

Abstract: Astrophysical observations suggest that most of the matter in the cosmos consists of a new form that has not been observed on Earth. The nature and origin of this mysterious dark matter are among the most pressing questions in fundamental science. In this review we summarize the current state of dark matter research from two perspectives. First, we provide an overview of the leading theoretical proposals for dark matter. And second, we describe how these proposals have driven a broad and diverse global search program for dark matter involving direct laboratory searches and astrophysical observations. This review is based on a Green Paper on dark matter prepared as part of the 2020 Astroparticle Community Planning initiative undertaken by the Canadian Subatomic Physics community but has been significantly updated to reflect recent advances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In models with extended scalar sectors consisting of multiple Higgs doublets that trigger spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking, it might be expected that the abundance of dimensionful quadratic couplings in the scalar potential could allow for a regime where, apart from the would-be Goldstone bosons and a neutral Higgs-like state, all new scalars have masses much larger than the electroweak scale. In the case of models where CP invariance holds at the lagrangian level but is broken by the vacuum, we show that such a reasonable expectation does not hold. When perturbativity requirements are placed on the dimensionless quartic couplings, the spectrum of the new scalars includes one charged and two additional neutral states whose masses cannot be much larger than the electroweak scale.</description>

      <title>Binary superfluids: Low-energy properties and dissipative processes from spontaneous emission of massive phonons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the low-energy properties of binary superfluids with density-dependent interactions. Adding an intra-species coupling that induces an explicit soft symmetry-breaking, we determine the background pressure and we show that the low-energy spectrum consists of a massless Nambu- Goldstone boson and a massive (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone boson. When the background velocities of the two superfluids are transonic, the system is characterized by two distinct acoustic horizons: the hydrodynamic analogue of the black hole event horizon. The Hawking-like emission occurring at these horizons produces an effective friction on the fluids. We compute the viscosity-to-entropy ratios close to the two acoustic horizons, finding that the emission of pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons violates the bound conjectured by Kovtun, Son and Starinet.</description>

      <title>RG-stable parameter relations of a scalar field theory in absence of a symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11011v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability of tree-level relations among the parameters of a quantum field theory with respect to renormalization group (RG) running is typically explained by the existence of a symmetry. We examine a toy model of a quantum field theory of two real scalars in which a tree-level relation among the squared-mass parameters of the scalar potential appears to be RG-stable without the presence of an appropriate underlying symmetry. The stability of this relation with respect to renormalization group running can be explained by complexifying the original scalar field theory. It is then possible to exhibit a symmetry that guarantees the relations of relevant beta functions of squared-mass parameters of the complexified theory. Among these relations, we can identify equations that are algebraically identical to the corresponding equations that guarantee the stability of the relations among the squared-mass parameters of the original real scalar field theory where the symmetry of the complexified theory is no longer present.</description>

      <title>Filtered cogenesis of PBH dark matter and baryons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel cogenesis of baryon and dark matter (DM) in the Universe by utilising a first-order phase transition (FOPT) in the dark sector containing an asymmetric Dirac fermion $\chi$. Due to the mass difference of $\chi$ across the bubble walls, it is energetically favourable for $\chi$ to get trapped in the false vacuum leading to the formation of Fermi-ball, which can self-collapse to form primordial black hole (PBH) if $\chi$ has a sufficiently large Yukawa interaction. While such PBH formed out of false vacuum collapse can give rise to the DM in the Universe, a tiny amount of asymmetric $\chi$ leaking into the true vacuum through the bubble walls can transfer the dark asymmetry into the visible sector via decay. The same mass difference of $\chi$ across the two minima which decides the amount of trapping or filtering of $\chi$, also allows $\chi$ decay into visible sector in the true minima while keeping it stable in the false vacuum. Our filtered cogenesis scenario can be probed via FOPT generated stochastic gravitational waves (GW) at near future detectors in addition to the well-known detection aspects of asteroid mass PBH constituting DM in the Universe.</description>

Abstract: Recently, a new approach for high loop integrals has been proposed in \cite{Huang:2024nij}, where the whole parameter integration has been divided into two parts: a one-loop-like integration and the remaining parameter integration. In this paper, we systematically study the one-loop-like integrals. We establish the IBP relations for the integral family and show how to complete the reduction. We find the canonical master integrals and write down the corresponding canonical differential equations.</description>

      <title>Probing "Continuous Spin" QED with Rare Atomic Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An intriguing and elementary possibility is that familiar massless particles like the photon could be "continuous spin" particles (CSP) with a small but non-zero spin Casimir $\rho$. In this case, the familiar two polarization states of the photon are accompanied by an infinite tower of integer spaced helicity modes, with couplings dictated entirely by Lorentz symmetry and the parameter $\rho$. We present a formalism for computing bound state atomic transitions for scalar QED when $\rho \neq 0$, employing path integral methods not often used for bound state computations, but that readily generalize to the CSP case. We compute several illustrative amplitudes and show that $\rho\neq 0$ opens new decay channels for atomic transitions with rates controlled by $\rho\alpha/\omega$ for transition frequency $\omega$. These new channels can appreciably modify the rates of "forbidden" transitions. For example, the lifetime of the hydrogen $2s$ state would be affected at $O(1)$ for $\rho\sim 0.1$ eV, suggesting new directions for fundamental tests of QED in laboratory experiments.</description>

Abstract: The minimal theory in which baryon number is spontaneously broken at the low scale predicts new fermions, one of which is a dark matter candidate, from gauge anomaly cancellation. We discuss the production mechanisms and decays of these new fermions, which include channels with multi-leptons, and channels with long-lived charged fermions that can give rise to exotic signatures with 'kinked' tracks at the Large Hadron Collider. We evaluate the contraints on the theory from current LHC searches and measurements, and briefly comment on the excess in top pair production at threshold recently reported by CMS. We also discuss predictions for the $h \to \gamma Z_B$ decay, where $h$ is the SM-like Higgs and $Z_B$ is the new gauge boson associated with baryon number.</description>

Abstract: The heavy-to-heavy exclusive semileptonic transitions of singly heavy baryons (SHBs) are investigated within the framework of the Hypercentral Constituent Quark Model (hCQM). The six-dimensional hyperradial Schr\"{o}dinger equation is solved in the variational approach to calculate the ground state masses of bottom and charmed baryons. The transition magnetic moments and radiative $M1$ decay widths are calculated using the spin-flavour wave function and the effective quark masses of constituent baryon. The Isgur-Wise function (IWF) is determined at zero recoil to compute the $b \rightarrow c$ semileptonic decay. Additionally, the branching ratios, as well as the slope and convexity parameters of IWF are evaluated and compared with results from other studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct light-cone sum rules for various types of effective form factors in the $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda \ell^+\ell^-$ and $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda \gamma$ decays by analyzing vacuum-to-$\Lambda_b$ (or $\gamma^\ast$-to-$\Lambda_b$) correlation functions with the light $\Lambda$-baryon interpolating current. These form factors, defined via hadronic matrix elements within soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), enter the next-to-leading-power QCD factorization formulas for large-recoil transitions. Implementing the perturbative matching from $\text{SCET}_\text{I}$ to heavy quark effective theory, we determine the hard-collinear functions at next-to-leading-order accuracy. Based on light-cone sum rule predictions for the $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda$ form factors, we compute the $q^2$-dependent differential branching fraction, forward-backward asymmetry and dilepton longitudinal polarization fraction for $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda \ell^+\ell^-$ decay, as well as the branching fraction for $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda \gamma$ decay.</description>

      <title>The Echo 12-23 Texture: A Novel Flavour Paradigm for Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a flavour guided model that realises the distinctive Echo 12-23 Texture in the neutrino mass matrix through a non-trivial interplay of symmetries. While the model accounts for charged lepton mass hierarchy, the texture offers interesting insights specifically into neutrino mass ordering and flavour dynamics. With clear imprints on low energy observables, the framework provides a minimal yet testable path toward understanding the origin of neutrino properties.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger signatures of delayed choked jets in tidal disruption events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent radio observations and coincident neutrino detections suggest that some tidal disruption events (TDEs) exhibit late-time activities, relative to the optical emission peak, and these may be due to delayed outflows launched from the central supermassive black hole. We investigate the possibility that jets launched with a time delay of days to months, interact with a debris that may expand outwards. We discuss the effects of the time delay and expansion velocity on the outcomes of jet breakout and collimation. We find that a jet with an isotropic-equivalent luminosity of $\lesssim 5 \times 10^{45}\,{\rm erg/s}$ is likely to be choked for a delay time of $\sim 3$ months. We also study the observational signatures of such delayed choked jets. The jet-debris interaction preceding the breakout would lead to particle acceleration and the resulting synchrotron emission can be detected by current and near-future radio, optical and X-ray telescopes, and the expanding jet-driven debris could explain late-time radio emission. We discuss high-energy neutrino production in delayed choked jets, and the time delay can significantly alleviate the difficulty of the hidden jet scenario in explaining neutrino coincidences.</description>

      <title>Observational Probes of the Neutron Star Equation of State with Hyperons, Bosonic Dark Matter, and Quark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of dark matter in neutron stars is of growing interest due to its possible impact on their structure and observables. Among proposed candidates, the hypothetical sexaquark has emerged as a promising bosonic dark matter particle, potentially forming under extreme conditions in neutron star cores. We investigate this scenario using a relativistic density functional approach, including hyperons (DD2Y-T model) for the hadronic phase, coupled to a deconfined quark phase described by a non-local Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. The phase transition is modeled through a smooth crossover, and sexaquark-baryon interactions are introduced via an effective mass shift representing repulsion. We assess whether this hybrid scenario, incorporating hyperons, bosonic dark matter, and deconfined quark matter, is consistent with multi-messenger constraints from neutron stars. By scanning the parameter space, we identify sexaquark masses that are consistent with mass-radius measurements and tidal deformability. Our results show that the presence of the sexaquark softens the equation of state, enabling the model to satisfy both the radius and tidal deformability constraints around the canonical $1.4M_\odot$ neutron stars. We incorporate all available NICER data, including PSR J0437-4715 and newly published PSR J0614-3329. We find out that hybrid stars with sexaquark mass near 1900 MeV agree with all current observational limits, including HESS J1731-347 and PSR J0952-0607, representing the lightest and most massive known neutron stars. Furthermore, we perform a Bayesian analysis, which yields a favored sexaquark mass range of 1885-1935 MeV, supporting the potential role of this exotic particle in the interiors of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Cosmological scaling of precursor domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain wall (DW) networks have a large impact on cosmology and present interesting dynamics that can be controlled by various scaling regimes. In the first stage after spontaneous breaking of the discrete symmetry, the network is seeded with `DW precursors', the zeros of a tachyonic field. At sufficiently weak coupling, this stage can be quite long. The network is then driven to a non-relativistic scaling regime: in flat spacetime the correlation length grows like $L\sim t^{\kappa}$ with $\kappa=1/2$. We focus on the precursor regime in cosmology, assuming a power-law scale factor $a\propto t^\alpha$. We obtain the scaling exponent as a function of the external parameter, $\kappa(\alpha)$, by explicit computation in $1+1$ and $2+1$ dimensions, and find a smooth transition from nonrelativistic scaling with $\kappa\simeq 1/2$ for $\alpha\lesssim1/2$ to DW gas regime $\kappa \simeq \alpha$ for $\alpha\gtrsim1/2$, confirming previous arguments. The precise form of the transition $\kappa(\alpha)$ is surprisingly independent of dimension, suggesting that similar results should also be valid in $3+1$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh-energy neutrino searches using next-generation gravitational wave detectors at radio neutrino detectors: GRAND, IceCube-Gen2 Radio, and RNO-G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers can be sources of ultrahigh-energy (UHE) cosmic rays and potential emitters of UHE neutrinos. The upcoming and current radio neutrino detectors like the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND), IceCube-Gen2 Radio, and the Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) are projected to reach the required sensitivities to search for these neutrinos. In particular, in conjunction with the next-generation of gravitational wave (GW) detectors like Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), GW-triggered stacking searches can be performed with the UHE neutrino detectors. In this work, we explore the prospects of such searches by implementing in our analysis an upper distance limit based on the sky-localization capabilities of the GW detectors from which meaningful triggers can be collected. We find that if each GW burst is associated with a total isotropic-equivalent energy of $\sim 10^{50} - 10^{51}$ erg emitted in UHE neutrinos, along with a corresponding beaming fraction of $1$%, GRAND and IceCube-Gen2 Radio have a large probability ($\sim 99$%) to detect a coincident neutrino event using the joint combination of CE+ET in a timescale of less than 15 years of operation for our fiducial choice of parameters. In case of nondetections, the parameter spaces can be constrained at $3\sigma$ level in similar timescales of operation. We also highlight and discuss the prospects of such joint radio neutrino detector network, their importance, and their role in facilitating synergic GW and neutrino observations in the next era of multimessenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Topological data analysis of the deconfinement transition in SU(3) lattice gauge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the confining and deconfining phases of pure $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory with topological data analysis. This provides unique insights into long range correlations of field configurations across the confinement-deconfinement transition. Specifically, we analyze non-trivial structures in electric and magnetic field energy densities as well as Polyakov loop traces and a Polyakov loop-based variant of the topological density. The Betti curves for filtrations based on the electric and magnetic field energy densities reveal signals of electromagnetic dualities. These dualities can be associated with an interchange in the roles of local lumps of electric and magnetic energy densities around the phase transition. Moreover, we show that plaquette susceptibilities can manifest in the geometric features captured by the Betti curves. We also compare these findings against earlier results for $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and elaborate on the significant differences. Our results demonstrate that topological data analysis can identify clear differences between phase transitions of first and second order for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories and provides unprecedented insights into the relevant structures in their vicinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $1+1$ flat spacetime dynamics of a classical field configuration corresponding to an ensemble of sine-Gordon kinks and antikinks, semi-classically coupled to a quantum field. This coupling breaks the integrability of the sine-Gordon model resulting in the background's decay into quantum radiation as kink-antikink pairs annihilate. We find evidence that, on average, the energy of the ensemble scales as $t^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha&lt;1$ and independent of the coupling strength or the mass of the quantum field. The generalization of this result to domain wall networks in higher spacetime dimensions could be relevant to particle production in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Assisted Unfolding for Neutrino Cross-section Measurements with the OmniFold Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The choice of unfolding method for a cross-section measurement is tightly coupled to the model dependence of the efficiency correction and the overall impact of cross-section modeling uncertainties in the analysis. A key issue is the dimensionality used in unfolding, as the kinematics of all outgoing particles in an event typically affect the reconstruction performance in a neutrino detector. OmniFold is an unfolding method that iteratively reweights a simulated dataset, using machine learning to utilize arbitrarily high-dimensional information, that has previously been applied to proton-proton and proton-electron datasets. This paper demonstrates OmniFold's application to a neutrino cross-section measurement for the first time using a public T2K near detector simulated dataset, comparing its performance with traditional approaches using a mock data study.</description>

      <title>On the Probability of the Initial Conditions for Inflation and Slow Contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some recent studies based on numerical relativity simulations claim that slow contraction/ekpyrosis is strongly preferred over inflation as the smoothing mechanism that brought the universe into the homogeneous, isotropic and flat state we observe today on large scales. In this paper, we evaluate the likelihood of the initial conditions employed in the aforementioned simulations by estimating the probability that a free scalar field dominating the universe at the beginning of inflation or ekpyrosis will be sufficiently homogeneous on scales comparable to the Hubble radius at that time. We explore the space of parameters that characterize the initial power spectrum of the scalar field, finding that either can be more likely than the other for a fixed choice of parameters. On the other hand, when we extremize over these parameters, we find that the maximal probability for inflation is much higher than that of ekpyrosis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we explore the chaotic behavior of non-integrable QFTs and compare them to integrable ones. We choose as prototypes the double sine-Gordon and the sine-Gordon models. We analyze their discrete spectrum determined by a truncation method. We examine the map of the corresponding energy eigenvalues to the eigenvalues of the random matrix theory (RMT) Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). This is done by computing the following properties: (a) The distribution of the adjacent spacings and their ratios (b) Higher order spacings and ratios (c) Pair correlations (d) Spectral form factors and (e) Spectral rigidity. For these properties we determine the differences between the integrable and non-integrable theories and verify that the former admits a Poisson behavior and the latter GOE (apart from the spectral rigidity).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The influence of a possible low gravity scale, concretely through the presence of extra dimensions or additional species, on radiation properties of micro black holes is investigated. In particular, the suppression of evaporation through the so-called memory-burden effect is shown to be stronger, occurs earlier and with sharper transition compared to the canonical Planck-scale regime. It is furthermore shown how this affects the possibility of light primordial black hole dark matter, constraints on which may weaken substantially and allow them to be as light as $10^{-5}\,M_{\rm P}$, thereby lying in the particle regime.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Dark-Matter Spikes and the Final-Parsec Problem: Bayesian constraints from the NANOGrav 15-Year Gravitational-Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A self-interacting dark-matter (SIDM) density spike around merging supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may be able to supply the dynamical friction needed to shrink binaries from $\sim 1\, \mathrm{pc}$ to $\sim 10^{-2} \,\mathrm{pc}$, thereby resolving the long-standing "final-parsec problem". Embedding the binary-halo system in a cosmological population model, we evolve the inspiral under the combined influence of gravitational-wave (GW) emission and SIDM drag, compute the resulting nanohertz GW background, and confront it with the NANOGrav 15 year pulsar-timing data. A six-parameter Bayesian analysis, performed with a Gaussian-process-accelerated Markov chain Monte Carlo, yields posterior constraints on the cross-section per unit mass and maximum circular velocity values that were consistent with independent galaxy-rotation and cluster-lensing limits. Within this parameter space, the SIDM spike remains intact, supplies sufficient friction to overcome the stellar depletion barrier, and produces a characteristic-strain spectrum that matches the NANOGrav signal as well as phenomenological astrophysical models.</description>
