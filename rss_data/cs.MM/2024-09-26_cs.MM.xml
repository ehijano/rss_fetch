      <title>Analyzing Recursiveness in Multimodal Generative Artificial Intelligence: Stability or Divergence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the latest trends in generative Artificial Intelligence is tools that generate and analyze content in different modalities, such as text and images, and convert information from one to the other. From a conceptual point of view, it is interesting to study whether these modality changes incur information loss and to what extent. This is analogous to variants of the classical game telephone, where players alternate between describing images and creating drawings based on those descriptions leading to unexpected transformations of the original content. In the case of AI, modality changes can be applied recursively, starting from an image to extract a text that describes it; using the text to generate a second image, extracting a text that describes it, and so on. As this process is applied recursively, AI tools are generating content from one mode to use them to create content in another mode and so on. Ideally, the embeddings of all of them would remain close to those of the original content so that only small variations are observed in the generated content versus the original one. However, it may also be the case the distance to the original embeddings increases in each iteration leading to a divergence in the process and to content that is barely related to the original one. In this paper, we present the results of an empirical study on the impact of recursive modality changes using GPT-4o, a state-of-the-art AI multimodal tool, and DALL-E 3. The results show that the multimodality loop diverges from the initial image without converging to anything specific. We have observed differences depending on the type of initial image and the configuration of the models. These findings are particularly relevant due to the increasing use of these tools for content generation, reconstruction, and adaptation, and their potential implications for the content on the Internet of the future.</description>

      <title>FastTalker: Jointly Generating Speech and Conversational Gestures from Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating 3D human gestures and speech from a text script is critical for creating realistic talking avatars. One solution is to leverage separate pipelines for text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-gesture (STG), but this approach suffers from poor alignment of speech and gestures and slow inference times. In this paper, we introduce FastTalker, an efficient and effective framework that simultaneously generates high-quality speech audio and 3D human gestures at high inference speeds. Our key insight is reusing the intermediate features from speech synthesis for gesture generation, as these features contain more precise rhythmic information than features re-extracted from generated speech. Specifically, 1) we propose an end-to-end framework that concurrently generates speech waveforms and full-body gestures, using intermediate speech features such as pitch, onset, energy, and duration directly for gesture decoding; 2) we redesign the causal network architecture to eliminate dependencies on future inputs for real applications; 3) we employ Reinforcement Learning-based Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to enhance both performance and inference speed by optimizing our network architecture. Experimental results on the BEAT2 dataset demonstrate that FastTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in both speech synthesis and gesture generation, processing speech and gestures in 0.17 seconds per second on an NVIDIA 3090.</description>

      <title>Language-oriented Semantic Communication for Image Transmission with Fine-Tuned Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ubiquitous image transmission in emerging applications brings huge overheads to limited wireless resources. Since that text has the characteristic of conveying a large amount of information with very little data, the transmission of the descriptive text of an image can reduce the amount of transmitted data. In this context, this paper develops a novel semantic communication framework based on a text-2-image generative model (Gen-SC). In particular, a transmitter converts the input image to textual modality data. Then the text is transmitted through a noisy channel to the receiver. The receiver then uses the received text to generate images. Additionally, to improve the robustness of text transmission over noisy channels, we designed a transformer-based text transmission codec model. Moreover, we obtained a personalized knowledge base by fine-tuning the diffusion model to meet the requirements of task-oriented transmission scenarios. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can achieve high perceptual quality with reducing the transmitted data volume by up to 99% and is robust to wireless channel noise in terms of portrait image transmission.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Cognitive State Classification from Speech with Multi-View Pseudo-Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of labeled data is a common challenge in speech classification tasks, particularly those requiring extensive subjective assessment, such as cognitive state classification. In this work, we propose a Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) framework, introducing a novel multi-view pseudo-labeling method that leverages both acoustic and linguistic characteristics to select the most confident data for training the classification model. Acoustically, unlabeled data are compared to labeled data using the Frechet audio distance, calculated from embeddings generated by multiple audio encoders. Linguistically, large language models are prompted to revise automatic speech recognition transcriptions and predict labels based on our proposed task-specific knowledge. High-confidence data are identified when pseudo-labels from both sources align, while mismatches are treated as low-confidence data. A bimodal classifier is then trained to iteratively label the low-confidence data until a predefined criterion is met. We evaluate our SSL framework on emotion recognition and dementia detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised learning using only 30% of the labeled data and significantly outperforms two selected baselines.</description>

      <title>Navigating Weight Prediction with Diet Diary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current research in food analysis primarily concentrates on tasks such as food recognition, recipe retrieval and nutrition estimation from a single image. Nevertheless, there is a significant gap in exploring the impact of food intake on physiological indicators (e.g., weight) over time. This paper addresses this gap by introducing the DietDiary dataset, which encompasses daily dietary diaries and corresponding weight measurements of real users. Furthermore, we propose a novel task of weight prediction with a dietary diary that aims to leverage historical food intake and weight to predict future weights. To tackle this task, we propose a model-agnostic time series forecasting framework. Specifically, we introduce a Unified Meal Representation Learning (UMRL) module to extract representations for each meal. Additionally, we design a diet-aware loss function to associate food intake with weight variations. By conducting experiments on the DietDiary dataset with two state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, NLinear and iTransformer, we demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves superior performance compared to the original models. We make our dataset, code, and models publicly available at: https://yxg1005.github.io/weight-prediction/.</description>

      <title>ChatDiet: Empowering Personalized Nutrition-Oriented Food Recommender Chatbots through an LLM-Augmented Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The profound impact of food on health necessitates advanced nutrition-oriented food recommendation services. Conventional methods often lack the crucial elements of personalization, explainability, and interactivity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) bring interpretability and explainability, their standalone use falls short of achieving true personalization. In this paper, we introduce ChatDiet, a novel LLM-powered framework designed specifically for personalized nutrition-oriented food recommendation chatbots. ChatDiet integrates personal and population models, complemented by an orchestrator, to seamlessly retrieve and process pertinent information. The personal model leverages causal discovery and inference techniques to assess personalized nutritional effects for a specific user, whereas the population model provides generalized information on food nutritional content. The orchestrator retrieves, synergizes and delivers the output of both models to the LLM, providing tailored food recommendations designed to support targeted health outcomes. The result is a dynamic delivery of personalized and explainable food recommendations, tailored to individual user preferences. Our evaluation of ChatDiet includes a compelling case study, where we establish a causal personal model to estimate individual nutrition effects. Our assessments, including a food recommendation test showcasing a 92\% effectiveness rate, coupled with illustrative dialogue examples, underscore ChatDiet's strengths in explainability, personalization, and interactivity.</description>

      <title>HybridVC: Efficient Voice Style Conversion with Text and Audio Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce HybridVC, a voice conversion (VC) framework built upon a pre-trained conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) that combines the strengths of a latent model with contrastive learning. HybridVC supports text and audio prompts, enabling more flexible voice style conversion. HybridVC models a latent distribution conditioned on speaker embeddings acquired by a pretrained speaker encoder and optimises style text embeddings to align with the speaker style information through contrastive learning in parallel. Therefore, HybridVC can be efficiently trained under limited computational resources. Our experiments demonstrate HybridVC's superior training efficiency and its capability for advanced multi-modal voice style conversion. This underscores its potential for widespread applications such as user-defined personalised voice in various social media platforms. A comprehensive ablation study further validates the effectiveness of our method.</description>
