      <title>Anomalous diffusion via iterative quantitative homogenization: an overview of the main ideas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous diffusion is the fundamental ansatz of phenomenological theories of passive scalar turbulence, and has been confirmed numerically and experimentally to an extraordinary extent. The purpose of this survey is to discuss our recent result, in which we construct a class of incompressible vector fields that have many of the properties observed in a fully turbulent velocity field, and for which the associated scalar advection-diffusion equation generically displays anomalous diffusion. Our main contribution is to propose an analytical framework in which to study anomalous diffusion via a backward cascade of renormalized eddy viscosities.</description>

      <title>On the cutoff phenomenon for fast diffusion and porous medium equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cutoff phenomenon, conceptualized at the origin for finite Markov chains, states that for a parametric family of evolution equations, started from a point, the distance towards a long time equilibrium may become more and more abrupt for certain choices of initial conditions, when the parameter tends to infinity. This threshold phenomenon can be seen as a critical competition between trend to equilibrium and worst initial condition. In this note, we investigate this phenomenon beyond stochastic processes, in the context of the analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations, by proving cutoff for the fast diffusion and porous medium Fokker-Planck equations on the Euclidean space, when the dimension tends to infinity. We formulate the phenomenon using quadratic Wasserstein distance, as well as using specific relative entropy and Fisher information. Our high dimensional asymptotic analysis uses the exact solvability of the model involving Barenblatt profiles. It includes the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics as a special linear case.</description>

      <title>Rigorous analysis of shape transitions in frustrated elastic ribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ribbons are elastic bodies of thickness $t$ and width $w$, where $t\ll w\ll 1$. Many ribbons in nature have a non-trivial internal geometry, making them incompatible with the Euclidean space; this incompatibility, which can be represented as a failure of the Gauss-Codazzi equations for surfaces, often results in shape transitions between narrow and wide ribbons. These transitions depend on the internal geometry: ribbons whose incompatibility arises from failure of the Gauss equation always exhibit a transition, whereas some, but not all, of those whose incompatibility arises from failure of the Codazzi equations do. We give the first rigorous analysis of this behavior, mainly for ribbons whose first fundamental form is flat: for Gauss-incompatible ribbons we identify the natural energy scaling of the problem and prove the existence of a shape transition, and for Codazzi-incompatible ribbons we give a necessary condition for a transition to occur. The results are obtained by calculating the $\Gamma$-limits, as $t,w\to 0$, for narrow ribbons ($w^2 \ll t$), and wide ribbons (taking $t$ to zero and then $w$), in the natural energy scalings dictated by the internal geometry.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Analysis of an Optimal Insulation Problem on Non-Smooth Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an insulation problem that seeks the optimal distribution of a fixed amount $m&gt;0$ of insulating material coating an insulated boundary $\Gamma_I\subseteq \partial\Omega$ of a thermally conducting body $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, $d\in \mathbb{N}$. The thickness of the thin insulating layer $\Sigma_{I}^{\varepsilon}$ is given locally via $\varepsilon h$, where $h\colon \Gamma_{I}\to [0,+\infty)$ specifies the (to be determined) distribution of the insulating material. We establish $\Gamma(L^2(\mathbb{R}^d))$-convergence of the problem (as $\varepsilon\to 0^+$). Different from the existing literature, which predominantly assumes that the thermally conducting body $\Omega$ has a $C^{1,1}$-boundary, we merely assume that $\Gamma_I$ is piece-wise flat. To overcome this lack of boundary regularity, we define the thin insulating boundary layer $\Sigma_{I}^{\varepsilon}$ using a Lipschitz continuous transversal vector field rather than the outward unit normal vector field. The piece-wise flatness condition on $\Gamma_I$ is only needed to prove the $\liminf$-estimate. In fact, for the $\limsup$-estimate is enough that the thermally conducting body $\Omega$ has a $C^{0,1}$-boundary.</description>

      <title>Liouville theorems and new gradient estimates for positive solutions to $\Delta_pv+a(v+b)^q=0$ on a complete manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the Saloff-Coste Sobolev inequality and Nash-Moser iteration method to study the local and global behaviors of positive solutions to the nonlinear elliptic equation $\Delta_pv+a(v+b)^q=0$ defined on a complete Riemannian manifold $\left(M,g\right)$ with Ricci lower bound, where $p&gt;1$ is a constant and $\Delta_pv=\mathrm{div}\left(\left|\nabla v\right|^{p-2}\nabla v\right)$ is the usual $p$-Laplace operator. Under certain assumptions on $a$, $p$ and $q$, we derive some gradient estimates and Liouville type theorems for positive solutions to the above equation. In particular, under certain assumptions on $a$, $b$, $p$ and $q$ we show whether or not the exact Cheng-Yau $\log$-gradient estimates for the positive solutions to $\Delta_pv+av^q=0$ on $\left(M,g\right)$ with Ricci lower bound hold true is equivalent to whether or not the positive solutions to this equation fulfill Harnack inequality, and hence some new Cheng-Yau $\log$-gradient estimates are established.</description>

      <title>The Navier-Stokes limit of kinetic equations for low regularity data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the link between kinetic equations (including Boltzmann with or without cutoff assumption and Landau equations) and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. We work with strong solutions and we treat all the cases in a unified framework. The main purpose of this work is to be as accurate as possible in terms of functional spaces. More precisely, it is well-known that the Navier-Stokes equation can be solved in a lower regularity setting (in the space variable) than kinetic equations. Our main result allows to get a rigorous link between solutions to the Navier-Stokes equation with such low regularity data and kinetic equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a coupled system describing the interaction between the Relativistic Cucker-Smale model and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations via a drag force, and establish a global existence theory as well as the time-asymptotic behavior of the proposed model in $\mathbb{T}^3$. It is shown that the coupled system exhibits an exponential alignment under some specific assumptions, and that weak solutions exist globally for general initial data.</description>

      <title>Boundedness and stability of a 2-D parabolic-elliptic system arising in biological transport networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the Dirichlet initial-boundary value problem of a 2-D parabolic-elliptic system proposed to model the formation of biological transport networks. Even if global weak solutions for this system are known to exist, how to improve the regularity of weak solutions is a challenging problem due to the peculiar cubic nonlinearity and the possible elliptic singularity of the system. Global-in-time existence of classical solutions has recently been established showing that finite time singularities cannot emerge in this problem. However, whether or not singularities in infinite time can be precluded was still pending. In this work, we show that classical solutions of the initial-boundary value problem are uniformly bounded in time as long as $\gamma\geq1$ and $\kappa$ is suitably large, closing this gap in the literature. Moreover, uniqueness of classical solutions is also achieved based on the uniform-in-time bounds. Furthermore, it is shown that the corresponding stationary problem possesses a unique classical stationary solution which is semi-trivial, and that is globally exponentially stable, that is, all solutions of the time dependent problem converge exponentially fast to the semi-trivial steady state for $\kappa$ large enough.</description>

      <title>Decay estimate for subcritical semilinear damped wave equations with slowly decreasing data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the decay properties of non-negative solutions to the one-dimensional defocusing damped wave equation in the Fujita subcritical case under a specific initial condition. Specifically, we assume that the initial data are positive, satisfy a condition ensuring the positiveness of solutions, and exhibit polynomial decay at infinity.
  To show the decay properties of the solution, we construct suitable supersolutions composed of an explicit function satisfying an ordinary differential inequality and the solution of the linear damped wave equation. Our estimates correspond to the optimal ones inferred from the analysis of the heat equation.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis and Stability of Wave Equations with Dispersive Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs spectral methods to capture the behaviour of wave equation with dispersive-nonlinearity. We describe the evolution of hump initial data and track the conservation of the mass and energy functionals. The dispersive-nonlinearity results to solution in an extended Schwartz space via analytic approach. We construct numerical schemes based on spectral methods to simulate soliton interactions under Schwartzian initial data. The computational analysis includes validation of energy and mass conservation to ensure numerical accuracy. Results show that initial data from the Schwartz space decompose into smaller wave-packets due to the weaker dispersive-nonlinearity but leads to wave collapse as a result of stronger dispersive-nonlinearity. We conjecture that the hyperbolic equation with a positive nonlinearity and exponent greater or equal 2 admits global solutions, while lower exponents lead to localized solutions. A stability analysis of solitonic solutions of the equation is provided via the perturbation approach.</description>

      <title>Existence and non-uniqueness of classical solutions to the axially symmetric stationary Navier-Stokes equations in an exterior cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show existence and non-uniqueness on the axially symmetric stationary Navier-Stokes equations in an exterior periodic cylinder. On the boundary of the cylinder, the horizontally swirl velocity is subject to the perturbation of a rotation, the horizontally radial velocity is subject to the perturbation of an interior sink, while the vertical velocity is the perturbation of zero. At infinity, the flow stays at rest. We construct a solution to such problem, whose principal part admits a critical decay for the horizontal components and a supercritical decay for the vertical component of the velocity.
  This existence result is related to the 2D Stokes paradox and an open problem raised by V. I. Yudovich in [Eleven great problems of mathematical hydrodynamics, Mosc. Math. J. 3 (2003), no. 2, 711--737], where Problem 2 states that: Show (spatially) global existence theorems for stationary and periodic flows. Moreover, if the horizontally radial-sink velocity is relatively large ($\nu&lt;-2$ in our setting), then the solution to this problem is non-unique.</description>

      <title>Localization of critical points in annular conical sets via the method of Nehari manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Nehari manifold method, we establish sufficient conditions such that a smooth functional attains a ground state within an annular domain of a closed cone. The localization we obtain immediately allows for multiplicity when applied to disjoint conical sets. To illustrate our results, we consider a two-point boundary value problem and obtain a solution within a shell of a closed cone, defined in terms of a Harnack inequality with respect to the energy norm. The conditions imposed on the nonlinear term naturally extend those from classical examples in the literature which were derived using the method of Nehari manifold on the entire domain.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically self-similar global solutions for Hardy-H\'enon parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct asymptotically self-similar global solutions to the Hardy-H\'enon parabolic equation $\partial_t u - \Delta u = \pm |x|^{\gamma} |u|^{\alpha-1} u$, $\alpha&gt;1$, $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}$ for a large class of initial data belonging to weighted Lorentz spaces. The solution may be asymptotic to a self-similar solution of the linear heat equation or to a self-similar solution to the Hardy-H\'enon parabolic equation depending on the speed of decay of the initial data at infinity. The asymptotic results are new for the H\'enon case $\gamma&gt;0$. We also prove the stability of the asymptotic profiles. Our approach applies for $\gamma&gt; -\min(2,d)$ and unifies the cases $\gamma&gt;0$, $\gamma=0$ and $-\min(2,d)&lt;\gamma&lt;0$. For complex-valued initial data, a more intricate asymptotic behaviors can be shown; if either one of the real part or the imaginary part of the initial data has a faster spatial decay, then the solution exhibits a combined Nonlinear-"Modified Linear" asymptotic behavior, which is completely new even for the Fujita case $\gamma=0$. In Appendix, we show the non-existence of local positive solutions for supercritical initial data.</description>

      <title>Finite-time blowup in a fully parabolic chemotaxis model involving indirect signal production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a parabolic-parabolic-parabolic chemotaxis system with indirect signal production, modelling the impact of phenotypic heterogeneity on population aggregation \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases} u_t = \Delta u - \nabla\cdot(u\nabla v),\\ v_t = \Delta v - v + w,\\ w_t = \Delta w - w + u,
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} posed on a ball in $\mathbb R^n$ with $n\geq5$, subject to homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The system has a four-dimensional critical mass phenomenon concerning blowup in finite or infinite time according to the seminal works of Fujie and Senba [J. Differential Equations, 263 (2017), 88--148; 266 (2019), 942--976]. We prove that for any prescribed mass $m &gt; 0$, there exist radially symmetric and nonnegative initial data $(u_0,v_0,w_0)\in C^0(\overline{\Omega})\times C^2(\overline{\Omega})\times C^2(\overline{\Omega})$ with $\int_\Omega u_0 = m$ such that the corresponding classical solutions blow up in finite time. The key ingredient is a novel integral inequality for the cross-term integral $\int_\Omega uv$ constructed via a Lyapunov functional.</description>

      <title>Introduction to inverse problems for non-linear partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider inverse problems for non-linear hyperbolic and elliptic equations and give an introduction to the method based on the multiple linearization, or on the construction of artificial sources, to solve these problems. The method is based on self-interaction of linearized waves or other solutions in the presence of non-linearities. Multiple linearization has successfully been used to solve inverse problems for non-linear equation which are still unsolved for the corresponding linear equations.</description>

      <title>Stationary Boltzmann Equation for Polyatomic Gases in a slab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the existence of steady rarefied flows of polyatomic gas between two parallel condensed phases, where evaporation and condensation processes occur. To this end, we study the existence problem of stationary solutions in a one-dimensional slab for the polyatomic Boltzmann equation, which takes into account the effect of internal energy in the collision process of the gas molecules. We show that, under suitable norm bound assumptions on the boundary condition functions, there exists a unique mild solution to the stationary polyatomic Boltzmann equation when the slab is sufficiently small. This is based on various norm estimates - singular estimates, hyperplane estimates - of the collision operator, for which genuinely polyatomic techniques must be employed. For example, in the weighted and singular estimates of the collision operator, we carry out integration with respect to the parameter describing the internaltranslational energy distribution, which provides a regularizing effect in the estimate.</description>

      <title>Well-posed geometric boundary data in General Relativity, I: Conformal-mean curvature boundary data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local in time well-posedness of the initial boundary value problem (IBVP) for the vacuum Einstein equations in general relativity with geometric boundary conditions. For conformal-mean curvature boundary conditions, consisting of the conformal class of the boundary metric and mean curvature of the boundary, well-posedness does not hold without imposing additional angle data at the corner. When the corner angle is included as corner data, we prove well-posedness of the linearized problem in $C^{\infty}$, where the linearization is taken at any smooth vacuum Einstein metric.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an extension of the Bony quasilinearization formula as a tensor paraproduct decomposition to obtain an approximation, $\tilde{A}(f)$, to $A(f)$ where $f \in \text{tensor-} \Lambda^{\alpha}([0,1]^2)$ and $A \in C^2$. The rough content of $A(f)$ is encoded in the approximation of $\tilde{A}(f)$ while the residual, $\Delta(A,f) = A(f) - \tilde{A}(f)$, which is of regularity $\text{tensor-} \Lambda^{2 \alpha}([0,1]^2)$, contains the smooth content of $A(f)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the small amplitude linearization of the Korteweg de Vries equation on the line with a local defect scattering waves represented by a metric graph domain adjoined at one point. For a representative collection of examples, we obtain explicit contour integral representations of the solution and obtain existence and unicity results for piecewise absolutely continuous data. In so doing, we implement the unified transform method on metric graphs comprising both bonds and leads for a third order differential operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a ball $B_R(0)\subset\mathbb{R}^2$, we provide sufficient conditions such that a harmonic map $u\in C^\infty(B_R(0)\setminus\{0\}, N)$, with a self-similar bound on its gradient, belongs to $C^\infty(B_R(0))$. Those conditions also guarantee the triviality of such harmonic maps when $R=\infty$.</description>

      <title>On Ma\~n\'e's critical value for the two-component Hunter-Saxton system and a infnite dimensional magnetic Hopf-Rinow theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a nonlinear system of partial differential equations, the magnetic two-component Hunter-Saxton system (M2HS). This system is formulated as a magnetic geodesic equation on an infinite-dimensional Lie group equipped with a right-invariant metric, the $\dot{H}^1$ -metric, which is closely related to the infinite-dimensional Fisher-Rao metric, and the derivative of an infinite-dimensional contact-type form as the magnetic field. We define Ma\~n\'e's critical value for exact magnetic systems on Hilbert manifolds in full generality and compute it explicitly for the (M2HS). Moreover, we establish an infinite-dimensional Hopf-Rinow theorem for this magnetic system, where Ma\~n\'e's critical value serves as the threshold beyond which the Hopf-Rinow theorem no longer holds. This geometric framework enables us to thoroughly analyze the blow-up behavior of solutions to the (M2HS). Using this insight, we extend solutions beyond blow-up by introducing and proving the existence of global conservative weak solutions. This extension is facilitated by extending the Madelung transform from an isometry into a magnetomorphism, embedding the magnetic system into a magnetic system on an infinite-dimensional sphere equipped with the derivative of the standard contact form as the magnetic field. Crucially, this setup can always be reduced, via a dynamical reduction theorem, to a totally magnetic three-sphere, providing a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the state observation problems for the semilinear heat equation in R^n. We derive observation estimates for the equation using the logarithmic convexity property of the frequency function (see [12]). As an application, we show that if two solutions coincide on a nonempty open subset \omega\subset\Omega at some time T&gt;0, then they must be identical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper, we propose a numerical investigation of topological interactions in flocking dynamics. Starting from a microscopic description of the phenomena, mesoscopic and macroscopic models have been previously derived under specific assumptions. We explore the role of topological interaction by describing the convergence speed to consensus in both microscopic and macroscopic dynamics, considering different forms of topological interactions. Additionally, we compare mesoscopic and macroscopic dynamics for monokinetic and non-monokinetic initial data. Finally, we illustrate with some simulations in one-and two-dimensional domains the sensitive dependence of solutions on initial conditions, including the case where the system exhibits two solutions starting with the same initial data.</description>

      <title>Singular perturbations models in phase transitions for anisotropic higher-order materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13035v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a model for phase transitions in which a double-well potential is singularly perturbed by possibly several terms involving different, arbitrarily high orders of derivation. We study by $\Gamma$-convergence the asymptotic behaviour as $\varepsilon\to 0$ of the functionals \begin{equation*}
  F_\varepsilon(u):=\int_\Omega \Bigl[\frac{1}{\varepsilon}W(u)+\sum_{\ell=1}^{k}q_\ell\varepsilon^{2\ell-1}|\nabla^{(\ell)}u|_\ell^2\Bigr]\,dx, \qquad u\in H^k(\Omega), \end{equation*} for fixed $k&gt;1$ integer, addressing also to the case in which the coefficients $q_1,...,q_{k-1}$ are negative and $|\cdot|_\ell$ is any norm on the space of symmetric $\ell$-tensors for each $\ell\in\{1,...,k\}$. The negativity of the coefficients leads to the lack of a priori bounds on the functionals; such issue is overcome by proving a nonlinear interpolation inequality. With this inequality at our disposal, a compactness result is achieved by resorting to the recent paper [10]. A further difficulty is the presence of general tensor norms which carry anisotropies, making standard slicing arguments not suitable. We prove that the $\Gamma$-limit is finite only on sharp interfaces and that it equals an anisotropic perimeter, with a surface energy density described by a cell formula.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to establish the existence and spectral stability of double-periodic standing waves for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation posed on the bi-dimensional torus. We first demonstrate that double-periodic solutions can be obtained using local and global bifurcation theories to produce periodic waves, given that the kernel of the linearized operator around the equilibrium solution is one-dimensional. Additionally, we prove that these local and global solutions solve an appropriate minimization problem, which allows us to derive certain spectral properties of the linearized operator around the periodic wave. Finally, we establish the spectral stability of small-amplitude periodic waves by applying the techniques presented in \cite{KapitulaKevrekidisSandstedeII} and \cite{KapitulaKevrekidisSandstedeI}.</description>

      <title>New Liouville type theorems for 3D steady incompressible MHD equations and Hall-MHD equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Liouville type results for the three-dimensional stationary incompressible MHD equations and Hall-MHD equations. By a new iteration argument, we establish Liouville type theorems if the velocity and magnetic field satisfy certain growth conditions of Lebesgue norms on the annulus. In our iteration procedure, the $L^2$ norms of the gradients of the velocity and magnetic field and the $L^6$ norms of the velocity and magnetic field are iterated together. The conditions imposed on the magnetic field are weaker than the velocity field in certain sense. As a consequence, we show that the velocity and magnetic field are trivial provided that they belong to some Lebesgue spaces or satisfy some decay conditions at infinity. Our results extend and improve the recent works of Chae-Lee (2024 Nonlinearity 37 095006) and Cho-Neustupa-Yang (2024 Nonlinearity 37 035007).</description>

      <title>Chain-structure solutions to a Schr\"odinger-Poisson system in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of ground states and high-energy solutions to the following Schr\"odinger-Poisson system
  \begin{align*}
  \begin{cases}
  - \Delta u + a(x) u + u v = 0,\newline
  \Delta v = u^2,
  \end{cases}
  \quad \text{in } \mathbb{R}^3,
  \end{align*}
  where $a \in L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^3)$ is nonnegative and radially symmetric in the first two variables. Differing from the standard approach, our framework yields chain-structure solutions, i.e. solutions periodic in the third variable. A central part of this work is the construction of the Green function of a Poisson problem subject to periodic boundary conditions and we show that its asymptotic profile is tightly related to both the two and three dimensional Poisson problems in the entire space. If the potential $a$ is constant along the third variable, we apply symmetry techniques to construct solutions that have nonvanishing derivative in the third variable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to a study of the controllability for one-dimensional degenerate parabolic equations in time-dependent domains. First, we demonstrate that the problem is well-posed in appropriate weighted function spaces. To address the controllability problem, we establish a Carleman estimate for degenerate parabolic equations in non-cylindrical domains. The proof relies on the selection of weighted functions and Hardy-type inequalities. As a consequence, we derive an inequality for the adjoint problem, which enables us to obtain controllability results and establish a cost estimate for the control function.</description>

      <title>On reflected isotropic stable processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build two types of isotropic stable processes reflected in a strongly convex bounded domain $\mathcal{D}$. In both cases, when the process tries to jump across the boundary, it is stopped at the unique point where $\partial\mathcal{D}$ intersects the line segment defined by the attempted jump. It then leaves the boundary either continuously (for the first type) or by a power-law distributed jump (for the second type). The construction of these processes is done via an It\^o synthesis: we concatenate their excursions in the domain, which are obtained by translating, rotating and stopping the excursions of some stable processes reflected in the half-space. The key ingredient in this procedure is the construction of the boundary processes, i.e. the processes time-changed by their local time on the boundary, which solve stochastic differential equations driven by some Poisson measures of excursions. The well-posedness of these boundary processes relies on delicate estimates involving some geometric inequalities and the laws of the undershoot and overshoot of the excursion when it leaves the domain. After having constructed the processes, we show that they are Markov and Feller, we study their infinitesimal generator and write down the reflected fractional heat equations satisfied by their time-marginals.</description>

      <title>Error analysis of the Strang splitting for the 3D semilinear wave equation with finite-energy data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a variant of the Strang splitting for the time integration of the semilinear wave equation under the finite-energy condition on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$. In the case of a cubic nonlinearity, we show almost second-order convergence in $L^2$ and almost first-order convergence in $H^1$. If the nonlinearity has a quartic form instead, we show an analogous convergence result with an order reduced by 1/2. To our knowledge these are the best convergence results available for the 3D cubic and quartic wave equations under the finite-energy condition. Our approach relies on continuous- and discrete-time Strichartz estimates. We also make use of the integration and summation by parts formulas to exploit cancellations in the error terms. Moreover, error bounds for a full discretization using the Fourier pseudo-spectral method in space are given. Finally, we discuss a numerical example indicating the sharpness of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Construction of self-similar energy forms and singularity of Sobolev spaces on Laakso-type fractal spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct self-similar $p$-energy forms as normalized limits of discretized $p$-energies on a rich class of Laakso-type fractal spaces. Collectively, we refer to them as IGS-fractals, where IGS stands for (edge-)iterated graph systems. We propose this framework as a rich source of "toy models" that can be consulted for tackling challenging questions that are not well understood on most other fractal spaces. Supporting this, our framework uncovers a novel analytic phenomenon, which we term as singularity of Sobolev spaces. This means that the associated Sobolev spaces $\mathscr{F}_{p_1}$ and $\mathscr{F}_{p_2}$ for distinct $p_1,p_2 \in (1,\infty)$ intersect only at constant functions. We provide the first example of a self-similar fractal on which this singularity phenomenon occurs for all pairs of distinct exponents. In particular, we show that the Laakso diamond space is one such example.</description>

      <title>Total masses of solutions to general Toda systems with singular sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:1605.07759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we obtain total masses of solutions to the Toda system associated to a general simple Lie algebra with singular sources at the origin. The determination of such total masses is one of the important steps towards establishing the a priori bound for solutions to the mean field type of Toda system on compact surfaces. The total mass is found to be related to the longest element $\kappa$ in the Weyl group of the corresponding Lie algebra. This is the foundation to future work relating the local blowup masses (from analysis) with the Weyl group.
  This work generalizes the previous works in Lin et al. (2012), Ao et al. (2015) and Nie (20160 for Toda systems of types $A, G_2$ and $B, C$. However, a more Lie-theoretic method is needed here for the general case, and the method relies heavily on the DPW method, Drinfeld-Sokolov gauge and the $W$-invariants. The last crucial step for the total masses is obtained by applying the work of Kostant (1979) on the one dimensional Toda lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a stochastic Hamiltonian system of $N$ particles with many particles interacting through a potential whose range is large in comparison with the typical distance between neighbouring particles. It is shown that the empirical measures associated to the position and velocity of the system converge to the solutions of stochastic compressible Euler equations in the limit as the particle number tends to infinity. Moreover, we quantify the distance between particles and the limit in suitable Sobolev norm.</description>

      <title>A First-Order Mean-Field Game on a Bounded Domain with Mixed Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15952v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entry-exit dynamics are crucial in modeling crowd movement. Here, we present a novel first-order, stationary mean-field game model on a bounded domain that accurately captures these dynamics. The interior dynamics of the system are governed by a standard first-order stationary MFG system consisting of a Hamilton-Jacobi equation coupled with a transport equation. The model incorporates nonstandard mixed boundary conditions corresponding to an entry region $\Gamma_N$, where a Neumann condition prescribes agent inflow, and an exit region $\Gamma_D$, where a no-entry condition prevents inward flow. Additionally, we impose an upper bound on the exit cost through $\Gamma_D$, combined with a complementary contact-set condition.
  The contact-set condition distinguishes boundary contact points, where the exit cost is attained and exit is permitted, from non-contact points, where a strict no-penetration condition is enforced. This mixed approach overcomes the limitations of classical Dirichlet conditions, which can artificially force boundary points to serve as both entry and exit locations. We analyze the system through a variational formulation, applying the direct method of the calculus of variations to establish the existence of solutions under minimal regularity assumptions. Furthermore, we prove a partial uniqueness result for the gradient of the value function (particularly in regions with positive agent density) and establish the uniqueness of the density function.
  Several examples, including one- and two-dimensional cases, illustrate the proper assignment of entry and exit roles and demonstrate that contact does not necessarily enforce exit. Additionally, they showcase first-order MFG phenomena, such as the formation of empty regions, where agent density vanishes. These results provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for modeling realistic entry-exit scenarios.</description>

      <title>Canonical solutions to non-translation invariant singular SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exhibit a canonical, finite dimensional solution family to certain singular SPDEs of the form \begin{equation} \left(\partial_t- \sum_{i,j=1}^d a_{i,j}(x,t) \partial_i \partial_j - \sum_{i=1}^d b_i(x,t) \partial_i - c(x,t)\right) u = F(u, \partial u, \xi) \ , \end{equation} where $a_{i,j}, b_i, c: \mathbb{T}^d\times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ and $A=\{a_{i,j}\}_{i,j=1}^d$ is uniformly elliptic. More specifically, we solve the non-translation invariant g-PAM, $\phi^4_2$, $\phi^4_3$ and KPZ-equation and show that the diverging renormalisation-functions are local functions of $A$. We also establish a continuity result for the solution map with respect to the differential operator for these equations.</description>

      <title>Supersonic Gravitational Collapse for Non-Isentropic Gaseous Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the existence of a new class of initially smooth spherically symmetric self-similar solutions to the non-isentropic Euler-Poisson system. These solutions exhibit supersonic gravitational implosion in the sense that the density blows-up in finite time while the fluid velocity remains supersonic. In particular, they occupy a portion of the phase space that is far from the recently constructed isentropic self-similar implosion. At the heart of our proof is the presence of a two-parameter scaling invariance and the reduction of the problem to a non-autonomous system of ordinary differential equations. We use the requirement of smoothness of the flow as a selection principle that constrains the choice of scaling indices. An important consequence of our analysis is that for all the solutions we construct, the polytropic index $\gamma$ is strictly bigger than $\frac{4}{3}$, which is in sharp contrast to the known results in the isentropic case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an arbitrary regular Dirichlet form $\mathscr{E}$ and the associated symmetric Markovian semigroup $T_t$, we consider the corresponding Sobolev-Bregman form $\mathscr{E}_p(u) = -\tfrac{1}{p} \frac{d}{d t}\bigr\vert_{t = 0} \|T_t u\|_p^p$, where $p \in (1, \infty)$. We prove a variant of the Beurling-Deny formula for $\mathscr{E}_p$. As an application, we prove the corresponding Hardy-Stein identity. Our results extend previous works in this area, which either required that $\mathscr{E}$ is translation-invariant, or that $u$ is sufficiently regular.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet eigenfunctions with nonzero mean value</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Laplacian eigenfunctions on a domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. Under Neumann boundary conditions, the first eigenfunction is constant and the others have mean value 0. The situation is different for Dirichlet boundary conditions: on `generic' domains, one would expect that every eigenfunction has nonzero mean value. The other extreme is the ball in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where among the first $n$ eigenfunctions only $\sim n^{1/d}$ have a mean value different from zero. We prove that this rate is sharp in \textit{any} smooth domain, up to a logarithmic factor: in any smooth domain~$\Omega$, among the first $n$ Dirichlet eigenfunctions at least $ (\log{n})^{-1/2} \cdot n^{1/d} $ have a nonzero mean.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Positive Solutions for Fractional Schr\"{o}dinger Equations with General Nonlinearities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2013, R.L. Frank and E. Lenzmann [R.L. Frank, E. Lenzmann, Uniqueness of non-linear ground states for fractional Laplacians in $\mathbb{R}$, Acta Math. 210 (2) (2013) 261-318] study the following problem:
  \begin{align*}
  (-\Delta)^su + u = u^{p-1} \quad \text{in } \mathbb{R}^N,
  \end{align*} where $s \in (0,1)$, $N = 1$, $p \in (2,2_s^*)$, and $2_s^*$ is the critical fractional Sobolev exponent. They proved that the ground state is unique (up to translations). Then in 2016, they, together with L. Silvestre [R.L. Frank, E. Lenzmann, L. Silvestre, Uniqueness of radial solutions for the fractional Laplacian, Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 69 (9) (2016) 1671-1726] showed similar uniqueness results for high dimensions ($N \geqslant 2$), in which they proposed a challenging open problem to extend their results about non-degeneracy and uniqueness of ground states to nonlinearities $f(u)$ beyond the pure-power case. To the best of our knowledge, this question is still unresolved so far. In this paper, we aim to give a full affirmative answer to this open issue for a large class of convex nonlinearities. In fact, we prove the uniqueness of the positive solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a thin multi-domain of $\mathbb R^N$, with $N\geq 2$, consisting of a vertical rod upon a horizontal disk. In this thin multi-domain, we introduce a bulk energy density of the kind $W(D^2U)$, where $W$ is a continuous function with linear growth at $\infty$ and $D^2U$ denotes the Hessian tensor of a vector-valued function $U$ that represents a deformation of the multi-domain. Considering suitable boundary conditions on the admissible deformations and assuming that the two volumes tend to zero with same rate, we prove that the limit model is well posed in the union of the limit domains, with dimensions $1$ and $N-1$, respectively. Moreover, we show that the limit problem is uncoupled if $N\geq 3$, and ``partially" coupled if $N=2$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the forward self-similar solutions to the three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic equations (MHD equations) in the whole space. By employing the Leray-Schauder theorem and blow-up argument, we construct a global-time forward self-similar solutions, which is smooth in $\R^{3}\times(0,\infty)$. Furthermore, by investigating the regularity of the weak solutions to the corresponding Leray system in the weighted Sobolev space, we can derive the pointwise estimate for the forward self-similar solution.</description>

Abstract: Given $p\geq 2$ and a map $g : B^n(0,1)\to S_n^{++}$, where $S_n^{++}$ is the group of positively definite matrices, we study critical points of the following functional: $$ v\in W^{1,p}\left(B^n(0,1);\mathbb{R}^N \right) \mapsto \int_{B^n(0,1)} |\nabla v|^p_g\, d\mathrm{vol}_g = \int_{B^n(0,1)} \left( g^{\alpha\beta}(x) \left\langle \partial_\alpha v(x), \partial_\beta v(x) \right\rangle \right)^{\frac{p}{2}}\, \sqrt{\det g(x)}\, dx. $$ We show that if $g$ is uniformly close to a constant matrix, then $v$ is locally H\"older-continuous. If $g$ is H\"older-continuous, we show that $\nabla v$ is locally H\"older-continuous. As an application, we prove that any H\"older-continuous solution to $|\Delta_{g,p}u|\lesssim |\nabla u|^p_g$ satisfies additional regularity properties depending on the regularity of $g$. In the case $p=n$, only the continuity is assumed \textit{a priori}.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the nonlinear scalar field equation with a point interaction at the origin in dimensions two and three. By applying the mountain pass theorem and the technique of adding one dimensional space, we prove the existence of a nontrivial singular solution for a wide class of nonlinearities. We also establish the Pohozaev identity by proving a pointwise estimate of the gradient near the origin. Some qualitative properties of nontrivial solutions are also given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized Wasserstein distances allow to quantitatively compare two continuous or atomic mass distributions with equal or different total mass. In this paper, we propose four numerical methods for the approximation of three different generalized Wasserstein distances introduced in the last years, giving some insights about their physical meaning. After that, we explore their usage in the context of the sensitivity analysis of differential models for traffic flow. The quantification of models sensitivity is obtained by computing the generalized Wasserstein distances between two (numerical) solutions corresponding to different inputs, including different boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Evolution problems with perturbed $1$-Laplacian type operators on random walk spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random walk spaces are a general framework for the study of PDEs. They include as particular cases locally finite weighted connected graphs and nonlocal settings involving symmetric integrable kernels on $\mathbb{R}^N$. We are interested in the study of evolution problems involving two random walk structures so that the associated functionals have different growth on each structure. We also deal with the case of a functional with different growth on a partition of the random walk.</description>

      <title>Gluing methods for quantitative stability of optimal transport maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish quantitative stability bounds for the quadratic optimal transport map $T_\mu$ between a fixed probability density $\rho$ and a probability measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$. Under general assumptions on $\rho$, we prove that the map $\mu\mapsto T_\mu$ is bi-H\"older continuous, with dimension-free H\"older exponents. The linearized optimal transport metric $W_{2,\rho}(\mu,\nu)=\|T_\mu-T_\nu\|_{L^2(\rho)}$ is therefore bi-H\"older equivalent to the $2$-Wasserstein distance, which justifies its use in applications.
  We show this property in the following cases: (i) for any log-concave density $\rho$ with full support in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and any log-bounded perturbation thereof; (ii) for $\rho$ bounded away from $0$ and $+\infty$ on a John domain (e.g., on a bounded Lipschitz domain), while the only previously known result of this type assumed convexity of the domain; (iii) for some important families of probability densities on bounded domains which decay or blow-up polynomially near the boundary. Concerning the sharpness of point (ii), we also provide examples of non-John domains for which the Brenier potentials do not satisfy any H\"older stability estimate.
  Our proofs rely on local variance inequalities for the Brenier potentials in small convex subsets of the support of $\rho$, which are glued together to deduce a global variance inequality. This gluing argument is based on two different strategies of independent interest: one of them leverages the properties of the Whitney decomposition in bounded domains, the other one relies on spectral graph theory.</description>

      <title>Kink dynamics for the Yang-Mills field in an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12790v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considered in this work is the Yang-Mills field in an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, a physically motivated mathematical model introduced by Bizo\'n and Kahl. The kink is a fundamental, strongly unstable stationary solution in this non-perturbative, variable coefficients model, with a polynomial tail and no explicit form. In this paper, we introduce and extend several virial techniques, adapt them to the inhomogeneous medium setting, and construct a finite codimensional manifold of the energy space where the kink is asymptotically stable. In particular, we handle, using virial techniques, the emergence of a weak threshold resonance in the description of the stable manifold.</description>

      <title>The Kato problem for weighted elliptic and parabolic systems of higher order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve the Kato square root problem for parabolic $N\times N$ systems of arbitrary order $2m$ whose coefficients are allowed to depend on both space and time in a merely measurable way and possess ellipticity controlled by a Muckenhoupt $A_{2}-$weight. Notably, the proof applies to the weighted Kato problem within an elliptic framework.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on compact product manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove new local well-posedness results for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations posed on a general product of spheres and tori, by the standard approach of multi-linear Strichartz estimates. To prove these estimates, we establish and utilize multi-linear bounds for the joint spectral projector associated to the Laplace--Beltrami operators on the individual sphere factors of the product manifold. To treat the particular case of the cubic NLS on a product of two spheres at critical regularity, we prove a sharp $L^\infty_xL^p_t$ estimate of the solution to the linear Schr\"odinger equation on the two-torus.</description>

      <title>Initial stability estimates for Ricci flow and three dimensional Ricci-pinched manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.15313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the question of stability for a class of Ricci flows which start at possibly non-smooth metric spaces. We show that if the initial metric space is Reifenberg and locally bi-Lipschitz to Euclidean space, then two solutions to the Ricci flow whose Ricci curvature is uniformly bounded from below and whose curvature is bounded by $c\cdot t^{-1}$ converge to one another at an exponential rate once they have been appropriately gauged. As an application, we show that smooth three dimensional, complete, uniformly Ricci-pinched Riemannian manifolds with bounded curvature are either compact or flat, thus confirming a conjecture of Hamilton and Lott.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph $p$-Laplacian regularization on point clouds for data interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a generalization of graphs, hypergraphs are widely used to model higher-order relations in data. This paper explores the benefit of the hypergraph structure for the interpolation of point cloud data that contain no explicit structural information. We define the $\varepsilon_n$-ball hypergraph and the $k_n$-nearest neighbor hypergraph on a point cloud and study the $p$-Laplacian regularization on the hypergraphs. We prove the variational consistency between the hypergraph $p$-Laplacian regularization and the continuum $p$-Laplacian regularization in a semisupervised setting when the number of points $n$ goes to infinity while the number of labeled points remains fixed. A key improvement compared to the graph case is that the results rely on weaker assumptions on the upper bound of $\varepsilon_n$ and $k_n$. To solve the convex but non-differentiable large-scale optimization problem, we utilize the stochastic primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithm. Numerical experiments on data interpolation verify that the hypergraph $p$-Laplacian regularization outperforms the graph $p$-Laplacian regularization in preventing the development of spikes at the labeled points.</description>
