      <title>Benchmarking Quantum Red TEA on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We benchmark simulations of many-body quantum systems on heterogeneous hardware platforms using CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. We compare different linear algebra backends, e.g., numpy versus the torch, jax, or tensorflow library, as well as a mixed-precision-inspired approach and optimizations for the target hardware. Quantum red TEA out of the Quantum TEA library specifically addresses handling tensors with different libraries or hardware, where the tensors are the building block of tensor network algorithms. The benchmark problem is a variational search of a ground state in an interacting model. This is a ubiquitous problem in quantum many-body physics, which we solve using tensor network methods. This approximate state-of-the-art method compresses quantum correlations which is key to overcoming the exponential growth of the Hilbert space as a function of the number of particles. We present a way to obtain speedups of a factor of 34 when tuning parameters on the CPU, and an additional factor of 2.76 on top of the best CPU setup when migrating to GPUs.</description>

      <title>Finite time path field theory perturbative methods for local quantum spin chain quenches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss local magnetic field quenches using perturbative methods of finite time path field theory in the following spin chains: Ising and XY in a transverse magnetic field. Their common characteristics are: i) they are integrable via mapping to second quantized noninteracting fermion problem; ii) when the ground state is nondegenerate (true for finite chains except in special cases) it can be represented as a vacuum of Bogoliubov fermions. By switching on a local magnetic field perturbation at finite time, the problem becomes nonintegrable and must be approached via numeric or perturbative methods. Using the formalism of finite time path field theory based on Wigner transforms of projected functions, we show how to: i) calculate the basic "bubble" diagram in the Loschmidt echo of a quenched chain to any order in the perturbation; ii) resum the generalized Schwinger-Dyson equation for the fermion two point retarded functions in the "bubble" diagram, hence achieving the resummation of perturbative expansion of Loschmidt echo for a wide range of perturbation strengths under certain analiticity assumptions. Limitations of the assumptions and possible generalizations beyond it and also for other spin chains are further discussed.</description>

      <title>Unified Framework for Matchgate Classical Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating quantum fermionic properties is a computationally difficult yet crucial task for the study of electronic systems. Recent developments have begun to address this challenge by introducing classical shadows protocols relying on sampling of Fermionic Gaussian Unitaries (FGUs): a class of transformations in fermionic space which can be conveniently mapped to matchgates circuits. The different protocols proposed in the literature use different sub-ensembles of the orthogonal group $O(2n)$ to which FGUs can be associated. We propose an approach that unifies these different protocols, proving their equivalence, and deriving from it an optimal sampling scheme. We begin by demonstrating that the first three moments of the FGU ensemble associated with $SO(2n)$ and of its intersection with the Clifford group are equal, generalizing a result known for $O(2n)$ and addressing a question raised in previous works. Building on this proof, we establish the equivalence between the shadows protocols resulting from FGU ensembles analyzed in the literature. Finally, from our results, we propose a sampling scheme for a small sub-ensemble of matchgates circuits that is optimal in terms of number of gates and that inherits the performances guarantees of the previous ensembles.</description>

      <title>The Gamow and the Fermi Golden Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using the fact that the Gamow states in the momentum representation are square integrable, we obtain the differential and the total decay width of a two-body, non-relativistic decay. The resulting Gamow Golden Rule is well suited to describe both energy and angular decay distributions, and it becomes the Fermi Golden Rule when the resonance is long-lived and far from the energy threshold. We also show that the correct density of states and phase space factors arise naturally from the Gamow Golden Rule. The upshot is that the Gamow states and the Golden Rule can be combined into a unified description of quantum resonances.</description>

      <title>Training microwave pulses using quantum machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A gate sequence of single-qubit transformations may be condensed into a single microwave pulse that maps a qubit from an initialized state directly into the desired state of the composite transformation. Here, machine learning is used to learn the parameterized values for a single driving pulse associated with a transformation of three sequential gate operations on a qubit. This implies that future quantum circuits may contain roughly a third of the number of single-qubit operations performed, greatly reducing the problems of noise and decoherence. There is a potential for even greater condensation and efficiency using the methods of quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Decoherence due to Casimir effect?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open system dynamics of an electron is studied in the presence of radiation field, confined between two parallel conducting pates. It has been suggested in previous works that the quantized zero-point modes of this field lead to finite decoherence effects, possibly due to the Casimir force. However, in this work it is shown that the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix of the electron are suppressed due to the sudden switching on of the interaction with the environment, and would not be observationally relevant in typical scenarios. The work clarifies important theoretical aspects of the setup and argues that any irreversible loss of coherence, in general, should not be ascribed to vacuum fluctuations. It can only originate from emission of bremsstrahlung by the electron, due to the acceleration caused by the effective Coulomb potential of all the infinite image charges.</description>

      <title>qSAT: Design of an Efficient Quantum Satisfiability Solver for Hardware Equivalence Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solver for hardware verification incurs exponential run-time in several instances. In this work we have proposed an efficient quantum SAT (qSAT) solver for equivalence checking of Boolean circuits employing Grover's algorithm. The Exclusive-Sum-of-Product based generation of the Conjunctive Normal Form equivalent clauses demand less qubits and minimizes the gates and depth of quantum circuit interpretation. The consideration of reference circuits for verification affecting Grover's iterations and quantum resources are also presented as a case study. Experimental results are presented assessing the benefits of the proposed verification approach using open-source Qiskit platform and IBM quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Additivity of quantum capacities in simple non-degradable quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum channel capacities give the fundamental performance limits for information flow over a communication channel. However, the prevalence of superadditivity is a major obstacle to understanding capacities, both quantitatively and conceptually. Examples of additivity, while rare, provide key insight into the origins of nonadditivity and enable our best upper bounds on capacities. Degradable channels, which have additive coherent information, are some of the only channels for which we can calculate the quantum capacity. In this paper we construct non-degradable quantum channels that nevertheless have additive coherent information and therefore easily calculated quantum capacity. The first class of examples is constructed by generalizing the Platypus channel introduced by Leditzky et al. The second class of examples, whose additivity follows from a conjectured stability property, is based on probabilistic mixture of degradable and anti-degradable channels.</description>

      <title>Extracting and Storing Energy From a Quasi-Vacuum on a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore recent advancements in the understanding and manipulation of vacuum energy in quantum physics, with a focus on the quantum energy teleportation (QET) protocol. Traditional QET protocols extract energy from what we refer to as a ``quasi-vacuum'' state, but the extracted quantum energy is dissipated into classical devices, limiting its practical utility. To address this limitation, we propose an enhanced QET protocol that incorporates an additional qubit, enabling the stored energy to be stored within a quantum register for future use. We experimentally validated this enhanced protocol using IBM superconducting quantum computers, demonstrating its feasibility and potential for future applications in quantum energy manipulation.</description>

      <title>Quantum multi-row iteration algorithm for linear systems with non-square coefficient matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of quantum linear system algorithms, quantum computing has realized exponential computational advantages over classical computing. However, the focus has been on square coefficient matrices, with few quantum algorithms addressing non-square matrices. Towards this kind of problems defined by $ Ax = b $ where $ A $$ \in\mathbb{R}^{m \times n} $, we propose a quantum algorithm inspired by the classical multi-row iteration method and provide an explicit quantum circuit based on the quantum comparator and Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM). The time complexity of our quantum multi-row iteration algorithm is $ O(K \log m) $, with $ K $ representing the number of iteration steps, which demonstrates an exponential speedup compared to the classical version. Based on the convergence of the classical multi-row iteration algorithm, we prove that our quantum algorithm converges faster than the quantum one-row iteration algorithm presented in [Phys. Rev. A, 101, 022322 (2020)]. Moreover, our algorithm places less demand on the coefficient matrix, making it suitable for solving inconsistent systems and quadratic optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Fault-Tolerant Quantum Protocol for Differential Privacy in the Shuffle Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum protocol which securely and implicitly implements a random shuffle to realize differential privacy in the shuffle model. The shuffle model of differential privacy amplifies privacy achievable via local differential privacy by randomly permuting the tuple of outcomes from data contributors. In practice, one needs to address how this shuffle is implemented. Examples include implementing the shuffle via mix-networks, or shuffling via a trusted third-party. These implementation specific issues raise non-trivial computational and trust requirements in a classical system. We propose a quantum version of the protocol using entanglement of quantum states and show that the shuffle can be implemented without these extra requirements. Our protocol implements k-ary randomized response, for any value of k &gt; 2, and furthermore, can be efficiently implemented using fault-tolerant computation.</description>

      <title>Distributed exact multi-objective quantum search algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-objective search means searching for any one of several objectives in an unstructured database. Grover's algorithm has quadratic acceleration in multi-objection search than classical ones. Iterated operator in Grover's algorithm is a key element and plays an important role in amplitude amplification. In this paper, we design two distributed iterated operators and therefore two new distributed Grover's algorithms are obtained with the following advantages: (1) Compared to Grover's algorithm and the modified Grover's algorithm by Long, our distributed algorithms require fewer qubits; (2) Compared to the distributed Grover's algorithm proposed by Qiu et al., one of our distributed algorithms is exact. Of course, both our distributed algorithms require quite quantum communication and involve a number of more complicated unitary operators as cost, but there still may have certain advantage of physical realizability in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.</description>

      <title>Experimental Quantum Simulation of Chemical Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating chemistry is likely to be among the earliest applications of quantum computing. However, existing digital quantum algorithms for chemical simulation require many logical qubits and gates, placing practical applications beyond existing technology. Here, we use an analog approach to carry out the first quantum simulations of chemical reactions. In particular, we simulate photoinduced non-adiabatic dynamics, one of the most challenging classes of problems in quantum chemistry because they involve strong coupling and entanglement between electronic and nuclear motions. We use a mixed-qudit-boson (MQB) analog simulator, which encodes information in both the electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom of a trapped ion. We demonstrate its programmability and versatility by simulating the dynamics of three different molecules as well as open-system dynamics in the condensed phase, all with the same quantum resources. Our approach requires orders of magnitude fewer resources than equivalent digital quantum simulations, demonstrating the potential of analog quantum simulators for near-term simulations of complex chemical reactions.</description>

      <title>Maximal work extraction unitarily from an unknown quantum state: Ergotropy estimation via feedback experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the emerging applications of quantum technologies, studying energy storage and usage at the quantum level is of great interest. In this context, there is a significant contemporary interest in studying ergotropy, the maximum amount of work that can be extracted unitarily from an energy-storing quantum device. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a feedback-based algorithm (FQErgo) for estimating ergotropy. This method also transforms an arbitrary initial state to its passive state, which allows no further unitary work extraction. FQErgo applies drive fields whose strengths are iteratively adjusted via certain expectation values, conveniently read using a single probe qubit. Thus, FQErgo provides a practical way for unitary energy extraction and for preparing passive states. By numerically analyzing FQErgo on random initial states, we confirm the successful preparation of passive states and estimation of ergotropy, even in the presence of drive errors. Finally, we implement FQErgo on two- and three-qubit NMR registers, prepare their passive states, and accurately estimate their ergotropy.</description>

      <title>Squeezing Enhancement in Lossy Multi-Path Atom Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the sensitivity gains afforded by spin-squeezed states in atom interferometry, in particular using Bragg diffraction. We introduce a generalised input-output formalism that accurately describes realistic, non-unitary interferometers, including losses due to velocity selectivity and scattering into undesired momentum states. This formalism is applied to evaluate the performance of one-axis twisted spin-squeezed states in improving phase sensitivity. Our results show that by carefully optimising the parameters of the Bragg beam splitters and controlling the degree of squeezing, it is possible to improve the sensitivity of the interferometer by several dB with respect to the standard quantum limit despite realistic levels of losses in light pulse operations. However, the analysis also highlights the challenges associated with achieving these improvements in practice, most notably the impact of finite temperature on the benefits of entanglement. The results suggest ways of optimising interferometric setups to exploit quantum entanglement under realistic conditions, thereby contributing to advances in precision metrology with atom interferometers.</description>

      <title>Hacking Cryptographic Protocols with Tensor Network Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we introduce the application of Tensor Networks (TN) to launch attacks on symmetric-key cryptography. Our approaches make use of Matrix Product States (MPS) as well as our recently-introduced Flexible-PEPS Quantum Circuit Simulator (FQCS). We compare these approaches with traditional brute-force attacks and Variational Quantum Attack Algorithm (VQAA) methods also proposed by us. Our benchmarks include the Simplified Data Encryption Standard (S-DES) with 10-bit keys, Simplified Advanced Encryption Standard (S-AES) with 16-bit keys, and Blowfish with 32-bit keys. We find that for small key size, MPS outperforms VQAA and FQCS in both time and average iterations required to recover the key. As key size increases, FQCS becomes more efficient in terms of average iterations compared to VQAA and MPS, while MPS remains the fastest in terms of time. These results highlight the potential of TN methods in advancing quantum cryptanalysis, particularly in optimizing both speed and efficiency. Our results also show that entanglement becomes crucial as key size increases.</description>

      <title>Connectivity matters: Impact of bath modes ordering and geometry in Open Quantum System simulation with Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being able to study the dynamics of quantum systems interacting with several environments is important in many settings ranging from quantum chemistry to quantum thermodynamics, through out-of-equilibrium systems. For such problems tensor network-based methods are state-of-the-art approaches to perform numerically exact simulations. However, to be used efficiently in this multi-environment non-perturbative context, these methods require a clever choice of the topology of the wave-function Ans\"atze. This is often done by analysing cross-correlations between different system and environment degrees of freedom. We show for canonical model Hamiltonians that simple orderings of bosonic environmental modes, which enable to write the joint {System + Environments} state as a matrix product state, reduce considerably the bond dimension required for convergence. These results suggest that complex correlation analyses in order to tweak tensor networks topology (e.g. entanglement renormalization) are usually not necessary and that tree tensor network states are sub-optimal compared to simple matrix product states in several applications.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity of Optical Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Krylov complexity in quantum optical systems subject to time--dependent classical external fields. We focus on various interacting quantum optical models, including a collection of two--level atoms, photonic systems and the quenched oscillator. These models have Hamiltonians which are linear in the generators of $SU(2)$, $H(1)$ (Heisenberg--Weyl) and $SU(1,1)$ group symmetries allowing for a straightforward identification of the Krylov basis. We analyze the behaviour of complexity for these systems in different regimes of the driven field, focusing primarily on resonances. This is achieved via the Gauss decomposition of the unitary evolution operators for the group symmetries. Additionally, we also investigate the Krylov complexity in a three--level $SU(3)$ atomic system using the Lanczos algorithm, revealing the underlying complexity dynamics. Throughout we have exploited the the relevant group structures to simplify our explorations.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Classical Algorithm for Simulating Short Time 2D Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient classical simulation of the Schrodinger equation is central to quantum mechanics, as it is crucial for exploring complex natural phenomena and understanding the fundamental distinctions between classical and quantum computation. Although simulating general quantum dynamics is BQP-complete, tensor networks allow efficient simulation of short-time evolution in 1D systems. However, extending these methods to higher dimensions becomes significantly challenging when the area law is violated. In this work, we tackle this challenge by introducing an efficient classical algorithm for simulating short-time dynamics in 2D quantum systems, utilizing cluster expansion and shallow quantum circuit simulation. Our algorithm has wide-ranging applications, including an efficient dequantization method for estimating quantum eigenvalues and eigenstates, simulating superconducting quantum computers, dequantizing quantum variational algorithms, and simulating constant-gap adiabatic quantum evolution. Our results reveal the inherent simplicity in the complexity of short-time 2D quantum dynamics and highlight the limitations of noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware, particularly those confined to 2D topological structures. This work advances our understanding of the boundary between classical and quantum computation and the criteria for achieving quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Randomness in quantum random number generator from vacuum fluctuations with source-device-independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application for random numbers is ubiquitous. We experimentally build a well-studied quantum random number generator from homodyne measurements on the quadrature of the vacuum fluctuations. Semi-device-independence in this random number generator is usually obtained using phase modulators to shift the phase of the laser and obtain random sampling from both X and P quadrature measurements of the vacuum state in previous implementations. We characterize the experimental parameters for optimal performance of this source-device independent quantum random number generator by measuring the two quadratures concurrently using two homodyne detectors. We also study the influence of these parameters on randomness, which can be extracted based on Shannon entropy and von Neumann entropy, which correspond to an eavesdropper listening to classical and quantum side information, respectively.</description>

      <title>Optimal Fidelity Estimation from Binary Measurements for Discrete and Continuous Variable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the fidelity between a desired target quantum state and an actual prepared state is essential for assessing the success of experiments. For pure target states, we use functional representations that can be measured directly and determine the number of copies of the prepared state needed for fidelity estimation. In continuous variable (CV) systems, we utilise the Wigner function, which can be measured via displaced parity measurements. We provide upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity required for fidelity estimation, considering the worst-case scenario across all possible prepared states. For target states of particular interest, such as Fock and Gaussian states, we find that this sample complexity is characterised by the $L^1$-norm of the Wigner function, a measure of Wigner negativity widely studied in the literature, in particular in resource theories of quantum computation. For discrete variable systems consisting of $n$ qubits, we explore fidelity estimation protocols using Pauli string measurements. Similarly to the CV approach, the sample complexity is shown to be characterised by the $L^1$-norm of the characteristic function of the target state for both Haar random states and stabiliser states. Furthermore, in a general black box model, we prove that, for any target state, the optimal sample complexity for fidelity estimation is characterised by the smoothed $L^1$-norm of the target state. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the $L^1$-norm of the Wigner function provides a lower bound on the cost of some information processing task.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodic arrangement of magnetodielectric $\delta$-plates: Green's functions and Casimir energies for $N$ bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a variety of finite quasiperiodic configurations with magnetodielectric $\delta$-function plates created from simple substitution rules. While previous studies for $N$ bodies involved interactions mediated by a scalar field, we extended our analysis of Green's function and corresponding Casimir energy to the electromagnetic field using plates with magnetic and dielectric properties for handling finite-size quasiperiodic lattices. The Casimir energy is computed for a class of quasiperiodic structures built from $N$ purely conducting or permeable $\delta$-plates. The Casimir energy of this quasiperiodic sequence of plates turns out to be either positive or negative, indicating that the pressure from the quantum vacuum tends to cause the stack of plates to expand or contract depending on their arrangement. We also handle the transverse electric and transverse magnetic mode Green's functions for $\delta$-plates and derive the Faddeev-like equation with the transition matrix for $N$ purely conducting or permeable plates.</description>

      <title>Twin-field-based multi-party quantum key agreement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) can secure cryptographic communication between two distant users, as guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics rather than computational assumptions. The twin-field scheme, which employs counter-propagated weak coherent light pulses, doubles the secure distance of standard QKD without using quantum repeaters. Here, we study a method to extend the twin-field key distribution protocol to a scheme for multi-party quantum key agreement. We study our protocol's security using a minimum error discrimination analysis and derive the asymptotic key rate based on the entanglement-based source-replacement scheme. We also simulate it on the ANSYS Interconnect platform to study the protocol's performance in certain practical situations.</description>

      <title>Recovering optimal precision in quantum sensing using imperfect control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum control plays a crucial role in enhancing precision scaling for quantum sensing. However, most existing protocols require perfect control, even though real-world devices inevitably have control imperfections. Here, we consider a fundamental setting of quantum sensing with imperfect clocks, where the duration of control pulses and the interrogation time are all subject to uncertainty. Under this scenario, we investigate the task of frequency estimation in the presence of a non-Markovian environment. We design a control strategy and prove that it outperforms any control-free strategies, recovering the optimal Heisenberg scaling up to a small error term that is intrinsic to this model. We further demonstrate the advantage of our control strategy via experiments on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform. Our finding confirms that the advantage of quantum control in quantum sensing persists even in the presence of imperfections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach for designing sources of postselected multipartite states based on photon-pair sources. Our approach can be applied to arbitrary target states in different encoding schemes and physical platforms. It also allows one to limit the types of components to be used in the device, such that lossy or difficult-to-implement optical elements can be avoided. As an example, we apply this strategy to design a passive integrated source of frequency-bin-encoded high-dimensional GHZ states with a 10 kHz on-chip generation rate for picojoule pump pulses.</description>

      <title>Dilution of error in digital Hamiltonian simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide analytic, numerical and experimental evidence that the amount of noise in digital quantum simulation of local observables can be independent of system size in a number of situations. We provide a microscopic explanation of this dilution of errors based on the "relevant string length" of operators, which is the length of Pauli strings in the operator at time $s$ that belong to the exponentially small subspace of strings that can give a non-zero expectation value at time $t$. We show that this explanation can predict when dilution of errors occurs and when it does not. We propose an error mitigation method whose efficiency relies on this mechanism. Our findings imply that digital quantum simulation with noisy devices is in appropriate cases scalable in the sense that gate errors do not need to be reduced linearly to simulate larger systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extension of the phase-space Weyl-Wigner quantum mechanics to the subset of Hamiltonians in the form of $H(q,\,p) = {K}(p) + {V}(q)$ (with $K(p)$ replacing single $p^2$ contributions) is revisited. Deviations from classical and stationary profiles are identified in terms of Wigner functions and Wigner currents for Gaussian and gamma/Laplacian distribution ensembles. The procedure is successful in accounting for the exact pattern of quantum fluctuations when compared with the classical phase-space pattern. General results are then specialized to some specific Hamiltonians revealing non-linear dynamics, and suggest a novel algorithm to treat quantum modifications mapped by Wigner currents. Our analysis shows that the framework encompasses, for instance, the quantized prey-predator-like scenarios subjected to statistical constraints.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Machine Learning Decoder for 3D Toric Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mitigating errors in computing and communication systems has seen a great deal of research since the beginning of the widespread use of these technologies. However, as we develop new methods to do computation or communication, we also need to reiterate the method used to deal with errors. Within the field of quantum computing, error correction is getting a lot of attention since errors can propagate fast and invalidate results, which makes the theoretical exponential speed increase in computation time, compared to traditional systems, obsolete. To correct errors in quantum systems, error-correcting codes are used. A subgroup of codes, topological codes, is currently the focus of many research papers. Topological codes represent parity check matrices corresponding to graphs embedded on a $d$-dimensional surface. For our research, the focus lies on the toric code with a 3D square lattice. The goal of any decoder is robustness to noise, which can increase with code size. However, a reasonable decoder performance scales polynomially with lattice size. As error correction is a time-sensitive operation, we propose a neural network using an inductive bias: equivariance. This allows the network to learn from a rather small subset of the exponentially growing training space of possible inputs. In addition, we investigate how transformer networks can help in correction. These methods will be compared with various configurations and previously published methods of decoding errors in the 3D toric code.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of a Grover-Michelson interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a low-resource and robust optical implementation of the four-dimensional Grover coin, a four-port linear-optical scatterer that augments the low dimensionality of a regular beam-splitter. While prior realizations of the Grover coin required a potentially unstable ring-cavity to be formed, this version of the scatterer does not exhibit any internal interference. When this Grover coin is placed in another system, it can be used for interferometry with a higher-dimensional set of optical field modes. In this case, we formed a Grover-Michelson interferometer, which results when the traditional beam-splitter of a Michelson interferometer is replaced with a four-port Grover coin. This replacement has been shown to remove a phase parameter redundancy in the original Michelson system, now allowing continuous tuning of the shape and slope of the interference pattern. We observed an intensity interferogram with $97\%$ visibility and a phase sensitivity more than an order of magnitude larger than a regular Michelson interferometer. Because this device is readily formed with nearly the same number of optomechanical resources as a Michelson interferometer, but can outperform it drastically in phase delay evaluation, it has a great potential to improve many interferometric sensing and control systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we analyze recent proposals by Das and D\"{u}rr (DD) to measure the arrival time distributions of quantum particles within the framework of de Broglie Bohm theory (or Bohmian mechanics). We also analyze the criticisms made by Goldstein Tumulka and Zangh\`{i} (GTZ) of these same proposals, and show that each protagonist is both right and wrong. In fine, we show that DD's predictions are indeed measurable in principle, but that they will not lead to violations of the no-signalling theorem used in Bell's theorem, in contradiction with some of Das and Maudlin's hopes.</description>

Abstract: Encoding quantum information in a quantum error correction (QEC) code enhances protection against errors. Imperfection of quantum devices due to decoherence effects will limit the fidelity of quantum gate operations. In particular, neutral atom quantum computers will suffer from correlated errors because of the finite lifetime of the Rydberg states that facilitate entanglement. Predicting the impact of such errors on the performance of topological QEC codes is important in understanding and characterising the fidelity limitations of a real quantum device. Mapping a QEC code to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with disorder allows us to use Monte Carlo techniques to calculate upper bounds on error rates without resorting to an optimal decoder. In this Article, we adopt this statistical mapping to predict error rate thresholds for neutral atom architecture, assuming radiative decay to the computational basis, leakage and atom loss as the sole error sources. We quantify this error rate threshold $p_\text{th}$ and bounds on experimental constraints, given any set of experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Mode Diversity and Multiplexing for Continuous Variables Quantum Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the performance of continuous-variable (CV) quantum communication systems employing diversity schemes to mitigate the effects of realistic channel conditions, including Gaussian lossy channels, fading, and crosstalk. By modeling the transmittivity of the channel as a log-normal distribution, we account for the stochastic nature of fading. We analyze the impact of both post-processing amplification at the receiver and pre-amplification at the transmitter on the fidelity of the communication system. Our findings reveal that diversity schemes provide significant advantages over single-channel transmission in terms of fidelity, particularly in conditions of strong fading and high thermal background noise. We also explore the effect of crosstalk between channels and demonstrate that a noticeable advantage persists in scenarios of strong fading or thermal noise. For CV-QKD, we show that diversity can outperform multiplexing in terms of average secret key rate, revealing a diversity advantage over multiplexing in some regimes.</description>

      <title>A Sierpinski Triangle Fermion-to-Qubit Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to simulate a system of fermions on a quantum computer, it is necessary to represent the fermionic states and operators on qubits. This can be accomplished in multiple ways, including the well-known Jordan-Wigner transform, as well as the parity, Bravyi-Kitaev, and ternary tree encodings. Notably, the Bravyi-Kitaev encoding can be described in terms of a classical data structure, the Fenwick tree. Here we establish a correspondence between a class of classical data structures similar to the Fenwick tree, and a class of one-to-one fermion-to-qubit transforms. We present a novel fermion-to-qubit encoding based on the recently discovered "Sierpinski tree" data structure, which matches the operator locality of the ternary tree encoding, and has the additional benefit of encoding the fermionic states as computational basis states. This is analogous to the formulation of the Bravyi-Kitaev encoding in terms of the Fenwick tree.</description>

      <title>Stories in the two-state vector formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-state vector formalism of quantum mechanics is a time-symmetrized approach to standard quantum theory. In our work, we aim to establish rigorous foundations for the future investigation within this formalism. We introduce the concept of a story - a compatible pair consisting of a two-state vector and an ideal measurement. Using this concept, we examine the structure of the space comprising all two-state vectors. We conclude that some pairs of two-state vectors or their statistical mixtures cannot be physically distinguished. In particular, we demonstrate that not every non-separable two-state vector is distinguishable from a statistical mixture of separable two-state vectors. This leads us to formulate the definition of a strictly non-separable two-state vector as a genuine manifestation of entanglement between the past and the future.</description>

      <title>Lightcone shading for classically accelerated quantum error mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation (QEM) can recover accurate expectation values from a noisy quantum computer by trading off bias for variance, such that an averaged result is more accurate but takes longer to converge. Probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) stands out among QEM methods as an especially robust means of controllably eliminating bias. However, PEC often exhibits a much larger variance than other methods, inhibiting application to large problems for a given error rate. Recent analyses have shown that the variance of PEC can be reduced by not mitigating errors lying outside the causal lightcone of the desired observable. Here, we improve the lightcone approach by classically computing tighter bounds on how much each error channel in the circuit can bias the final result. This set of bounds, which we refer to as a "shaded lightcone," enables a more targeted application of PEC, improving the tradespace of bias and variance, while illuminating how the structure of a circuit determines the difficulty of error-mitigated computation. Although a tight shaded lightcone is exponentially hard to compute, we present an algorithm providing a practical benefit for some problems even with modest classical resources, leveraging the ease of evolving an error instead of the state or the observable. The algorithm reduces the runtime that would be needed to apply PEC for a target accuracy in an example 127-qubit Trotter circuit by approximately two orders of magnitude compared to standard lightcone-PEC, expanding the domain of problems that can be computed via direct application of PEC on noisy hardware.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kernel Methods under Scrutiny: A Benchmarking Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the entry of kernel theory in the field of quantum machine learning, quantum kernel methods (QKMs) have gained increasing attention with regard to both probing promising applications and delivering intriguing research insights. Two common approaches for computing the underlying Gram matrix have emerged: fidelity quantum kernels (FQKs) and projected quantum kernels (PQKs). Benchmarking these methods is crucial to gain robust insights and to understand their practical utility. In this work, we present a comprehensive large-scale study examining QKMs based on FQKs and PQKs across a manifold of design choices. Our investigation encompasses both classification and regression tasks for five dataset families and 64 datasets, systematically comparing the use of FQKs and PQKs quantum support vector machines and kernel ridge regression. This resulted in over 20,000 models that were trained and optimized using a state-of-the-art hyperparameter search to ensure robust and comprehensive insights. We delve into the importance of hyperparameters on model performance scores and support our findings through rigorous correlation analyses. In this, we also closely inspect two data encoding strategies. Moreover, we provide an in-depth analysis addressing the design freedom of PQKs and explore the underlying principles responsible for learning. Our goal is not to identify the best-performing model for a specific task but to uncover the mechanisms that lead to effective QKMs and reveal universal patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a notion of quantum channels that can make states useless for universal quantum computation by destroying their magic (non-stabilizerness) - we refer to them as magic-breaking channels. We establish the properties of these channels in arbitrary dimensions. We prove the necessary and sufficient criteria for qubit channels to be magic-breaking and present an algorithm for determining the same. Moreover, we provide compact criteria in terms of the parameters for several classes of qubit channels to be magic-breaking under various post-processing operations. Further, we investigate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the tensor product of multiple qubit channels to be magic-breaking. We establish implications of the same for the dynamical resource theory of magic preservability.</description>

      <title>Analog Quantum Simulation of Coupled Electron-Nuclear Dynamics in Molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the coupled electron-nuclear dynamics in molecules induced by light-matter interactions is crucial for potential applications of photochemical processes, but it is challenging due to the high computational costs of exact quantum dynamics simulations. Quantum computing has the potential to reduce the computational cost required for exact quantum dynamics simulations by exploiting the quantum nature of the computational device. However, existing quantum algorithms for coupled electron-nuclear dynamics simulation either require fault-tolerant devices, or use the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation and a truncation of the electronic basis. In this work, we present the first analog quantum simulation approach for molecular vibronic dynamics in a pre-BO framework, i.e. without the separation of electrons and nuclei, by mapping the molecular Hamiltonian to a device with coupled qubits and bosonic modes. We show that our approach has exponential savings in resource and computational costs compared to the equivalent classical algorithms. The computational cost of our approach is also exponentially lower than existing BO-based quantum algorithms. Furthermore, our approach has a much smaller resource scaling than the existing pre-BO quantum algorithms for chemical dynamics. The low cost of our approach will enable an exact treatment of electron-nuclear dynamics on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Constrained local Hamiltonians: quantum generalizations of Vertex Cover</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent successes in producing rigorous approximation algorithms for local Hamiltonian problems such as Quantum Max Cut have exploited connections to unconstrained classical discrete optimization problems. We initiate the study of approximation algorithms for constrained local Hamiltonian problems, using the well-studied classical Vertex Cover problem as inspiration. We consider natural quantum generalizations of Vertex Cover, and one of them, called Transverse Vertex Cover (TVC), is equivalent to the PXP model with additional 1-local Pauli-Z terms. We show TVC is StoqMA-hard and develop an approximation algorithm for it based on a quantum generalization of the classical local ratio method. This results in a simple linear-time classical approximation algorithm that does not depend on solving a convex relaxation. We also demonstrate our quantum local ratio method on a traditional unconstrained quantum local Hamiltonian version of Vertex Cover which is equivalent to the anti-ferromagnetic transverse field Ising model.</description>

      <title>An efficient finite-resource formulation of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories beyond one dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Abelian gauge theories provide an accurate description of fundamental interactions, as both perturbation theory and quantum Monte Carlo computations in lattice gauge theory, it when applicable, show remarkable agreement with experimental data from particle colliders and cosmological observations. Complementing these computations, or combining them with quantum-inspired Hamiltonian lattice computations on quantum machines to improve continuum limit predictions with current quantum resources, is a formidable open challenge. Here, we propose a resource-efficient method to compute the running of the coupling in non-Abelian gauge theories beyond one spatial dimension. We first represent the Hamiltonian on periodic lattices in terms of loop variables and conjugate loop electric fields, exploiting the Gauss law to retain the gauge-independent ones. Then, we identify a local basis for small and large loops variationally to minimize the truncation error while computing the running of the coupling on small tori. Our method enables computations at arbitrary values of the bare coupling and lattice spacing with current quantum computers, simulators and tensor-network calculations, in regimes otherwise inaccessible.</description>

      <title>First Search for Ultralight Dark Matter Using a Magnetically Levitated Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the first search for ultralight dark matter using a magnetically levitated particle. A sub-millimeter permanent magnet is levitated in a superconducting trap with a measured force sensitivity of $0.2\,\mathrm{fN/\sqrt{Hz}}$. We find no evidence of a signal and derive limits on dark matter coupled to the difference between baryon and lepton number, $B - L$, in the mass range $(1.10360 \text{ - } 1.10485) \times 10^{-13}\,\mathrm{eV} / c^2$. Our most stringent limit on the coupling strength is $g_{B - L} \lesssim 2.98 \times 10^{-21}$. We propose the POLONAISE (Probing Oscillations using Levitated Objects for Novel Accelerometry in Searches of Exotic physics) experiment, featuring short-, medium-, and long-term upgrades that will give us leading sensitivity in a wide mass range and demonstrating the promise of this novel quantum sensing technology in the hunt for dark matter.</description>

      <title>A Hardware-Aware Gate Cutting Framework for Practical Quantum Circuit Knitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circuit knitting emerges as a promising technique to overcome the limitation of the few physical qubits in near-term quantum hardware by cutting large quantum circuits into smaller subcircuits. Recent research in this area has been primarily oriented towards reducing subcircuit sampling overhead. Unfortunately, these works neglect hardware information during circuit cutting, thus posing significant challenges to the follow on stages. In fact, direct compilation and execution of these partitioned subcircuits yields low-fidelity results, highlighting the need for a more holistic optimization strategy.
  In this work, we propose a hardware-aware framework aiming to advance the practicability of circuit knitting. Drawing a contrast with prior methodologies, the presented framework designs a cutting scheme that concurrently optimizes the number of gate cuttings and SWAP insertions during circuit cutting. In particular, we leverage the graph similarity between qubits interactions and chip layout as a heuristic guide to reduces potential SWAPs in the subsequent step of qubit routing. Building upon this, the circuit knitting framework we developed has been evaluated on several quantum algorithms, leading to reduction of total subcircuits depth by up to 64% (48% on average) compared to the state-of-the-art approach, and enhancing the relative fidelity up to 2.7$\times$.</description>

      <title>Demkov--Fradkin tensor for curved harmonic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we obtain the Demkov-Fradkin tensor of symmetries for the quantum curved harmonic oscillator in a space with constant curvature given by a parameter $\kappa$. In order to construct this tensor we have firstly found a set of basic operators which satisfy the following conditions: i) their products give symmetries of the problem; in fact the Hamiltonian is a combination of such products; ii) they generate the space of eigenfunctions as well as the eigenvalues in an algebraic way; iii) in the limit of zero curvature, they come into the well known creation/annihilation operators of the flat oscillator. The appropriate products of such basic operators will produce the curved Demkov-Fradkin tensor. However, these basic operators do not satisfy Heisenberg commutators but close another Lie algebra. As a by-product, the classical Demkov-Fradkin tensor for the classical curved harmonic oscillator has been obtained by the same method. The case of two dimensions has been worked out in detail: the operators close a $so_\kappa(4)$ Lie algebra; the spectrum and eigenfunctions are explicitly solved in an algebraic way and in the classical case the trajectories have been computed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several domains of society will be disrupted once millions of high-quality qubits can be brought together to perform fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). All quantum computing hardware available today is many orders of magnitude removed from the requirements for FTQC. The intimidating challenges associated with integrating such complex systems have already been addressed by the semiconductor industry -hence many qubit makers have retrofitted their technology to be CMOS-compatible. This compatibility, however, can have varying degrees ranging from the mere ability to fabricate qubits using a silicon wafer as a substrate, all the way to the co-integration of qubits with high-yield, low-power advanced electronics to control these qubits. Extrapolating the evolution of quantum processors to future systems, semiconductor spin qubits have unique advantages in this respect, making them one of the most serious contenders for large-scale FTQC. In this review, we focus on the overlap between state-of-the-art semiconductor spin qubit systems and CMOS industry Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) principles. We identify the main differences in spin qubit operation, material, and system requirements compared to well-established CMOS industry practices. As key players in the field are looking to collaborate with CMOS industry partners, this review serves to accelerate R&amp;D towards the industrial scale production of FTQC processors.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Wavefunction of the Interacting Non-Hermitian Spin-1/2 1D System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an explicit Bethe-ansatz wavefunction to a 1D spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ interacting fermion system, manifesting a many-body resonance resulting from the interplay between interaction and non-Hermitian spin-orbit coupling. In the dilute limit, the wavefunction is greatly simplified and then factorized into Slater determinants and a Jastrow factor. An effective thermodynamic distribution is constructed with an effective Hamiltonian including a repulsion resulting from Pauli's exclusion principle and a distinctive zigzag potential arising from the resonance. The competition between these effects leads to a transition from a uniformly distributed configuration to a phase separation. The connection to the recent cold atom experimental efforts of realizing on-site atom-loss is discussed.</description>

      <title>Proposal for a Bose-Einstein condensate based test of Born's rule using light-pulse atom interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and numerically benchmark light-pulse atom interferometry with ultra-cold quantum gases as a platform to test the modulo-square hypothesis of Born's rule. Our interferometric protocol is based on a combination of double Bragg and single Raman diffraction to induce multipath interference in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and block selected interferometer paths, respectively. In contrast to previous tests employing macroscopic material slits and blocking masks, optical diffraction lattices provide a high degree of control and avoid possible systematic errors like geometrical inaccuracies from manufacturing processes. In addition, sub-recoil expansion rates of delta-kick collimated BECs allow to prepare, distinguish and selectively address the external momentum states of the atoms. This further displays in close-to-unity diffraction fidelities favorable for both high-contrast interferometry and high extinction of the blocking masks. In return, non-linear phase shifts caused by repulsive atom-atom interactions need to be taken into account, which we fully reflect in our numerical simulations of the multipath interferometer. Assuming that the modulo-square rule holds, we examine the impact of experimental uncertainties in accordance with conventional BEC interferometer to provide an upper bound of $5.7\times10^{-3}$ $\left(1.8\times10^{-3}\right)$ on the statistical deviation of $100$ $\left(1000\right)$ iterations for a hypothetical third-order interference term.</description>

      <title>Planar scanning probe microscopy enables vector magnetic field imaging at the nanoscale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planar scanning probe microscopy is a recently emerging alternative approach to tip-based scanning probe imaging. It can scan an extended planar sensor, such as a polished bulk diamond doped with magnetic-field-sensitive nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, in nanometer-scale proximity of a planar sample. So far, this technique has been limited to optical near-field microscopy, and has required nanofabrication of the sample of interest. Here we extend this technique to magnetometry using NV centers, and present a modification that removes the need for sample-side nanofabrication. We harness this new ability to perform a hitherto infeasible measurement - direct imaging of the three-dimensional vector magnetic field of magnetic vortices in a thin film magnetic heterostructure, based on repeated scanning with NV centers with different orientations within the same scanning probe. Our result opens the door to quantum sensing using multiple qubits within the same scanning probe, a prerequisite for the use of entanglement-enhanced and massively parallel schemes.</description>

      <title>Many-body tunneling in a double-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for evaluating Wannier functions, offering a new perspective on their role in many-body systems. Unlike traditional methods, such as the maximally localized Wannier functions approach, which focuses on minimizing the function tails, our approach emphasizes these tails. Using perturbative analytical approximations and extensive numerical simulations on an exactly solvable model, we address nonstandard Hubbard terms and demonstrate their critical influence on many-body dynamics. Specifically, we study tunneling dynamics in arbitrary double-well potentials, moving beyond the standard Hubbard model to include nonstandard terms such as density-induced tunneling and pair tunneling. Our results reveal that these terms significantly modify the dynamics predicted by the standard Hubbard model: density-induced tunneling modifies the single-particle tunneling parameter $\Omega_0$, while pair tunneling enables coherent propagation not captured by the standard model. We show that the discrepancies between the standard and nonstandard Hubbard models grow with increasing interaction strength, potentially leading to novel transport behaviors. However, at lower interaction strengths, both models converge, as nonstandard terms become negligible. These findings have important implications for phenomena like superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene and metal-insulator transitions. Our model aligns well with numerical simulations of lowest-band parameters and is strongly supported by experimental observations of second-order atom tunneling in optical double-well potentials. This strong agreement with experimental data highlights the accuracy and potential of our approach in providing a more comprehensive framework for describing complex many-body systems than the standard Hubbard model.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning is becoming a widely used technique with a impressive growth due to the diversity of problem of societal interest where it can offer practical solutions. This increase of applications and required resources start to become limited by present day hardware technologies. Indeed, novel machine learning subjects such as large language models or high resolution image recognition raise the question of large computing time and energy cost of the required computation. In this context, optical platforms have been designed for several years with the goal of developing more efficient hardware for machine learning. Among different explored platforms, optical free-space propagation offers various advantages: parallelism, low energy cost and computational speed. Here, we present a new design combining the strong and tunable nonlinear properties of a light beam propagating through a hot atomic vapor with an Extreme Learning Machine model. We numerically and experimentally demonstrate the enhancement of the training using such free-space nonlinear propagation on a MNIST image classification task. We point out different experimental hyperparameters that can be further optimized to improve the accuracy of the platform.</description>

Abstract: We use an exact Moreau-Yosida regularized formulation to obtain the exchange-correlation potential for periodic systems. We reveal a profound connection between rigorous mathematical principles and efficient numerical implementation, which marks the first computation of a Moreau-Yosida-based inversion for physical systems. We develop a mathematically rigorous inversion algorithm including error bounds that are verified numerically in bulk silicon. This unlocks a new pathway to analyze Kohn-Sham inversion methods, which we expect in turn to foster mathematical approaches for developing approximate functionals.</description>

      <title>Suppressing Gauge Drift in Quantum Simulations with Gauge Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of quantum lattice gauge theories faces the major challenge of maintaining gauge invariance, as various errors in the simulation push the state of the system out of the physical subspace of the system's exponentially larger Hilbert space. This paper outlines a method, based off of previous work, that uses gauge transformations in two ways. Firstly, the method exploits the Zeno effect by conducting frequent projections to suppress gauge drift. These projections utilize local gauge transformations to destructively interfere unphysical amplitudes via coupling to an ancillary qubit while the physical amplitudes are left untouched, up to a less than unity normalization factor. Secondly, gauge transformations are conducted throughout the time evolution of the system to hamper the speed of gauge drift. This paper demonstrates this method on a pure 1D SU$(2)$ toy model.</description>

      <title>In Quantum Computing Speedup Illusory?: The False Coin of "Counting Function Evaluations"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4345</link>
      <description>arXiv:1407.4345v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using a new way to encode Boolean functions in a reversible gate, an algorithm is developed in quantum computing over Z_2, symbolized QC/2, (as opposed to QC over C) that needs only one function evaluation to solve the Grover Database Search Problem of finding a designated record among 2^m records for any m. In the usual Grover algorithm in quantum computing over C, one needs essentially Sqrt(2^m) function evaluations as opposed to the average of (2^m)/2 functions evaluations needed in the classical algorithm. The one function evaluation of the QC/2 algorithm (for any m) represents such a super speedup, even over the Grover algorithm in QC/C, that one feels something has gone awry. Indeed, our analysis of the transparent calculations of Boolean functions over Z_2 shows that the classical algorithm is just repackaged in a rather obvious way in the single function evaluation of the QC/2 algorithm--whereas the calculations are hidden and non-transparent in the Grover QC/C algorithm using C. The conclusion in both cases (which is rather obvious in the QC/2 case) is that "counting function evaluations" is a false coin to measure speedup in the comparison between quantum and classical computing.</description>

      <title>Quantizing Galilean spacetime: a reconstruction of Maxwell's equations in empty space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As was recently shown, non-relativistic quantum theory can be derived by means of a projection method from a continuum of classical solutions for (massive) particles. In this paper we show that Maxwell's equations in empty space can be derived using the same method. In this case the starting point is a continuum of solutions of equations of motion for massless particles describing the structure of Galilean space-time. As a result of the projection, the space-time structure itself is changed by the appearance of a new fundamental constant $c$ with the dimension of a velocity. This maximum velocity $c$, derived here for massless particles, is analogous to the accuracy limit $\hbar$ derived earlier for massive particles. The projection method can thus be interpreted as a generalized quantization. We suspect that all fundamental fields can be traced back to continuous sets of particle trajectories, and that in this sense the particle concept is more fundamental than the field concept.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a one-dimensional spin chain, from spin 1 to spin N, such that each spin interacts with its nearest neighbors. Performing a local operation (measurement) on spin N, we expect from the Lieb-Robinson velocity that, in general, the effect of this measurement achieves spin 1 after some while. But, in this paper, we show that if a) the measurement on spin N is performed instantaneously and b) the initial state of the spin chain is chosen appropriately, then the effect of the measurement on spin N never achieves spin 1. In other words, performing or not performing an instantaneous measurement on spin N at t=0 does not alter the reduced dynamics of spin 1 for all the times t&gt;0. We can interpret this as the following: The information of performing an instantaneous measurement on spin N is isolated such that it cannot achieve spin 1.</description>

Abstract: Simulating physical systems on quantum devices is one of the most promising applications of quantum technology. Current quantum approaches to simulating open quantum systems are still practically challenging on NISQ-era devices, because they typically require ancilla qubits and extensive controlled sequences. In this work, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical approach for simulating a class of open system dynamics called random-unitary channels. These channels naturally decompose into a series of convex unitary evolutions, which can then be efficiently sampled and run as independent circuits. The method does not require deep ancilla frameworks and thus can be implemented with lower noise costs. We implement simulations of open quantum systems up to dozens of qubits and with large channel ranks.</description>

      <title>Global becomes local: Efficient many-body dynamics for global master equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work makes progress on the issue of global- vs. local- master equations. Global master equations like the Redfield master equation (following from standard Born- and Markov- approximation) require a full diagonalization of the system Hamiltonian. This is especially challenging for interacting quantum many-body systems. We discuss a short-bath-correlation-time expansion in reciprocal (energy) space, leading to a series expansion of the jump operator, which avoids a diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. For a bath that is coupled locally to one site, this typically leads to an expansion of the global Redfield jump operator in terms of local operators. We additionally map the local Redfield master equation to a novel local Lindblad form, giving an equation which has the same conceptual advantages of traditional local Lindblad approaches, while being applicable in a much broader class of systems. Our ideas give rise to a non-heuristic foundation of local master equations, which can be combined with established many-body methods.</description>

      <title>MQT Predictor: Automatic Device Selection with Device-Specific Circuit Compilation for Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fueled by recent accomplishments in quantum computing hardware and software, an increasing number of problems from various application domains are being explored as potential use cases for this new technology. Similarly to classical computing, realizing an application on a particular quantum device requires the corresponding (quantum) circuit to be compiled so that it can be executed on the device. With a steadily growing number of available devices and a wide variety of different compilation tools, the number of choices to consider when trying to realize an application is quickly exploding. Due to missing tool support and automation, especially end-users who are not quantum computing experts are easily left unsupported and overwhelmed. In this work, we propose a methodology that allows one to automatically select a suitable quantum device for a particular application and provides an optimized compiler for the selected device. The resulting framework -- called the MQT Predictor -- not only supports end-users in navigating the vast landscape of choices, it also allows mixing and matching compiler passes from various tools to create optimized compilers that transcend the individual tools. Evaluations of an exemplary framework instantiation based on more than 500 quantum circuits and seven devices have shown that -- compared to both Qiskit's and TKET's most optimized compilation flows for all devices -- the MQT Predictor produces circuits within the top-3 out of 14 baselines in more than 98% of cases while frequently outperforming any tested combination by up to 53% when optimizing for expected fidelity. MQT Predictor is publicly available as open-source on GitHub (https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-predictor) and as an easy-to-use Python package (https://pypi.org/p/mqt.predictor).</description>

Abstract: Additive codes and some nonadditive codes use the single and multiple invariant subspaces of the stabilizer G, respectively, to construct quantum codes, so the selection of the invariant subspaces is a key problem. In this paper, I provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for this problem and, establish the quotient space codes to construct quantum codes. These new codes unify additive codes and codeword stabilized codes and can transmit classical codewords. Actually, I give an alternative approach to constructing union stabilizer codes, which is different from that of Markus Grassl and Martin Roetteler, and which is easier to deal with degenerate codes. I also present new bounds for quantum codes and provide a simple proof of the quantum Singleton bound. The quotient space approach provides a concise and clear mathematical framework for the study of quantum error-correcting codes.</description>

      <title>Quest for optimal quantum resetting: protocols for a particle on a chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09150v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the classical context, it is well known that, sometimes, if the search does not find its target, it is better to start the process anew again, known as resetting. The quantum counterpart of resetting also indicates speeding up the detection process by eliminating the dark states, i.e., situations where the particle avoids detection. In this work, we introduce the most probable position resetting(MPR) protocol in which, at a given resetting step, resets are done with certain probabilities to the set of possible peak positions (where the probability of finding the particle is maximum) that could occur because of the previous resets and followed by uninterrupted unitary evolution, irrespective of which path was taken by the particle in previous steps. In a tight-binding lattice model, there exists a 2-fold degeneracy (left and right) of the positions of maximum probability. The survival probability with optimal restart rate approaches zero (detection probability approaches one) when the particle is reset with equal probability on both sides path independently. This protocol significantly reduces the optimal mean first-detected-passage time (FDT) and performs better even if the detector is far apart compared to the usual resetting protocols where the particle is brought back to the initial position. We propose a modified protocol, an adaptive two-stage MPR, by making the associated probabilities of going to the right and left a function of steps. In this protocol, we see a further reduction of the optimal mean FDT and improvement in the search process when the detector is far apart.</description>

      <title>Unconditionally Secure Commitments with Quantum Auxiliary Inputs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the following unconditional results on quantum commitments in two related yet different models:
  1. We revisit the notion of quantum auxiliary-input commitments introduced by Chailloux, Kerenidis, and Rosgen (Comput. Complex. 2016) where both the committer and receiver take the same quantum state, which is determined by the security parameter, as quantum auxiliary inputs. We show that computationally-hiding and statistically-binding quantum auxiliary-input commitments exist unconditionally, i.e., without relying on any unproven assumption, while Chailloux et al. assumed a complexity-theoretic assumption, ${\bf QIP}\not\subseteq{\bf QMA}$. On the other hand, we observe that achieving both statistical hiding and statistical binding at the same time is impossible even in the quantum auxiliary-input setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of unconditionally proving computational security of any form of (classical or quantum) commitments for which statistical security is impossible. As intermediate steps toward our construction, we introduce and unconditionally construct post-quantum sparse pseudorandom distributions and quantum auxiliary-input EFI pairs which may be of independent interest.
  2. We introduce a new model which we call the common reference quantum state (CRQS) model where both the committer and receiver take the same quantum state that is randomly sampled by an efficient setup algorithm. We unconditionally prove that there exist statistically hiding and statistically binding commitments in the CRQS model, circumventing the impossibility in the plain model.
  We also discuss their applications to zero-knowledge proofs, oblivious transfers, and multi-party computations.</description>

      <title>SQuADDS: A validated design database and simulation workflow for superconducting qubit design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an open-source database of superconducting quantum device designs that may be used as the starting point for customized devices. Each design can be generated programmatically using the open-source Qiskit Metal package, and simulated using finite-element electromagnetic solvers. We present a robust workflow for achieving high accuracy on design simulations. Many designs in the database are experimentally validated, showing excellent agreement between simulated and measured parameters. Our database includes a front-end interface that allows users to generate ``best-guess'' designs based on desired circuit parameters. This project lowers the barrier to entry for research groups seeking to make a new class of devices by providing them a well-characterized starting point from which to refine their designs.</description>

      <title>Microwave signal processing using an analog quantum reservoir computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) has been proposed as a paradigm for performing machine learning with quantum processors where the training is efficient in the number of required runs of the quantum processor and takes place in the classical domain, avoiding the issue of barren plateaus in parameterized-circuit quantum neural networks. It is natural to consider using a quantum processor based on superconducting circuits to classify microwave signals that are analog -- continuous in time. However, while theoretical proposals of analog QRC exist, to date QRC has been implemented using circuit-model quantum systems -- imposing a discretization of the incoming signal in time, with each time point input by executing a gate operation. In this paper we show how a quantum superconducting circuit comprising an oscillator coupled to a qubit can be used as an analog quantum reservoir for a variety of classification tasks, achieving high accuracy on all of them. Our quantum system was operated without artificially discretizing the input data, directly taking in microwave signals. Our work does not attempt to address the question of whether QRCs could provide a quantum computational advantage in classifying pre-recorded classical signals. However, beyond illustrating that sophisticated tasks can be performed with a modest-size quantum system and inexpensive training, our work opens up the possibility of achieving a different kind of advantage than a purely computational advantage: superconducting circuits can act as extremely sensitive detectors of microwave photons; our work demonstrates processing of ultra-low-power microwave signals in our superconducting circuit, and by combining sensitive detection with QRC processing within the same system, one could achieve a quantum sensing-computational advantage, i.e., an advantage in the overall analysis of microwave signals comprising just a few photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the derivation of a general solution to the scattering problem of particles incident onto a barrier of constant potential. This solution is constructed through a geometrodynamic approach to Bohmian mechanics, assuming that particles undergo quantum tunneling along geodesic trajectories in an Alcubierre-like spacetime. Furthermore, from this solution, mathematical expressions for the quantum potential, momentum, position, and tunneling time are determined in terms of the spacetime geometry for each relevant region. This allows us to explain the Hartman effect as a consequence of spacetime distortion generated by the quantum potential within the barrier.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Neural Exchange-Correlation Functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) provides the exact ground state energy and electron density of a molecule, contingent on the as-yet-unknown universal exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Recent research has demonstrated that neural networks can efficiently learn to represent approximations to that functional, offering accurate generalizations to molecules not present during the training process. With the latest advancements in quantum-enhanced machine learning (ML), evidence is growing that Quantum Neural Network (QNN) models may offer advantages in ML applications. In this work, we explore the use of QNNs for representing XC functionals, enhancing and comparing them to classical ML techniques. We present QNNs based on differentiable quantum circuits (DQCs) as quantum (hybrid) models for XC in KS-DFT, implemented across various architectures. We assess their performance on 1D and 3D systems. To that end, we expand existing differentiable KS-DFT frameworks and propose strategies for efficient training of such functionals, highlighting the importance of fractional orbital occupation for accurate results. Our best QNN-based XC functional yields energy profiles of the H$_2$ and planar H$_4$ molecules that deviate by no more than 1 mHa from the reference DMRG and FCI/6-31G results, respectively. Moreover, they reach chemical precision on a system, H$_2$H$_2$, not present in the training dataset, using only a few variational parameters. This work lays the foundation for the integration of quantum models in KS-DFT, thereby opening new avenues for expressing XC functionals in a differentiable way and facilitating computations of various properties.</description>

      <title>Analysis of ion chain sympathetic cooling and gate dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sympathetic cooling is a technique often employed to mitigate motional heating in trapped-ion quantum computers. However, choosing system parameters such as number of coolants and cooling duty cycle for optimal gate performance requires evaluating trade-offs between motional errors and other slower errors such as qubit dephasing. The optimal parameters depend on cooling power, heating rate, and ion spacing in a particular system. In this study, we aim to analyze best practices for sympathetic cooling of long chains of trapped ions using analytical and computational methods. We use a case study to show that optimal cooling performance is achieved when coolants are placed at the center of the chain and provide a perturbative upper-bound on the cooling limit of a mode given a particular set of cooling parameters. In addition, using computational tools, we analyze the trade-off between the number of coolant ions in a chain and the center-of-mass mode heating rate. We also show that cooling as often as possible when running a circuit is optimal when the qubit coherence time is otherwise long. These results provide a roadmap for how to choose sympathetic cooling parameters to maximize circuit performance in trapped ion quantum computers using long chains of ions.</description>

Abstract: Quasi-twisted codes are used here as the classical ingredients in the so-called Construction X for quantum error-control codes. The construction utilizes nearly self-orthogonal codes to design quantum stabilizer codes. We expand the choices of the inner product to also cover the symplectic and trace-symplectic inner products, in addition to the original Hermitian one. A refined lower bound on the minimum distance of the resulting quantum codes is established and illustrated. We report numerous record breaking quantum codes from our randomized search for inclusion in the updated online database.</description>

      <title>Boundary Time Crystals as AC sensors: enhancements and constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the use of a boundary time crystals (BTCs) as sensors of AC fields. Boundary time crystals are non-equilibrium phases of matter in contact to an environment, for which a macroscopic fraction of the many-body system breaks the time translation symmetry. We find an enhanced sensitivity of the BTC when its spins are resonant with the applied AC field, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information (QFI). The QFI dynamics in this regime is shown to be captured by a relatively simple ansatz consisting of an initial power-law growth and late-time exponential decay. We study the scaling of the ansatz parameters with resources (encoding time and number of spins) and identify a moderate quantum enhancement in the sensor performance through comparison with classical QFI bounds. Investigating the precise source of this performance, we find that despite of its long coherence time and multipartite correlations (advantageous properties for quantum metrology), the entropic cost of the BTC (which grows indefinitely in the thermodynamic limit) hinders an optimal decoding of the AC field information. This result has implications for future candidates of quantum sensors in open system and we hope it will encourage future study into the role of entropy in quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Quantum battery supercharging via counter-diabatic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a counter-diabatic approach for deriving Hamiltonians modeling superchargable quantum batteries (QBs). A necessary requirement for the supercharging process is the existence of multipartite interactions among the cells of the battery. Remarkably, this condition may be insufficient no matter the number of multipartite terms in the Hamiltonian. We analytically illustrate this kind of insufficiency through a model of QB based on the adiabatic version for the Grover search problem. On the other hand, we provide QB supercharging with just a mild number of global connections in the system. To this aim, we consider a spin-$1/2$ chain with $n$ sites in the presence of Ising multipartite interactions. We then show that, by considering the validity of the adiabatic approximation and by adding $n$ terms of $(n-1)$-site interactions, we can achieve a Hamiltonian exhibiting maximum QB power, with respect to a normalized evolution time, growing quadratically with $n$. Therefore, supercharging can be achieved by $O(n)$ terms of multipartite connections. The time constraint required by the adiabatic approximation can be surpassed by considering a counter-diabatic expansion in terms of the gauge potential for the original Hamiltonian, with a limited $O(n)$ many-body interaction terms assured via a Floquet approach for the counter-diabatic implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-talk is a well-known feature of single-photon avalanche detectors. It is especially important to account for this effect in applications involving coincidences of two or more photons registered by the sensor since in this case the cross-talk may mimic the useful signal. In this work, we characterize the cross-talk of the LinoSPAD2 detector, as well as perform joint measurements of the cross-talk and Hanbury Brown - Twiss two-photon interference, comparing and cross-calibrating both effects. With a median dark count rate of 125 cps/pixel, we report the average cross-talk probability of $0.22~\%$ for the nearest neighbor and also observe a long-range cross-talk of the order $2 \cdot 10^{-5}~\%$ for channels separated by up to 20 pixels.</description>

Abstract: Quantum networks consist of various quantum technologies, spread across vast distances, and involve various users at the same time. Certifying the functioning and efficiency of the individual components is a task that is well studied and widely used. However, the power of quantum networks can only be realized by integrating all the required quantum technologies and platforms across a large number of users. In this work, we demonstrate how to certify the distillable entanglement available in multipartite states produced by quantum networks, without relying on the physical realization of its constituent components. We do so by using the paradigm of device independence.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multimodal contrastive learning utilizing a quantum encoder to integrate EEG (electroencephalogram) and image data. This groundbreaking attempt explores the integration of quantum encoders within the traditional multimodal learning framework. By leveraging the unique properties of quantum computing, our method enhances the representation learning capabilities, providing a robust framework for analyzing time series and visual information concurrently. We demonstrate that the quantum encoder effectively captures intricate patterns within EEG signals and image features, facilitating improved contrastive learning across modalities. This work opens new avenues for integrating quantum computing with multimodal data analysis, particularly in applications requiring simultaneous interpretation of temporal and visual data.</description>

      <title>Alternatives of entanglement depth and metrological entanglement criteria</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We work out the general theory of one-parameter families of partial entanglement properties and the resulting entanglement depth-like quantities. Special cases of these are the depth of partitionability, the depth of producibility (or simply entanglement depth) and the depth of stretchability, which are based on one-parameter families of partial entanglement properties known earlier. We also construct some further physically meaningful properties, for instance the squareability, the toughness, the degree of freedom, and also several ones of entropic motivation. Metrological multipartite entanglement criteria with the quantum Fisher information fit naturally into this framework. Here we formulate these for the depth of squareability, which therefore turns out to be the natural choice, leading to stronger bounds than the usual entanglement depth. Namely, the quantum Fisher information turns out to provide a lower bound not only on the maximal size of entangled subsystems, but also on the average size of entangled subsystems for a random choice of elementary subsystems. We also formulate convex criteria for both cases, which are much stronger than the original ones. This means that the aforementioned bounds hold also for the average in every decomposition of the quantum state. We also argue for that one-parameter partial entanglement properties bearing entropic meaning are more suitable for the purpose of defining metrological bounds.</description>

Abstract: Trapped ions offer long coherence times and high fidelity, programmable quantum operations, making them a promising platform for quantum simulation of condensed matter systems, quantum dynamics, and problems related to high-energy physics. We review selected developments in trapped-ion qubits and architectures and discuss quantum simulation applications that utilize these emerging capabilities. This review emphasizes developments in digital (gate-based) quantum simulations that exploit trapped-ion hardware capabilities, such as flexible qubit connectivity, selective mid-circuit measurement, and classical feedback, to simulate models with long-range interactions, explore non-unitary dynamics, compress simulations of states with limited entanglement, and reduce the circuit depths required to prepare or simulate long-range entangled states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light pulse atom interferometers (AIFs) are exquisite quantum probes of spatial inhomogeneity and gravitational curvature. Moreover, detailed measurement and calibration are necessary prerequisites for very-long-baseline atom interferometry (VLBAI). Here we present a method in which the differential signal of two co-located interferometers singles out a phase shift proportional to the curvature of the gravitational potential. The scale factor depends only on well controlled quantities, namely the photon wave number, the interferometer time and the atomic recoil, which allows the curvature to be accurately inferred from a measured phase. As a case study, we numerically simulate such a co-located gradiometric interferometer in the context of the Hannover VLBAI facility and prove the robustness of the phase shift in gravitational fields with complex spatial dependence. We define an estimator of the gravitational curvature for non-trivial gravitational fields and calculate the trade-off between signal strength and estimation accuracy with regard to spatial resolution. As a perspective, we discuss the case of a time-dependent gravitational field and corresponding measurement strategies.</description>

Abstract: Direct detection experiments for dark matter are increasingly ruling out large parameter spaces. However, light dark matter models with particle masses $&lt;$ GeV are still largely unconstrained. Here we examine a proposal to use atom interferometers to detect a light dark matter subcomponent at sub-GeV masses. We describe the decoherence and phase shifts caused by dark matter scattering off of one "arm" of an atom interferometer using a generalized dark matter direct detection framework. This allows us to consider multiple channels: nuclear recoils, hidden photon processes, and axion interactions. We apply this framework to several proposed atom interferometer experiments. Because atom interferometers are sensitive to extremely low momentum deposition and their coherent atoms may give them a boost in sensitivity, these experiments will be highly competitive and complementary to other direct detection methods. In particular, atom interferometers are uniquely able to probe a dark matter sub-component with $m_\chi \lesssim 10~\rm{keV}$. We find that, for a mediator mass $m_\phi=10^{-5}m_\chi$, future atom interferometers could close a gap in the existing constraints on nuclear recoils down to $\bar{\sigma}_n \sim 10^{-42}~\rm{cm}^2$ for $m_\chi \sim 10^{-5} - 10^{-1}~\rm{MeV}$ dark matter masses.</description>

      <title>The Mutual Information In The Vicinity of Capacity-Achieving Input Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14219v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mutual information is bounded from above by a decreasing affine function of the square of the distance between the input distribution and the set of all capacity-achieving input distributions $\Pi_{\mathcal{A}}$, on small enough neighborhoods of $\Pi_{\mathcal{A}}$, using an identity due to Tops{\o}e and the Pinsker's inequality, assuming that the input set of the channel is finite and the constraint set $\mathcal{A}$ is polyhedral, i.e., can be described by (possibly multiple but) finitely many linear constraints. Counterexamples demonstrating nonexistence of such a quadratic bound are provided for the case of infinitely many linear constraints and the case of infinite input sets. Using Taylor's theorem with the remainder term, rather than the Pinsker's inequality and invoking Moreau's decomposition theorem the exact characterization of the slowest decrease of the mutual information with the distance to $\Pi_{\mathcal{A}}$ is determined on small neighborhoods of $\Pi_{\mathcal{A}}$. Corresponding results for classical-quantum channels are established under separable output Hilbert space assumption for the quadratic bound and under finite-dimensional output Hilbert space assumption for the exact characterization. Implications of these observations for the channel coding problem and applications of the proof techniques to related problems are discussed.</description>

      <title>A class of 2 X 2 correlated random-matrix models with Brody spacing distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01514v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of 2 X 2 random-matrix models is introduced for which the Brody distribution is the exact eigenvalue spacing distribution. The matrix elements consist of constrained sums of an exponential random variable raised to various powers that depend on the Brody parameter. The random matrices introduced here differ from those of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) in three important ways: the matrix elements are not independent and identically distributed (i.e., not IID) nor Gaussian-distributed, and the matrices are not necessarily real and/or symmetric. The first two features arise from dropping the classical independence assumption, and the third feature stems from dropping the quantum-mechanical conditions that are imposed in the construction of the GOE. In particular, the hermiticity condition, which in the present model, is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the eigenvalues to be real, is not imposed. Consequently, complex non-Hermitian 2 X 2 random matrices with real or complex eigenvalues can also have spacing distributions that are intermediate between those of the Poisson and Wigner classes. Numerical examples are provided for different types of random matrices, including complex-symmetric matrices with real or complex-conjugate eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Anomalous universal quantum transport in 2D asymptotic quasiperiodic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic systems extend the concept of the Anderson transition to quasi-random and low-dimensional realms and have garnered widespread attention. Here, we propose the asymptotic quasiperiodic two-dimensional systems characterized by a sequence of rational magnetic fluxes, which have an irrational limit, and predict exotic universal wave-packet dynamics and transport phenomena associated with the asymptotic quasiperiodicity (AQP). The predictions unveil a class of multiple metal-insulator transitions driven by a novel interplay effect between AQP, relaxation, and finite temperature, which further reveals a unified and profound mechanism. Specifically, all the transport phenomena, including the wave-packet dynamics, the bulk and edge transport, are unified in the universal scaling laws unveiled in the asymptotic quasiperiodic regime, which demonstrate a nontrivial asymptotic connection to quantum phases in the quasiperiodic limit. Our work enriches the universal quantum transport phenomena, adds to the basic mechanisms underlying metal-insulator transitions, and opens up an avenue to study the exotic transport physics with AQP in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Floquet engineering of many-body states by the ponderomotive potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ponderomotive force is an effective static force that a particle feels in an oscillating field, whose static potential may be called the ponderomotive potential. We generalize this notion to periodically driven quantum many-body systems, and propose it as a convenient tool to engineer their non-equilibrium steady states beyond the single particle level. Applied to materials driven by light, the ponderomotive potential is intimately related to the equilibrium optical conductivity, which is enhanced close to resonances. We show that the ponderomotive potential from the incident light may be used to induce exciton condensates in semiconductors, to generate attractive interactions leading to superconductivity in certain electron-phonon systems, and to create additional free energy minima in systems with charge/spin/excitonic orders. These effects are presented with experimentally relevant parameters.</description>

      <title>Cavity-resonated detection of spin polarization in a microfabricated atomic vapor cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate continuous Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) nondestructive monitoring of the electron spin polarization of an atomic vapor in a microfabricated vapor cell within an optical resonator. The two-chamber silicon and glass cell contains $^{87}$Rb and 1.3 amagat of N$_{2}$ buffer gas, and is placed within a planar optical resonator formed by two mirrors with dichroic dielectric coatings to resonantly enhance the coupling to phase-modulated probe light near the D$_2$ line at 780 nm. We describe the theory of signal generation in this system, including the spin-dependent complex refractive index, cavity optical transfer functions, and PDH signal response to spin polarization. We observe cavity transmission and PDH signals across $\approx 200$ GHz of detuning around the atomic resonance line. By resonant optical pumping on the 795 nm D$_1$ line, we observe spin-dependent cavity line shifts, in good agreement with theory. We use the saturation of the line shift vs. optical pumping power to calibrate the number density and efficiency of the optical pumping. In the unresolved sideband regime, we observe quantum-noise-limited PDH readout of the spin polarization density, with a flat noise floor of $9 \times 10^9$ spins cm$^{-3}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$ for frequencies above 700 Hz. We note possible extensions of the technique.</description>

      <title>An algebraic approach to gravitational quantum mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most approaches towards a quantum theory of gravitation indicate the existence of a minimal length scale of the order of the Planck length. Quantum mechanical models incorporating such an intrinsic length scale call for a deformation of Heisenberg's algebra resulting in a generalized uncertainty principle and constitute what is called gravitational quantum mechanics. Utilizing the position representation of this deformed algebra, we study various models of gravitational quantum mechanics. The free time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet is investigated as well as the spectral properties of a particle bound by an external attractive potential. Here the cases of a box with infinite walls and an attractive potential well of finite depth are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02240v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement, superposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial processing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help solve many complex problems that cannot be solved otherwise with conventional computing methods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics, chemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy, banking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few years have witnessed remarkable progress in quantum software and algorithm creation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the prospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have comprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and find outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research community working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand quantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on current research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum computer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography, quantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential challenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and development are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike charge, heat flows are difficult to control. We show that, in mesoscopic conductors, electronic thermal currents can be manipulated with a magnetic field by using the Aharonov-Bohm effect: the magnetic control of the interference pattern enhances the thermoelectric effect, while heat transport can be totally suppressed. In a three-terminal configuration, the flux-induced broken reciprocity generates a non-local thermoelectric response and translates to the circulation of heat. This way, efficient thermoelectric generators, thermal switches and thermal circulators, as well as energy harvesters can be defined for minimally disturbing thermal management at the nanoscale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum cosmology, it is expected that the Big Bang singularity is resolved and the universe undergoes a bounce. We find that for Gaussian initial states, matter-gravity entanglement entropy rises rapidly during the bounce, declines, and then approaches a steady-state value following the bounce. These observations suggest that matter-gravity entanglement is a feature of the macroscopic universe and that there is no Second Law of entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in quenched extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with anomalous dynamical quantum phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on topological models unveils fascinating physics, especially in the realm of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs). However, the understanding of entanglement structures and properties near DQPT in models with longer-range hoppings is far from complete. In this work, we study DQPTs in the quenched extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Anomalous DQPTs, where the number of critical momenta exceeds the winding number differences between the pre-quench and post-quench phases, are observed. We find that the entanglement exhibits local maximum (minimum) around the anomalous DQPTs, in line with the level crossings (separations) around the middle of the correlation matrix spectrum. We further categorize the phases in the equilibrium model into two classes and distinctive features in the time evolution of the entanglement involving quenches within and across the two classes are identified. The findings pave the way to a better understanding of topological models with longer-range hoppings in the out-of-equilibrium regime.</description>

      <title>Driving noncollinear interlayer exchange coupling intrinsically in magnetic trilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic side layers sandwiching a nonmagnetic spacer as a metallic trilayer has become a pivotal platform for achieving spintronic devices. Recent experiments demonstrate that manipulating the width or the nature of conducting spacer induces noncollinear magnetic alignment between the side layers. Our theoretical analysis reveals that altering the width of spacer significantly affects the interlayer exchange coupling (IEC), resulting in noncollinear alignment. Through analytic and first-principles methods, our study on the Fe/Ag/Fe trilayer shows that at a specific width of the Ag spacer, the magnetic moments of side layers tend to be perpendicular. This alignment is mediated by Ag quantum well states, exhibiting spin spirals across the trilayer. Our results reveal that the noncollinear IEC offers a degree of freedom to control magnetic devices and boot spintronic technology with improved transport capabilities.</description>
