      <title>On the Counting Complexity of the Skolem Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Skolem Problem asks, given an integer linear recurrence sequence (LRS), to determine whether the sequence contains a zero term or not. Its decidability is a longstanding open problem in theoretical computer science and automata theory. Currently, decidability is only known for LRS of order at most 4. On the other hand, the sole known complexity result is NP-hardness, due to Blondel and Portier.
  A fundamental result in this area is the celebrated Skolem-Mahler-Lech theorem, which asserts that the zero set of any LRS is the union of a finite set and finitely many arithmetic progressions. This paper focuses on a computational perspective of the Skolem-Mahler-Lech theorem: we show that the problem of counting the zeros of a given LRS is #P-hard, and in fact #P-complete for the instances generated in our reduction.</description>

      <title>PosSLP and Sum of Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem PosSLP is the problem of determining whether a given straight-line program (SLP) computes a positive integer. PosSLP was introduced by Allender et al. to study the complexity of numerical analysis (Allender et al., 2009). PosSLP can also be reformulated as the problem of deciding whether the integer computed by a given SLP can be expressed as the sum of squares of four integers, based on the well-known result by Lagrange in 1770, which demonstrated that every natural number can be represented as the sum of four non-negative integer squares.
  In this paper, we explore several natural extensions of this problem by investigating whether the positive integer computed by a given SLP can be written as the sum of squares of two or three integers. We delve into the complexity of these variations and demonstrate relations between the complexity of the original PosSLP problem and the complexity of these related problems. Additionally, we introduce a new intriguing problem called Div2SLP and illustrate how Div2SLP is connected to DegSLP and the problem of whether an SLP computes an integer expressible as the sum of three squares.
  By comprehending the connections between these problems, our results offer a deeper understanding of decision problems associated with SLPs and open avenues for further exciting research</description>

      <title>Deterministic Weighted Automata under Partial Observability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weighted automata is a basic tool for specification in quantitative verification, which allows to express quantitative features of analysed systems such as resource consumption. Quantitative specification can be assisted by automata learning as there are classic results on Angluin-style learning of weighted automata. The existing work assumes perfect information about the values returned by the target weighted automaton. In assisted synthesis of a quantitative specification, knowledge of the exact values is a strong assumption and may be infeasible. In our work, we address this issue by introducing a new framework of partially-observable deterministic weighted automata, in which weighted automata return intervals containing the computed values of words instead of the exact values. We study the basic properties of this framework with the particular focus on the challenges of</description>

      <title>Graph Homomorphism, Monotone Classes and Bounded Pathwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent paper describes a framework for studying the computational complexity of graph problems on monotone classes, that is those omitting a set of graphs as a subgraph. If the problems lie in the framework, and many do, then the computational complexity can be described for all monotone classes defined by a finite set of omitted subgraphs. It is known that certain homomorphism problems, e.g. $C_5$-Colouring, do not sit in the framework. By contrast, we show that the more general problem of Graph Homomorphism does sit in the framework.
  The original framework had examples where hard versus easy were NP-complete versus P, or at least quadratic versus almost linear. We give the first example of a problem in the framework such that hardness is in the polynomial hierarchy above NP. Considering a variant of the colouring game as studied by Bodlaender, we show that with the restriction of bounded alternation, the list version of this problem is contained in the framework. The hard cases are $\Pi_{2k}^\mathrm{P}$-complete and the easy cases are in P.
  The cases in P comprise those classes for which the pathwidth is bounded. Bodlaender explains that Sequential $3$-Colouring Construction Game is in P on classes with bounded vertex separation number, which coincides with bounded pathwidth on unordered graphs. However, these graphs are ordered with a playing order for the two players, which corresponds to a prefix pattern in a quantified formula. We prove that Sequential $3$-Colouring Construction Game is Pspace-complete on some class of bounded pathwidth, using a celebrated result of Atserias and Oliva.
  We consider several locally constrained variants of the homomorphism problem. Like $C_5$-Colouring, none of these is in the framework. However, when we consider the bounded-degree restrictions, we prove that each of these problems is in our framework.</description>

      <title>SAT, Gadgets, Max2XOR, and Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Annealers are basically quantum computers that with high probability can optimize certain quadratic functions on Boolean variables in constant time. These functions are basically the Hamiltonian of Ising models that reach the ground energy state, with a high probability, after an annealing process. They have been proposed as a way to solve SAT.
  These Hamiltonians can be seen as Max2XOR problems, i.e. as the problem of finding an assignment that maximizes the number of XOR clauses of at most 2 variables that are satisfied. In this paper, we present several gadgets to reduce SAT to Max2XOR. We show how they can be used to translate SAT instances to initial configurations of a quantum annealer.</description>

      <title>Undercomplete Decomposition of Symmetric Tensors in Linear Time, and Smoothed Analysis of the Condition Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study symmetric tensor decompositions, i.e., decompositions of the form $T = \sum_{i=1}^r u_i^{\otimes 3}$ where $T$ is a symmetric tensor of order 3 and $u_i \in \mathbb{C}^n$.In order to obtain efficient decomposition algorithms, it is necessary to require additional properties from $u_i$. In this paper we assume that the $u_i$ are linearly independent. This implies $r \leq n$,that is, the decomposition of T is undercomplete.
  We give a randomized algorithm for the following problem in the exact arithmetic model of computation: Let $T$ be an order-3 symmetric tensor that has an undercomplete decomposition.Then given some $T'$ close to $T$, an accuracy parameter $\varepsilon$, and an upper bound B on the condition number of the tensor, output vectors $u'_i$ such that $||u_i - u'_i|| \leq \varepsilon$ (up to permutation and multiplication by cube roots of unity) with high probability. The main novel features of our algorithm are:
  1) We provide the first algorithm for this problem that runs in linear time in the size of the input tensor. More specifically, it requires $O(n^3)$ arithmetic operations for all accuracy parameters $\varepsilon =$ 1/poly(n) and B = poly(n).
  2) Our algorithm is robust, that is, it can handle inverse-quasi-polynomial noise (in $n$,B,$\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$) in the input tensor.
  3) We present a smoothed analysis of the condition number of the tensor decomposition problem. This guarantees that the condition number is low with high probability and further shows that our algorithm runs in linear time, except for some rare badly conditioned inputs.
  Our main algorithm is a reduction to the complete case ($r=n$) treated in our previous work [Koiran,Saha,CIAC 2023]. For efficiency reasons we cannot use this algorithm as a blackbox. Instead, we show that it can be run on an implicitly represented tensor obtained from the input tensor by a change of basis.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Drawing Graphs on Few Lines and Few Planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:1607.06444v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that any graph admits a crossing-free straight-line drawing in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and that any planar graph admits the same even in $\mathbb{R}^2$. For a graph $G$ and $d \in \{2,3\}$, let $\rho^1_d(G)$ denote the smallest number of lines in $\mathbb{R}^d$ whose union contains a crossing-free straight-line drawing of $G$. For $d=2$, $G$ must be planar. Similarly, let $\rho^2_3(G)$ denote the smallest number of planes in $\mathbb{R}^3$ whose union contains a crossing-free straight-line drawing of $G$.
  We investigate the complexity of computing these three parameters and obtain the following hardness and algorithmic results.
  - For $d\in\{2,3\}$, we prove that deciding whether $\rho^1_d(G)\le k$ for a given graph $G$ and integer $k$ is ${\exists\mathbb{R}}$-complete.
  - Since $\mathrm{NP}\subseteq{\exists\mathbb{R}}$, deciding $\rho^1_d(G)\le k$ is NP-hard for $d\in\{2,3\}$. On the positive side, we show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to $k$.
  - Since ${\exists\mathbb{R}}\subseteq\mathrm{PSPACE}$, both $\rho^1_2(G)$ and $\rho^1_3(G)$ are computable in polynomial space. On the negative side, we show that drawings that are optimal with respect to $\rho^1_2$ or $\rho^1_3$ sometimes require irrational coordinates.
  - We prove that deciding whether $\rho^2_3(G)\le k$ is NP-hard for any fixed $k \ge 2$. Hence, the problem is not fixed-parameter tractable with respect to $k$ unless $\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{NP}$.</description>

      <title>Dichotomies for Maximum Matching Cut: $H$-Freeness, Bounded Diameter, Bounded Radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01099v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The (Perfect) Matching Cut problem is to decide if a graph $G$ has a (perfect) matching cut, i.e., a (perfect) matching that is also an edge cut of $G$. Both Matching Cut and Perfect Matching Cut are known to be NP-complete. A perfect matching cut is also a matching cut with maximum number of edges. To increase our understanding of the relationship between the two problems, we introduce the Maximum Matching Cut problem. This problem is to determine a largest matching cut in a graph. We generalize and unify known polynomial-time algorithms for Matching Cut and Perfect Matching Cut restricted to graphs of diameter at most $2$ and to $(P_6+sP_2)$-free graphs. We also show that the complexity of Maximum Matching Cut differs from the complexities of Matching Cut and Perfect Matching Cut by proving NP-hardness of Maximum Matching Cut for $2P_3$-free quadrangulated graphs of diameter $3$ and radius $2$ and for subcubic line graphs of triangle-free graphs. In this way, we obtain full dichotomies of Maximum Matching Cut for graphs of bounded diameter, bounded radius and $H$-free graphs. Finally, we apply our techniques to get a dichotomy for the Maximum Disconnected Perfect Matching problem for $H$-free graphs. A disconnected perfect matching of a graph $G$ is a perfect matching that contains a matching cut of $G$. The Maximum Disconnected Perfect Matching problem asks to determine for a connected graph $G$, a disconnected perfect matching with a largest matching cut over all disconnected perfect matchings of $G$. Our dichotomy result implies that the original decision problem Disconnected Perfect Matching is polynomial-time solvable for $(P_6+sP_2)$-free graphs for every $s\geq 0$, which resolves an open problem of Bouquet and Picouleau (arXiv, 2020).</description>

      <title>Distribution-Specific Auditing For Subgroup Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of auditing classifiers with the notion of statistical subgroup fairness. Kearns et al. (2018) has shown that the problem of auditing combinatorial subgroups fairness is as hard as agnostic learning. Essentially all work on remedying statistical measures of discrimination against subgroups assumes access to an oracle for this problem, despite the fact that no efficient algorithms are known for it. If we assume the data distribution is Gaussian, or even merely log-concave, then a recent line of work has discovered efficient agnostic learning algorithms for halfspaces. Unfortunately, the reduction of Kearns et al. was formulated in terms of weak, "distribution-free" learning, and thus did not establish a connection for families such as log-concave distributions.
  In this work, we give positive and negative results on auditing for Gaussian distributions: On the positive side, we present an alternative approach to leverage these advances in agnostic learning and thereby obtain the first polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for auditing nontrivial combinatorial subgroup fairness: we show how to audit statistical notions of fairness over homogeneous halfspace subgroups when the features are Gaussian. On the negative side, we find that under cryptographic assumptions, no polynomial-time algorithm can guarantee any nontrivial auditing, even under Gaussian feature distributions, for general halfspace subgroups.</description>
