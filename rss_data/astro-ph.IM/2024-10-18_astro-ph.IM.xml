      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Quantifying Atmospheric Emission above Cerro Toco</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At frequencies below 1\,Hz, fluctuations in atmospheric emission in the Chajnantor region in northern Chile are the primary source of interference for bolometric millimeter-wave observations. This paper focuses on the statistics of these fluctuations using measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) water vapor radiometer. After introducing a method for separating atmospheric effects from other systematic effects, we present a direct measurement of the temporal outer scale of turbulence of $\tau_0\approx50$s corresponding to a spatial scale of $L_0\approx500$m. At smaller scales, the fluctuations are well described by the Kolmogorov 2/3 power law until, at yet smaller scales, the effects of beam smearing become important. As a part of this study, we present measurements of the atmosphere by the APEX radiometer over 20 years, focused on fluctuations in precipitable water vapor (PWV). We find that the 30-minute mean of the total PWV is not in general a robust estimator of the level of fluctuations. We show that the microwave frequency spectrum of these fluctuations is in good agreement with predictions by the \texttt{am} code for bands above 90~GHz. We then show that the variance of fluctuations in ACT's mm-wave bands correlates with the variance of fluctuations in PWV measured by APEX, even though the observatories are 6\,km apart and observe different lines of sight. We find that ACT's atmosphere-determined optical efficiencies are consistent with previous planet-based results.</description>

      <title>The cloud cover and meteorological parameters at the Lenghu site on the Tibetan Plateau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cloud cover and meteorological parameters serve as fundamental criteria for the qualification of an astronomical observatory working in optical and infrared wavelengths. In this paper, we present a systematic assessment of key meteorological parameters at the Lenghu site. The datasets adopted in this study includes the meteorological parameters collected at the local weather stations at the site and in the Lenghu Town, the sky brightness at the local zenith acquired by the Sky Quality Meters and night sky all-sky images from a digital camera, the ERA5 reanalysis database and global climate monitoring data. From 2019 to 2023, the fractional observable time of photometric condition is 69.70%, 74.97%, 70.26%, 74.27% and 65.12%, respectively. The fractional observing time is inversely correlated with surface air temperature, relative humidity, precipitable water vapor, and dew temperature, demonstrating that the observing conditions are influenced by these meteorological parameters. Large-scale air-sea interactions affect the climate at Lenghu site, which in fact delivers a clue to understand the irregularity of 2023. Specifically, precipitable water vapor at Lenghu site is correlated to both the westerly wind index and the summer North Atlantic Oscillation index, the yearly average temperature of Lenghu site is observed to increase significantly during the occurrence of a strong El Ni\~no event and the relative humidity anomaly at Lenghu site is correlated to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index. The decrease of fractional observing time in 2023 was due to the ongoing strong El Ni\~no event and relevant global climate change. We underscore the substantial role of global climate change in regulating astronomical observing conditions and the necessity for long-term continuous monitoring of the astronomical meteorological parameters at Lenghu site.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation of Angular Response of GRID Detectors for GRID Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gamma-Ray Integrated Detectors (GRID) are a space science mission that employs compact gamma-ray detectors mounted on NanoSats in low Earth orbit (LEO) to monitor the transient gamma-ray sky. Owing to the unpredictability of the time and location of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), obtaining the photon responses of gamma-ray detectors at various incident angles is important for the scientific analysis of GRB data captured by GRID detectors. For this purpose, a dedicated Monte Carlo simulation framework has been developed for GRID detectors. By simulating each GRID detector and the NanoSat carrying it, the spectral energy response, detection efficiency, and other angular responses of each detector for photons with different incident angles and energies can be obtained within this framework. The accuracy of these simulations has been corroborated through on-ground calibration, and the derived angular responses have been successfully applied to the data analysis of recorded GRBs.</description>

      <title>Galactic calibration and its long-term stability for the Auger Engineering Radio Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA), part of the Pierre Auger Observatory, is a facility designed to detect radio emissions from extensive air showers at high energies. Consisting of 153 autonomous radio-detector stations spread over 17 km$^2$, it detects radio waves in the frequency range of 30 to 80 MHz. Accurate characterization of the detector response is essential for correct data interpretation, previously achieved through laboratory measurements of the analog chain and measurements of the antenna's directional response. In this study, we perform an absolute calibration using the continuously monitored sidereal modulation of the diffuse Galactic radio emission. Calibration is done by comparing the average spectra recorded by the stations with seven different models of the full radio sky propagated through the system response, including antennas, filters, and amplifiers. The Galactic calibration is in good agreement with the original laboratory calibration. In addition, we analyze the time-dependence of the calibration constants over a period of seven years. No aging effects are observed in AERA stations over a timescale of a decade, which shows that radio detectors could help monitor possible aging effects of other detector systems during long-term operations and highlight their importance in determining an absolute cosmic-ray energy scale.</description>

      <title>lightcurver: A Python Pipeline for Precise Photometry of Multiple-Epoch Wide-Field Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: lightcurver is a photometric pipeline for time series astronomical imaging data, designed for the semi-automatic extraction of precise light curves from small, blended targets. Such targets include, but are not limited to, lensed quasars, supernovae, or Cepheids in crowded fields. lightcurver leverages STARRED (Michalewicz et al., 2023; Millon et al., 2024) to generate state-of-the-art empirical point spread function (PSF) models for each image. It then determines the relative zeropoints between epochs by combining the PSF-photometry fluxes of several stars in the field of view. Subsequently, STARRED is used again to simultaneously model the calibrated pixels of the region of interest across all epochs. This process yields light curves of the point sources and a high-resolution image model of the region of interest, cumulating the signal from all epochs. lightcurver aims to be maintainable, fast, and incremental in its processing approach. As such, it can enable the daily photometric analysis of a large number of blended targets in the context of the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>VBMicroLensing: three algorithms for multiple lensing with contour integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling of microlensing events poses computational challenges for the resolution of the lens equation and the high dimensionality of the parameter space. In particular, numerical noise represents a severe limitation to fast and efficient calculations of microlensing by multiple systems, which are of particular interest in exoplanetary searches. We present a new public code built on our previous experience on binary lenses that introduces three new algorithms for the computation of magnification and astrometry in multiple microlensing. Besides the classical polynomial resolution, we introduce a multi-polynomial approach in which each root is calculated in a frame centered on the closest lens. In addition, we propose a new algorithm based on a modified Newton-Raphson method applied to the original lens equation without any numerical manipulation. These new algorithms are more accurate and robust compared to traditional single-polynomial approaches at a modest computational cost, opening the way to massive studies of multiple lenses. The new algorithms can be used in a complementary way to optimize efficiency and robustness.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Simulation and Correlated Low-Frequency Noise Subtraction for an In-Orbit Demonstrator of Magnetic Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, nanosatellites have revolutionized the space sector due to their significant economic and time-saving advantages. As a result, they have fostered the testing of advanced instruments intended for larger space science missions. The case of MELISA is presented in this work. MELISA is a magnetic measurement instrument which aims at demonstrating the in-orbit performance of AMR sensors featuring dedicated noise reduction techniques at sub-millihertz frequencies. Such low frequency ranges are relevant for future space-borne gravitational wave detectors, where the local magnetic environment of the satellite might yield a significant contribution to the overall noise budget of the observatory. The demanding magnetic noise levels required for this bandwidth, down to 0.1 mHz, make measurements arduous. To explore sensing solutions within the H2020 European Commission Programme with the involvement of ESA, the functional performance of MELISA-III will be validated in-orbit. During operations, there is the possibility to measure the low-frequency magnetic contribution stemming from orbiting the Earth's magnetic field, impeding the characterization of the intrinsic performance of the sensor. With the objective of minimizing excess noise during the in-flight operations, the present research aims to simulate the environmental magnetic conditions in LEO to identify and subtract undesired contributions to the measurements. The in-orbit long-term magnetic fluctuations are replicated using a Helmholtz coil system. A fluxgate magnetometer allows the correlation of the generated field with the payload measurements, leading to the subsequent subtraction. Proving the effect of this approach will facilitate the noise characterization of magnetic sensors in LEO, paving the way for the in-orbit validation of MELISA-III for use in magnetically demanding missions with long integration times.</description>

      <title>Semi-supervised Learning for Detecting Inverse Compton Emission in Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse Compton (IC) emission associated with the non-thermal component of the intracluster medium (ICM) has been a long sought phenomenon in cluster physics. Traditional spectral fitting often suffers from the degeneracy between the two-temperature thermal spectrum (2T) and the one-temperature plus IC power-law spectrum (1T+IC). We present a semi-supervised deep learning approach to search for IC emission in galaxy clusters. We employ a conditional autoencoder (CAE), which is based on an autoencoder with latent representations trained to constrain the thermal parameters of the ICM. The algorithm is trained and tested using synthetic NuSTAR X-ray spectra with instrumental and astrophysical backgrounds included. The training data set only contains 2T spectra, which is more common than 1T+IC spectra. Anomaly detection is performed on the validation and test datasets, consisting of 2T spectra as the normal set and 1T+IC spectra as anomalies. With a threshold anomaly score, chosen based on cross-validation, our algorithm is able to identify spectra that contain an IC component in the test dataset, with a balanced accuracy (BAcc) of 0.64, which outperforms traditional spectral fitting (BAcc = 0.55) and ordinary autoencoder (BAcc = 0.55). Traditional spectral fitting is better at identifying IC cases among true IC spectra (a better recall), while IC predictions made by CAE have a higher chance of being true IC cases (a better precision), demonstrating their mutual complement to each other.</description>

      <title>Picometer-level quadrangle optical bonding bench for testing interferometric technologies in TianQin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interferometric techniques are crucial for space-based gravitational wave detection, requiring a picometer-level stable optical bench, precise phasemeter, interstellar transponder low-light phase locking, and laser sideband communication. These technologies must be rigorously tested on the ground before deployment in space. The AEI group has previously developed a picometer-stable hexapod optical bench to verify the linearity and precision of phase extraction for LISA. In this paper, we introduce a quadrangle quasi-monolithic optical bench aimed at simplifying the system and expanding the range of tested interferometric techniques for TianQin. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves picometer-level optical pathlength stability and phase resolution over a large dynamic range. In the laser transponder link test, the light phase-locked residual noise is lower than ${\rm 10^{-4}\,rad/Hz^{1/2}}$ above millihertz frequency range, and the laser sideband modulation has no significant coupling to the measurements in the ${\rm mHz-Hz}$ band. These results provide critical technical validation for the implementation of future gravitational wave detection in space.</description>

      <title>Learning Efficient Representations of Neutrino Telescope Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino telescopes detect rare interactions of particles produced in some of the most extreme environments in the Universe. This is accomplished by instrumenting a cubic-kilometer volume of naturally occurring transparent medium with light sensors. Given their substantial size and the high frequency of background interactions, these telescopes amass an enormous quantity of large variance, high-dimensional data. These attributes create substantial challenges for analyzing and reconstructing interactions, particularly when utilizing machine learning (ML) techniques. In this paper, we present a novel approach, called om2vec, that employs transformer-based variational autoencoders to efficiently represent neutrino telescope events by learning compact and descriptive latent representations. We demonstrate that these latent representations offer enhanced flexibility and improved computational efficiency, thereby facilitating downstream tasks in data analysis.</description>

      <title>Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE). XIV. Finding terrestrial protoplanets in the galactic neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increased brightness temperature of young rocky protoplanets during their magma ocean epoch makes them potentially amenable to atmospheric characterization to distances from the solar system far greater than thermally equilibrated terrestrial exoplanets, offering observational opportunities for unique insights into the origin of secondary atmospheres and the near surface conditions of prebiotic environments. The Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) mission will employ a space-based mid-infrared nulling interferometer to directly measure the thermal emission of terrestrial exoplanets. Here, we seek to assess the capabilities of various instrumental design choices of the LIFE mission concept for the detection of cooling protoplanets with transient high-temperature magma ocean atmospheres, in young stellar associations in particular. Using the LIFE mission instrument simulator (LIFEsim) we assess how specific instrumental parameters and design choices, such as wavelength coverage, aperture diameter, and photon throughput, facilitate or disadvantage the detection of protoplanets. We focus on the observational sensitivities of distance to the observed planetary system, protoplanet brightness temperature using a blackbody assumption, and orbital distance of the potential protoplanets around both G- and M-dwarf stars. Our simulations suggest that LIFE will be able to detect (S/N $\geq$ 7) hot protoplanets in young stellar associations up to distances of $\approx$100 pc from the solar system for reasonable integration times (up to $\sim$hours). Detection of an Earth-sized protoplanet orbiting a solar-sized host star at 1 AU requires less than 30 minutes of integration time. M-dwarfs generally need shorter integration times. The contribution from wavelength regions $&lt;$6 $\mu$m is important for decreasing the detection threshold and discriminating emission temperatures.</description>

Abstract: In July 2021, faculty from the UAlbany Department of Physics participated in a week-long field expedition with the organization UAPx to collect data on UAPs in Avalon, California, located on Catalina Island, and nearby. This paper reviews both the hardware and software techniques which this collaboration employed, and contains a frank discussion of the successes and failures, with a section about how to apply lessons learned to future expeditions. Both observable-light and infrared cameras were deployed, as well as sensors for other (non-EM) emissions. A pixel-subtraction method was augmented with other similarly simple methods to provide initial identification of objects in the sky and/or the sea crossing the cameras' fields of view. The first results will be presented based upon approximately one hour in total of triggered visible/night-vision-mode video and over 600 hours of un-triggered (far) IR video recorded, as well as 55 hours of (background) radiation measurements. Following multiple explanatory resolutions of several ambiguities that were potentially anomalous at first, we focus on the primary remaining ambiguity captured at approximately 4am Pacific Time on Friday, July 16: a dark spot in the visible/near-IR camera possibly coincident with ionizing radiation that has so far resisted prosaic explanation. We conclude with quantitative suggestions (3-5 sigma rules) for serious researchers in the still-maligned field of hard-science-based UAP studies, with an ultimate goal of identifying UAPs without confirmation bias toward mundane / speculative conclusions.</description>

      <title>Comparing sampling techniques to chart parameter space of 21 cm Global signal with Artificial Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Understanding the first billion years of the universe requires studying two critical epochs: the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and Cosmic Dawn (CD). However, due to limited data, the properties of the Intergalactic Medium (IGM) during these periods remain poorly understood, leading to a vast parameter space for the global 21cm signal. Training an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with a narrowly defined parameter space can result in biased inferences. To mitigate this, the training dataset must be uniformly drawn from the entire parameter space to cover all possible signal realizations. However, drawing all possible realizations is computationally challenging, necessitating the sampling of a representative subset of this space. This study aims to identify optimal sampling techniques for the extensive dimensionality and volume of the 21cm signal parameter space. The optimally sampled training set will be used to train the ANN to infer from the global signal experiment. We investigate three sampling techniques: random, Latin hypercube (stratified), and Hammersley sequence (quasi-Monte Carlo) sampling, and compare their outcomes. Our findings reveal that sufficient samples must be drawn for robust and accurate ANN model training, regardless of the sampling technique employed. The required sample size depends primarily on two factors: the complexity of the data and the number of free parameters. More free parameters necessitate drawing more realizations. Among the sampling techniques utilized, we find that ANN models trained with Hammersley sequence sampling demonstrate greater robustness compared to those trained with Latin hypercube and Random sampling.</description>

      <title>Simulating images of radio galaxies with diffusion models</title>

Abstract: With increasing amounts of data in astronomy, automated analysis methods have become crucial. Synthetic data are required for developing and testing such methods. Current simulations often suffer from insufficient detail or inaccurate representation of source type occurrences. To overcome those deficiencies, we implemented a deep generative model trained on observations to generate realistic radio galaxy images with full control over the flux and source morphology. We used a diffusion model, trained with continuous time steps to reduce sampling time without quality impairments. Two models were trained on two different datasets, respectively. One set was a selection of images from the second data release of the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS). The model is conditioned on peak flux values to preserve signal intensity information after re-scaling image pixel values. The other, smaller set was obtained from the VLA survey of Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST). In that set, every image was provided with a morphological class label the corresponding model was conditioned on. Conditioned sampling is realized with classifier-free diffusion guidance. We evaluated the quality of generated images by comparing distributions of different quantities over the real and generated data, including results from the standard source-finding algorithms. The class conditioning was evaluated by training a classifier and comparing its performance on both real and generated data. We were able to generate realistic images of high quality using 25 sampling steps, which is unprecedented in the field of radio astronomy. The generated images are visually indistinguishable from the training data and the distributions of different image metrics were replicated. The classifier performs equally well for real and generated images, indicating strong sampling control over morphological properties.</description>

Abstract: In 2018 the Large Sized Telescope (LST-1) prototype, designed to be the lowest energy detector for the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, was inaugurated at the Observatorio de Roque de Los Muchachos in La Palma, Canary Island and today three more are under construction, LST2-4. The LST camera, with 1855 photomultipliers (PMTs), requires precise and regular calibration. The camera calibration system (hereafter CaliBox), installed at the center of the telescope mirror dish, is equipped with a Q-switching 355 nm UV laser corresponding to the wavelength at which the maximum camera PMT quantum efficiency is achieved, a set of filters to guarantee a large dynamic range of photons on each camera pixel, and a Ulbricht sphere to spread uniformly the laser light over the camera plane 28 m away. The system is managed by an ODROID-C1+ single board computer that communicates through an Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPCUA) protocol to the camera. The CaliBox is designed to fulfill the requirements needed for the calibration of the camera including the monitor of the photon flux to guarantee the quality of the CaliBox system of laser stability, uniform illumination and intensity range. In this paper, we present in detail the optical system, the monitor of the photon flux, the relevant electronic to monitor the device. The performance of the device, the photon flux monitoring, the evaluation of the photon flux sent to the camera obtained during tests performed in Laboratory are shown.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the visual impact of wind farm lights on the nocturnal landscape</title>

Abstract: Wind farm lights are a conspicuous feature in the nocturnal landscape. Their presence is a source of light pollution for residents and the environment, severely disrupting in some places the aesthetic, cultural, and scientific values of the pristine starry skies. In this work we present a simple model for quantifying the visual impact of individual wind turbine lights, based on the comparison of their brightnesses with the brightness of well-known night sky objects. The model includes atmospheric and visual variables, and for typical parameters it shows that medium-intensity turbine lights can be brighter than Venus up to ~4 km from the turbine, brighter than alpha CMa (the brightest star on the nighttime sky) until about ~10 km, and reach the standard stellar visibility limit for the unaided eye (m_v=+6.00) at ~38 km. These results suggest that the visual range of wind farms at nighttime may be significantly larger than at daytime, a factor that should be taken into account in environmental impact assessments.</description>

      <title>New approach to template banks of gravitational waves with higher harmonics: Reducing matched-filtering cost by over an order of magnitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Searches for gravitational wave events use models, or templates, for the signals of interest. The templates used in current searches in the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) data model the dominant quadrupole mode $(\ell,|m|)=(2,2)$ of the signals, and omit sub-dominant higher-order modes (HM) such as $(\ell,|m|)=(3,3)$, $(4,4)$, which are predicted by general relativity. This omission reduces search sensitivity to black hole mergers in interesting parts of parameter space, such as systems with high masses and asymmetric mass-ratios. We develop a new strategy to include HM in template banks: instead of making templates containing a combination of different modes, we separately store normalized templates corresponding to $(2,2)$, $(3,3)$ and $(4,4)$ modes. To model aligned-spin $(3,3)$, $(4,4)$ waveforms corresponding to a given $(2,2)$ waveform, we use a combination of post-Newtonian formulae and machine learning tools. In the matched filtering stage, one can filter each mode separately with the data and collect the timeseries of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). This leads to a HM template bank whose matched-filtering cost is just $\approx 3\times$ that of a quadrupole-only search (as opposed to $\approx\! 100 \times$ in previously proposed HM search methods). Our method is effectual and generally applicable for template banks constructed with either stochastic or geometric placement techniques. New GW candidate events that we detect using our HM banks and details for combining the different SNR mode timeseries are presented in accompanying papers: Wadekar et al. [1] and [2] respectively. Additionally, we discuss non-linear compression of $(2,2)$-only geometric-placement template banks using machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The KM3NeT/ARCA neutrino detector is currently under construction at 3500 m depth offshore Capo Passero, Sicily, in the Mediterranean Sea. The main science objectives are the detection of high-energy cosmic neutrinos and the discovery of their sources. Simulations were conducted for the full KM3NeT/ARCA detector, instrumenting a volume of 1 km$^3$, to estimate the sensitivity and discovery potential to point-like neutrino sources and an all-sky diffuse neutrino flux. This paper covers the reconstruction of track- and shower-like signatures, as well as the criteria employed for neutrino event selection. By leveraging both the track and shower observation channels, the KM3NeT/ARCA detector demonstrates the capability to detect the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux within half a year of operation, achieving a 5$\sigma$ statistical significance. With an angular resolution below 0.1$^\circ$ for tracks and under 2$^\circ$ for showers, the sensitivity to point-like neutrino sources surpasses existing observed limits across the entire sky.</description>

      <title>Squeezing the quantum noise of a gravitational-wave detector below the standard quantum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precision measurements of space and time, like those made by the detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), are often confronted with fundamental limitations imposed by quantum mechanics. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle dictates that the position and momentum of an object cannot both be precisely measured, giving rise to an apparent limitation called the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). Reducing quantum noise below the SQL in gravitational-wave detectors, where photons are used to continuously measure the positions of freely falling mirrors, has been an active area of research for decades. Here we show how the LIGO A+ upgrade reduced the detectors' quantum noise below the SQL by up to 3 dB while achieving a broadband sensitivity improvement, more than two decades after this possibility was first presented.</description>
