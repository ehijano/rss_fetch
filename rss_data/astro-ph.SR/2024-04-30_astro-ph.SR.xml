      <title>Evidence for Plasmoid-mediated Magnetic Reconnection during a Small-scale Flare in the Partially Ionized Low Solar Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection plays a crucial role in the energy release process for different kinds of solar eruptions and activities. The rapid solar eruption requires a fast reconnection model. Plasmoid instability in the reconnecting current sheets is one of the most acceptable fast reconnection mechanisms for explaining the explosive events in the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) scale, which is also a potential bridge between the macroscopic MHD reconnection process and microscale dissipations. Plenty of high resolution observations indicate that the plasmoid-like structures exist in the high temperature solar corona, but such evidences are very rare in the lower solar atmosphere with partially ionized plasmas. Utilizing joint observations from the Goode Solar Telescope (GST) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we discovered a small-scale eruptive phenomenon in NOAA AR 13085, characterized by clear reconnection cusp structures, supported by Nonlinear Force-Free Field (NLFFF) extrapolation results. The plasmoid-like structures with a size about 150 km were observed to be ejected downward from the current sheet at a maximum velocity of 24 km$\cdot$s$^{-1}$ in the H$\alpha$ line wing images, followed by enhanced emissions at around the post flare loop region in multiple wave lengths. Our 2.5D high-resolution MHD simulations further reproduced such a phenomenon and revealed reconnection fine structures. These results provide comprehensive evidences for the plasmoid mediated reconnection in partially ionized plasmas, and suggest an unified reconnection model for solar flares with different length scales from the lower chromosphere to corona.</description>

      <title>On the Pair-Instability Supernova origin of J1010+2358</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first (Pop III) stars formed only out of H and He and were likely more massive than present-day stars. Massive Pop III stars in the range 140-260 M$_\odot$ are predicted to end their lives as pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), enriching the environment with a unique abundance pattern, with high ratios of odd to even elements. Recently, the most promising candidate for a pure descendant of a zero-metallicity massive PISN (260 M$_{\odot}$) was discovered by the LAMOST survey, the star J1010+2358. However, the key elements to verify the high PISN contribution, C and Al, were missing from the analysis. To rectify this, we obtained and analyzed a high-resolution VLT/UVES spectrum, correcting for 3D and/or non-LTE effects. Our measurements of both C and Al give much higher values (~1 dex) than expected from a 260 M$_{\odot}$ PISN. Furthermore, we find significant discrepancies with the previous analysis, and therefore a much less pronounced odd-even effect. Thus, we show that J1010+2358 cannot be a pure descendant of a 260 M$_{\odot}$ PISN. Instead, we find that the best fit model consists of a 13 M$_{\odot}$ Pop II core-collapse supernova combined with a Pop III supernova. Alternative, less favoured solutions $(\chi^2/\chi^2_{\rm best}\approx2.3)$ include a 50% contribution from a 260 M$_{\odot}$ PISN, or a 40% contribution from a Pop III type Ia supernova. Ultimately, J1010+2358 is certainly a unique star giving insights into the earliest chemical enrichment. However, this star has not necessarily obtained any of its metals from a PISN. So the search continues for a concrete proof of the existence of zero-metallicity PISNe.</description>

      <title>Tayler Instability Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tayler instability of toroidal magnetic fields $B_\phi$ is broadly invoked as a trigger for turbulence and angular momentum transport in stars. This paper presents a systematic revision of the linear stability analysis for a rotating, magnetized, and stably stratified star. For plausible configurations of $B_\phi$, instability requires diffusive processes: viscosity, magnetic diffusivity, or thermal/compositional diffusion. Our results reveal a new physical picture, demonstrating how different diffusive effects independently trigger instability of two types of waves in the rotating star: magnetostrophic waves and inertial waves. It develops via overstability of the waves, whose growth rate sharply peaks at some characteristic wavenumbers. We determine instability conditions for each wave branch and find the characteristic wavenumbers. The results are qualitatively different for stars with magnetic Prandtl number $Pm\ll 1$ (e.g. the Sun) and $Pm\gg 1$ (e.g. protoneutron stars). The parameter dependence of unstable modes suggests a non-universal scaling of the possible Tayler-Spruit dynamo.</description>

      <title>Long term CCD photometry of the distant cluster NGC 2419: the CMD revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing \emph{VI} images of NGC 2419 acquired over 17 years, light curves for most of the known variables in the field of the cluster are produced. A cluster membership analysis for about 3100 stars in the cluster field with proper motions from $Gaia$-DR3, revealed the presence of member stars as far as 140 pc from the cluster center and enabled the construction of a cleaner CMD free of field stars. It was found that RRab and RRc stars share the inter-order region in the instability strip, which is unusual for OoII clusters. Theoretical considerations confirm that Pop II cepheids are descendants of extreme ZAHB blue tail stars with very thin envelopes of about 10\% of the total mass. Member RR Lyrae stars were employed to calculate independent estimates of the mean cluster metallicity and distance; we found [Fe/H]$_{\rm UV}= -1.90 \pm 0.27$ and $D=86.3 \pm 5.0$ kpc from the RRab and [Fe/H]$_{\rm UV}= -1.88 \pm 0.30$ and $D=83.1 \pm 8.1$ kpc from the RRc light curves.</description>

      <title>On the Determining Physical Factor of Jet-Related Coronal Mass Ejection's Morphology in the High Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A solar jet can often cause coronal mass ejections (CMEs) with different morphologies in the high corona, for example, jet-like CMEs, bubble-like CMEs, and so-called twin CMEs that include a pair of simultaneous jet-like and bubble-like CMEs. However, what determines the morphology of a jet-related CME is still an open question. Using high spatiotemporal resolution stereoscopic observations taken by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) from October 2010 to December 2012, we performed a statistical study of jet-related CMEs to study the potential physical factors that determine the morphology of CMEs in the outer corona. Our statistical sample includes 16 jet-related CME events of which 7 are twin CME events and 9 are jet-like narrow CMEs. We find that all CMEs in our sample were accompanied by filament-driven blowout jets and Type III radio bursts during their initial formation and involved magnetic reconnection between filament channels and the surrounding magnetic fields. Most of our cases occurred in a fan-spine magnetic configuration. Our study suggests that the bubble-like components of twin CMEs lacking an obvious core are related to the expansion of the closed-loop systems next to the fan-spine topology, while the jet-like component is from the coronal extension of the jet plasma along open fields. Based on the statistical results, we conclude that the morphology of jet-related CMEs in the high corona may be related to the filament length and the initial magnetic null point height of the fan-spine structures.</description>

      <title>Rediscussion of eclipsing binaries. Paper XIX. The long-period solar-type system V454 Aurigae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V454 Aur is an eclipsing binary system containing two solar-type stars on an orbit of relatively long period (P = 27.02 d) and large eccentricity (e = 0.381). Eclipses were detected using data from the Hipparcos satellite, and a high-quality double-lined spectroscopic orbit has been presented by Griffin (2001). The NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has observed the system during eight sectors, capturing ten eclipses in their entirety. V454 Aur is unusual in that the primary star - the star eclipsed at the deeper minimum - is less massive, smaller \emph{and} cooler than its companion. This phenomenon can occur in certain configurations of eccentric orbits when the stars are closer together at the primary eclipse, causing a larger area to be eclipsed than at the secondary. We use the radial velocity measurements from Griffin and the light curves from TESS to determine the masses and radii of the component stars for the first time, finding masses of 1.034 +/- 0.006 Msun and 1.161 +/- 0.008 Msun, and radii of 0.979 +/- 0.003 Rsun and 1.211 +/- 0.003 Rsun. Our measurement of the distance to the system is consistent with that from the Gaia DR3 parallax. A detailed spectroscopic study to determine chemical abundances and more precise temperatures is encouraged. Finally, we present equations to derive the effective temperatures of the stars from the inferred temperature of the system as a whole, plus the ratio of the radii and either the surface brightness or light ratio of the stars.</description>

      <title>More luminous red novae that require jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study two intermediate luminosity optical transients (ILOTs) classified as luminous red novae (LRNe) and argue that their modeling with a common envelope evolution (CEE) without jets encounters challenges. LRNe are ILOTs powered by violent binary interaction. Although popular in the literature is to assume a CEE is the cause of LRNe, I here repeat an old claim that many LRNe are powered by grazing envelope evolution (GEE) events; the GEE might end in a CEE or a detached binary system. I find that the LRN AT 2021biy might have continued to experience mass ejection episodes after its eruption and, therefore, might not suffered a full CEE during the outburst. This adds to an earlier finding that a jet-less model does not account for some of its properties. I find that a suggested jet-less CEE model for the LRN AT 2019zhd does not reproduce its photosphere radius evolution. These results that challenge jet-less models of two LRNe strengthen a previous claim that jets play major roles in powering ILOTs and shaping their ejecta and that in many LRNe, the more compact companion launches the jets during a GEE.</description>

      <title>The Nature of X-Rays from Young Stellar Objects in the Orion Nebula Cluster -- A Chandra HETGS Legacy Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) is the closest site of very young ($\sim$ 1 Myrs) massive star formation. The ONC hosts more than 1600 young and X-ray bright stars with masses ranging from $\sim$ 0.1 to 35 $M_\odot$. The Chandra HETGS Orion Legacy Project observed the ONC with the Chandra high energy transmission grating spectrometer (HETGS) for $2.1\,$Ms. We describe the spectral extraction and cleaning processes necessary to separate overlapping spectra. We obtained 36 high resolution spectra which includes a high brilliance X-ray spectrum of $\theta^1$ Ori C with over 100 highly significant X-ray lines. The lines show Doppler broadening between 300 and $400\;\mathrm{km}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Higher spectral diffraction orders allow us to resolve line components of high Z He-like triplets in $\theta^1$ Ori C with unprecedented spectral resolution. Long term light curves spanning $\sim$20 years show all stars to be highly variable, including the massive stars. Spectral fitting with thermal coronal emission line models reveals that most sources show column densities of up to a few times $10^{22}\,$cm$^{-2}$ and high coronal temperatures of 10 to 90 MK. We observe a bifurcation of the high temperature component where some stars show a high component of 40 MK, while others show above 60 MK indicating heavy flaring activity. Some lines are resolved with Doppler broadening above our threshold of $\sim200\;\mathrm{km}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, up to $500\;\mathrm{km}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. This data set represents the largest collection of HETGS high resolution X-ray spectra from young pre-MS stars in a single star-forming region to date.</description>

      <title>FAUST XV. A disk wind mapped by CH$_3$OH and SiO in the inner 300 au of the NGC 1333 IRAS 4A2 protostar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Understanding the connection between outflows, winds, accretion and disks in the inner protostellar regions is crucial for comprehending star and planet formation process. Aims. We aim to we explore the inner 300 au of the protostar IRAS 4A2 as part of the ALMA FAUST Large Program. Methods. We analysed the kinematical structures of SiO and CH$_3$OH emission with 50 au resolution. Results. The emission arises from three zones: i) a very compact and unresolved region ($&lt;$50 au) dominated by the ice sublimation zone, at $\pm$1.5 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to vsys, traced by methanol; ii) an intermediate region (between 50 au and 150 au) traced by both SiO and CH$_3$OH, between 2 and 6 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to vsys, with an inverted velocity gradient (with respect to the large scale emission), whose origin is not clear; iii) an extended region ($&gt;$150 au) traced by SiO, above 7 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to vsys, and dominated by the outflow. In the intermediate region we estimated a CH$_3$OH/SiO abundance ratio of about 120-400 and a SiO/H$_2$ abundance of 10$^{-8}$. We explored various possibilities to explain the origin of this region such as, rotating disk/inner envelope, jet on the plane of the sky/precessing, wide angle disk wind. Conclusions. We propose that CH$_3$OH and SiO in the inner 100 au probe the base of a wide-angle disk wind. The material accelerated in the wind crosses the plane of the sky, giving rise to the observed inverted velocity gradient, and sputtering the grain mantles and cores releasing CH$_3$OH and SiO. This is the first detection of a disk wind candidate in SiO, and the second ever in CH$_3$OH.</description>

      <title>SN 2024ggi in NGC 3621: Rising Ionization in a Nearby, CSM-Interacting Type II Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present UV/optical/NIR observations and modeling of supernova (SN) 2024ggi, a type II supernova (SN II) located in NGC 3621 at 7.2 Mpc. Early-time ("flash") spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi within +0.8 days of discovery shows emission lines of H I, He I, C III, and N III with a narrow core and broad, symmetric wings (i.e., IIn-like) arising from the photoionized, optically-thick, unshocked circumstellar material (CSM) that surrounded the progenitor star at shock breakout. By the next spectral epoch at +1.5 days, SN 2024ggi showed a rise in ionization as emission lines of He II, C IV, N IV/V and O V became visible. This phenomenon is temporally consistent with a blueward shift in the UV/optical colors, both likely the result of shock breakout in an extended, dense CSM. The IIn-like features in SN 2024ggi persist on a timescale of $t_{\rm IIn} = 3.8 \pm 1.6$ days at which time a reduction in CSM density allows the detection of Doppler broadened features from the fastest SN material. SN 2024ggi has peak UV/optical absolute magnitudes of $M_{\rm w2} = -18.7$ mag and $M_{\rm g} = -18.1$ mag that are consistent with the known population of CSM-interacting SNe II. Comparison of SN 2024ggi with a grid of radiation hydrodynamics and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (nLTE) radiative-transfer simulations suggests a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} = 10^{-2}$M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($v_w$ = 50 km/s), confined to a distance of $r &lt; 5\times 10^{14}$ cm. Assuming a wind velocity of $v_w$ = 50 km/s, the progenitor star underwent an enhanced mass-loss episode in the last ~3 years before explosion.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional plasmoid-mediated reconnection and turbulence in Hall magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmoid instability accelerates reconnection in collisional plasmas by transforming a laminar reconnection layer into numerous plasmoids connected by secondary current sheets in two dimensions (2D) and by fostering self-generated turbulent reconnection in three dimensions (3D). In large-scale astrophysical and space systems, plasmoid instability likely initiates in the collisional regime but may transition into the collisionless regime as the fragmentation of the current sheet progresses toward kinetic scales. Hall MHD models are widely regarded as a simplified yet effective representation of the transition from collisional to collisionless reconnection. However, plasmoid instability in 2D Hall MHD simulations often leads to a single-X-line reconnection configuration, which significantly differs from fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulation results. This study shows that single-X-line reconnection is less likely to occur in 3D compared to 2D. Moreover, depending on the Lundquist number and the ratio between the system size and the kinetic scale, Hall MHD can also realize 3D self-generated turbulent reconnection. We analyze the features of the self-generated turbulent state, including the energy power spectra and the scale dependence of turbulent eddy anisotropy.</description>

      <title>3D hydrodynamic simulations of massive main-sequence stars II. Convective excitation and spectra of internal gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06125v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent photometric observations of massive stars have identified a low-frequency power excess which appears as stochastic low-frequency variability in light curve observations. We present the oscillation properties of high resolution hydrodynamic simulations of a 25 $\mathrm{M}_\odot$ star performed with the PPMStar code. The model star has a convective core mass of $\approx\, 12\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and approximately half of the envelope simulated. From this simulation, we extract light curves from several directions, average them over each hemisphere, and process them as if they were real photometric observations. We show how core convection excites waves with a similar frequency as the convective time scale in addition to significant power across a forest of low and high angular degree $l$ modes. We find that the coherence of these modes is relatively low as a result of their stochastic excitation by core convection, with lifetimes on the order of 10s of days. Thanks to the still significant power at higher $l$ and this relatively low coherence, we find that integrating over a hemisphere produces a power spectrum that still contains measurable power up to the Brunt--V\"ais\"al\"a frequency. These power spectra extracted from the stable envelope are qualitatively similar to observations, with same order of magnitude yet lower characteristic frequency. This work further shows the potential of long-duration, high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations for connecting asteroseismic observations to the structure and dynamics of core convection and the convective boundary.</description>

      <title>Compositional metrics of fast and slow Alfvenic solar wind emerging from coronal holes and their boundaries</title>

Abstract: We seek to understand the composition and variability of fast (FSW) and slow Alfvenic solar wind (SASW) emerging from coronal holes (CH). We leverage an opportune conjunction between Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe (PSP) during PSP Encounter 11 to include compositional diagnostics from the Solar Orbiter heavy ion sensor (HIS) as these variations provide crucial insights into the origin and nature of the solar wind. We use Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) and Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models to connect the observed plasma at PSP and Solar Orbiter to its origin footpoint in the photosphere, and compare these results with the in situ measurements. A very clear signature of a heliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossing as evidenced by enhancements in low FIP elements, ion charge state ratios, proton density, low-Alfvenicity, and polarity estimates validates the combination of modeling, data, and mapping. We identify two FSW streams emerging from small equatorial coronal holes (CH) with low ion charge state ratios, low FIP bias, high-Alfvenicity, and low footpoint brightness, yet anomalously low alpha particle abundance for both streams. We identify high-Alfvenicity slow solar wind emerging from the over-expanded boundary of a CH having intermediate alpha abundance, high-Alfvenicity, and dips in ion charge state ratios corresponding to CH boundaries. Through this comprehensive analysis, we highlight the power of multi-instrument conjunction studies in assessing the sources of the solar wind.</description>

      <title>A New Window for Studying Intermediate Polars and Tilted Accretion Disk Precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08162</link>

Abstract: TV Col is a long-period eclipsing intermediate polar (IPs) prototype star for the negative superhump (NSH) system. We investigate the eclipse minima, eclipse depth, and NSH amplitude based on TESS photometry. Using the same analytical method as SDSS J081256.85+191157.8, we find periodic variations of the O-C for eclipse minima and NSH amplitudes with periods of 3.939(25) d and 3.907(30) d, respectively. The periodic variation of the NSH amplitude of TV Col confirms that periodic NSH amplitude changes in response to the tilted disk precession may be universal, which is another evidence that the origin of the NSHs is related to the tilted disk precession. We suggest that the NSH amplitude variation may be similar to the superorbital signal, coming from the periodic change in visual brightness of the energy released by streams touching the tilted disk with tilted disk precession. Finally, we find for the first time that the eclipse depth exhibits bi-periodic variations with periods of P1 = 3.905(11) d and P2 = 1.953(4) d, respectively. P2 is about half of P1 and the disk precession period (P1~ Pprec ~ 2 * P2). We suggest that P1 may come from the periodic change in the brightness of the eclipse center due to tilted disk precession, while P2 may come from two accretion curtains precessing together with the tilted disk, but more verification and discussion are necessary. The discovery of bi-periodic variations in eclipse depth provides a new window for studying IPs and tilted disk precession.</description>

      <title>ROME III. The Arecibo Search for Star-Planet Interactions at 5 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.08899v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After nearly three decades of discovery, many exoplanetary systems have been studied and characterized in detail with one important exception: exoplanet magnetism. Although many surveys sought to detect magnetospheric radio emissions from exoplanets to directly measure their magnetic field strengths, they have yet to reveal an unambiguous detection. However, the indirect detection of exoplanet magnetic fields by measuring their influence on their host stars via magnetic star-planet interactions has recently gained prominence as an alternative method of discovery. This third paper of the ROME (Radio Observations of Magnetized Exoplanets) series presents the results of a targeted radio survey of eight nearby exoplanet-hosting systems that may engage in star-planet interactions. This survey, conducted with the Arecibo radio telescope at $\sim$5 GHz, has the greatest frequency coverage of any to date, while providing mJy-level sensitivity over $&lt;$1 s integration times. No exoplanet-induced stellar radio bursts were detected. The orbital phase coverage of candidate systems for magnetic star-planet interactions is described, and the survey results are examined within the context of the plasma flow-obstacle paradigm and searches for star-planet interactions at other wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Small-scale dynamo with nonzero correlation time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The small-scale dynamo is typically studied by assuming that the correlation time of the velocity field is zero. Some authors have used a smooth renovating flow model to study how the properties of the dynamo are affected by the correlation time being nonzero. Here, we assume the velocity is an incompressible Gaussian random field (which need not be smooth), and derive the lowest-order corrections to the evolution equation for the two-point correlation of the magnetic field in Fourier space. Using this, we obtain the evolution equation for the longitudinal correlation function of the magnetic field ($M_L$) in nonhelical turbulence, valid for arbitrary Prandtl number. The non-resistive terms of this equation do not contain spatial derivatives of $M_L$ of order greater than two. We further simplify this equation in the limit of high Prandtl number, and find that the growth rate of the magnetic energy is much smaller than previously reported. Nevertheless, the magnetic power spectrum still retains the Kazantsev form at high Prandtl number.</description>

      <title>ROME IV. The Arecibo Search for Substellar Magnetospheric Radio Emissions in Purported Exoplanet-Hosting Systems at 5 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasma flow-obstacle interactions, such as those between an exoplanet's magnetosphere and the host star's stellar wind, may lead to detectable radio emissions. Despite many attempts to detect magnetospheric (auroral) radio emissions from exoplanets, a reproducible, unambiguous detection remains elusive. This fourth paper of the ROME (Radio Observations of Magnetized Exoplanets) series presents the results of a targeted radio survey of nine nearby systems that host exoplanet, brown dwarf, or low-mass-stellar companions conducted with the Arecibo radio telescope at $\sim$5 GHz. This search for magnetospheric radio emissions has the greatest sensitivity ($\sim$1 mJy during $&lt;$1 s integration times) and collected full Stokes parameters over the largest simultaneous bandpass of any survey to date. It is also the first survey to search for radio emission from brown dwarfs of spectral class Y, which may illuminate open questions regarding their magnetism, interior and atmospheric structure, and formation histories. No magnetospheric radio emissions from substellar companions were detected. These results are examined within the context of recent theoretical work on plasma flow-obstacle interactions, and radio emissions observed from the solar system planets and ultracool dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of neutron-skin thickness and neutron-star observables based on effective nuclear interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have obtained the constraints on the density dependence of the symmetry energy from neutron-skin thickness data by parity-violating electron scatterings and neutron-star observables using a Bayesian approach, based on the standard Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF) model and its extension as well as the relativistic mean-field (RMF) model. While the neutron-skin thickness data (neutron-star observables) mostly constrain the symmetry energy at subsaturation (suprasaturation) densities, they may more or less constrain the behavior of the symmetry energy at suprasaturation (subsaturation) densities, depending on the energy-density functional form. Besides showing the final posterior density dependence of the symmetry energy, we also compare the slope parameters of the symmetry energy at 0.10 fm$^{-3}$ as well as the values of the symmetry energy at twice saturation density from three effective nuclear interactions. The present work serves as a comparison study based on relativistic and non-relativistic energy-density functionals, for constraining the nuclear symmetry energy from low to high densities using a Bayesian approach.</description>
