      <title>Classification of virtual links by arc shift move</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish that the arc shift operation on a $n$-component virtual link diagram acts as an unknotting operation when the virtual link is $n$-homogeneous proper, aiding in the classification of \( n \)-component virtual links up to arc shift equivalence. We explore the connection between the arc shift number and the odd writhe of virtual links which are homogeneous proper. Additionally, we identify sequences of virtual link diagrams \( L_n \) for which the upper bound of the arc shift number is exactly \( n \).</description>

      <title>Anosov deformations of Barbot representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct for each conformal structure on a closed orientable surface of genus at least 2 a proper slice in the character variety of representations of the associated surface group into SL(3,R) that belongs to the Barbot component and show that the corresponding representations are Borel Anosov. We describe a fibered geometric structure in the space of full flags associated with these representations.</description>

      <title>Convex cocompact groups in real hyperbolic spaces with limit set a Pontryagin sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit two examples of convex cocompact subgroups of the isometry groups of real hyperbolic spaces with limit set a Pontryagin sphere: one generated by $50$ reflections of $\mathbb{H}^4$, and the other by a rotation of order $21$ and a reflection of $\mathbb{H}^6$. For each of them, we also locate convex cocompact subgroups with limit set a Menger curve.</description>

      <title>On the monodromy and spin parity of single-cylinder origamis in the minimal stratum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a paper with Menasco-Nieland, the first author constructed factorially many origamis in the minimal stratum of the moduli space of translation surfaces having simultaneously a single vertical cylinder and a single horizontal cylinder. Moreover, these origamis were constructed using the minimal number of squares required for origamis in the minimal stratum. We shall call such origamis minimal $[1,1]$-origamis. In this work, by calculating their spin parities, we determine that the odd genus origamis in this construction all lie in the odd component of the minimal stratum, while the even genus origamis are contained in both the odd and even components with an asymptotic ratio of 3:1. Noticing that the even component is missed in the odd genus case, we provide a generalisation of the odd genus construction that gives rise to factorially many minimal $[1,1]$-origamis lying in the even component. Motivated by understanding the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$-orbits of these origamis, we investigate their monodromy groups (a weak $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$-invariant). We also prove that, with one exception, the monodromy group of any primitive minimal $[1,1]$-origami in the minimal stratum must be simple.</description>

      <title>On dynamics of the Mapping class group action on relative $\text{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$-Character Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the mapping class group action on the relative $\text{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$-character varieties of punctured surfaces. It is well known that Minsky's primitive-stable representations form a domain of discontinuity for the $\text{Out}(F_n)$-action on the $\text{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})$-character variety. We define simple-stability of representations of fundamental group of a surface into $\text{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ which is an analogue of the definition of primitive stability and prove that these representations form a domain of discontinuity for the $\text{MCG}$-action. Our first main result shows that holonomies of hyperbolic cone surfaces are simple-stable. We also prove that holonomies of hyperbolic cone surfaces with exactly one cone-point of cone-angle less than $\pi$ are primitive-stable, thus giving examples of an infinite family of indiscrete primitive-stable representations.</description>

      <title>The monoid structure of singular twisted virtual braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine specific submonoids within the singular twisted virtual braid monoid $STVB_n$. Notably, we establish that the singular twisted virtual pure braid monoid $STVP_n$ serves as the kernel of an epimorphism from $STVB_n$ onto the symmetric group $S_n$. We identify the generators and defining relations for $STVP_n$. Additionally, we construct other epimorphisms from $STVB_n$ onto $S_n$, whose kernels are analogous to $STVP_n$, and determine their respective generators and defining relations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the embedding of the monoid $STVB_n$ into a group. Also, we provide the extension of the representation of the twisted virtual braid group to the representation of the singular twisted virtual braid monoid.</description>

      <title>The Kirby torus trick for surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.3518</link>
      <description>arXiv:1312.3518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is an expository paper giving a proof of the existence and uniqueness of smooth structures (hence also PL structures) on topological surfaces. Most published proofs rely on the topological Schoenflies theorem, but here we use instead the Kirby torus trick. This has the advantage of reducing the point-set topology in the proof to practically nothing, replacing it by a few basic facts about smooth surfaces. Uniqueness of smooth structures is proved in the strong form that every homeomorphism between smooth surfaces is isotopic to a diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotics of the meromorphic 3D-index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.05355v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their recent work, Garoufalidis and Kashaev extended the 3D-index of an ideally triangulated 3-manifold with toroidal boundary to a well-defined topological invariant which takes the form of a meromorphic function of 2 complex variables per boundary component and which depends in addition on a quantisation parameter q. In this paper, we study asymptotics of this invariant as q approaches 1 and develop a conjectural asymptotic approximation in the form of a sum of contributions associated to conjugacy classes of certain boundary parabolic PSL(2,C) representations of the fundamental group. Furthermore, we study the coefficients appearing in these contributions, which include the hyperbolic volume, the '1-loop invariant' of Dimofte and Garoufalidis, as well as a new topological invariant of 3-manifolds with torus boundary, which we call the 'beta invariant'. The technical heart of our analysis is the expression of the state-integral of the Garoufalidis--Kashaev invariant as an integral over one connected component of the space of circle-valued angle structures introduced by Luo. Our stationary phase analysis of the asymptotics of this integral reveals many connections to the theory of angle structures and volume optimization. This investigation was motivated by extensive numerical experiments. In addition, we prove a variety of theorems about the quantities appearing in the analysis which support the overall conjectural picture.</description>

      <title>Circle-valued angle structures and obstruction theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study spaces of circle-valued angle structures, introduced by Feng Luo, on ideal triangulations of 3-manifolds. We prove that the connected components of these spaces are enumerated by certain cohomology groups of the 3-manifold with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-coefficients. Our main theorem shows that this establishes a geometrically natural bijection between the connected components of the spaces of circle-valued angle structures and the obstruction classes to lifting boundary-parabolic $PSL(2,\mathbb{C})$-representations of the fundamental group of the 3-manifold to boundary-unipotent representations into $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$. In particular, these connected components have topological and algebraic significance independent of the ideal triangulations chosen to construct them. The motivation and main application of this study is to understand the domain of the state-integral defining the meromorphic 3D-index of Garoufalidis and Kashaev, necessary in order to classify the boundary-parabolic representations contributing to its asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Flip graph and arc complex finite rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A subcomplex $\mathcal{X}$ of a cell complex $\mathcal{C}$ is called \emph{rigid} with respect to another cell complex $\mathcal{C}'$ if every injective simplicial map $\lambda:\mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}'$ has a unique extension to an injective simplicial map $\phi:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow \mathcal{C}'$. We say that a cell complex exhibits \emph{finite rigidity} if it contains a finite rigid subcomplex. Given a surface with marked points, its \textit{flip graph} and \textit{arc complex} are simplicial complexes indexing the triangulations and the arcs between marked points, respectively. In this paper, we leverage the fact that the flip graph can be embedded in the arc complex as its dual to show that finite rigidity of the flip graph implies finite rigidity of the arc complex. Thus, a recent result of the second author on the finite rigidity of the flip graph implies finite rigidity of the arc complex for a broad class of surfaces. Notably, this includes surfaces with boundary -- a setting where finite rigidity of the arc complex was previously unknown.</description>

      <title>On Matveev-Piergallini moves for branched spines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Matveev-Piergallini (MP) moves on spines of $3$-manifolds are well-known for their correspondence to the Pachner $2$-$3$ moves in dual ideal triangulations. Benedetti and Petronio introduced combinatorial descriptions of closed $3$-manifolds and combed $3$-manifolds by using branched spines and their equivalence relations, which involves MP moves with 16 distinct patterns of branchings. In this paper, we demonstrate that these 16 MP moves on branched spines are derived from a primary MP move, pure sliding moves and their inverses. Consequently, we obtain alternative generating sets for the equivalence relations on branched spines for closed $3$-manifolds and combed $3$-manifolds. Furthermore, we extend these results to framed $3$-manifolds and spin $3$-manifolds. These descriptions are advantageous, particularly when constructing and studying quantum invariants of links and $3$-manifolds. In various constructions of quantum invariants using (ideal) triangulations, branching structures naturally arise to facilitate the assignment of non-symmetric algebraic objects to tetrahedra. In these frameworks, the primary MP move precisely corresponds to certain algebraic pentagon relations, such as the pentagon relation of the canonical element of a Heisenberg double, the Biedenharn-Elliott identity for quantum 6j-symbols, or Schaeffer's identity for the Rogers dilogarithm and its non-commutative analog for Faddeev's quantum dilogarithm in quantum Teichm\"uller theory. We expect our results to contribute to a better understanding of quantum invariants in the context of spines and ideal triangulations.</description>
