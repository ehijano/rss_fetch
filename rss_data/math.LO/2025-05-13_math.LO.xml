      <title>A dual characterisation of simple and subdirectly-irreducible temporal Heyting algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an Esakia duality for the categories of temporal Heyting algebras and temporal Esakia spaces. This includes a proof of contravariant equivalence and a congruence/filter/closed-upset correspondence. We then study two notions of {\guillemotleft} reachability {\guillemotright} on the relevant spaces/frames and show their equivalence in the finite case. We use these notions of reachability to give both lattice-theoretic and dual order-topological characterisations of simple and subdirectly-irreducible temporal Heyting algebras. Finally, we apply our duality results to prove the relational and algebraic finite model property for the temporal Heyting calculus. This, in conjunction with the proven characterisations, allows us to prove a relational completeness result that combines finiteness and the frame property dual to subdirect-irreducibility, giving us a class of finite, well-understood frames for the logic.</description>

      <title>The tree property on long intervals of regular cardinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that the tree property can hold on regular
  cardinals in an interval which overlaps a strong limit cardinal. This is
  a crucial milestone in the long term project, tracing back to a question
  raised by Foreman and Magidor in the 1980s, of obtaining the tree property at every regular
  cardinal above the first uncountable cardinal.</description>

      <title>On the abstract elementary class of acts with embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the class of acts with embeddings as an abstract elementary class. We show that the class is always stable and show that superstability in the class is characterized algebraically via weakly noetherian monoids.
  The study of these model-theoretic notions and limit models lead us to introduce parametized weakly noetherian monoids and find a characterization of them via parametrized injective acts. Furthermore, we obtain a characterization of weakly noetherian monoids via absolutely pure acts extending a classical result of ring theory.
  The paper is aimed at algebraists and model theorists so an effort was made to provide the background for both.</description>

      <title>A topos for extended Weihrauch degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weihrauch reducibility is a notion of reducibility between computational problems that is useful to calibrate the uniform computational strength of a multivalued function. It complements the analysis of mathematical theorems done in reverse mathematics, as multi-valued functions on represented spaces can be considered as realizers of theorems in a natural way. Despite the rich literature and the relevance of the applications of category theory in logic and realizability, actually there are just a few works starting to study the Weihrauch reducibility from a categorical point of view. The main purpose of this work is to provide a full categorical account to the notion of extended Weihrauch reducibility introduced by A. Bauer, which generalizes the original notion of Weihrauch reducibility. In particular, we present a tripos and a topos for extended Weihrauch degrees. We start by defining a new tripos, abstracting the notion of extended Weihrauch degrees, and then we apply the tripos-to-topos construction to obtain the desired topos. Then we show that the Kleene-Vesley topos is a topos of $j$-sheaves for a certain Lawvere-Tierney topology over the topos of extended Weihrauch degrees.</description>

      <title>The fine structure of operator mice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00083</link>
      <description>arXiv:1604.00083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the fine structure theory of operator-premice. These are a generalization of standard premice, in which an abstract operator $F$ is used to form the successor steps in the internal hierarchy of the premouse, instead of Jensen's $J$-operator (which computes rudimentary closure). Such notions have seen applications in core model induction arguments, but their theory has not previously been developed in detail. We define fine condensation for operators $F$ and show that fine condensation and iterability together ensure that $F$-mice have the fundamental fine structural properties including universality and solidity of the standard parameter.</description>

      <title>Ordinal definability in $L[\mathbb{E}]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.07185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a tame mouse modelling ZFC. We show that $M$ satisfies "$V=\mathrm{HOD}_x$ for some real $x$", and that the restriction $\mathbb{E}\upharpoonright[\omega_1^M,\mathrm{OR}^M)$ of the extender sequence $\mathbb{E}^M$ of $M$ to indices above $\omega_1^M$ is definable without parameters over the universe of $M$. We show that $M$ has universe $\mathrm{HOD}^M[X]$, where $X=M|\omega_1^M$ is the initial segment of $M$ of height $\omega_1^M$ (including $\mathbb{E}^M\upharpoonright\omega_1^M$), and that $\mathrm{HOD}^M$ is the universe of a premouse over some $t\subseteq\omega_2^M$. We also show that $M$ has no proper grounds via strategically $\sigma$-closed forcings.
  We then extend some of these results partially to non-tame mice, including a proof that many natural $\varphi$-minimal mice model "$V=\mathrm{HOD}$", assuming a certain fine structural hypothesis whose proof has almost been given elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Local mantles of $L[x]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.12925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assume ZFC. Let $\kappa$ be a cardinal. Recall that a ${&lt;\kappa}$-ground is a transitive proper class $W$ modelling ZFC such that $V$ is a generic extension of $W$ via a forcing $\mathbb{P}\in W$ of cardinality ${&lt;\kappa}$, and the $\kappa$-mantle is the intersection of all ${&lt;\kappa}$-grounds.
  Assume there is a Woodin cardinal and a proper class of measurables, and let $x$ be a real of sufficiently high Turing degree. Let $\kappa$ be a limit cardinal of $L[x]$ of uncountable cofinality in $L[x]$. Using methods from Woodin's analysis of $\mathrm{HOD}^{L[x,G]}$, we analyze the $\kappa$-mantle of $L[x]$, and show that it models ZFC + GCH + "There is a Woodin cardinal". Moreover, we show that it is a fully iterable strategy mouse (analogous to $\mathrm{HOD}^{L[x,G]}$). We also analyze another form of "local mantle", partly assuming also a weak form of Turing determinacy. We also compute bounds on how much iteration strategy can be added to $M_1$ before $M_1^\#$ is added.</description>

      <title>Varsovian models II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.12051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assume the existence of sufficent large cardinals. Let $M_{\mathrm{sw}n}$ be the minimal iterable proper class $L[E]$ model satisfying "there are $\delta_0&lt;\kappa_0&lt;\ldots&lt;\delta_{n-1}&lt;\kappa_{n-1}$ such that the $\delta_i$ are Woodin cardinals and the $\kappa_i$ are strong cardinals". Let $M=M_{\mathrm{sw}2}$. We identify an inner model $\mathscr{V}_2^M$ of $M$, which is a proper class model satisfying "there are 2 Woodin cardinals", and is iterable both in $V$ and in $M$, and closed under its own iteration strategy. The construction also yields significant information about the extent to which $M$ knows its own iteration strategy. We characterize the universe of $\mathscr{V}_2^M$ as the mantle and the least ground of $M$, and as $\mathrm{HOD}^{M[G]}$ for $G\subseteq\mathrm{Coll}(\omega,\lambda)$ being $M$-generic with $\lambda$ sufficiently large. These results correspond to facts already known for $M_{\mathrm{sw}1}$, and the proofs are an elaboration of those, but there are substantial new issues and new methods used to handle them.</description>

      <title>Varsovian models $\omega$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $n&lt;\omega$, let $N_n$ be the minimal iterable proper class mouse $M$ such that $M\models$ "there are ordinals $\delta_0&lt;\kappa_0&lt;\ldots&lt;\delta_{n-1}&lt;\kappa_{n-1}$ such that each $\delta_i$ is a Woodin cardinal and each $\kappa_i$ is a strong cardinal", and let $N_\omega$ be likewise, but with $M\models$ "there is an ordinal $\lambda$ which is a limit of Woodin cardinals and a limit of strong cardinals". Under appropriate large cardinal hypotheses, Sargsyan and Schindler introduced and analysed in "Varsovian models I" the Varsovian model of $N_1$, and Sargsyan, Schindler and the author introduced and analysed in "Varsovian models II" the Varsovian model of $N_2$. We extend this to $N_\omega$, assuming that $*$-translation integrates routinely with the P-constructions of this paper (the write-up of which is yet to be completed). We show, under this assumption, that $N_\omega$ has a proper class inner model $\mathscr{V}_\omega$ which is a fully iterable strategy mouse with $\omega$ Woodin cardinals, closed under its strategy, and that the universe of $\mathscr{V}_\omega$ is the eventual generic HOD, and the mantle, of $N_\omega$. We also show, under the same assumption, that the core model $K$ of $N_\omega$ (which can be defined in a natural manner) is an iterate of $N_\omega$, is an inner model of $\mathscr{V}_\omega$, and is fully iterable in $M$ and in $\mathscr{V}_\omega$.</description>

      <title>$\Sigma_1$ gaps as derived models and correctness of mice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assume ZF + AD + V=L(R). Let $[\alpha,\beta]$ be a $\Sigma_1$ gap with $J_\alpha(R)$ admissible. We analyze $J_\beta(R)$ as a natural form of "derived model" of a premouse $P$, where $P$ is found in a generic extension of $V$. In particular, we will have $\mathcal{P}(R)\cap J_\beta(R)=\mathcal{P}(R)\cap D$, and if $J_\beta(R)\models$ "$\Theta$ exists", then $J_\beta(R)$ and $D$ in fact have the same universe. This analysis will be employed in further work, yet to appear, toward a resolution of a conjecture of Rudominer and Steel on the nature of $(L(R))^M$, for $\omega$-small mice $M$. We also establish some preliminary work toward this conjecture in the present paper.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Resilience Problems via Valued Constraint Satisfaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15654v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Valued constraint satisfaction problems (VCSPs) constitute a large class of computational optimisation problems. It was shown recently that, over finite domains, every VCSP is in P or NP-complete, depending on the admitted cost functions. In this article, we study cost functions over countably infinite domains whose automorphisms form an oligomorphic permutation group. Our results include a hardness condition based on a generalisation of pp-constructability as known from classical CSPs and a polynomial-time tractability condition based on the concept of fractional polymorphisms. We then observe that the resilience problem for unions of conjunctive queries (UCQs) studied in database theory, under bag semantics, may be viewed as a special case of the VCSPs that we consider. We obtain a complexity dichotomy for the case of incidence-acyclic UCQs and exemplarily use our methods to determine the complexity of a conjunctive query that has been stated as an open problem in the literature. We conjecture that our hardness and tractability conditions match for resilience problems for UCQs. Further, we obtain a complete dichotomy for resilience problems for two-way regular path queries, under bag semantics.</description>

      <title>Mouse scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a construction of scales (in the descriptive set theoretic sense) directly from mouse existence hypotheses, without using any determinacy arguments. The construction is related to the Martin-Solovay construction for scales on $\Pi^1_2$ sets. The prewellorders of the scales compare reals $x$ and $y$ by comparing features of certain kinds of fully backgrounded $L[E,x]$- and $L[E,y]$-constructions executed in mice $P$ with $x,y \in P$. In this way we produce an inner model theoretic proof of the scale property for many pointclasses, for which the scale property was classically established using determinacy arguments (for example, $\Pi^1_3$). Moreover, it also yields many further pointclasses with the scale property, for example intermediate between $\Pi^1_{2n+1}$ and $\Sigma^1_{2n+2}$, and also instances of complexity well beyond projective.</description>

      <title>Normalization properties of $\lambda\mu$-calculus using realizability semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a general realizability semantics for the simply typed $\lambda\mu$-calculus. Then, based on this semantics, we derive both weak and strong normalization results for two versions of the $\lambda\mu$-calculus equipped with specific simplification rules. The novelty in our method, in addition to its more systematic approach, lies in its applicability to a broader set of reduction rules without relying on the usual postponement technique. Our approach is original in that it introduces a parameter into the definition of the model, thus establishing a general result which we can then apply to systems with different sets of reduction rules by adjusting the parameter accordingly. Our saturation conditions also lead to a neat characterization of typable $\lambda\mu$-terms.</description>

      <title>Boolean basis, formula size, and number of modal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Is it possible to write significantly smaller formulae when using Boolean operators other than those of the De Morgan basis (and, or, not, and the constants)? For propositional logic, a negative answer was given by Pratt: formulae over one set of operators can always be translated into an equivalent formula over any other complete set of operators with only polynomial increase in size. Surprisingly, for modal logic the picture is different: we show that elimination of bi-implication is only possible at the cost of an exponential number of occurrences of the modal operator $\lozenge$ and therefore of an exponential increase in formula size, i.e., the De Morgan basis and its extension by bi-implication differ in succinctness. Moreover, we prove that any complete set of Boolean operators agrees in succinctness with the De Morgan basis or with its extension by bi-implication. More precisely, these results are shown for the modal logic $\mathrm{T}$ (and therefore for $\mathrm{K}$). We complement them showing that the modal logic $\mathrm{S5}$ behaves as propositional logic: the choice of Boolean operators has no significant impact on the size of formulae.</description>
