      <title>ViralQC: A Tool for Assessing Completeness and Contamination of Predicted Viral Contigs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Viruses represent the most abundant biological entities on the planet and play vital roles in diverse ecosystems. Cataloging viruses across various environments is essential for understanding their properties and functions. Metagenomic sequencing has emerged as the most comprehensive method for virus discovery, enabling the sequencing of all genetic materials, including viruses, from host or environmental samples. However, distinguishing viral sequences from the vast background of cellular organism-derived reads in metagenomic data remains a significant challenge. While several learning-based tools, such as VirSorter2 and geNomad, have shown promise in identifying viral contigs, they often experience varying degrees of false positive rates due to noise in sequencing and assembly, shared genes between viruses and their hosts, and the formation of proviruses within host genomes. This highlights the urgent need for an accurate and efficient method to evaluate the quality of viral contigs. Results: To address these challenges, we introduce ViralQC, a tool designed to assess the quality of reported viral contigs or bins. ViralQC identifies contamination regions within putative viral sequences using foundation models trained on viral and cellular genomes and estimates viral completeness through protein organization alignment. We evaluate ViralQC on multiple datasets and compare its performance against CheckV, the state-of-the-art in virus quality assessment. Notably, ViralQC correctly identifies 38% more contamination than CheckV, while maintaining a median absolute error of only 3%. In addition, ViralQC delivers more accurate results for medium- to high-quality (&gt;50% completeness) contigs, demonstrating its superior performance in completeness estimation.</description>

      <title>GraphPINE: Graph Importance Propagation for Interpretable Drug Response Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainability is necessary for many tasks in biomedical research. Recent explainability methods have focused on attention, gradient, and Shapley value. These do not handle data with strong associated prior knowledge and fail to constrain explainability results based on known relationships between predictive features.
  We propose GraphPINE, a graph neural network (GNN) architecture leveraging domain-specific prior knowledge to initialize node importance optimized during training for drug response prediction. Typically, a manual post-prediction step examines literature (i.e., prior knowledge) to understand returned predictive features. While node importance can be obtained for gradient and attention after prediction, node importance from these methods lacks complementary prior knowledge; GraphPINE seeks to overcome this limitation. GraphPINE differs from other GNN gating methods by utilizing an LSTM-like sequential format. We introduce an importance propagation layer that unifies 1) updates for feature matrix and node importance and 2) uses GNN-based graph propagation of feature values. This initialization and updating mechanism allows for informed feature learning and improved graph representation.
  We apply GraphPINE to cancer drug response prediction using drug screening and gene data collected for over 5,000 gene nodes included in a gene-gene graph with a drug-target interaction (DTI) graph for initial importance. The gene-gene graph and DTIs were obtained from curated sources and weighted by article count discussing relationships between drugs and genes. GraphPINE achieves a PR-AUC of 0.894 and ROC-AUC of 0.796 across 952 drugs. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GraphPINE-40DE.</description>

      <title>GenoTEX: An LLM Agent Benchmark for Automated Gene Expression Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15341v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have significantly improved the identification of disease-associated genes from gene expression datasets. However, these processes often require extensive expertise and manual effort, limiting their scalability. Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating these tasks due to their increasing problem-solving abilities. To support the evaluation and development of such methods, we introduce GenoTEX, a benchmark dataset for the automated analysis of gene expression data. GenoTEX provides analysis code and results for solving a wide range of gene-trait association problems, encompassing dataset selection, preprocessing, and statistical analysis, in a pipeline that follows computational genomics standards. The benchmark includes expert-curated annotations from bioinformaticians to ensure accuracy and reliability. To provide baselines for these tasks, we present GenoAgent, a team of LLM-based agents that adopt a multi-step programming workflow with flexible self-correction, to collaboratively analyze gene expression datasets. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of LLM-based methods in analyzing genomic data, while error analysis highlights the challenges and areas for future improvement. We propose GenoTEX as a promising resource for benchmarking and enhancing automated methods for gene expression data analysis. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/Liu-Hy/GenoTEX.</description>
