      <title>Intrinsic bulk viscosity of the one-component plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsic bulk viscosity of the one-component plasma (OCP) is computed and analyzed using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and the Green-Kubo formalism. It is found that bulk viscosity exhibits a maximum at $\Gamma \approx 1$, corresponding to the condition that the average kinetic energy of particles equals the potential energy at the average inter-particle spacing. The weakly coupled and strongly coupled limits are analyzed and used to construct a model that captures the full range of coupling strengths simulated: $\Gamma \approx 10^{-2} - 10^2$. Simulations are also run of the Yukawa one-component plasma (YOCP) in order to understand the impact of electron screening. It is found that electron screening leads to a smaller bulk viscosity due to a reduction in the excess heat capacity of the system. Bulk viscosity is shown to be at least an order of magnitude smaller than shear viscosity in both the OCP and YOCP. The generalized frequency-dependent bulk viscosity coefficient is also analyzed. This is found to exhibit a peak near twice the plasma frequency in strongly coupled conditions, which is associated with the oscillatory decay observed in the bulk viscosity autocorrelation function. The generalized shear and bulk viscosity coefficients are found to have a similar magnitude for $\omega \gtrsim 2\omega_p$ at strongly coupled conditions.</description>

      <title>Energy-Preserving Coupling of Explicit Particle-In-Cell with Monte Carlo Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Particle-In-Cell (PIC) and Monte Carlo Collisions (MCC) methods are workhorses of many numerical simulations of physical systems. Recently, it was pointed out that, while the two methods can be exactly - or nearly - energy-conserving independently, combining the two is leading to anomalous numerical heating. This paper reviews the standard explicit PIC-MCC algorithm, elucidates the origins of the anomalous numerical heating and explains how to couple the two methods such that the anomalous numerical heating is avoided.</description>

      <title>Continuous relativistic high-harmonic generation from a kHz liquid-sheet plasma mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on continuous high-harmonic generation at 1 kHz repetition rate from a liquid-sheet plasma mirror driven by relativistic-intensity near-single-cycle light transients. Through precise control of both the surface plasma density gradient and the driving light waveform, we can produce highly stable and reproducible extreme ultraviolet spectral quasi-continua, corresponding to the generation of stable kHz-trains of isolated attosecond pulses in the time domain. This confirms the exciting potential of liquid sheet targets as one of the building blocks of future high-power attosecond lasers.</description>

      <title>Efficiency and Physical Limitations of Adiabatic Direct Energy Conversion in Axisymmetric Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe and analyze a new class of direct energy conversion schemes based on the adiabatic magnetic drift of charged particles in axisymmetric magnetic fields. The efficiency of conversion as well as the geometrical and dynamical limitations of the recoverable power are calculated. The geometries of these axisymmetric field configurations are suited for direct energy conversion in radiating advanced aneutronic reactors and in advanced divertors of deuterium-tritium tokamak reactors. The E cross B configurations considered here do not suffer from the classical drawbacks and limitations of thermionic and magnetohydrodynamic high temperature direct energy conversion devices.</description>

      <title>Some generalizations of the convective model of jet generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For analytical description of the initial stage of jet generation in nonequilibrium inhomogeneous plasma in the magnetohydrodynamic approximation, possible generalizations of solutions of the nonlinear equation for the stream function are analyzed. The jet generation model is based on the mechanism of convective instability and the frozen-in condition of magnetic field lines and is characterized by a number of free parameters. The equation for the radial part of the stream function is satisfied by first-order Bessel functions. To satisfy all the conditions near the jet axis and on its periphery, the found solutions are smoothly joined at the boundary. The final analytical solution for the velocity field is applicable to arbitrary values of dimensionless coordinates. The poloidal velocity increases approximately exponentially, and the azimuthal velocity - according to a superexponential law. In this paper, the velocity field of the jet, which consists of seven sections, is calculated. The rotation of the jet turns out to be differential, and to obtain a solution in quadratures for the azimuthal velocity, one can use not only linear but also power dependences on the altitude. For the exponent n &lt; 1, a noticeable increase in the azimuthal velocity with radius is observed immediately from the jet axis, and for n &gt; 1, a region of relative calm is observed near the axis. The jet model is generalized to the case of an arbitrary dependence of the Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency on the altitude. The corresponding solutions are found for the radial and vertical velocity components. For the initial stage of development, the vertical and azimuthal components of the generated magnetic field of the jet were also found in the work.</description>

      <title>In-situ observations of the three-dimensional energy cascade rate and Yaglom flux in the Earth's magnetosheath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the energy cascade rate in space plasmas is a challenging task for several reasons. This quantity is (i) inherently three-dimensional (ii) scale-dependent, (iii) anisotropic in the interplanetary plasma, and (iv) requires measurements of plasma parameters in at least four points. Here, we show how three of such problems have been addressed by applying the novel Lag Polyhedra Derivative Ensemble (LPDE) technique to the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission in the Earth's magnetosheath.</description>

      <title>Gas puff imaging of plasma turbulence in the magnetic island scrape-off layer of W7-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The turbulence characteristics of the scrape-off-layer (SOL) plasma in the W7-X stellarator are investigated using a gas-puff-imaging (GPI) diagnostic, newly installed and operated during the OP 2.1 campaign. The SOL plasma on W7-X features a chain of magnetic islands intersected by discrete divertor plates at five separate toroidal locations, forming a set of island divertors for heat and particle exhaust. GPI measures 2D emission fluctuations in the magnetic island plasma. A dedicated experiment was conducted to characterize the broadband turbulence and filament dynamics in the island divertor SOL in the standard magnetic configuration. This involves shifting the poloidal location of the magnetic island with respect to the GPI field of view. Overall, initial analyses confirm minimal intermittent type fluctuations, compared to tokamaks. A relationship between the radial profile of the connection length and the sheared poloidal flow structure is discussed. Turbulence statistical analyses reveal poloidal asymmetry of the fluctuation properties and a birth region of intermittent fluctuations indicated by skewness reversal. Their birth locations appear sensitive to plasma conditions. Finally, 2D cross-correlation analysis is presented to study turbulence propagation in the presence of multiple shear layers in the poloidal flows, showing a dominant poloidal motion and evidencing a shear effect.</description>

      <title>Photon conversion to axions and dark photons in magnetized plasmas: a finite-temperature field theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some of the most stringent constraints on physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) arise from considerations of particle emission from astrophysical plasmas. However, many studies assume that particle production occurs in an isotropic plasma environment. This condition is rarely (if ever) met in astrophysical settings, for instance due to the ubiquitous presence of magnetic fields. In anisotropic plasmas, the equations of motion are not diagonal in the usual polarization basis of transverse and longitudinal modes, causing a mixing of these modes and breaking the degeneracy in the dispersion relation of the two transverse modes. This behavior is captured by a $3\times3$ mixing matrix $\pi^{IJ}$, determined by projecting the response tensor of the plasma $\Pi^{\mu\nu}$ into mode space, whose eigenvectors and eigenvalues are related to the normal modes and their dispersion relations. In this work, we provide a general formalism for determining the normal modes of propagation that are coupled to axions and dark photons in an anisotropic plasma. As a key part of this formalism, we present detailed derivations of $\Pi^{\mu\nu}$ for magnetized plasmas in the long-wavelength limit using the real-time formalism of finite-temperature field theory. We provide analytic approximations for the normal modes and their dispersion relations assuming various plasma conditions that are relevant to astrophysical environments. These approximations will allow for a systematic exploration of the effects of plasma anisotropy on BSM particle production.</description>

      <title>Controlled Injection in a Laser Plasma Accelerator via an Optically Generated Waveguide Constriction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel scheme for controlling the injection of a high-quality electron bunch into a channel-guided laser plasma accelerator. This all-optical technique, constricted waveguide injection, creates a highly tunable controlled injection structure natively within a plasma waveguide, a key requirement for efficient acceleration of high-quality multi-GeV electron beams. We describe a simple optical setup to tailor the plasma and present start-to-end simulations showing the injection structure formation and the generation of a 1.1 GeV electron beam with 10 pC of charge and 0.35 % energy spread using 1 J of drive laser energy. Highly tunable tailored plasma sources, like those proposed here, enable fine control over the injection and acceleration processes and thus will be crucial for the development of application-focused laser plasma accelerators.</description>

      <title>Interaction of the Prominence Plasma within the Magnetic Cloud of an ICME with the Earth's Bow Shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic cloud within an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) is characterized by high magnetic field intensities. In this study, we investigate the interaction of a magnetic cloud carrying a density structure with the Earth's bow shock during ICME event on 24 April 2023. Elevated abundances of cold protons and heavier ions, namely alpha particles, and singly charged helium ions associated with the prominence plasma are observed within this structure. The plasma downstream of the bow shock exhibits an irregular compression pattern which could be due to the presence of heavy ions. Heavy ions carry a significant fraction of upstream flow energy, however, due to their different charge per mass ratio and rigidity, they are less scattered by the electromagnetic and electrostatic waves at the shock. We find that ions thermal energy is only a small fraction of the background magnetic energy density downstream of the shock. While increased ion fluxes reduce the characteristic wave speeds in the that region. As such, we observe a transition state of an unstable bow shock in which the plasma flow is super Alfv\'enic both upstream and downstream of the bow shock. Our findings help with understanding of the intense space weather impacts of such events.</description>

      <title>Collisionless tearing instability in relativistic non-thermal pair plasma and its application to MHD turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless tearing instability with a power-law distribution function in a relativistic pair plasma with a guide field is studied. When the current sheet is supported by plasma pressure, the tearing mode is suppressed as the particle spectrum hardens. In the force-free limit, the instability growth rate becomes independent of the particle spectrum. We apply these results to relativistic MHD turbulence, where magnetic energy greatly exceeds plasma rest energy, and derive an expression for the transverse size of turbulent eddies unstable to tearing mode. We also establish the critical plasma magnetization parameter above which charge starvation prevents the tearing instability. These results might be useful for developing more accurate models of particle acceleration in relativistic astrophysical sources.</description>

      <title>Investigation of positive streamers in CO$_2$: experiments and 3D particle-in-cell simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of positive streamers in CO$_2$ through 3D particle-in-cell simulations, which are qualitatively compared against experimental results at 50 mbar. The experiments show that CO$_2$ streamers are much more stochastic than air streamers at the same applied voltage, indicating that few electrons are available in front of the streamer head. In the simulations, we include a photoionization model for CO$_2$. The computational results show that even a small amount of photoionization can sustain positive streamer propagation, but this requires a background electric field close to the critical field. When we compare streamers in CO$_2$ and in air at the same applied voltage, the electric field at the streamer head and the electron density in the streamer channel are higher in CO$_2$. We discuss the uncertainties in CO$_2$ photoionization and provide an estimate for the quenching pressure, which is based on the radiative lifetime of emitting states and the collision frequency of the gas. Furthermore, a criterion for self-sustained streamer growth in CO$_2$ is presented and compared against simulation results.</description>

      <title>Efficient generation of divergent and collimated hot electrons via a novel multi-beam two-plasmon decay and stimulated Raman scattering mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In inertial confinement fusion (ICF) implosions, the preheating risks associated with hot electrons generated by laser plasma instabilities (LPI) are contingent upon the angular characteristics of these hot electrons for a given total energy. Using particle-in-cell simulations, we reveal a novel multi-beam collaborative mechanism of two-plasmon decay (TPD) and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), and investigate the angular variations of hot electrons generated from this shared TPD-SRS (STS) instability driven collectively by dual laser beams with varying incident angles $\theta_{in}$ ($24^\circ$ to $55^\circ$ at the incident plane) for typical ICF conditions. In the simulations with $\theta_{in}\gtrsim44^\circ$, STS emerges as the dominant mechanism responsible for hot electron generation, leading to a wide angular distribution of hot electrons that exhibit both pronounced divergent and collimated components. The common Langmuir wave associated with STS plays a crucial role in accelerating both components.By properly modeling the STS common wave gains, we establish scaling relations between these gains and the energies of collimated and divergent hot electrons. These relations reveal that the divergent hot electrons are more sensitive to variations in gain compared to the collimated electrons. Additionally, the calculated gains qualitatively predict the asymmetry in hot electron angular distributions when the density gradients deviate from the bisector of the laser beams. Our findings offers insights for hot electron generation with multiple beams, potentially complementing previous experiments that underscore the critical role of overlapped intensity from symmetric beams within the same cone and the dominance of dual-beam coupling.</description>

      <title>Relativistic theory of the viscosity of fluids across the entire energy spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shear viscosity is a fundamental transport property of matter. Here we derive a general theory of the viscosity of gases based on the relativistic Langevin equation (deduced from a relativistic Lagrangian) and nonaffine linear response theory. The proposed relativistic theory is able to recover the viscosity of non-relativistic classical gases, with all its key dependencies on mass, temperature, particle diameter and Boltzmann constant, in the limit of Lorentz factor $\gamma=1$. It also unveils the relativistic enhancement mechanism of viscosity. In the limit of ultrarelativistic fluids, the theory provides a new analytical formula which reproduces the cubic increase of viscosity with temperature in agreement with various estimates for hot dense matter and the QGP-type fluid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In plasma physics, collisionless charged particles are transported following the dynamics of a meanfield Vlasov equation with a self-consistent electric field generated by the charge density. Due to the long range interaction between particles, the generating electric field oscillates and disperses like a Klein-Gordon dispersive wave, known in the physical literature as plasma oscillations or Langmuir's oscillatory waves. The oscillatory electric field then in turn drives particles. Despite its great physical importance, the question of whether such a nonlinear particle-wave interaction would remain regular globally and be damped in the large time has been an outstanding open problem. In this paper, we propose a new framework to resolve this exact nonlinear interaction. Specifically, we employ the framework to establish the large time behavior and scattering of solutions to the nonlinear Vlasov-Klein-Gordon system in the small initial data regime. The novelty of this work is to provide a detailed physical space description of particles moving in an oscillatory field and to resolve oscillations for the electric field generated by the collective interacting particles. This appears to be the first such a result analyzing oscillations in the physical phase space $\mathbb{R}^3_x\times \mathbb{R}_v^3$.</description>
