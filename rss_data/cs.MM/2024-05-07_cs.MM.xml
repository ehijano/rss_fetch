      <title>A Rate-Distortion-Classification Approach for Lossy Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In lossy image compression, the objective is to achieve minimal signal distortion while compressing images to a specified bit rate. The increasing demand for visual analysis applications, particularly in classification tasks, has emphasized the significance of considering semantic distortion in compressed images. To bridge the gap between image compression and visual analysis, we propose a Rate-Distortion-Classification (RDC) model for lossy image compression, offering a unified framework to optimize the trade-off between rate, distortion, and classification accuracy. The RDC model is extensively analyzed both statistically on a multi-distribution source and experimentally on the widely used MNIST dataset. The findings reveal that the RDC model exhibits desirable properties, including monotonic non-increasing and convex functions, under certain conditions. This work provides insights into the development of human-machine friendly compression methods and Video Coding for Machine (VCM) approaches, paving the way for end-to-end image compression techniques in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing DETRs Variants through Improved Content Query and Similar Query Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of the query is crucial for the performance of DETR and its variants. Each query consists of two components: a content part and a positional one. Traditionally, the content query is initialized with a zero or learnable embedding, lacking essential content information and resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel plug-and-play module, Self-Adaptive Content Query (SACQ), to address this limitation. The SACQ module utilizes features from the transformer encoder to generate content queries via self-attention pooling. This allows candidate queries to adapt to the input image, resulting in a more comprehensive content prior and better focus on target objects. However, this improved concentration poses a challenge for the training process that utilizes the Hungarian matching, which selects only a single candidate and suppresses other similar ones. To overcome this, we propose a query aggregation strategy to cooperate with SACQ. It merges similar predicted candidates from different queries, easing the optimization. Our extensive experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches across six different DETR's variants with multiple configurations, achieving an average improvement of over 1.0 AP.</description>

      <title>DBDH: A Dual-Branch Dual-Head Neural Network for Invisible Embedded Regions Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embedding invisible hyperlinks or hidden codes in images to replace QR codes has become a hot topic recently. This technology requires first localizing the embedded region in the captured photos before decoding. Existing methods that train models to find the invisible embedded region struggle to obtain accurate localization results, leading to degraded decoding accuracy. This limitation is primarily because the CNN network is sensitive to low-frequency signals, while the embedded signal is typically in the high-frequency form. Based on this, this paper proposes a Dual-Branch Dual-Head (DBDH) neural network tailored for the precise localization of invisible embedded regions. Specifically, DBDH uses a low-level texture branch containing 62 high-pass filters to capture the high-frequency signals induced by embedding. A high-level context branch is used to extract discriminative features between the embedded and normal regions. DBDH employs a detection head to directly detect the four vertices of the embedding region. In addition, we introduce an extra segmentation head to segment the mask of the embedding region during training. The segmentation head provides pixel-level supervision for model learning, facilitating better learning of the embedded signals. Based on two state-of-the-art invisible offline-to-online messaging methods, we construct two datasets and augmentation strategies for training and testing localization models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed DBDH over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Expert Insight-Enhanced Follow-up Chest X-Ray Summary Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A chest X-ray radiology report describes abnormal findings not only from X-ray obtained at current examination, but also findings on disease progression or change in device placement with reference to the X-ray from previous examination. Majority of the efforts on automatic generation of radiology report pertain to reporting the former, but not the latter, type of findings. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is only one work dedicated to generating summary of the latter findings, i.e., follow-up summary. In this study, we therefore propose a transformer-based framework to tackle this task. Motivated by our observations on the significance of medical lexicon on the fidelity of summary generation, we introduce two mechanisms to bestow expert insight to our model, namely expert soft guidance and masked entity modeling loss. The former mechanism employs a pretrained expert disease classifier to guide the presence level of specific abnormalities, while the latter directs the model's attention toward medical lexicon. Extensive experiments were conducted to demonstrate that the performance of our model is competitive with or exceeds the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Beyond LLMs: System Implications of Multi-Modal Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the development of large-scale Generative AI models evolve beyond text (1D) generation to include image (2D) and video (3D) generation, processing spatial and temporal information presents unique challenges to quality, performance, and efficiency. We present the first work towards understanding this new system design space for multi-modal text-to-image (TTI) and text-to-video (TTV) generation models. Current model architecture designs are bifurcated into 2 categories: Diffusion- and Transformer-based models. Our systematic performance characterization on a suite of eight representative TTI/TTV models shows that after state-of-the-art optimization techniques such as Flash Attention are applied, Convolution accounts for up to 44% of execution time for Diffusion-based TTI models, while Linear layers consume up to 49% of execution time for Transformer-based models. We additionally observe that Diffusion-based TTI models resemble the Prefill stage of LLM inference, and benefit from 1.1-2.5x greater speedup from Flash Attention than Transformer-based TTI models that resemble the Decode phase. Since optimizations designed for LLMs do not map directly onto TTI/TTV models, we must conduct a thorough characterization of these workloads to gain insights for new optimization opportunities. In doing so, we define sequence length in the context of TTI/TTV models and observe sequence length can vary up to 4x in Diffusion model inference. We additionally observe temporal aspects of TTV workloads pose unique system bottlenecks, with Temporal Attention accounting for over 60% of total Attention time. Overall, our in-depth system performance characterization is a critical first step towards designing efficient and deployable systems for emerging TTI/TTV workloads.</description>

      <title>Separate in the Speech Chain: Cross-Modal Conditional Audio-Visual Target Speech Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of visual cues has revitalized the performance of the target speech extraction task, elevating it to the forefront of the field. Nevertheless, this multi-modal learning paradigm often encounters the challenge of modality imbalance. In audio-visual target speech extraction tasks, the audio modality tends to dominate, potentially overshadowing the importance of visual guidance. To tackle this issue, we propose AVSepChain, drawing inspiration from the speech chain concept. Our approach partitions the audio-visual target speech extraction task into two stages: speech perception and speech production. In the speech perception stage, audio serves as the dominant modality, while visual information acts as the conditional modality. Conversely, in the speech production stage, the roles are reversed. This transformation of modality status aims to alleviate the problem of modality imbalance. Additionally, we introduce a contrastive semantic matching loss to ensure that the semantic information conveyed by the generated speech aligns with the semantic information conveyed by lip movements during the speech production stage. Through extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets for audio-visual target speech extraction, we showcase the superior performance achieved by our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Towards Real-world Video Face Restoration: A New Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) on images has significantly progressed over the last several years, while real-world video face restoration (VFR), which is more challenging for more complex face motions such as moving gaze directions and facial orientations involved, remains unsolved. Typical BFR methods are evaluated on privately synthesized datasets or self-collected real-world low-quality face images, which are limited in their coverage of real-world video frames. In this work, we introduced new real-world datasets named FOS with a taxonomy of "Full, Occluded, and Side" faces from mainly video frames to study the applicability of current methods on videos. Compared with existing test datasets, FOS datasets cover more diverse degradations and involve face samples from more complex scenarios, which helps to revisit current face restoration approaches more comprehensively. Given the established datasets, we benchmarked both the state-of-the-art BFR methods and the video super resolution (VSR) methods to comprehensively study current approaches, identifying their potential and limitations in VFR tasks. In addition, we studied the effectiveness of the commonly used image quality assessment (IQA) metrics and face IQA (FIQA) metrics by leveraging a subjective user study. With extensive experimental results and detailed analysis provided, we gained insights from the successes and failures of both current BFR and VSR methods. These results also pose challenges to current face restoration approaches, which we hope stimulate future advances in VFR research.</description>
