      <title>Temporal and Spacial Studies of Infectious Diseases: Mathematical Models and Numerical Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SIR model is a classical model characterizing the spreading of infectious diseases. This model describes the time-dependent quantity changes among Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered groups. By introducing space-depend effects such as diffusion and creation in addition to the SIR model, the Fisher's model is in fact a more advanced and comprehensive model. However, the Fisher's model is much less popular than the SIR model in simulating infectious disease numerically due to the difficulties from the parameter selection, the involvement of 2-d/3-d spacial effects, the configuration of the boundary conditions, etc.
  This paper aim to address these issues by providing numerical algorithms involving space and time finite difference schemes and iterative methods, and its open-source Python code for solving the Fisher's model. This 2-D Fisher's solver is second order in space and up to the second order in time, which is rigorously verified using test cases with analytical solutions. Numerical algorithms such as SOR, implicit Euler, Staggered Crank-Nicolson, and ADI are combined to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the solver. It can handle various boundary conditions subject to different physical descriptions. In addition, real-world data of Covid-19 are used by the model to demonstrate its practical usage in providing prediction and inferences.</description>

      <title>Recent advances in deep learning and language models for studying the microbiome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly large language models (LLMs), made a significant impact on how researchers study microbiome and metagenomics data. Microbial protein and genomic sequences, like natural languages, form a language of life, enabling the adoption of LLMs to extract useful insights from complex microbial ecologies. In this paper, we review applications of deep learning and language models in analyzing microbiome and metagenomics data. We focus on problem formulations, necessary datasets, and the integration of language modeling techniques. We provide an extensive overview of protein/genomic language modeling and their contributions to microbiome studies. We also discuss applications such as novel viromics language modeling, biosynthetic gene cluster prediction, and knowledge integration for metagenomics studies.</description>

      <title>Manifold-Constrained Nucleus-Level Denoising Diffusion Model for Structure-Based Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence models have shown great potential in structure-based drug design, generating ligands with high binding affinities. However, existing models have often overlooked a crucial physical constraint: atoms must maintain a minimum pairwise distance to avoid separation violation, a phenomenon governed by the balance of attractive and repulsive forces. To mitigate such separation violations, we propose NucleusDiff. It models the interactions between atomic nuclei and their surrounding electron clouds by enforcing the distance constraint between the nuclei and manifolds. We quantitatively evaluate NucleusDiff using the CrossDocked2020 dataset and a COVID-19 therapeutic target, demonstrating that NucleusDiff reduces violation rate by up to 100.00% and enhances binding affinity by up to 22.16%, surpassing state-of-the-art models for structure-based drug design. We also provide qualitative analysis through manifold sampling, visually confirming the effectiveness of NucleusDiff in reducing separation violations and improving binding affinities.</description>

      <title>A computational framework for optimal and Model Predictive Control of stochastic gene regulatory networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering biology requires precise control of biomolecular circuits, and Cybergenetics is the field dedicated to achieving this goal. A significant challenge in developing controllers for cellular functions is designing systems that can effectively manage molecular noise. To address this, there has been increasing effort to develop model-based controllers for stochastic biomolecular systems, where a major difficulty lies in accurately solving the chemical master equation. In this work we develop a framework for optimal and Model Predictive Control of stochastic gene regulatory networks with three key advantageous features: high computational efficiency, the capacity to control the overall probability density function enabling the fine-tuning of the cell population to obtain complex shapes and behaviors (including bimodality and other emergent properties), and the capacity to handle high levels of intrinsic molecular noise. Our method exploits an efficient approximation of the Chemical Master Equation using Partial Integro-Differential Equations, which additionally enables the development of an effective adjoint-based optimization. We illustrate the performance of the methods presented through two relevant studies in Synthetic Biology: shaping bimodal cell populations and tracking moving target distributions via inducible gene regulatory circuits.</description>

      <title>Comorbid anxiety symptoms predict lower odds of improvement in depression symptoms during smartphone-delivered psychotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comorbid anxiety disorders are common among patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), and numerous studies have identified an association between comorbid anxiety and resistance to pharmacological depression treatment. However, less is known regarding the effect of anxiety on non-pharmacological therapies for MDD. We apply machine learning techniques to analyze MDD treatment responses in a large-scale clinical trial (n=754), in which participants with MDD were recruited online and randomized to different smartphone-based depression treatments. We find that a baseline GAD-7 questionnaire score in the "moderate" to "severe" range (&gt;10) predicts greatly reduced probability of responding to treatment across treatment groups. Our findings suggest that depressed individuals with comorbid anxiety face lower odds of substantial improvement in the context of smartphone-based therapeutic interventions for MDD. Our work highlights a simple methodology for identifying clinically useful "rules of thumb" in treatment response prediction using interpretable machine learning models and a forward variable selection process.</description>

      <title>Active learning for energy-based antibody optimization and enhanced screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10964v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction and optimization of protein-protein binding affinity is crucial for therapeutic antibody development. Although machine learning-based prediction methods $\Delta\Delta G$ are suitable for large-scale mutant screening, they struggle to predict the effects of multiple mutations for targets without existing binders. Energy function-based methods, though more accurate, are time consuming and not ideal for large-scale screening. To address this, we propose an active learning workflow that efficiently trains a deep learning model to learn energy functions for specific targets, combining the advantages of both approaches. Our method integrates the RDE-Network deep learning model with Rosetta's energy function-based Flex ddG to efficiently explore mutants. In a case study targeting HER2-binding Trastuzumab mutants, our approach significantly improved the screening performance over random selection and demonstrated the ability to identify mutants with better binding properties without experimental $\Delta\Delta G$ data. This workflow advances computational antibody design by combining machine learning, physics-based computations, and active learning to achieve more efficient antibody development.</description>

      <title>Infer metabolic velocities from moment differences of molecular weight distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14887v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metabolic pathways are fundamental maps in biochemistry that detail how molecules are transformed through various reactions. The complexity of metabolic network, where a single compound can play a part in multiple pathways, poses a challenge in inferring metabolic balance changes over time or after different treatments. Isotopic labeling experiment is the standard method to infer metabolic flux, which is currently defined as the flow of a single metabolite through a given pathway over time. However, there is still no way to accurately infer the metabolic balance changes after different treatments in an experiment. This study introduces a different concept: molecular weight distribution, which is the empirical distribution of the molecular weights of all metabolites of interest. By estimating the differences of the location and scale estimates of these distributions, it becomes possible to quantitatively infer the metabolic balance changes even without requiring knowledge of the exact chemical structures of these compounds and their related pathways. This research article provides a mathematical framing for a classic biological concept.</description>

      <title>DrugAgent: Explainable Drug Repurposing Agent with Large Language Model-based Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drug repurposing offers a promising avenue for accelerating drug development by identifying new therapeutic potentials of existing drugs. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent framework to enhance the drug repurposing process using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and knowledge integration. Our framework comprises several specialized agents: an AI Agent trains robust drug-target interaction (DTI) models; a Knowledge Graph Agent utilizes the drug-gene interaction database (DGIdb), DrugBank, Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), and Search Tool for Interactions of Chemicals (STITCH) to systematically extract DTIs; and a Search Agent interacts with biomedical literature to annotate and verify computational predictions. By integrating outputs from these agents, our system effectively harnesses diverse data sources, including external databases, to propose viable repurposing candidates. Preliminary results demonstrate the potential of our approach in not only predicting drug-disease interactions but also in reducing the time and cost associated with traditional drug discovery methods. This paper highlights the scalability of multi-agent systems in biomedical research and their role in driving innovation in drug repurposing. Our approach not only outperforms existing methods in predicting drug repurposing potential but also provides interpretable results, paving the way for more efficient and cost-effective drug discovery processes.</description>
