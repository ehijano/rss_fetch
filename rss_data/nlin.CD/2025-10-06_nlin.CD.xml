      <title>Multi-dimensional chaos I: Classical and quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of multi-dimensional chaos that applies to processes described by erratic functions of several dynamical variables. We employ this concept in the interpretation of classical and quantum scattering off a pinball system. In the former case it is illustrated by means of two-dimensional plots of the scattering angle and of the number of bounces. We draw similar patterns for the quantum differential cross section for various geometries of the disks. We find that the eigenvalues of the S-matrix are distributed according to the Circular Orthogonal Ensemble (COE) in random matrix theory (RMT), provided the setup be asymmetric and the wave-number be large enough. We then consider the electric potential associated with charges randomly located on a plane as a toy model that generalizes the scattering from a leaky torus. We propose several methods to analyze the spacings between the extrema of this function. We show that these follow a repulsive Gaussian beta-ensemble distribution even for Poisson-distributed positions of the charges. A generalization of the spectral form factor is introduced and determined. We apply these methods to the case of a chaotic S-matrix and of the quantum pinball scattering. The spacings between nearest neighbor extrema points and ratios between adjacent spacings follow a logistic and Beta distributions correspondingly. We conjecture about a potential relation with random tensor theory.</description>

      <title>Time-Lagged Recurrence: a data-driven method to estimate the predictability of dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems are ubiquitous in nature and they are hard to forecast. Not only they may be sensitive to small perturbations in their initial conditions, but they are often composed of processes acting at multiple scales. Classical approaches based on the Lyapunov spectrum rely on the knowledge of the dynamic forward operator, or of a data-derived approximation of it. This operator is typically unknown, or the data are too noisy to derive its faithful representation. Here we propose a new data-driven approach to analyze the local predictability of dynamical systems. This method, based on the concept of recurrence, is closely linked to the well-established framework of local dynamical indices. When applied to both idealized systems and real-world datasets arising from large-scale atmospheric fields, our new approach proves its effectiveness in estimating local predictability. Additionally, we discuss its relationship with other local dynamical indices, and how it reveals the scale-dependent nature of predictability. Furthermore, we explore its link to information theory, its extension that includes a weighting strategy, and its real-time application. We believe these aspects collectively demonstrate its potential as a powerful diagnostic tool for complex systems.</description>

      <title>Illusions of Criticality: Crises Without Tipping Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01833v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abrupt shifts in ecosystems, brains, markets, and climate are often diagnosed as signs of approaching a tipping point, i.e. a critical bifurcation where stability is lost. Here we reveal a broader and more deceptive mechanism: pseudo-bifurcations. In stochastic non-normal systems, asymmetric interactions produce transient episodes of apparent instability despite long-term stability. We show analytically, numerically, and with empirical evidence from brain dynamics during epileptic seizures that pseudo-bifurcations reproduce the full set of early-warning signals usually taken as proof of proximity to tipping points, including critical slowing down, increased variance, and dimensional collapse. Crucially, these false alarms can occur well before any true bifurcation, systematically biasing crisis diagnosis. This discovery reframes how abrupt transitions are interpreted across disciplines: what has long been attributed to ``criticality'' may instead reflect the hidden geometry of non-normal dynamics. By uncovering this illusion of criticality, we call for a fundamental reassessment of how crises are identified, predicted, and managed in natural, social, and technological systems.</description>

      <title>Gluon Condensation as a Unifying Mechanism for Special Spectra of Cosmic Gamma Rays and Low-Momentum Pion Enhancement at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoding the internal structure of the proton is a fundamental challenge in physics. Historically, any new discovery about the proton has fuelled advances in several scientific fields. We have reported that gluons inside the proton accumulate near the critical momentum due to chaotic phenomena, forming gluon condensation. Surprisingly, the pion distribution predicted by this gluon distribution for the production of high-energy proton collisions could answer two puzzles in astronomy and high-energy physics. We find that during ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray collisions, gluon condensation may abruptly produce a large number of low-momentum pions, whose electromagnetic decays have the typical breakout properties appearing in various cosmic gamma-ray spectra. On the other hand, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is well below the cosmic ray energy scale, also shows weak but recognisable signs of gluon condensation, which had been mistaken for BEC pions. The connection between these two phenomena, which occur at different scales in the Universe, supports the existence of a new structure within the proton-gluon condensation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Signatures of Strange Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In classical mechanics, driven systems with dissipation often exhibit complex, fractal dynamics known as strange attractors. This paper addresses the fundamental question of how such structures manifest in the quantum realm. We investigate the quantum Duffing oscillator, a paradigmatic chaotic system, using the Caldirola-Kanai (CK) framework, where dissipation is integrated directly into a time-dependent Hamiltonian. By employing the Husimi distribution to represent the quantum state in phase space, we present the first visualization of a quantum strange attractor within this model. Our simulations demonstrate how an initially simple Gaussian wave packet is stretched, folded, and sculpted by the interplay of chaotic dynamics and energy loss, causing it to localize onto a structure that beautifully mirrors the classical attractor. This quantum "photograph" is inherently smoothed, blurring the infinitely fine fractal details of its classical counterpart as a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle. We supplement this analysis by examining the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), which shows that stronger dissipation clarifies the exponential growth associated with the classical Lyapunov exponent, thereby confirming the model's semiclassical behavior. This work offers a compelling geometric perspective on open chaotic quantum systems and sheds new light on the quantum-classical transition.</description>
