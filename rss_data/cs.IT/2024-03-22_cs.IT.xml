      <title>Fundamentals of Delay-Doppler Communications: Practical Implementation and Extensions to OTFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently proposed orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation, which is a typical Delay-Doppler (DD) communication scheme, has attracted significant attention thanks to its appealing performance over doubly-selective channels. In this paper, we present the fundamentals of general DD communications from the viewpoint of the Zak transform. We start our study by constructing DD domain basis functions aligning with the time-frequency (TF)-consistency condition, which are globally quasi-periodic and locally twisted-shifted. We unveil that these features are translated to unique signal structures in both time and frequency, which are beneficial for communication purposes. Then, we focus on the practical implementations of DD Nyquist communications, where we show that rectangular windows achieve perfect DD orthogonality, while truncated periodic signals can obtain sufficient DD orthogonality. Particularly, smoothed rectangular window with excess bandwidth can result in a slightly worse orthogonality but better pulse localization in the DD domain. Furthermore, we present a practical pulse shaping framework for general DD communications and derive the corresponding input-output relation under various shaping pulses. Our numerical results agree with our derivations and also demonstrate advantages of DD communications over conventional orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM).</description>

      <title>An Achievability Bound for Variable-Length Stop-Feedback Coding over the Gaussian Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback holds a pivotal role in practical communication schemes, even though it does not enhance channel capacity. Its main attribute includes adaptability in transmission that allows for a higher rate of convergence of the error probability to zero with respect to blocklength. Motivated by this fact, we present a non-asymptotic achievability bound for variable-length coding with stop-feedback. Specifically, a general achievability bound is derived, that employs a random coding ensemble in combination with minimum distance decoding. The general bound is particularized for the Gaussian channel. Numerical evaluation of the bound confirms the significant value of feedback compared to transmission with fixed blocklength coding and without feedback.</description>

      <title>Stable Coorbit Embeddings of Orbifold Quotients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a real inner product space $V$ and a group $G$ of linear isometries, we construct a family of $G$-invariant real-valued functions on $V$ that we call coorbit filter banks, which unify previous notions of max filter banks and finite coorbit filter banks. When $V=\mathbb R^d$ and $G$ is compact, we establish that a suitable coorbit filter bank is injective and locally lower Lipschitz in the quotient metric at orbits of maximal dimension. Furthermore, when the orbit space $\mathbb S^{d-1}/G$ is a Riemannian orbifold, we show that a suitable coorbit filter bank is bi-Lipschitz in the quotient metric.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Design for Quickest Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of quickest change detection (QCD) concerns design and analysis of algorithms to estimate in real time the time at which an important event takes place, and identify properties of the post-change behavior. It is shown in this paper that approaches based on reinforcement learning (RL) can be adapted based on any "surrogate information state" that is adapted to the observations. Hence we are left to choose both the surrogate information state process and the algorithm. For the former, it is argued that there are many choices available, based on a rich theory of asymptotic statistics for QCD. Two approaches to RL design are considered: (i) Stochastic gradient descent based on an actor-critic formulation. Theory is largely complete for this approach: the algorithm is unbiased, and will converge to a local minimum. However, it is shown that variance of stochastic gradients can be very large, necessitating the need for commensurately long run times; (ii) Q-learning algorithms based on a version of the projected Bellman equation. It is shown that the algorithm is stable, in the sense of bounded sample paths, and that a solution to the projected Bellman equation exists under mild conditions. Numerical experiments illustrate these findings, and provide a roadmap for algorithm design in more general settings.</description>

      <title>Optimal Second-Order Rates for Quantum Information Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the standard quantum information decoupling, in which Alice aims to decouple her system from the environment by local operations and discarding some of her systems. To achieve an $\varepsilon$-decoupling with trace distance as the error criterion, we establish a near-optimal one-shot characterization for the largest dimension of the remainder system in terms of the conditional $(1-\varepsilon)$-hypothesis-testing entropy. When the underlying system is independent and identically prepared, our result leads to the matched second-order rate as well as the matched moderate deviation rate. As an application, we find an achievability bound in entanglement distillation protocol, where the objective is for Alice and Bob to transform their quantum state to maximally entangled state with largest possible dimension using only local operations and one-way classical communications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Channel Simulation under Purified Distance is no more difficult than State Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the minimal communication needed for the quantum channel simulation is a fundamental task in the quantum information theory. In this paper, we show that, under the purified distance, the quantum channel simulation can be directly achieved via quantum state splitting without using a technique known as the de Finetti reduction, and thus provide a pair of tighter one-shot bounds. Using the bounds, we also recover the quantum reverse Shannon theorem in a much simpler way.</description>

      <title>Maximal $\alpha$-Leakage for Quantum Privacy Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, maximal $\alpha$-leakage is introduced to quantify how much a quantum adversary can learn about any sensitive information of data upon observing its disturbed version via a quantum privacy mechanism. We first show that an adversary's maximal expected $\alpha$-gain using optimal measurement is characterized by measured conditional R\'enyi entropy. This can be viewed as a parametric generalization of K\"onig et al.'s famous guessing probability formula [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 55(9), 2009]. Then, we prove that the $\alpha$-leakage and maximal $\alpha$-leakage for a quantum privacy mechanism are determined by measured Arimoto information and measured R\'enyi capacity, respectively. Various properties of maximal $\alpha$-leakage, such as data processing inequality and composition property are established as well. Moreover, we show that regularized $\alpha$-leakage and regularized maximal $\alpha$-leakage for identical and independent quantum privacy mechanisms coincide with $\alpha$-tilted sandwiched R\'enyi information and sandwiched R\'enyi capacity, respectively.</description>

      <title>Exploring Hybrid Active-Passive RIS-Aided MEC Systems: From the Mode-Switching Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been regarded as a promising technique to support latencysensitivity and computation-intensive serves. However, the low offloading rate caused by the random channel fading characteristic becomes a major bottleneck in restricting the performance of the MEC. Fortunately, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can alleviate this problem since it can boost both the spectrum- and energy- efficiency. Different from the existing works adopting either fully active or fully passive RIS, we propose a novel hybrid RIS in which reflecting units can flexibly switch between active and passive modes. To achieve a tradeoff between the latency and energy consumption, an optimization problem is formulated by minimizing the total cost. In light of the intractability of the problem, we develop an alternating optimization-based iterative algorithm by combining the successive convex approximation method, the variable substitution, and the singular value decomposition (SVD) to obtain sub-optimal solutions. Furthermore, in order to gain more insight into the problem, we consider two special cases involving a latency minimization problem and an energy consumption minimization problem, and respectively analyze the tradeoff between the number of active and passive units. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm can achieve flexible mode switching and significantly outperforms existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Constellation Shaping under Phase Noise Impairment for Sub-THz Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large untapped spectrum in the sub-THz allows for ultra-high throughput communication to realize many seemingly impossible applications in 6G. One of the challenges in radio communications in sub-THz is the hardware impairments. Specifically, phase noise is one key hardware impairment, which is accentuated as we increase the frequency and bandwidth. Furthermore, the moderate output power of the sub-THz power amplifier demands limits on peak to average power ratio (PAPR) signal design. Single carrier frequency domain equalization (SC-FDE) has been identified as a suitable candidate for sub-THz, although some challenges such as phase noise and PAPR still remain to be tackled. In this work, we design a phase noise robust, modest PAPR SC waveform by geometrically shaping the constellation under practical conditions. We formulate the waveform optimization problem in its augmented Lagrangian form and use a back-propagation-inspired technique to obtain a constellation design that is numerically robust to phase noise, while maintaining a relatively low PAPR compared to the conventional waveforms.</description>

      <title>Fractal spatio-temporal scale-free messaging: amplitude modulation of self-executable carriers given by the Weierstrass function's components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06633v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many communication contexts, the capabilities of the involved actors cannot be known beforehand, whether it is a cell, a plant, an insect, or even a life form unknown to Earth. Regardless of the recipient, the message space and time scale could be too fast, too slow, too large, or too small and may never be decoded. Therefore, it pays to devise a way to encode messages agnostic of space and time scales. We propose the use of fractal functions as self-executable infinite-frequency carriers for sending messages, given their properties of structural self-similarity and scale invariance. We call it `fractal messaging'. Starting from a spatial embedding, we introduce a framework for a space-time scale-free messaging approach to this challenge. When considering a space and time-agnostic framework for message transmission, it would be interesting to encode a message such that it could be decoded at several spatio-temporal scales. Hence, the core idea of the framework proposed herein is to encode a binary message as waves along infinitely many frequencies (in power-like distributions) and amplitudes, transmit such a message, and then decode and reproduce it. To do so, the components of the Weierstrass function, a known fractal, are used as carriers of the message. Each component will have its amplitude modulated to embed the binary stream, allowing for a space-time-agnostic approach to messaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assembly Theory (AT) is a theory that explains how to determine if a complex object is the product of evolution. Here we explain why attempts to compare AT to compression algorithms, ref 1, does not help identify if the object is the product of selection or not. Specifically, we show why aims to perform benchmark comparisons of different compression schemes to compare the performance of Molecular Assembly Indices against standard compression schemes in determining living vs. non-living samples fails to classify the data correctly. In their approach, Uthamacumaran et al., ref 1, compress data from Marshall et al.2 describing the experimental basis for assembly theory and evaluate the difference in the resulting distributions of data. After several computational experiments Uthamacumaran et al., ref 1, conclude that other compression techniques obtain better results in the problem of detecting life and non-life that of assembly pathways. Here we explain why the approach presented by Uthamacumaran et al.1 appears to be lacking, and why it is not to reproduce their analysis with the information given.</description>

      <title>Understanding Information Disclosure from Secure Computation Output: A Study of Average Salary Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Secure multi-party computation has seen substantial performance improvements in recent years and is being increasingly used in commercial products. While a significant amount of work was dedicated to improving its efficiency under standard security models, the threat models do not account for information leakage from the output of secure function evaluation. Quantifying information disclosure about private inputs from observing the function outcome is the subject of this work. Motivated by the City of Boston gender pay gap studies, in this work we focus on the computation of the average of salaries and quantify information disclosure about private inputs of one or more participants (the target) to an adversary via information-theoretic techniques. We study a number of distributions including log-normal, which is typically used for modeling salaries. We consequently evaluate information disclosure after repeated evaluation of the average function on overlapping inputs, as was done in the Boston gender pay study that ran multiple times, and provide recommendations for using the sum and average functions in secure computation applications. Our goal is to develop mechanisms that lower information disclosure about participants' inputs to a desired level and provide guidelines for setting up real-world secure evaluation of this function.</description>

      <title>Postselected communication over quantum channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The single-letter characterisation of the entanglement-assisted capacity of a quantum channel is one of the seminal results of quantum information theory. In this paper, we consider a modified communication scenario in which the receiver is allowed an additional, `inconclusive' measurement outcome, and we employ an error metric given by the error probability in decoding the transmitted message conditioned on a conclusive measurement result. We call this setting postselected communication and the ensuing highest achievable rates the postselected capacities. Here, we provide a precise single-letter characterisation of postselected capacities in the setting of entanglement assistance as well as the more general nonsignalling assistance, establishing that they are both equal to the channel's projective mutual information -- a variant of mutual information based on the Hilbert projective metric. We do so by establishing bounds on the one-shot postselected capacities, with a lower bound that makes use of a postselected teleportation protocol and an upper bound in terms of the postselected hypothesis testing relative entropy. As such, we obtain fundamental limits on a channel's ability to communicate even when this strong resource of postselection is allowed, implying limitations on communication even when the receiver has access to postselected closed timelike curves.</description>

      <title>Efficient Approximation of Quantum Channel Fidelity Exploiting Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the optimal fidelity for the transmission of quantum information over noisy quantum channels is one of the central problems in quantum information theory. Recently, [Berta-Borderi-Fawzi-Scholz, Mathematical Programming, 2021] introduced an asymptotically converging semidefinite programming hierarchy of outer bounds for this quantity. However, the size of the semidefinite programs (SDPs) grows exponentially with respect to the level of the hierarchy, thus making their computation unscalable. In this work, by exploiting the symmetries in the SDP, we show that, for a fixed output dimension of the quantum channel, we can compute the SDP in time polynomial with respect to the level of the hierarchy and input dimension. As a direct consequence of our result, the optimal fidelity can be approximated with an accuracy of $\epsilon$ in $\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon, \text{input dimension})$ time.</description>

Abstract: The amount of information in satisfiability problem (SAT) is considered. SAT can be polynomial-time solvable when the solving algorithm holds an exponential amount of information. It is also established that SAT Kolmogorov complexity is constant. It is argued that the amount of information in SAT grows at least exponentially with the size of the input instance. The amount of information in SAT is compared with the amount of information in the fixed code algorithms and generated over runtime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any positive integer $q\geq 2$ and any real number $\delta\in(0,1)$, let $\alpha_q(n,\delta n)$ denote the maximum size of a subset of $\mathbb{Z}_q^n$ with minimum Hamming distance at least $\delta n$, where $\mathbb{Z}_q=\{0,1,\dotsc,q-1\}$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}$. The asymptotic rate function is defined by $ R_q(\delta) = \limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{n}\log_q\alpha_q(n,\delta n).$ The famous $q$-ary asymptotic Gilbert-Varshamov bound, obtained in the 1950s, states that \[ R_q(\delta) \geq 1 - \delta\log_q(q-1)-\delta\log_q\frac{1}{\delta}-(1-\delta)\log_q\frac{1}{1-\delta} \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}R_\mathrm{GV}(\delta,q) \] for all positive integers $q\geq 2$ and $0&lt;\delta&lt;1-q^{-1}$. In the case that $q$ is an even power of a prime with $q\geq 49$, the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound was firstly improved by using algebraic geometry codes in the works of Tsfasman, Vladut, and Zink and of Ihara in the 1980s. These algebraic geometry codes have been modified to improve the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound $R_\mathrm{GV}(\delta,q)$ at a specific tangent point $\delta=\delta_0\in (0,1)$ of the curve $R_\mathrm{GV}(\delta,q)$ for each given integer $q\geq 46$. However, the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound $R_\mathrm{GV}(\delta,q)$ at $\delta=1/2$, i.e., $R_\mathrm{GV}(1/2,q)$, remains the largest known lower bound of $R_q(1/2)$ for infinitely many positive integers $q$ which is a generic prime and which is a generic non-prime-power integer. In this paper, by using codes from geometry of numbers introduced by Lenstra in the 1980s, we prove that the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound $R_\mathrm{GV}(\delta,q)$ with $\delta\in(0,1)$ can be improved for all but finitely many positive integers $q$. It is shown that the growth defined by $\eta(\delta)= \liminf_{q\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{\log q}\log[1-\delta-R_q(\delta)]^{-1}$ for every $\delta\in(0,1)$ has actually a nontrivial lower bound.</description>
