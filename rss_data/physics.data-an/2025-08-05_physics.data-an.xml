      <title>Cooperative effects in feature importance of individual patterns: application to air pollutants and Alzheimer disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging recent advances in the analysis of synergy and redundancy in systems of random variables, an adaptive version of the widely used metric Leave One Covariate Out (LOCO) has been recently proposed to quantify cooperative effects in feature importance (Hi-Fi), a key technique in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), so as to disentangle high-order effects involving a particular input feature in regression problems. Differently from standard feature importance tools, where a single score measures the relevance of each feature, each feature is here characterized by three scores, a two-body (unique) score and higher-order scores (redundant and synergistic). This paper presents a framework to assign those three scores (unique, redundant, and synergistic) to each individual pattern of the data set, while comparing it with the well-known measure of feature importance named {\it Shapley effect}. To illustrate the potential of the proposed framework, we focus on a One-Health application: the relation between air pollutants and Alzheimer's disease mortality rate. Our main result is the synergistic association between features related to $O_3$ and $NO_2$ with mortality, especially in the provinces of Bergamo e Brescia; notably also the density of urban green areas displays synergistic influence with pollutants for the prediction of AD mortality. Our results place local Hi-Fi as a promising tool of wide applicability, which opens new perspectives for XAI as well as to analyze high-order relationships in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Observational causality by states and interaction type for scientific discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10878</link>

Abstract: Causality plays a central role in understanding interactions between variables in complex systems. These systems often exhibit state-dependent causal relationships, where both the strength and direction of causality vary with the value of the interacting variables. In this work, we introduce a state-aware causal inference method that quantifies causality in terms of information gain about future states. The effectiveness of the proposed approach stems from two key features: its ability to characterize causal influence as a function of system state, and its capacity to distinguish between redundant and synergistic interactions. The method is validated across a range of benchmark cases in which the direction and strength of causality evolve in a prescribed manner with the state of the system. We further demonstrate the applicability of our approach in two real scenarios: the interaction between motions across scales in a turbulent boundary layer, and the Walker circulation phenomenon in tropical Pacific climate dynamics. Our results show that, without accounting for state-dependent causality as well as redundant and synergistic effects, traditional approaches to causal inference may lead to incomplete or misleading conclusions.</description>

      <title>Robustness of graph embedding methods for community detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the robustness of graph embedding methods for community detection in the face of network perturbations, specifically edge deletions. Graph embedding techniques, which represent nodes as low-dimensional vectors, are widely used for various graph machine learning tasks due to their ability to capture structural properties of networks effectively. However, the impact of perturbations on the performance of these methods remains relatively understudied. The research considers state-of-the-art graph embedding methods from two families: matrix factorization (e.g., LE, LLE, HOPE, M-NMF) and random walk-based (e.g., DeepWalk, LINE, node2vec). Through experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world networks, the study reveals varying degrees of robustness within each family of graph embedding methods. The robustness is found to be influenced by factors such as network size, initial community partition strength, and the type of perturbation. Notably, node2vec and LLE consistently demonstrate higher robustness for community detection across different scenarios, including networks with degree and community size heterogeneity. These findings highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate graph embedding method based on the specific characteristics of the network and the task at hand, particularly in scenarios where robustness to perturbations is crucial.</description>

      <title>On the role of symmetry and geometry in global quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global quantum sensing enables parameter estimation across arbitrary ranges with a finite number of measurements. Among the various existing formulations, the Bayesian paradigm stands as a flexible approach for optimal protocol design under minimal assumptions. Within this paradigm, however, there are two fundamentally different ways to capture prior ignorance and uninformed estimation; namely, requiring invariance of the prior distribution under specific parameter transformations, or adhering to the geometry of a state space. In this paper we carefully examine the practical consequences of both the invariance-based and the geometry-based approaches, and show how to apply them in relevant examples of rate and coherence estimation in noisy settings. We find that, while the invariance-based approach often leads to simpler priors and estimators and is more broadly applicable in adaptive scenarios, the geometry-based one can lead to faster posterior convergence in a well-defined measurement setting. Crucially, by employing the notion of location-isomorphic parameters, we are able to unify the two formulations into a single practical and versatile framework for optimal global quantum sensing, detailing when and how each set of assumptions should be employed to tackle any given estimation task. We thus provide a blueprint for the design of novel high-precision quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Greedy Emulators for Nuclear Two-Body Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applications of reduced basis method emulators are increasing in low-energy nuclear physics because they enable fast and accurate sampling of high-fidelity calculations, enabling robust uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we develop, implement, and test two model-driven emulators based on (Petrov-)Galerkin projection using the prototypical test case of two-body scattering with the Minnesota potential and a more realistic local chiral potential. The high-fidelity scattering equations are solved with the matrix Numerov method, a reformulation of the popular Numerov recurrence relation for solving special second-order differential equations as a linear system of coupled equations. A novel error estimator based on reduced-space residuals is applied to an active learning approach (a greedy algorithm) to choosing training samples ("snapshots") for the emulator and contrasted with a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) approach. Both approaches allow for computationally efficient offline-online decompositions, but the greedy approach requires much fewer snapshot calculations. These developments set the groundwork for emulating scattering observables based on chiral nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon interactions and optical models, where computational speed-ups are necessary for Bayesian uncertainty quantification. Our emulators and error estimators are widely applicable to linear systems.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the gender divide: Authorship and acknowledgment in scientific publications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The issue of gender bias in scientific publications has been a topic of ongoing debate. One aspect of this debate concerns whether women receive equal credit for their contributions compared to men. Conventional wisdom suggests that women are more likely to be acknowledged than listed as co-authors. In this study, we analyze data from over 20,000 authors and 60,000 acknowledged individuals across nine disciplines in open-access journals. Our results confirm persistent gender disparities: women are more frequently acknowledged than credited as co-authors, especially in roles involving investigation and analysis. To account for status and disciplinary effects, we examined collaboration pair composed of highly cited and less-cited scholars. In collaborations, highly cited scholars are more likely to be listed as an author regardless of gender. Notably, highly cited women in such pairs are even more likely to be co-authors than their men counterparts. Our findings suggest that power dynamics and perceived success heavily influence the distribution of credit in scientific publishing. These results underscore the role of status dynamics in shaping authorship and call for a more nuanced understanding of how gender, power, and recognition interact in scientific publishing. Our findings offer valuable insights for scholars, editors, and funding committed to advancing equity in science.</description>
