      <title>Particle-In-Cell simulations of filamentation process in magnetized plasma of capacitively-coupled radio-frequency discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the uniform raido-frequency capacitively-coupled plasma (RF-CCP) between a large electrode pair, adding an axial magnetic field induces diverse longitudinal filaments. This phenomenon, termed 'filamentation', challenges conventional understanding and remains poorly understood to date. To reveal its pattern dynamics, we conduct 2D Particle-In-Cell simulations to comprehensively examine whole process of filamentation, identifying two distinct stages. Initially, standing waves grows with a modulational instability, forming regular filaments. Subsequently, when initial wavenumber matching relation breaks, the plasma shifts towards dynamic regime governed by competition between Lorentz and thermal pressure forces, characterized by filaments' chaotic evolution. These novel clues pave the way to theoretically understanding the filamentation instability, and provides essential references in effectively manipulating the magnetized plasmas.</description>

      <title>Electron-only reconnection and inverse magnetic-energy transfer at sub-ion scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive, and validate numerically, an analytical model for electron-only magnetic reconnection applicable to strongly magnetized (low-beta) plasmas. Our model predicts sub-ion-scale reconnection rates significantly higher than those pertaining to large-scale reconnection, aligning with recent observations and simulations. We apply this reconnection model to the problem of inverse magnetic-energy transfer at sub-ion scales. We derive time-dependent scaling laws for the magnetic energy decay and the typical magnetic structure dimensions that differ from those previously found in the MHD regime. These scaling laws are validated via two- and three-dimensional simulations, demonstrating that sub-ion scale magnetic fields can reach large, system-size scales via successive coalescence.</description>

      <title>Global realisation of magnetic fields as 1$\frac{1}{2}$D Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper reviews the notion of $n+\frac{1}{2}$D non-autonomous Hamiltonian systems, portraying their dynamics as the flow of the Reeb field related to a closed two-form of maximal rank on a cosymplectic manifold, and naturally decomposing into time-like and Hamiltonian components. The paper then investigates the conditions under which the field-line dynamics of a (tangential) divergence-free vector field on a connected compact three-manifold (possibly with boundary) diffeomorphic to a trivial fibre bundle over the circle can be conversely identified as a non-autonomous $1\frac{1}{2}$D Hamiltonian system. Under the assumption that the field is transverse to a global compact Poincar\'e section, an adaptation of Moser's trick shows that all such fields are locally-Hamiltonian. A full identification is established upon further assuming that the Poincar\'e sections are planar, which crucially implies (together with Dirichlet boundary conditions) that the cohomology class of the generating closed one-forms on each section is constant. By reviewing the classification of fibre bundles over the circle using the monodromy representation, it is remarked that as soon as the Poincar\'e section of an alleged field is diffeomorphic to a disk or an annulus, the domain is necessarily diffeomorphic to a solid or hollow torus, and thus its field-line dynamics can always be identified as a non-autonomous Hamiltonian system.</description>

      <title>Hard X-rays from the deep solar atmosphere: An unusual UV burst with flare properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explosive transient events occur throughout the solar atmosphere. The differing manifestations range from coronal mass ejections to Ellermann bombs. The former may have negligible signatures in the lower atmosphere, and the latter may have negligible nonthermal emissions such as hard X-radiation. A solar flare generally involves a broad range of emission signatures. Using a suite of four space-borne telescopes, we report a solar event that combines aspects of simple UV bursts and hard X-ray emitting flares at the same time. The event is a compact C-class flare in active region AR11861, SOL2013-10-12T00:30. By fitting a combined isothermal and nonthermal model to the hard X-ray spectrum, we inferred plasma temperatures in excess of 15\,MK and a nonthermal power of about $3\times10^{27}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$ in this event. Despite these high temperatures and evidence for nonthermal particles, the flare was mostly confined to the chromosphere. However, the event lacked clear signatures of UV spectral lines, such as the Fe\,{\sc xii} 1349\,\AA\ and Fe\,{\sc xxi} 1354\,\AA\ emission lines, which are characteristic of emission from hotter plasma with a temperature over 1\,MK. Moreover, the event exhibited very limited signatures in the extreme-UV wavelengths. Our study indicates that a UV burst -- hard X-ray flare hybrid phenomenon exists in the low solar atmosphere. Plasma that heats to high temperatures coupled with particle acceleration by magnetic energy that is released directly in the lower atmosphere sheds light on the nature of active region core heating and on inferences of flare signatures.</description>

      <title>Electric field effects during disruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09744v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Helmholtz decomposition separates the electric field in a plasma into the sum of a divergence-free, $\vec{E}_B$, and a curl-free, $\vec{E}_q$, part. The divergence-free part of $\vec{E}$ determines the evolution of the magnetic field. The curl-free part enforces quasi-neutrality, $\vec{E}_q=-\vec{\nabla}\Phi_q$. The quasi-neutrality potential is approximated by $T_e/e$, the electron temperature divided by the elementary charge. During tokamak disruptions, the magnetic surfaces are broken creating large regions of chaotic magnetic field lines. In each chaotic region, the parallel current density divided by $B$ relaxes toward a spatial constant by shear Alfv\'en waves. The potential $\Phi_q$ produces both a diffusion coefficient that is Bohm-like, $D_q\approx T_e/eB$, and a large scale flow $\approx T_e/eB a_T$ across the magnetic field lines, where $a_T$ is the scale of the large scale difference in temperature. This diffusion and flow are important for sweeping impurities into the core of a disrupting tokamak plasma.</description>
