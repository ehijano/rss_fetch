      <title>Gain assistant control of photonic spin Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the photonic spin Hall effect (SHE), also known as transverse shift, incident light photons with opposite spins are spatially separated in the transverse direction due to the spin-orbit interaction of light. Here, we propose a gain-assisted model to control the SHE in the reflected probe light. In this model, a probe light is incident on a cavity containing a three-level dilute gaseous atomic medium, where the interaction between the atom and the control field follows two-photon Raman transitions. We show that the direction of photonic spin accumulations can be switched between positive and negative values across the Brewster angle in both the anomalous and normal dispersion regimes. For the same magnitude of control fields, the peak value of the photonic SHE is higher in the anomalous dispersion region compared to the normal dispersion regime. Additionally, the angular range around the Brewster angle is wider in the normal dispersion regime than in the anomalous dispersion region. Furthermore, the peak value of the photonic SHE and the angular range is controllable by changing the Rabi frequencies of the control fields and the probe field detuning. The measurement of photonic SHE based on gain assistance may enable spin-related applications such as optical sensing.</description>

      <title>Single-molecule motion control</title>

Abstract: Achieving dynamic manipulation and control of single molecules at high spatio-temporal resolution is pivotal for advancing atomic-scale computing and nanorobotics. However, this endeavour is critically challenged by complex nature of atomic and molecular interactions, high-dimensional characteristics of nanoscale systems, and scarcity of experimental data. Here, we present a toy model for controlling single-molecule diffusion by harnessing electrostatic forces arising from elementary surface charges within a lattice structure, mimicking embedded charges on a surface. We investigate the interplay between quantum mechanics and electrostatic interactions in single molecule diffusion processes using a combination of state-dependent diffusion equations and Green's functions. We find that surface charge density critically influences diffusion coefficients, exhibiting linear scaling akin to Coulombic forces. We achieve accurate predictions of experimental diffusion constants and extending the observed range to values reaching up to 6000 $\mu\text{m}^2\text{ms}^{-1}$ and 80000 $\mu\text{m}^2\text{ms}^{-1}$. The molecular trajectories predicted by our model bear resemblance to planetary motion, particularly in their gravity-assisted acceleration-like behaviour. It holds transformative implications for nanorobotics, motion control at the nanoscale, and computing applications, particularly in the areas of molecular and quantum computing where the trapping of atoms and molecules is essential. Beyond the state-of-the-art optical lattice and scanning tunnelling microscopy for atomic/molecular manipulation, our findings give unambiguous advantage of precise control over single-molecule dynamics through quantum manipulation at the angstrom scale.</description>

      <title>Observation of anisotropy-independent magnetization dynamics in spatially disordered Heisenberg spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.08080v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important step towards a comprehensive understanding of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems is the identification of unifying features that are independent of microscopic details of the system. We experimentally observe such robust features in the magnetization relaxation dynamics of disordered Heisenberg XX-, XXZ- and Ising Hamiltonians. We realize these Heisenberg spin models with tunable anisotropy parameter and power-law interactions in an ensemble of Rydberg atoms by encoding the spin in suitable Rydberg state combinations. We consistently observe stretched-exponential relaxation of magnetization for all considered spin models, collapsing onto a single curve after appropriate rescaling of time. This robust short-time relaxation behavior is explained by a perturbative treatment that exploits the strong disorder in pairwise couplings, which leads to a description in terms of approximately independent pairs of spins. In numerical simulations of small systems, we show that these pairs of spins constitute approximate local integrals of motion, which remain at least partially conserved on a timescale exceeding the duration of the relaxation dynamics of the magnetization.</description>
