      <title>Entry and disclosure in group contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study information disclosure policies for contests among groups. Each player endogenously decides whether or not to participate in competition as a member of their group. Within-group aggregation of effort is best-shot, i.e., each group's performance is determined by the highest investment among its members. We consider a generalized all-pay auction setting, in which the group with the highest performance wins the contest with certainty. Players' values for winning are private information at the entry stage, but may be disclosed at the competition stage. We compare three disclosure policies: (i) no disclosure, when the number of entrants remains unknown and their values private; (ii) within-group disclosure, when this information is disclosed within each group but not across groups; and (iii) full disclosure, when the information about entrants is disclosed across groups. For the benchmark case of contests between individuals, information disclosure always reduces expected aggregate investment. However, this is no longer true in group contests: Within-group disclosure unambiguously raises aggregate investment, while the effect of full disclosure is ambiguous.</description>

      <title>Flexible Learning via Noise Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel framework for costly information acquisition in which a decision-maker learns about an unobserved state by choosing a signal distribution, with the cost of information determined by the distribution of noise in the signal. We show that a natural set of axioms admits a unique integral representation of the cost function, and we establish the uniform dominance principle: there always exists an optimal experiment that generates signals with uniform noise. The uniform dominance principle allows us to reduce the infinite-dimensional optimization problem of finding an optimal information structure to finding a single parameter that measures the level of noise. We show that an optimal experiment exists under natural conditions, and we characterize it using generalized first-order conditions that accommodate non-smooth payoff functions and decision rules. Finally, we demonstrate the tractability of our framework in a bilateral trade setting in which a buyer learns about product quality.</description>

      <title>On the Dominance of Truth-Telling in Gradual Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent literature highlights the advantages of implementing social rules via dynamic game forms. We characterize when truth-telling remains a dominant strategy in gradual mechanisms implementing strategy-proof social rules, where agents gradually reveal their private information while acquiring information about others in the process. Our first characterization hinges on the incentive-preservation of a basic transformation on gradual mechanisms called illuminating that partitions information sets. The second relies on a single reaction-proofness condition. We demonstrate the usefulness of both characterizations through applications to second-price auctions and the top-trading cycles algorithm.</description>

      <title>Value of Information in Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study extends Blackwell's (1953) comparison of information to a sequential social learning model, where agents make decisions sequentially based on both private signals and the observed actions of others. In this context, we introduce a new binary relation over information structures: an information structure is more socially valuable than another if it yields higher expected payoffs for all agents, regardless of their preferences. First, we establish that this binary relation is strictly stronger than the Blackwell order. Then, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for our binary relation and propose a simpler sufficient condition that is easier to verify.</description>
