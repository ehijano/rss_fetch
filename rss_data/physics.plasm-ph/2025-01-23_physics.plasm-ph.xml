      <title>Optimization of passive superconductors for shaping stellarator magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the novel problem of optimizing a large set of passive superconducting coils (PSCs) with currents induced by a background magnetic field rather than power supplies. In the nuclear fusion literature, such coils have been proposed to partially produce the 3D magnetic fields for stellarators and provide passive stabilization. We perform the first optimizations of PSC arrays with respect to the orientation, shape, and location of each coil, jointly minimized with the background fields. We conclude by generating passive coil array solutions for four stellarators.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Proton Acceleration via Petawatt Laguerre-Gaussian Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy, high-flux collimated proton beams with high repetition rates are critical for applications such as proton therapy, proton radiography, high-energy-density matter generation, and compact particle accelerators. However, achieving proton beam collimation has typically relied on complex and expensive target fabrication or precise control of auxiliary laser pulses, which poses significant limitations for high-repetition applications. Here, we demonstrate an all-optical method for collimated proton acceleration using a single femtosecond Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) laser with an intensity exceeding 1020 W/cm2 irradiating a simple planar target. Compared to conventional Gaussian laser-driven schemes, the maximum proton energy is enhanced by 60% (reaching 35 MeV) and beam divergence is much reduced. Particle-in-cell simulations reveal that a plasma jet is initially focused by the hollow electric sheath field of the LG laser, and then electrons in the jet are further collimated by self-generated magnetic fields. This process amplifies the charge-separation electric field between electrons and ions, leading to increased proton energy in the longitudinal direction and improved collimation in the transverse direction. This single-LG-laser-driven collimation mechanism offers a promising pathway for high-repetition, high-quality proton beam generation, with broad potential applications including proton therapy and fast ignition in inertial confinement fusion.</description>

      <title>Glow-to-arc transition in graphite cathode with high-current magnetron discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The glow-to-arc transition is a critical phenomenon in plasma discharges, commonly leading to detrimental effects. The physical mechanisms triggering this transition remain poorly understood. The advent of a discharge called Hyper-Power Impulse Magnetron has opened possibilities. Hyper-Power Impulse Magnetron allows the glow mode to be maintained over long periods (1 ms) and at high-current densities (&gt; 5 A/cm$^2$), which has unveiled certain features in the glow-to-arc transition. This work focuses on a graphite target that transits easily in the arc regime. The high-speed video-camera analysis revealed specific properties of graphite in ExB discharges, and the statistical study of the arc transition revealed differences from other refractory target materials. The early stage of cathodic spot formation, observed as bright dots, will be presented and analyzed within the known "ecton" and "vaporization" models for spot formation. This experimental study highlights the role of luminous spot formation prior to arc transition, with possible optimization on the stability of magnetron discharges.</description>

      <title>Zonal flow suppression of microturbulent transport in the optimized stellarators W7-X and QSTK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparative study of turbulence transport in two optimized stellarator configurations: Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) and a recent design called Quasi-Symmetric Turbulence Konzept (QSTK). Using global gyrokinetic simulations with the Gyrokinetic Toroidal Code (GTC), we explore the role of zonal flows (ZFs) in suppressing electrostatic Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG) driven turbulence in both configurations. The simulations reveal that ZFs significantly reduce ion heat transport in both W7-X and QSTK, with a more pronounced impact on the latter configuration, as suggested by the apparently higher linear threshold ("critical") gradients for ITG modes. The study also highlights that, while both stellarators exhibit similar mode structures, the reduced ITG growth rates in QSTK contribute to the better performance regarding turbulence suppression, particularly at larger temperature gradients. The results support the notion that linear stability measures, in combination with nonlinear stabilization by zonal flows, can play an important role in the suppression of nonlinear heat fluxes.</description>

      <title>Two facilitating mechanisms for SF6 streamer breakdown induced by a floating linear metal particle: following streamers (FS) and side streamers (SS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electrical breakdown of SF6 in the presence of floating metal particles is facilitated by two key factors: the role of floating metal particles and the nonlinear breakdown behavior of high-pressure SF6. However, the microscopic transient processes remain unclear, motivating this paper. Using 2D fluid models, we investigate SF6 streamer breakdown induced by a floating linear metal particle under negative applied voltage. First, We identify a characteristic double-end streamer inception in the combined gap. Then, we propose the following streamer (FS) mechanism to explain the metal particle's role. Two following streamers, FS1 and FS2, arise from the interaction between space charge and metal particle. FS1 facilitates breakdown via the negative space charge field generated by its head. FS2 facilitates breakdown by merging with FS1, accelerating its propagation and enhancing the electric field at the primary streamer head. Finally, we propose the side streamer (SS) mechanism to explain the nonlinear breakdown behavior of high-pressure SF6. The SS is identified as a new forward ionization wave that develops along the sides of the primary streamer, due to photoionization-driven negative ion accumulation. SS facilitates breakdown by merging with the primary streamer, increasing negative space charge and leading to three distinct propagation modes. Higher pressure increases the production rate of negative ions along the streamer sides, making SS more likely to form. Under overvoltage, the facilitating effect of SS diminishes as the background field (E/N)b strengthens, disappearing when (E/N)b exceeds 245 Td. This study provides new insights into the SF6 streamer breakdown mechanisms induced by floating metal particles and offers theoretical references for further investigation on the quantitative characterization.</description>

      <title>Influence of initial conditions on data-driven model identification and information entropy for ideal mhd problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven methods of model identification are able to discern governing dynamics of a system from data. Such methods are well suited to help us learn about systems with unpredictable evolution or systems with ambiguous governing dynamics given our current understanding. Many plasma problems of interest fall into these categories as there are a wide range of models that exist, however each model is only useful in a certain regime and often limited by computational complexity. To ensure data-driven methods align with theory, they must be consistent and predictable when acting on data whose governing dynamics are known. Weak Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) is a recently developed data-driven method that has shown promise in learning governing dynamics from data with high noise levels [1]. This work examines how WSINDy acts on ideal MHD test problems as the initial conditions are varied and specifies limiting requirements for successful equation identification. It is hard to recover the governing dynamics from data that emphasize a single dominant behavior. In these low information cases, Shannon information entropy is able to pick up on the redundancies in the data that affect recoverability.</description>
