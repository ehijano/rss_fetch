      <title>Inequality at risk of automation? Gender differences in routine tasks intensity in developing country labor markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technological change can have profound impacts on the labor market. Decades of research have made it clear that technological change produces winners and losers. Machines can replace some types of work that humans do, while new technologies increase human's productivity in other types of work. For a long time, highly educated workers benefitted from increased demand for their labor due to skill-biased technological change, while the losers were concentrated at the bottom of the wage distribution (Katz and Autor, 1999; Goldin and Katz, 2007, 2010; Kijima, 2006). Currently, however, labor markets seem to be affected by a different type of technological change, the so-called routine-biased technological change (RBTC). This chapter studies the risk of automation in developing country labor markets, with a particular focus on differences between men and women. Given the pervasiveness of gender occupational segregation, there may be important gender differences in the risk of automation. Understanding these differences is important to ensure progress towards equitable development and gender inclusion in the face of new technological advances. Our objective is to describe the gender gap in the routine task intensity of jobs in developing countries and to explore the role of occupational segregation and several worker characteristics in accounting for the gender gap.</description>

      <title>Market-Based Portfolio Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Markowitz's (1952) decomposition of a portfolio variance as a quadratic form in the variables of the relative amounts invested into the securities, which has been the core of classical portfolio theory for more than 70 years, is valid only in the approximation when all trade volumes with all securities of the portfolio are assumed constant. We derive the market-based portfolio variance and its decomposition by its securities, which accounts for the impact of random trade volumes and is a polynomial of the 4th degree in the variables of the relative amounts invested into the securities. To do that, we transform the time series of market trades with the securities of the portfolio and obtain the time series of trades with the portfolio as a single market security. The time series of market trades determine the market-based means and variances of prices and returns of the portfolio in the same form as the means and variances of any market security. The decomposition of the market-based variance of returns of the portfolio by its securities follows from the structure of the time series of market trades of the portfolio as a single security. The market-based decompositions of the portfolio's variances of prices and returns could help the managers of multi-billion portfolios and the developers of large market and macroeconomic models like BlackRock's Aladdin, JP Morgan, and the U.S. Fed adjust their models and forecasts to the reality of random markets.</description>

      <title>DeepGreen: Effective LLM-Driven Green-washing Monitoring System Designed for Empirical Testing -- Evidence from China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes DeepGreen, an Large Language Model Driven (LLM-Driven) system for detecting corporate green-washing behaviour. Utilizing dual-layer LLM analysis, DeepGreen preliminarily identifies potential green keywords in financial statements and then assesses their implementation degree via iterative semantic analysis of LLM. A core variable GreenImplement is derived from the ratio from the two layers' output. We extract 204 financial statements of 68 companies from A-share market over three years, comprising 89,893 words, and analyse them through DeepGreen. Our analysis, supported by violin plots and K-means clustering, reveals insights and validates the variable against the Huazheng ESG rating. It offers a novel perspective for regulatory agencies and investors, serving as a proactive monitoring tool that complements traditional methods.Empirical tests show that green implementation can significantly boost the asset return rate of companies, but there is heterogeneity in scale. Small and medium-sized companies have limited contribution to asset return via green implementation, so there is a stronger motivation for green-washing.</description>

      <title>Trading Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new algorithm -- Trading Graph Neural Network (TGNN) that can structurally estimate the impact of asset features, dealer features and relationship features on asset prices in trading networks. It combines the strength of the traditional simulated method of moments (SMM) and recent machine learning techniques -- Graph Neural Network (GNN). It outperforms existing reduced-form methods with network centrality measures in prediction accuracy. The method can be used on networks with any structure, allowing for heterogeneity among both traders and assets.</description>

      <title>Costly Attention and Retirement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.06520v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In UK data, I document the prevalence of misbeliefs regarding the State Pension eligibility age (SPA) and these misbeliefs' predictivity of retirement. Exploiting policy variation, I estimate a lifecycle model of retirement in which rationally inattentive households learning about uncertain pension policy endogenously generates misbeliefs. Endogenous misbeliefs explain 43\%-88\% of the excessive (given financial incentives) drop in employment at SPA. To achieve this, I develop a solution method for dynamic rational inattention models with history-dependent beliefs. Costly attention makes the SPA up to 15\% less effective at increasing old-age employment. Information letters improve welfare and increase employment.</description>

      <title>Regional House Price Dynamics in Australia: Insights into Lifestyle and Mining Dynamics through PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to regional house price indexes to uncover dominant trends in Australia's housing market. Regions are assigned PCA-derived scores that reveal which underlying market forces are most influential in each area, enabling broad classification of local housing markets. The approach highlights where price movements tend to align across regions, even those geographically distant. The three most dominant trends are described in detail and, together with the regional scores, provide objective tools for policymakers, researchers, and real estate professionals.</description>
