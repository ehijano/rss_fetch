      <title>Underground Multi-robot Systems at Work: a revolution in mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing global demand for critical raw materials (CRMs) has highlighted the need to access difficult and hazardous environments such as abandoned underground mines. These sites pose significant challenges for conventional machinery and human operators due to confined spaces, structural instability, and lack of infrastructure. To address this, we propose a modular multi-robot system designed for autonomous operation in such environments, enabling sequential mineral extraction tasks. Unlike existing work that focuses primarily on mapping and inspection through global behavior or central control, our approach incorporates physical interaction capabilities using specialized robots coordinated through local high-level behavior control. Our proposed system utilizes Hierarchical Finite State Machine (HFSM) behaviors to structure complex task execution across heterogeneous robotic platforms. Each robot has its own HFSM behavior to perform sequential autonomy while maintaining overall system coordination, achieved by triggering behavior execution through inter-robot communication. This architecture effectively integrates software and hardware components to support collaborative, task-driven multi-robot operation in confined underground environments.</description>

      <title>Learning in Stackelberg Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing socially optimal policies in multi-agent environments is a fundamental challenge in both economics and artificial intelligence. This paper studies a general framework for learning Stackelberg equilibria in dynamic and uncertain environments, where a single leader interacts with a population of adaptive followers. Motivated by pressing real-world challenges such as equitable electricity tariff design for consumers with distributed energy resources (such as rooftop solar and energy storage), we formalize a class of Stackelberg Markov games and establish the existence and uniqueness of stationary Stackelberg equilibria under mild continuity and monotonicity conditions. We then extend the framework to incorporate a continuum of agents via mean-field approximation, yielding a tractable Stackelberg-Mean Field Equilibrium (S-MFE) formulation. To address the computational intractability of exact best-response dynamics, we introduce a softmax-based approximation and rigorously bound its error relative to the true Stackelberg equilibrium. Our approach enables scalable and stable learning through policy iteration without requiring full knowledge of follower objectives. We validate the framework on an energy market simulation, where a public utility or a state utility commission sets time-varying rates for a heterogeneous population of prosumers. Our results demonstrate that learned policies can simultaneously achieve economic efficiency, equity across income groups, and stability in energy systems. This work demonstrates how game-theoretic learning frameworks can support data-driven policy design in large-scale strategic environments, with applications to real-world systems like energy markets.</description>

      <title>Servos for Local Map Exploration Onboard Nonholonomic Vehicles for Extremum Seeking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremum seeking control (ESC) often employs perturbation-based estimates of derivatives for some sensor field or cost function. These estimates are generally obtained by simply multiplying the output of a single-unit sensor by some time-varying function. Previous work has focused on sinusoidal perturbations to generate derivative estimates with results for arbitrary order derivatives of scalar maps or higher up to third-order derivatives of multivariable maps. This work extends the perturbations from sinusoidal to bounded periodic or almost periodic functions and considers multivariable maps. A necessary and sufficient condition is given for determining if time-varying functions exist for estimating arbitrary order derivatives of multivariable maps for any given bounded periodic or almost periodic dither signal. These results are then used in a source seeking controller for a nonholonomic vehicle with a sensor actuated by servo. The conducted simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that by distributing the local map exploration to a servo, the nonholonomic vehicle was able to achieve a faster convergence to the source.</description>

      <title>Synergies between Federated Foundation Models and Smart Power Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 has marked a significant paradigm shift in machine learning. Trained on massive corpora of data, these models demonstrate remarkable capabilities in language understanding, generation, summarization, and reasoning, transforming how intelligent systems process and interact with human language. Although LLMs may still seem like a recent breakthrough, the field is already witnessing the rise of a new and more general category: multi-modal, multi-task foundation models (M3T FMs). These models go beyond language and can process heterogeneous data types/modalities, such as time-series measurements, audio, imagery, tabular records, and unstructured logs, while supporting a broad range of downstream tasks spanning forecasting, classification, control, and retrieval. When combined with federated learning (FL), they give rise to M3T Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs): a highly recent and largely unexplored class of models that enable scalable, privacy-preserving model training/fine-tuning across distributed data sources. In this paper, we take one of the first steps toward introducing these models to the power systems research community by offering a bidirectional perspective: (i) M3T FedFMs for smart grids and (ii) smart grids for FedFMs. In the former, we explore how M3T FedFMs can enhance key grid functions, such as load/demand forecasting and fault detection, by learning from distributed, heterogeneous data available at the grid edge in a privacy-preserving manner. In the latter, we investigate how the constraints and structure of smart grids, spanning energy, communication, and regulatory dimensions, shape the design, training, and deployment of M3T FedFMs.</description>

      <title>A LiDAR-Driven Fallback Longitudinal Controller for Safer Following in Sudden Braking Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive Cruise Control has seen significant advancements, with Collaborative Adaptive Cruise Control leveraging Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication to enhance coordination and stability. However, the reliance on stable communication channels limits its reliability. Research on reducing information dependencies in Adaptive Cruise Control systems has remained limited, despite its critical role in mitigating collision risks during sudden braking scenarios. This study proposes a novel fallback longitudinal controller that relies solely on LiDAR-based distance measurements and the velocity of a follower vehicle. The controller is designed to be time-independent, ensuring operation in the presence of sensor delays or synchronization issues. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller enables vehicle-following from standstill and prevents collisions during emergency braking, even under minimal onboard information.</description>

      <title>Safe Guaranteed Dynamics Exploration with Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring both optimality and safety is critical for the real-world deployment of agents, but becomes particularly challenging when the system dynamics are unknown. To address this problem, we introduce a notion of maximum safe dynamics learning via sufficient exploration in the space of safe policies. We propose a $\textit{pessimistically}$ safe framework that $\textit{optimistically}$ explores informative states and, despite not reaching them due to model uncertainty, ensures continuous online learning of dynamics. The framework achieves first-of-its-kind results: learning the dynamics model sufficiently $-$ up to an arbitrary small tolerance (subject to noise) $-$ in a finite time, while ensuring provably safe operation throughout with high probability and without requiring resets. Building on this, we propose an algorithm to maximize rewards while learning the dynamics $\textit{only to the extent needed}$ to achieve close-to-optimal performance. Unlike typical reinforcement learning (RL) methods, our approach operates online in a non-episodic setting and ensures safety throughout the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in challenging domains such as autonomous car racing and drone navigation under aerodynamic effects $-$ scenarios where safety is critical and accurate modeling is difficult.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Computing the Cyclic Output-to-Output Gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cyclic output-to-output gain is a security metric for control systems. Commonly, it is computed by solving a semi-definite program, which scales badly and inhibits its use for large-scale systems. We propose a method for computing the cyclic output-to-output gain using Hamiltonian matrices, similar to existing methods for the $H_\infty$-norm. In contrast to existing methods for the $H_{\infty}$-norm, the proposed method considers generalized singular values rather than regular singular values. Moreover, to ensure that the Hamiltonian matrices exist, we introduce a regularized version of the cyclic output-to-output gain. Through numerical experiments, we show that the proposed method is more efficient, scalable, and reliable than semi-definite programming approaches.</description>

      <title>6DMA-Assisted Secure Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) has been widely studied for capacity enhancement, but its potential for physical layer security (PLS) remains largely unexplored. By adjusting both three-dimensional (3D) positions and 3D rotations of distributed antenna surfaces, 6DMA can increase spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). The extra DoFs enable dynamic shaping of legitimate channels and suppresses eavesdropping channels, thereby offering unique advantages in enhancing secrecy performance. Motivated by this, this letter proposes a novel 6DMA-assisted secure wireless communication system, where the base station (BS) is equipped with 6DMA to enhance secrecy performance. Specifically, to simultaneously serve multiple legitimate users and counter cooperative interception by multiple eavesdroppers (Eves), we formulate a sum secrecy rate (SSR) maximization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit and artificial noise (AN) beamformers, as well as the 3D positions and 3D rotations of antenna surfaces. To solve this non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that decomposes the original problem into two subproblems and solves them iteratively to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate the superior secrecy performance over partially movable and conventional fixed-position antenna systems.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Observer Synthesis for Autonomous Limit Cycle Systems through Estimation of Koopman Eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The signal of system states needed for feedback controllers is estimated by state observers. One state observer design is the Kazantzis-Kravaris/Luenberger (KKL) observer, a generalization of the Luenberger observer for linear systems. The main challenge in applying the KKL design is constructing an injective mapping of the states, which requires solving PDEs based on a first-principles model. This paper proposes a data-driven, Koopman operator-based method for the construction of KKL observers for planar limit cycle systems. Specifically, for such systems, the KKL injective mapping is guaranteed to be a linear combination of Koopman eigenfunctions. Hence, the determination of such an injection is reduced to a least-squares regression problem, and the inverse of the injective mapping is then approximated using kernel ridge regression. The entire synthesis procedure uses solely convex optimization. We apply the proposed approach to the Brusselator system, demonstrating accurate estimations of the system states.</description>

      <title>On the System Theoretic Offline Learning of Continuous-Time LQR with Exogenous Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze offline designs of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) strategies with uncertain disturbances. First, we consider the scenario where the exogenous variable can be estimated in a controlled environment, and subsequently, consider a more practical and challenging scenario where it is unknown in a stochastic setting. Our approach builds on the fundamental learning-based framework of adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), combined with a Lyapunov-based analytical methodology to design the algorithms and derive sample-based approximations motivated from the Markov decision process (MDP)-based approaches. For the scenario involving non-measurable disturbances, we further establish stability and convergence guarantees for the learned control gains under sample-based approximations. The overall methodology emphasizes simplicity while providing rigorous guarantees. Finally, numerical experiments focus on the intricacies and validations for the design of offline continuous-time LQR with exogenous disturbances.</description>

      <title>A model free approach for continuous-time optimal tracking control with unknown user-define cost and constrained control input via advantage function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a pioneering approach to solving the linear quadratic regulation (LQR) and linear quadratic tracking (LQT) problems with constrained inputs using a novel off-policy continuous-time Q-learning framework. The proposed methodology leverages a novel concept of the Advantage function for linear continuous systems, enabling solutions to be obtained without the need for prior knowledge of the reward matrix weights, state resetting, or assuming the existence of a predefined admissible controller. This framework includes multiple algorithms (Algs) tailored to address these control problems under model-free conditions, without requiring any knowledge about system dynamics. Two distinct implementation methods are explored: the first processes state and input data over a fixed time interval, making it well-suited for LQR problems, while the second method operates over multiple intervals, offering a practical solution for tracking problems with constrained inputs. The convergence of the proposed algorithms is verified theoretically. Finally, the simulation results of the F-16 aircraft system are presented for the two problems to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Robustly Constrained Dynamic Games for Uncertain Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for robust dynamic games with nonlinear dynamics corrupted by state-dependent additive noise, and nonlinear agent-specific and shared constraints. Leveraging system-level synthesis (SLS), each agent designs a nominal trajectory and a causal affine error feedback law to minimize their own cost while ensuring that its own constraints and the shared constraints are satisfied, even under worst-case noise realizations. Building on these nonlinear safety certificates, we define the novel notion of a robustly constrained Nash equilibrium (RCNE). We then present an Iterative Best Response (IBR)-based algorithm that iteratively refines the optimal trajectory and controller for each agent until approximate convergence to the RCNE. We evaluated our method on simulations and hardware experiments involving large numbers of robots with high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics, as well as state-dependent dynamics noise. Across all experiment settings, our method generated trajectory rollouts which robustly avoid collisions, while a baseline game-theoretic algorithm for producing open-loop motion plans failed to generate trajectories that satisfy constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the robustness of a prescribed-time observer for a class of nonlinear systems in the presence of disturbances and unmodeled dynamics. It is proven and demonstrated through simulations that the proposed observer completely rejects the effects of arbitrarily large bounded disturbances and unmodeled dynamics, enabling accurate estimation of both the states and the disturbances. Furthermore, a comparison with the standard high-gain observer is provided to highlight the superiority of the prescribed-time observer in reducing the peaking phenomenon and improving estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Closing the Loop Inside Neural Networks: Causality-Guided Layer Adaptation for Fault Recovery Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of real-time fault recovery control for nonlinear control-affine systems subject to actuator loss of effectiveness faults and external disturbances. We derive a two-stage framework that combines causal inference with selective online adaptation to achieve an effective learning-based recovery control method. In the offline phase, we develop a causal layer attribution technique based on the average causal effect (ACE) to evaluate the relative importance of each layer in a pretrained deep neural network (DNN) controller compensating for faults. This methodology identifies a subset of high-impact layers responsible for robust fault compensation. In the online phase, we deploy a Lyapunov-based gradient update to adapt only the ACE-selected layer to circumvent the need for full-network or last-layer only updates. The proposed adaptive controller guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) with exponential convergence of the closed-loop system in the presence of actuator faults and external disturbances. Compared to conventional adaptive DNN controllers with full-network adaptation, our methodology has a reduced computational overhead. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology, a case study is provided on a 3-axis attitude control system of a spacecraft with four reaction wheels.</description>

      <title>Online Data-Driven Reachability Analysis using Zonotopic Recursive Least Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reachability analysis is a key formal verification technique for ensuring the safety of modern cyber physical systems subject to uncertainties in measurements, system models (parameters), and inputs. Classical model-based approaches rely on accurate prior knowledge of system dynamics, which may not always be available or reliable. To address this, we present a data-driven reachability analysis framework that computes over-approximations of reachable sets directly from online state measurements. The method estimates time-varying unknown models using an Exponentially Forgetting Zonotopic Recursive Least Squares (EF ZRLS) method, which processes data corrupted by bounded noise. Specifically, a time-varying set of models that contains the true model of the system is estimated recursively, and then used to compute the forward reachable sets under process noise and uncertain inputs. Our approach applies to both discrete-time Linear Time Varying (LTV) and nonlinear Lipschitz systems. Compared to existing techniques, it produces less conservative reachable set over approximations, remains robust under slowly varying dynamics, and operates solely on real-time data without requiring any pre-recorded offline experiments. Numerical simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness and practical applicability of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Campus Energy Resilience: Clustering and Time-Series Forecasting in Intelligent Load Shedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for reliable electricity in universities necessitates intelligent energy management. This study proposes a machine learning-based load shedding framework for the University of Lagos, designed to optimize distribution and reduce waste. The methodology followed three main stages. First, a dataset of 3,648 hourly records from 55 buildings was compiled to develop building-level consumption models. Second, Principal Component Analysis was applied for dimensionality reduction, and clustering validation techniques were used to determine the optimal number of demand groups. Mini-Batch K-Means was then employed to classify buildings into high-, medium-, and low-demand clusters. Finally, short-term load forecasting was performed at the cluster level using multiple statistical and deep learning models, including ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, and GRU. Results showed Prophet offered the most reliable forecasts, while Mini-Batch K-Means achieved stable clustering performance. By integrating clustering with forecasting, the framework enabled a fairer, data-driven load shedding strategy that reduces inefficiencies and supports climate change mitigation through sustainable energy management.</description>

      <title>Vibrational Stabilization of Cluster Synchronization in Oscillator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cluster synchronization is of great importance for the normal functioning of numerous technological and natural systems. Deviations from normal cluster synchronization patterns are closely associated with various malfunctions, such as neurological disorders in the brain. Therefore, it is crucial to restore normal system functions by stabilizing the appropriate cluster synchronization patterns. Most existing studies focus on designing controllers based on state measurements to achieve system stabilization. However, in many real-world scenarios, measuring system states in real time, such as neuronal activity in the brain, poses significant challenges, rendering the stabilization of such systems difficult. To overcome this challenge, in this paper, we employ an open-loop control strategy, vibrational control, which does not require any state measurements. We establish some sufficient conditions under which vibrational inputs stabilize cluster synchronization. Further, we provide a tractable approach to design vibrational control. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Delay compensation of multi-input distinct delay nonlinear systems via neural operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the first stability results for approximate predictors in multi-input non-linear systems with distinct actuation delays. We show that if the predictor approximation satisfies a uniform (in time) error bound, semi-global practical stability is correspondingly achieved. For such approximators, the required uniform error bound depends on the desired region of attraction and the number of control inputs in the system. The result is achieved through transforming the delay into a transport PDE and conducting analysis on the coupled ODE-PDE cascade. To highlight the viability of such error bounds, we demonstrate our results on a class of approximators - neural operators - showcasing sufficiency for satisfying such a universal bound both theoretically and in simulation on a mobile robot experiment.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Lyapunov-constrained MPC for fault-tolerant AUV trajectory tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are subject to various sources of faults during their missions, which challenges AUV control and operation in real environments. This paper addresses fault-tolerant trajectory tracking of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) under thruster failures. We propose an adaptive Lyapunov-constrained model predictive control (LMPC) that guarantees stable trajectory tracking when the AUV switches between fault and normal modes. Particularly, we model different AUV thruster faults and build online failure identification based on Bayesian approach. This facilitates a soft switch between AUV status, and the identified and updated AUV failure model feeds LMPC controller for the control law derivation. The Lyapunov constrain in LMPC ensures that the trajectory tracking control remains stable during AUV status shifts, thus mitigating severe and fatal fluctuations when an AUV thruster occurs or recovers. We conduct numerical simulations on a four-thruster planar AUV using the proposed approach. The results demonstrate smooth transitions between thruster failure types and low trajectory tracking errors compared with the benchmark adaptive MPC and backstepping control with rapid failure identification and failure accommodation during the trajectory tracking.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Encryption Cooperative Salvo Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of trajectory encryption in cooperative simultaneous target interception, wherein heterogeneity in guidance principles across a team of unmanned autonomous systems is leveraged as a strategic design feature. By employing a mix of heterogeneous time-to-go formulations leading to a cooperative guidance strategy, the swarm of vehicles is able to generate diverse trajectory families. This diversity expands the feasible solution space for simultaneous target interception, enhances robustness under disturbances, and enables flexible time-to-go adjustments without predictable detouring. From an adversarial perspective, heterogeneity obscures the collective interception intent by preventing straightforward prediction of swarm dynamics, effectively acting as an encryption layer in the trajectory domain. Simulations demonstrate that the swarm of heterogeneous vehicles is able to intercept a moving target simultaneously from a diverse set of initial engagement configurations.</description>

      <title>Methods for Multi-objective Optimization PID Controller for quadrotor UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating unmanned aerial vehicles into daily use requires controllers that ensure stable flight, efficient energy use, and reduced noise. Proportional integral derivative controllers remain standard but are highly sensitive to gain selection, with manual tuning often yielding suboptimal trade-offs. This paper studies different optimization techniques for the automated tuning of quadrotor proportional integral derivative gains under a unified simulation that couples a blade element momentum based aerodynamic model with a fast deep neural network surrogate, six degrees of freedom rigid body dynamics, turbulence, and a data driven acoustic surrogate model that predicts third octave spectra and propagates them to ground receivers. We compare three families of gradient-free optimizers: metaheuristics, Bayesian optimization, and deep reinforcement learning. Candidate controllers are evaluated using a composite cost function that incorporates multiple metrics, such as noise footprint and power consumption, simultaneously. Metaheuristics improve performance consistently, with Grey Wolf Optimization producing optimal results. Bayesian optimization is sample efficient but carries higher per iteration overhead and depends on the design domain. The reinforcement learning agents do not surpass the baseline in the current setup, suggesting the problem formulation requires further refinement. On unseen missions the best tuned controller maintains accurate tracking while reducing oscillations, power demand, and acoustic emissions. These results show that noise aware proportional integral derivative tuning through black box search can deliver quieter and more efficient flight without hardware changes.</description>

      <title>A Fundamental Study for Multiobjective Optimization Problems in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiobjective optimization problems are important in analysis and application of nonlinear dynamical systems. As a first step, this paper studies a biobjective optimization problem in a simple nonlinear switched dynamical system: a piecewise linear system based on a boost converter with photovoltaic input. The piecewise linearity enables us to analyze the nonlinear dynamics exactly. In the biobjective optimization problem, the first objective evaluates stability of circuit operation and the second objective evaluates average input power. A main task is analysis of a trade-off between the two objectives. Using the piecewise exact solutions, the two objectives are formulated theoretically. Using the theoretical formulae, the existence of a trade-off between the two objectives is clarified exactly. Relationship between the trade-off and parameters is also considered. The results provide fundamental information to analyze multiobjective optimization problems in various nonlinear systems and to realize their engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Battery Electric Vehicle Charging Scheduling across Multiple Charging Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uptake of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) is increasing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector. The rapid adoption of BEVs depends significantly on the coordinated charging/discharging infrastructure. Without it, uncontrolled and erratic charging patterns could lead to increased power losses and voltage fluctuations beyond acceptable thresholds. BEV charge scheduling presents a multi-objective optimization (MOO) challenge, demanding a balance between minimizing network impact and maximizing the benefits for electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) operators and BEV owners. In this paper, we develop an MOO framework incorporating a carbon emission program and a dynamic economic dispatch problem, allowing BEV users to respond by charging and discharging through grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies according to the optimal electricity price and compensation. Furthermore, we integrate dynamic economic dispatch with time-of-use tariffs to obtain optimal market electricity prices and reduce total costs over 24 hours. Our experimental results on a sample network show that the proposed scheduling increases participation in V2G services by over 10%, increases EVCS benefits by over 20%, and reduces network losses. Furthermore, increased rates of charging/discharging, coupled with more significant carbon revenue benefits for BEV users and EVCS, contribute to better offsetting battery degradation costs.</description>

      <title>Holistic Grid-Forming Control for HVDC-Connected Offshore Wind Power Plants to Provide Frequency Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HVDC-connected offshore wind power plants (OWPPs) are expected to provide inertial response and frequency containment reserve (FCR) to help address the frequency control challenges caused by the growing penetration of power electronics in power systems. Initially dominated by communication-based and grid-following (GFL) control, recent efforts have shifted towards incorporating communication-free and grid-forming (GFM) control into HVDC-OWPP systems to enhance their frequency response capability. This paper proposes a holistic GFM control based on dual-port GFM control to improve the coordination across the entire AC-DC-AC dynamics. A frequency response model of a typical HVDC-OWPP system is developed for GFM control design. Then, dual-port GFM control and virtual synchronous generator control are implemented respectively on the HVDC system and OWPP of the typical system, where the asynchronism of onshore and offshore frequencies is revealed. Next, holistic GFM control is proposed to improve the synchronization and DC voltage regulation. Finally, simulations on the delivery of FCR and inertial response are carried out to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control.</description>

      <title>RSU-Assisted Resource Allocation for Collaborative Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a pivotal technology for autonomous driving, collaborative perception enables vehicular agents to exchange perceptual data through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications, thereby enhancing perception accuracy of all collaborators. However, existing collaborative perception frameworks often assume ample communication resources, which is usually impractical in real-world vehicular networks. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the problem of communication resource allocation for collaborative perception and proposes RACooper, a novel RSU-assisted resource allocation framework that maximizes perception accuracy under constrained communication resources. RACooper leverages a hierarchical reinforcement learning model to dynamically allocate communication resources while accounting for real-time sensing data and channel dynamics induced by vehicular mobility. By jointly optimizing spatial confidence metrics and channel state information, our approach ensures efficient feature transmission, enhancing the effectiveness of collaborative perception. Simulation results demonstrate that compared to conventional baseline algorithms, RACooper achieves significant improvements in perception accuracy, especially under bandwidth-constrained scenarios.</description>

      <title>Existence and Synthesis of Multi-Resolution Approximate Bisimulations for Continuous-State Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully automatic framework for synthesising compact, finite-state deterministic abstractions of deterministic, continuous-state autonomous systems under locally specified resolution requirements.
  Our approach builds on multi-resolution approximate bisimulations, a generalisation of classical $\epsilon$-approximate bisimulations, that support state-dependent error bounds and subsumes both variable- and uniform-resolution relations. We show that some systems admit multi-resolution bisimulations but no $\epsilon$-approximate bisimulation.
  We prove the existence of multi-resolution approximately bisimilar abstractions for all incrementally uniformly bounded ($\delta$-UB) systems, thereby broadening the applicability of symbolic verification to a larger class of dynamics; as a trivial special case, this result also covers incrementally globally asymptotically stable ($\delta$-GAS) systems.
  The Multi-resolution Abstraction Synthesis Problem (MRASP) is solved via a scalable Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS) loop, combining mesh refinement with counterexample-driven refinement. This ensures soundness for all $\delta$-UB systems, and ensures termination in certain special cases.
  Experiments on linear and nonlinear benchmarks, including non-$\delta$-GAS and non-differentiable cases, demonstrate that our algorithm yields abstractions up to 50\% smaller than Lyapunov-based grids while enforcing tighter, location-dependent error guarantees.</description>

      <title>On Fast Attitude Filtering Based on Matrix Fisher Distribution with Stability Guarantee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses two interrelated problems of the nonlinear filtering mechanism and fast attitude filtering with the matrix Fisher distribution (MFD) on the special orthogonal group. By analyzing the distribution evolution along Bayes' rule, we reveal two essential properties that enhance the performance of Bayesian attitude filters with MFDs, particularly in challenging conditions, from a theoretical viewpoint.
  Benefiting from the new understanding of the filtering mechanism associated with MFDs, two closed-form filters with MFDs is then proposed. These filters avoid the burdensome computations in previous MFD-based filters by introducing linearized error systems with right-invariant errors but retaining the two advantageous properties. Moreover, we leverage the two properties and closed-form filtering iteration to prove the almost-global exponential stability of the proposed filter with right-invariant error for the single-axis rotation, which, to our knowledge, is not achieved by existing directional statistics-based filters. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed filters are significantly more accurate than the classic invariant Kalman filter. Besides, they are also as accurate as recent MFD-based Bayesian filters in challenging circumstances with large initial error and measurement uncertainty but consumes far less computation time (about 1/5 to 1/100 of previous MFD-based attitude filters).</description>

      <title>Addressing Model Inaccuracies in Transmission Network Reconfiguration via Diverse Alternatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17865v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ongoing energy transition places significant pressure on the transmission network due to increasing shares of renewables and electrification. To mitigate grid congestion, transmission system operators need decision support tools to suggest remedial actions, such as transmission network reconfigurations or redispatch. However, these tools are prone to model inaccuracies and may not provide relevant suggestions with regard to important unmodeled constraints or operator preferences. We propose a human-in-the-loop modeling-to-generate alternatives (HITL-MGA) approach to address these shortcomings by generating diverse topology reconfiguration alternatives. Case studies on the IEEE 57-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems show the method can leverage expert feedback and improve the quality of the suggested remedial actions.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz-Based Robustness Certification for Recurrent Neural Networks via Convex Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robustness certification against bounded input noise or adversarial perturbations is increasingly important for deployment recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in safety-critical control applications. To address this challenge, we present RNN-SDP, a relaxation based method that models the RNN's layer interactions as a convex problem and computes a certified upper bound on the Lipschitz constant via semidefinite programming (SDP). We also explore an extension that incorporates known input constraints to further tighten the resulting Lipschitz bounds. RNN-SDP is evaluated on a synthetic multi-tank system, with upper bounds compared to empirical estimates. While incorporating input constraints yields only modest improvements, the general method produces reasonably tight and certifiable bounds, even as sequence length increases. The results also underscore the often underestimated impact of initialization errors, an important consideration for applications where models are frequently re-initialized, such as model predictive control (MPC).</description>

      <title>Developing a Dynamic Mobility Model for Backcasting Applications: A Case Study with Shared Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes the application of a backcasting approach to a mobility model with the aim of defining an optimal decarbonization roadmap. The selected decision variable is the introduction of a fleet of shared autonomous vehicles. The mobility model developed is composed of six interconnected sub-models. After presenting each of these models in detail, a method is introduced to analyze the direct and indirect effects of the measure, and a necessary condition for the occurrence of an undesirable effect is identified. Simulations in both forecasting and backcasting frameworks are then conducted, demonstrating the relevance of backcasting: it enables a 10% reduction in operator costs compared to forecasting results, while maintaining the same level of emissions.</description>

      <title>Frequency Switching for Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:1705.03366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new frequency switching receiver structure is proposed for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer in multi-carrier communication systems. Each subcarrier is switched to either the energy harvesting unit or the information decoding unit, according to the optimal subcarrier allocation. To implement the system, one-bit feedback is required for each subcarrier. Two optimization problems are defined, converted to binary knapsack problems, and solved using dynamic programming approaches. Upper bounds are obtained using continuous relaxations. Power allocation is integrated to further increase the performance. Numerical studies show that the proposed frequency switching based model is better than existing models in a wide range of parameters.</description>

      <title>Diversity Combining for RF Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:1705.10514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RF energy harvesting (RFEH) is a promising technology for energy requirements of wireless communication nodes. However, providing sufficient amount of energy to ensure self-sufficient devices based on RFEH may be challenging. In this paper, the use of diversity combining in RFEH systems is proposed to increase the amount of harvested energy. The power consumption of diversity combining process is also taken into account to analyze the net benefit of diversity combining. Performances of RFEH systems are investigated for selection combining (SC), equal gain combining (EGC), and maximal ratio combining (MRC) techniques. Simulations are conducted to compare the numerical results of SC, EGC, and MRC, and the results show that although the diversity combining techniques can improve the energy harvesting performance, the power consumption parameters have a critical importance while determining the suitable technique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a closed-form extension of Riccati's recursion for solving regularized LQR problems. We also show how this can be used to solve general constrained, non-convex, discrete-time optimal control problems via a regularized interior point method, while guaranteeing that each step is a descent direction of an Augmented Barrier-Lagrangian merit function. We also provide MIT-licensed implementations of our method in C++ and JAX.</description>

      <title>Robot Conga: A Leader-Follower Walking Approach to Sequential Path Following in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coordinated path following in multi-agent systems is a key challenge in robotics, with applications in automated logistics, surveillance, and collaborative exploration. Traditional formation control techniques often rely on time-parameterized trajectories and path integrals, which can result in synchronization issues and rigid behavior. In this work, we address the problem of sequential path following, where agents maintain fixed spatial separation along a common trajectory, guided by a leader under centralized control. We introduce Robot Conga, a leader-follower control strategy that updates each agent's desired state based on the leader's spatial displacement rather than time, assuming access to a global position reference, an assumption valid in indoor environments equipped with motion capture, vision-based tracking, or UWB localization systems. The algorithm was validated in simulation using both TurtleBot3 and quadruped (Laikago) robots. Results demonstrate accurate trajectory tracking, stable inter-agent spacing, and fast convergence, with all agents aligning within 250 time steps (approx. 0.25 seconds) in the quadruped case, and almost instantaneously in the TurtleBot3 implementation.</description>

      <title>Advancing Accessible Hand-Arm Vibration Safety Monitoring: ISO-Compliance with Wearable Sensors and Transfer Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Field workers are frequently exposed to hazardous vibrations, increasing the risk of Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS) and other long-term health problems. ISO 5349-1 provides guidelines for measuring vibration exposure. However, this standard was established in controlled conditions using high-quality accelerometers directly attached to power tool handles. This study investigates an alternative, wearable sensor-based data collection process and develops an error-minimization transfer function that derives values comparable to ISO benchmarks for safety monitoring. Experiments are performed with subjects hammer drilling into concrete while vibrations are measured using three accelerometers at different sampling frequencies. The transfer function maps vibration data across sensor positions by accounting for damping effects. The findings indicate a significant reduction in acceleration between the palm and upper arm, highlight the impact of sampling frequency on data accuracy, and enable accurate comparison of true hand-arm vibration levels with existing standard limits to allow accessible, real-time, and cost-effective HAVS prevention.</description>

      <title>TranTac: Leveraging Transient Tactile Signals for Contact-Rich Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation tasks such as inserting a key into a lock or plugging a USB device into a port can fail when visual perception is insufficient to detect misalignment. In these situations, touch sensing is crucial for the robot to monitor the task's states and make precise, timely adjustments. Current touch sensing solutions are either insensitive to detect subtle changes or demand excessive sensor data. Here, we introduce TranTac, a data-efficient and low-cost tactile sensing and control framework that integrates a single contact-sensitive 6-axis inertial measurement unit within the elastomeric tips of a robotic gripper for completing fine insertion tasks. Our customized sensing system can detect dynamic translational and torsional deformations at the micrometer scale, enabling the tracking of visually imperceptible pose changes of the grasped object. By leveraging transformer-based encoders and diffusion policy, TranTac can imitate human insertion behaviors using transient tactile cues detected at the gripper's tip during insertion processes. These cues enable the robot to dynamically control and correct the 6-DoF pose of the grasped object. When combined with vision, TranTac achieves an average success rate of 79% on object grasping and insertion tasks, outperforming both vision-only policy and the one augmented with end-effector 6D force/torque sensing. Contact localization performance is also validated through tactile-only misaligned insertion tasks, achieving an average success rate of 88%. We assess the generalizability by training TranTac on a single prism-slot pair and testing it on unseen data, including a USB plug and a metal key, and find that the insertion tasks can still be completed with an average success rate of nearly 70%. The proposed framework may inspire new robotic tactile sensing systems for delicate manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Reproducing a Security Risk Assessment Using Computer Aided Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Security risk assessment is essential in establishing the trustworthiness and reliability of modern systems. While various security risk assessment approaches exist, prevalent applications are "pen and paper" implementations that -- even if performed digitally using computers -- remain prone to authoring mistakes and inconsistencies. Computer-aided design approaches can transform security risk assessments into more rigorous and sustainable efforts. This is of value to both industrial practitioners and researchers, who practice security risk assessments to reflect on systems' designs and to contribute to the discipline's state-of-the-art. In this article, we report the application of a model-based security design tool to reproduce a previously reported security assessment. The main contributions are: 1) an independent attempt to reproduce a refereed article describing a real security risk assessment of a system; 2) comparison of a new computer-aided application with a previous non-computer-aided application, based on a published, real-world case study; 3) a showcase for the potential advantages -- for both practitioners and researchers -- of using computer-aided design approaches to analyze reports and to assess systems.</description>

      <title>ORN-CBF: Learning Observation-conditioned Residual Neural Control Barrier Functions via Hypernetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been demonstrated as an effective method for safety-critical control of autonomous systems. Although CBFs are simple to deploy, their design remains challenging, motivating the development of learning-based approaches. Yet, issues such as suboptimal safe sets, applicability in partially observable environments, and lack of rigorous safety guarantees persist. In this work, we propose observation-conditioned neural CBFs based on Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, which approximately recover the maximal safe sets. We exploit certain mathematical properties of the HJ value function, ensuring that the predicted safe set never intersects with the observed failure set. Moreover, we leverage a hypernetwork-based architecture that is particularly suitable for the design of observation-conditioned safety filters. The proposed method is examined both in simulation and hardware experiments for a ground robot and a quadcopter. The results show improved success rates and generalization to out-of-domain environments compared to the baselines.</description>

      <title>SMART-3D: Three-Dimensional Self-Morphing Adaptive Replanning Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents SMART-3D, an extension of the SMART algorithm to 3D environments. SMART-3D is a tree-based adaptive replanning algorithm for dynamic environments with fast moving obstacles. SMART-3D morphs the underlying tree to find a new path in real-time whenever the current path is blocked by obstacles. SMART-3D removed the grid decomposition requirement of the SMART algorithm by replacing the concept of hot-spots with that of hot-nodes, thus making it computationally efficient and scalable to 3D environments. The hot-nodes are nodes which allow for efficient reconnections to morph the existing tree to find a new safe and reliable path. The performance of SMART-3D is evaluated by extensive simulations in 2D and 3D environments populated with randomly moving dynamic obstacles. The results show that SMART-3D achieves high success rates and low replanning times, thus highlighting its suitability for real-time onboard applications.</description>

      <title>Randomized Space-Time Sampling for Affine Graph Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of dynamical sampling for graph signals influenced by a constant source term. We consider signals evolving over time according to a linear dynamical system on a graph, where both the initial state and the source term are bandlimited. We introduce two random space-time sampling regimes and analyze the conditions under which stable recovery is achievable. While our framework extends recent work on homogeneous dynamics, it addresses a fundamentally different setting where the evolution includes a constant source term. This results in a non-orthogonal-diagonalizable system matrix, rendering classical spectral techniques inapplicable and introducing new challenges in sampling design, stability analysis, and joint recovery of both the initial state and the forcing term. A key component of our analysis is the spectral graph weighted coherence, which characterizes the interplay between the sampling distribution and the graph structure. We establish sampling complexity bounds ensuring stable recovery via the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), and develop a robust recovery algorithm with provable error guarantees. The effectiveness of our method is validated through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>A Reliable Robot Motion Planner in Complex Real-world Environments via Action Imagination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans and animals can make real-time adjustments to movements by imagining their action outcomes to prevent unanticipated or even catastrophic motion failures in unknown unstructured environments. Action imagination, as a refined sensorimotor strategy, leverages perception-action loops to handle physical interaction-induced uncertainties in perception and system modeling within complex systems. Inspired by the action-awareness capability of animal intelligence, this study proposes an imagination-inspired motion planner (I-MP) framework that specifically enhances robots' action reliability by imagining plausible spatial states for approaching. After topologizing the workspace, I-MP build perception-action loop enabling robots autonomously build contact models. Leveraging fixed-point theory and Hausdorff distance, the planner computes convergent spatial states under interaction characteristics and mission constraints. By homogenously representing multi-dimensional environmental characteristics through work, the robot can approach the imagined spatial states via real-time computation of energy gradients. Consequently, experimental results demonstrate the practicality and robustness of I-MP in complex cluttered environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prevailing network control strategies, which rely on static shortest-path logic, suffer from catastrophic "stress concentration" on critical nodes. This paper introduces the System Relaxation Algorithm (SRA), a new control paradigm inspired by physical relaxation that guides a network toward an emergent equilibrium of load balance. SRA is an interpretable, 'white-box' dynamical system whose behavior is profoundly topology-dependent: in heterogeneous networks, it acts as a proactive performance optimizer, reducing peak centrality by over 80\% and increasing high-load throughput by more than 45\%; in homogeneous topologies, its objective intelligently shifts to resilience enhancement. We rigorously prove its global convergence and practical stability using the theory of non-smooth dynamical systems, establishing a predictable paradigm for network governance that intelligently trades off performance and resilience.</description>

      <title>Communication over LQG Control Systems: A Convex Optimization Approach to Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study communication over control systems, where a controller-encoder selects inputs to a dynamical system in order to simultaneously regulate the system and convey a message to an observer that has access to the system's output measurements. This setup reflects implicit communication, as the controller embeds a message in the control signal. The capacity of a control system is the maximal reliable rate of the embedded message subject to a closed-loop control-cost constraint. We focus on linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control systems, in which the dynamical system is given by a state-space model with Gaussian noise, and the control cost is a quadratic function of the system inputs and system states. Our main result is a convex optimization upper bound on the capacity of LQG systems. In the case of scalar systems, we prove that the upper bound yields the exact LQG system capacity. The upper bound also recovers all known results, including LQG control, feedback capacity of Gaussian channels with memory, and the LQG system capacity with a state-feedback. For vector LQG control systems, we provide a sufficient condition for tightness of the upper bound, based on the Riccati equation. Numerical simulations indicate the upper bound tightness in all tested examples, suggesting that the upper bound may be equal to the LQG system capacity in the vector case as well.</description>

      <title>Generalized Momenta-Based Koopman Formalism for Robust Control of Euler-Lagrangian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Koopman operator formulation for Euler Lagrangian dynamics that employs an implicit generalized momentum-based state space representation, which decouples a known linear actuation channel from state dependent dynamics and makes the system more amenable to linear Koopman modeling. By leveraging this structural separation, the proposed formulation only requires to learn the unactuated dynamics rather than the complete actuation dependent system, thereby significantly reducing the number of learnable parameters, improving data efficiency, and lowering overall model complexity. In contrast, conventional explicit formulations inherently couple inputs with the state dependent terms in a nonlinear manner, making them more suitable for bilinear Koopman models, which are more computationally expensive to train and deploy. Notably, the proposed scheme enables the formulation of linear models that achieve superior prediction performance compared to conventional bilinear models while remaining substantially more efficient. To realize this framework, we present two neural network architectures that construct Koopman embeddings from actuated or unactuated data, enabling flexible and efficient modeling across different tasks. Robustness is ensured through the integration of a linear Generalized Extended State Observer (GESO), which explicitly estimates disturbances and compensates for them in real time. The combined momentum-based Koopman and GESO framework is validated through comprehensive trajectory tracking simulations and experiments on robotic manipulators, demonstrating superior accuracy, robustness, and learning efficiency relative to state of the art alternatives.</description>

      <title>Certifiably Optimal Doppler Positioning using Opportunistic LEO Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To provide backup and augmentation to global navigation satellite system (GNSS), Doppler shift from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites can be employed as signals of opportunity (SOP) for position, navigation and timing (PNT). Since the Doppler positioning problem is non-convex, local searching methods may produce two types of estimates: a global optimum without notice or a local optimum given an inexact initial estimate. As exact initialization is unavailable in some unknown environments, a guaranteed global optimization method in no need of initialization becomes necessary. To achieve this goal, we propose a certifiably optimal LEO Doppler positioning method by utilizing convex optimization. In this paper, the certifiable positioning method is implemented through a graduated weight approximation (GWA) algorithm and semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. To guarantee the optimality, we derive the necessary conditions for optimality in ideal noiseless cases and sufficient noise bounds conditions in noisy cases. Simulation and real tests are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Specially, the real test using Iridium-NEXT satellites shows that the proposed method estimates an certifiably optimal solution with an 3D positioning error of 140 m without initial estimates while Gauss-Newton and Dog-Leg are trapped in local optima when the initial point is equal or larger than 1000 km away from the ground truth. Moreover, the certifiable estimation can also be used as initialization in local searching methods to lower down the 3D positioning error to 130 m.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving State Estimation with Crowd Sensors: An Information-Theoretic Respective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving state estimation for linear time-invariant dynamical systems with crowd sensors is considered. At any time step, the estimator has access to measurements from a randomly selected sensor from a pool of sensors with pre-specified models and noise profiles. A Luenberger-like observer is used to fuse the measurements with the underlying model of the system to recursively generate the state estimates. An additive privacy-preserving noise is used to constrain information leakage. Information leakage is measured via mutual information between the identity of the sensors and the state estimate conditioned on the actual state of the system. This captures an omnipotent adversary that not only can access state estimates but can also gather direct high-quality state measurements. Any prescribed level of information leakage is shown to be achievable by appropriately selecting the variance of the privacy-preserving noise. Therefore, privacy-utility trade-off can be fine-tuned.</description>

      <title>AERO-MPPI: Anchor-Guided Ensemble Trajectory Optimization for Agile Mapless Drone Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agile mapless navigation in cluttered 3D environments poses significant challenges for autonomous drones. Conventional mapping-planning-control pipelines incur high computational cost and propagate estimation errors. We present AERO-MPPI, a fully GPU-accelerated framework that unifies perception and planning through an anchor-guided ensemble of Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) optimizers. Specifically, we design a multi-resolution LiDAR point-cloud representation that rapidly extracts spatially distributed "anchors" as look-ahead intermediate endpoints, from which we construct polynomial trajectory guides to explore distinct homotopy path classes. At each planning step, we run multiple MPPI instances in parallel and evaluate them with a two-stage multi-objective cost that balances collision avoidance and goal reaching. Implemented entirely with NVIDIA Warp GPU kernels, AERO-MPPI achieves real-time onboard operation and mitigates the local-minima failures of single-MPPI approaches. Extensive simulations in forests, verticals, and inclines demonstrate sustained reliable flight above 7 m/s, with success rates above 80% and smoother trajectories compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Real-world experiments on a LiDAR-equipped quadrotor with NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX 16G confirm that AERO-MPPI runs in real time onboard and consistently achieves safe, agile, and robust flight in complex cluttered environments. The code will be open-sourced upon acceptance of the paper.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Safety Verification of Neural Networks via Worst-Case CVaR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of neural networks under input uncertainty is a fundamental challenge in safety-critical applications. This paper builds on and expands Fazlyab's quadratic-constraint (QC) and semidefinite-programming (SDP) framework for neural network verification to a distributionally robust and tail-risk-aware setting by integrating worst-case Conditional Value-at-Risk (WC-CVaR) over a moment-based ambiguity set with fixed mean and covariance. The resulting conditions remain SDP-checkable and explicitly account for tail risk. This integration broadens input-uncertainty geometry-covering ellipsoids, polytopes, and hyperplanes-and extends applicability to safety-critical domains where tail-event severity matters. Applications to closed-loop reachability of control systems and classification are demonstrated through numerical experiments, illustrating how the risk level $\varepsilon$ trades conservatism for tolerance to tail events-while preserving the computational structure of prior QC/SDP methods for neural network verification and robustness analysis.</description>

      <title>GPS Denied IBVS-Based Navigation and Collision Avoidance of UAV Using a Low-Cost RGB Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an image-based visual servoing (IBVS) framework for UAV navigation and collision avoidance using only an RGB camera. While UAV navigation has been extensively studied, it remains challenging to apply IBVS in missions involving multiple visual targets and collision avoidance. The proposed method achieves navigation without explicit path planning, and collision avoidance is realized through AI-based monocular depth estimation from RGB images. Unlike approaches that rely on stereo cameras or external workstations, our framework runs fully onboard a Jetson platform, ensuring a self-contained and deployable system. Experimental results validate that the UAV can navigate across multiple AprilTags and avoid obstacles effectively in GPS-denied environments.</description>

      <title>EigenSafe: A Spectral Framework for Learning-Based Stochastic Safety Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present EigenSafe, an operator-theoretic framework for learning-enabled safety-critical control for stochastic systems. In many robotic systems where dynamics are best modeled as stochastic systems due to factors such as sensing noise and environmental disturbances, it is challenging for conventional methods such as Hamilton-Jacobi reachability and control barrier functions to provide a holistic measure of safety. We derive a linear operator governing the dynamic programming principle for safety probability, and find that its dominant eigenpair provides information about safety for both individual states and the overall closed-loop system. The proposed learning framework, called EigenSafe, jointly learns this dominant eigenpair and a safe backup policy in an offline manner. The learned eigenfunction is then used to construct a safety filter that detects potentially unsafe situations and falls back to the backup policy. The framework is validated in three simulated stochastic safety-critical control tasks.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Control Interpretation of Augmented Distributed Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed optimization algorithms are used in a wide variety of problems involving complex network systems where the goal is for a set of agents in the network to solve a network-wide optimization problem via distributed update rules. In many applications, such as communication networks and power systems, transient performance of the algorithms is just as critical as convergence, as the algorithms link to physical processes which must behave well. Primal-dual algorithms have a long history in solving distributed optimization problems, with augmented Lagrangian methods leading to important classes of widely used algorithms, which have been observed in simulations to improve transient performance. Here we show that such algorithms can be seen as being the optimal solution to an appropriately formulated optimal control problem, i.e., a cost functional associated with the transient behavior of the algorithm is minimized, penalizing deviations from optimality during algorithm transients. This is shown for broad classes of algorithm dynamics, including the more involved setting where inequality constraints are present. The results presented improve our understanding of the performance of distributed optimization algorithms and can be used as a basis for improved formulations.</description>

      <title>Guided Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization for Data-driven Controller Tuning with Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a \textit{guided multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization} framework for data-efficient controller tuning that integrates corrected digital twin (DT) simulations with real-world measurements. The method targets closed-loop systems with limited-fidelity simulations or inexpensive approximations. To address model mismatch, we build a multi-fidelity surrogate with a learned correction model that refines DT estimates from real data. An adaptive cost-aware acquisition function balances expected improvement, fidelity, and sampling cost. Our method ensures adaptability as new measurements arrive. The accuracy of DTs is re-estimated, dynamically adapting both cross-source correlations and the acquisition function. This ensures that accurate DTs are used more frequently, while inaccurate DTs are appropriately downweighted. Experiments on robotic drive hardware and supporting numerical studies demonstrate that our method enhances tuning efficiency compared to standard Bayesian optimization (BO) and multi-fidelity methods.</description>

      <title>Prepare Before You Act: Learning From Humans to Rearrange Initial States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) has proven effective across a wide range of manipulation tasks. However, IL policies often struggle when faced with out-of-distribution observations; for instance, when the target object is in a previously unseen position or occluded by other objects. In these cases, extensive demonstrations are needed for current IL methods to reach robust and generalizable behaviors. But when humans are faced with these sorts of atypical initial states, we often rearrange the environment for more favorable task execution. For example, a person might rotate a coffee cup so that it is easier to grasp the handle, or push a box out of the way so they can directly grasp their target object. In this work we seek to equip robot learners with the same capability: enabling robots to prepare the environment before executing their given policy. We propose ReSET, an algorithm that takes initial states -- which are outside the policy's distribution -- and autonomously modifies object poses so that the restructured scene is similar to training data. Theoretically, we show that this two step process (rearranging the environment before rolling out the given policy) reduces the generalization gap. Practically, our ReSET algorithm combines action-agnostic human videos with task-agnostic teleoperation data to i) decide when to modify the scene, ii) predict what simplifying actions a human would take, and iii) map those predictions into robot action primitives. Comparisons with diffusion policies, VLAs, and other baselines show that using ReSET to prepare the environment enables more robust task execution with equal amounts of total training data.

      <title>HuMam: Humanoid Motion Control via End-to-End Deep Reinforcement Learning with Mamba</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) for humanoid locomotion is appealing for its compact perception-action mapping, yet practical policies often suffer from training instability, inefficient feature fusion, and high actuation cost. We present HuMam, a state-centric end-to-end RL framework that employs a single-layer Mamba encoder to fuse robot-centric states with oriented footstep targets and a continuous phase clock. The policy outputs joint position targets tracked by a low-level PD loop and is optimized with PPO. A concise six-term reward balances contact quality, swing smoothness, foot placement, posture, and body stability while implicitly promoting energy saving. On the JVRC-1 humanoid in mc-mujoco, HuMam consistently improves learning efficiency, training stability, and overall task performance over a strong feedforward baseline, while reducing power consumption and torque peaks. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end humanoid RL controller that adopts Mamba as the fusion backbone, demonstrating tangible gains in efficiency, stability, and control economy.</description>

Abstract: A two-layer control architecture is proposed, which promotes scalable implementations for model predictive controllers. The top layer acts as both reference governor for the bottom layer, and as a feedback controller for the regulated network. By employing set-based methods, global theoretical guarantees are obtained by enforcing local constraints upon the network's variables and upon those of the first layer's implementation. The proposed technique offers recursive feasibility guarantees as one of its central features, and the expressions of the resulting predictive strategies bear a striking resemblance to classical formulations from model predictive control literature, allowing for flexible and easily customizable implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we exploit a diagonally dominant structure for the decentralized stabilization of unknown nonlinear time-delayed networks. To this end, we first introduce a novel generalization of virtual contraction analysis to diagonally dominant time-delayed control systems. We then show that nonlinear time-delayed networks can be stabilized using diagonal high-gains, provided that the input matrices satisfy certain generalized (column/row) diagonally dominant conditions. To enable stabilization of unknown networks, we further propose a distributed adaptive tuning rule for each individual gain function, guaranteeing that all closed-loop trajectories converge to the origin while the gains converge to finite values. The effectiveness of the proposed decentralized adaptive control is illustrated through a case study on epidemic spreading control in SIS networks with transmission delays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21461v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate frequency estimation is critical for the control, monitoring and protection of electrical power systems, in particular, of systems with a high penetration of power electronics. This paper introduces the novel concept of Quasi Steady-State (QSS) frequency as a quantity that fills the gap between stationary and instantaneous frequency. QSS frequency coincides with the fundamental frequency of an AC voltage in any stationary conditions, including unbalanced and non-sinusoidal, and is able to capture the time-varying fundamental frequency in transient conditions. The paper also proposes a metric borrowed from fluid dynamics, namely, the time derivative of the circulation, to define the scope of validity of the QSS frequency. Analytical examples as well as a case study based on a fully-fledged EMT model of the IEEE 39-bus system serve to illustrate, respectively, the properties of the QSS frequency and its behavior in transient conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proposes a distributed control method for matrix-scaled multi-agent networks aimed at achieving convergence within a user-defined time frame. The control law of each individual agent relies only on information from neighboring agents and is updated at discrete intervals determined by state-dependent triggering functions, reducing the frequency of agent interactions. To this end, first, the controller is augmented with a time-varying gain. Then, the dynamics of the closed-loop system over the finite-time interval is transformed into an infinite-time frame using time scaling. Lyapunov-based analysis is employed to derive suitable triggering conditions that guarantee the asymptotic convergence of the time-transformed system, thereby ensuring the prescribed-time convergence of the original system.</description>

Abstract: The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for reliable and energy-efficient data collection from spatially distributed devices holds great promise in supporting diverse Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Nevertheless, the limited endurance and communication range of UAVs necessitate intelligent trajectory planning. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been extensively explored for UAV trajectory optimization, its interactive nature entails high costs and risks in real-world environments. Offline RL mitigates these issues but remains susceptible to unstable training and heavily rely on expert-quality datasets. To address these challenges, we formulate a joint UAV trajectory planning and resource allocation problem to maximize energy efficiency of data collection. The resource allocation subproblem is first transformed into an equivalent linear programming formulation and solved optimally with polynomial-time complexity. Then, we propose a large language model (LLM)-empowered critic-regularized decision transformer (DT) framework, termed LLM-CRDT, to learn effective UAV control policies. In LLM-CRDT, we incorporate critic networks to regularize the DT model training, thereby integrating the sequence modeling capabilities of DT with critic-based value guidance to enable learning effective policies from suboptimal datasets. Furthermore, to mitigate the data-hungry nature of transformer models, we employ a pre-trained LLM as the transformer backbone of the DT model and adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, i.e., LoRA, enabling rapid adaptation to UAV control tasks with small-scale dataset and low computational overhead. Extensive simulations demonstrate that LLM-CRDT outperforms benchmark online and offline RL methods, achieving up to 36.7\% higher energy efficiency than the current state-of-the-art DT approaches.</description>

      <title>On-Policy Reinforcement-Learning Control for Optimal Energy Sharing and Temperature Regulation in District Heating Systems</title>

Abstract: We address the problem of temperature regulation and optimal energy sharing in district heating systems (DHSs) where the demand and system parameters are unknown. We propose a temperature regulation scheme that employs data-driven on-policy updates that achieve these objectives. In particular, we show that the proposed control scheme converges to an optimal equilibrium point of the system, while also having guaranteed convergence to an optimal LQR control policy, thus providing good transient performance. The efficiency of our approach is also demonstrated through extensive simulations.</description>

      <title>Randomness in appendage coordination facilitates strenuous ground self-righting</title>

Abstract: Randomness is common in biological and artificial systems, resulting either from stochasticity of the environment or noise in organisms or devices themselves. In locomotor control, randomness is typically considered a nuisance. For example, during dynamic walking, randomness in stochastic terrain leads to metastable dynamics, which must be mitigated to stabilize the system around limit cycles. Here, we studied whether randomness in motion is beneficial for strenuous locomotor tasks. Our study used robotic simulation modeling of strenuous, leg-assisted, winged ground self-righting observed in cockroaches, in which unusually large randomness in wing and leg motions is present. We developed a simplified simulation robot capable of generating similar self-righting behavior and varied the randomness level in wing-leg coordination. During each wing opening attempt, the more randomness added to the time delay between wing opening and leg swinging, the more likely it was for the naive robot (which did not know what coordination is best) to self-right within a finite time. Wing-leg coordination, measured by the phase between wing and leg oscillations, had a crucial impact on self-righting outcome. Without randomness, periodic wing and leg oscillations often limited the system to visit a few bad phases, leading to failure to escape from the metastable state. With randomness, the system explored phases thoroughly and had a better chance of encountering good phases to self-right. Our study complements previous work by demonstrating that randomness helps destabilize locomotor systems from being trapped in undesired metastable states, a situation common in strenuous locomotion.</description>

      <title>Shape-induced obstacle attraction and repulsion during dynamic locomotion</title>

Abstract: Robots still struggle to dynamically traverse complex 3-D terrain with many large obstacles, an ability required for many critical applications. Body-obstacle interaction is often inevitable and induces perturbation and uncertainty in motion that challenges closed-form dynamic modeling. Here, inspired by recent discovery of a terradynamic streamlined shape, we studied how two body shapes interacting with obstacles affect turning and pitching motions of an open-loop multi-legged robot and cockroaches during dynamic locomotion. With a common cuboidal body, the robot was attracted towards obstacles, resulting in pitching up and flipping-over. By contrast, with an elliptical body, the robot was repelled by obstacles and readily traversed. The animal displayed qualitatively similar turning and pitching motions induced by these two body shapes. However, unlike the cuboidal robot, the cuboidal animal was capable of escaping obstacle attraction and subsequent high pitching and flipping over, which inspired us to develop an empirical pitch-and-turn strategy for cuboidal robots. Considering the similarity of our self-propelled body-obstacle interaction with part-feeder interaction in robotic part manipulation, we developed a quasi-static potential energy landscape model to explain the dependence of dynamic locomotion on body shape. Our experimental and modeling results also demonstrated that obstacle attraction or repulsion is an inherent property of locomotor body shape and insensitive to obstacle geometry and size. Our study expanded the concept and usefulness of terradynamic shapes for passive control of robot locomotion to traverse large obstacles using physical interaction. Our study is also a step in establishing an energy landscape approach to locomotor transitions.</description>

      <title>Locomotor transitions in the potential energy landscape-dominated regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.10685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To traverse complex three-dimensional terrainwith large obstacles, animals and robots must transition across different modes. However, the most mechanistic understanding of terrestrial locomotion concerns how to generate and stabilize near-steady-state, single-mode locomotion (e.g. walk, run). We know little about how to use physical interaction to make robust locomotor transitions. Here, we review our progress towards filling this gap by discovering terradynamic principles of multi-legged locomotor transitions, using simplified model systems representing distinct challenges in complex three-dimensional terrain. Remarkably, general physical principles emerge across diverse model systems, by modelling locomotor-terrain interaction using a potential energy landscape approach. The animal and robots' stereotyped locomotor modes are constrained by physical interaction. Locomotor transitions are stochastic, destabilizing, barrier-crossing transitions on the landscape. They can be induced by feed-forward self-propulsion and are facilitated by feedbackcontrolled active adjustment. General physical principles and strategies from our systematic studies already advanced robot performance in simple model systems. Efforts remain to better understand the intelligence aspect of locomotor transitions and how to compose larger-scale potential energy landscapes of complex three-dimensional terrains from simple landscapes of abstracted challenges. This will elucidate how the neuromechanical control system mediates physical interaction to generate multi-pathway locomotor transitions and lead to advancements in biology, physics, robotics and dynamical systems theory.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning with Policy Gradient Based Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.14125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many engineering problems have multiple objectives, and the overall aim is to optimize a non-linear function of these objectives. In this paper, we formulate the problem of maximizing a non-linear concave function of multiple long-term objectives. A policy-gradient based model-free algorithm is proposed for the problem. To compute an estimate of the gradient, a biased estimator is proposed. The proposed algorithm is shown to achieve convergence to within an $\epsilon$ of the global optima after sampling $\mathcal{O}(\frac{M^4\sigma^2}{(1-\gamma)^8\epsilon^4})$ trajectories where $\gamma$ is the discount factor and $M$ is the number of the agents, thus achieving the same dependence on $\epsilon$ as the policy gradient algorithm for the standard reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>On the Uniqueness of Participation Factors in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the modal analysis and control of nonlinear dynamical systems, the participation factors of state variables with respect to a critical or selected mode serve as a pivotal tool for simplifying stability studies by focusing on a subset of highly influential state variables. For linear systems, the participation factors of state variables regarding a mode are uniquely determined by the mode's composition and shape, defined by the system's left and right eigenvectors, respectively. However, the uniqueness of other types of participation factors necessitates further investigation. This paper establishes a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of nonlinear participation factors and five other variants of participation factors, accounting for uncertain scaling factors in a mode's shape and composition. These scaling factors arise from variations in the selection of physical units or the value ranges of state variables when analyzing and controlling real-world dynamical systems. Understanding the sufficient condition of the uniqueness is therefore crucial for the correct application of participation factors in practical scenarios. Additionally, the paper explores the relationship between perturbation magnitudes in state variables and the selection of optimal scaling factors.</description>

      <title>Equality Constrained Diffusion for Direct Trajectory Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent success of diffusion-based generative models in image and natural language processing has ignited interest in diffusion-based trajectory optimization for nonlinear control systems. Existing methods cannot, however, handle the nonlinear equality constraints necessary for direct trajectory optimization. As a result, diffusion-based trajectory optimizers are currently limited to shooting methods, where the nonlinear dynamics are enforced by forward rollouts. This precludes many of the benefits enjoyed by direct methods, including flexible state constraints, reduced numerical sensitivity, and easy initial guess specification. In this paper, we present a method for diffusion-based optimization with equality constraints. This allows us to perform direct trajectory optimization, enforcing dynamic feasibility with constraints rather than rollouts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first diffusion-based optimization algorithm that supports the general nonlinear equality constraints required for direct trajectory optimization.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Federated Learning: A Scalable Approach for Decentralized Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17723v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for decentralized machine learning, enabling collaborative model training across diverse clients without sharing raw data. However, traditional FL approaches often face limitations in scalability and efficiency due to their reliance on synchronous client updates, which can result in significant delays and increased communication overhead, particularly in heterogeneous and dynamic environments. To address these challenges in this paper, we propose an Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) algorithm, which allows clients to update the global model independently and asynchronously. Our key contributions include a comprehensive convergence analysis of AFL in the presence of client delays and model staleness. By leveraging martingale difference sequence theory and variance bounds, we ensure robust convergence despite asynchronous updates. Assuming strongly convex local objective functions, we establish bounds on gradient variance under random client sampling and derive a recursion formula quantifying the impact of client delays on convergence. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical applicability of the AFL algorithm by training decentralized linear regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifiers and compare its results with synchronous FL algorithm to effectively handling non-IID data distributed among clients. The proposed AFL algorithm addresses key limitations of traditional FL methods, such as inefficiency due to global synchronization and susceptibility to client drift. It enhances scalability, robustness, and efficiency in real-world settings with heterogeneous client populations and dynamic network conditions. Our results underscore the potential of AFL to drive advancements indistributed learning systems, particularly for large-scale, privacy-preserving applications in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>RGBSQGrasp: Inferring Local Superquadric Primitives from Single RGB Image for Graspability-Aware Bin Picking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bin picking is a challenging robotic task due to occlusions and physical constraints that limit visual information for object recognition and grasping. Existing approaches often rely on known CAD models or prior object geometries, restricting generalization to novel or unknown objects. Other methods directly regress grasp poses from RGB-D data without object priors, but the inherent noise in depth sensing and the lack of object understanding make grasp synthesis and evaluation more difficult. Superquadrics (SQ) offer a compact, interpretable shape representation that captures the physical and graspability understanding of objects. However, recovering them from limited viewpoints is challenging, as existing methods rely on multiple perspectives for near-complete point cloud reconstruction, limiting their effectiveness in bin-picking. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{RGBSQGrasp}, a grasping framework that leverages superquadric shape primitives and foundation metric depth estimation models to infer grasp poses from a monocular RGB camera -- eliminating the need for depth sensors. Our framework integrates a universal, cross-platform dataset generation pipeline, a foundation model-based object point cloud estimation module, a global-local superquadric fitting network, and an SQ-guided grasp pose sampling module. By integrating these components, RGBSQGrasp reliably infers grasp poses through geometric reasoning, enhancing grasp stability and adaptability to unseen objects. Real-world robotic experiments demonstrate a 92\% grasp success rate, highlighting the effectiveness of RGBSQGrasp in packed bin-picking environments.</description>

      <title>Robotic Trail Maker Platform for Rehabilitation in Neurological Conditions: Clinical Use Cases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19230v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Patients with neurological conditions require rehabilitation to restore their motor, visual, and cognitive abilities. To meet the shortage of therapists and reduce their workload, a robotic rehabilitation platform involving the clinical trail making test is proposed. Therapists can create custom trails for each patient and the patient can trace the trails using a robotic device. The platform can track the performance of the patient and use these data to provide dynamic assistance through the robot to the patient interface. Therefore, the proposed platform not only functions as an evaluation platform, but also trains the patient in recovery. The developed platform has been validated at a rehabilitation center, with therapists and patients operating the device. It was found that patients performed poorly while using the platform compared to healthy subjects and that the assistance provided also improved performance amongst patients. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the speed of the patients was significantly enhanced with the robotic assistance. Further, neural networks are trained to classify between patients and healthy subjects and to forecast their movements using the data collected.</description>

      <title>Rapid and Safe Trajectory Planning over Diverse Scenes through Diffusion Composition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safe trajectory planning in complex environments must balance stringent collision avoidance with real-time efficiency, which is a long-standing challenge in robotics. In this work, we present a diffusion-based trajectory planning framework that is both rapid and safe. First, we introduce a scene-agnostic, MPC-based data generation pipeline that efficiently produces large volumes of kinematically feasible trajectories. Building on this dataset, our integrated diffusion planner maps raw onboard sensor inputs directly to kinematically feasible trajectories, enabling efficient inference while maintaining strong collision avoidance. To generalize to diverse, previously unseen scenarios, we compose diffusion models at test time, enabling safe behavior without additional training. We further propose a lightweight, rule-based safety filter that, from the candidate set, selects the trajectory meeting safety and kinematic-feasibility requirements. Across seen and unseen settings, the proposed method delivers real-time-capable inference with high safety and stability. Experiments on an F1TENTH vehicle demonstrate practicality on real hardware.

      <title>Improving Drone Racing Performance Through Iterative Learning MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous drone racing presents a challenging control problem, requiring real-time decision-making and robust handling of nonlinear system dynamics. While iterative learning model predictive control (LMPC) offers a promising framework for iterative performance improvement, its direct application to drone racing faces challenges like real-time compatibility or the trade-off between time-optimal and safe traversal. In this paper, we enhance LMPC with three key innovations: (1) an adaptive cost function that dynamically weights time-optimal tracking against centerline adherence, (2) a shifted local safe set to prevent excessive shortcutting and enable more robust iterative updates, and (3) a Cartesian-based formulation that accommodates safety constraints without the singularities or integration errors associated with Frenet-frame transformations. Results from extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our improved algorithm can optimize initial trajectories generated by a wide range of controllers with varying levels of tuning for a maximum improvement in lap time by 60.85%. Even applied to the most aggressively tuned state-of-the-art model-based controller, MPCC++, on a real drone, a 6.05% improvement is still achieved. Overall, the proposed method pushes the drone toward faster traversal and avoids collisions in simulation and real-world experiments, making it a practical solution to improve the peak performance of drone racing.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Microgrid Composition for Sustainable Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04284</link>

Abstract: As computing energy demand continues to grow and electrical grid infrastructure struggles to keep pace, an increasing number of data centers are being planned with colocated microgrids that integrate on-site renewable generation and energy storage. However, while existing research has examined the tradeoffs between operational and embodied carbon emissions in the context of renewable energy certificates, there is a lack of tools to assess how the sizing and composition of microgrid components affects long-term sustainability and power reliability.
  In this paper, we present a novel optimization framework that extends the computing and energy system co-simulator Vessim with detailed renewable energy generation models from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) System Advisor Model (SAM). Our framework simulates the interaction between computing workloads, on-site renewable production, and energy storage, capturing both operational and embodied emissions. We use a multi-horizon black-box optimization to explore efficient microgrid compositions and enable operators to make more informed decisions when planning energy systems for data centers.</description>

      <title>Handling Infinite Domain Parameters in Planning Through Best-First Search with Delayed Partial Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In automated planning, control parameters extend standard action representations through the introduction of continuous numeric decision variables. Existing state-of-the-art approaches have primarily handled control parameters as embedded constraints alongside other temporal and numeric restrictions, and thus have implicitly treated them as additional constraints rather than as decision points in the search space. In this paper, we propose an efficient alternative that explicitly handles control parameters as true decision points within a systematic search scheme. We develop a best-first, heuristic search algorithm that operates over infinite decision spaces defined by control parameters and prove a notion of completeness in the limit under certain conditions. Our algorithm leverages the concept of delayed partial expansion, where a state is not fully expanded but instead incrementally expands a subset of its successors. Our results demonstrate that this novel search algorithm is a competitive alternative to existing approaches for solving planning problems involving control parameters.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Bounds and Task-Centric Learning Complexity for Real-World Dynamic Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic nonlinear systems exhibit distortions arising from coupled static and dynamic effects. Their intertwined nature poses major challenges for data-driven modeling. This paper presents a theoretical framework grounded in structured decomposition, variance analysis, and task-centric complexity bounds.
  The framework employs a directional lower bound on interactions between measurable system components, extending orthogonality in inner product spaces to structurally asymmetric settings. This bound supports variance inequalities for decomposed systems. Key behavioral indicators are introduced along with a memory finiteness index. A rigorous power-based condition establishes a measurable link between finite memory in realizable systems and the First Law of Thermodynamics. This offers a more foundational perspective than classical bounds based on the Second Law.
  Building on this foundation, we formulate a `Behavioral Uncertainty Principle,' demonstrating that static and dynamic distortions cannot be minimized simultaneously. We identify that real-world systems seem to resist complete deterministic decomposition due to entangled static and dynamic effects. We also present two general-purpose theorems linking function variance to mean-squared Lipschitz continuity and learning complexity. This yields a model-agnostic, task-aware complexity metric, showing that lower-variance components are inherently easier to learn.
  These insights explain the empirical benefits of structured residual learning, including improved generalization, reduced parameter count, and lower training cost, as previously observed in power amplifier linearization experiments. The framework is broadly applicable and offers a scalable, theoretically grounded approach to modeling complex dynamic nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Stabilising Lifetime PD Models under Forecast Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating lifetime probabilities of default (PDs) under IFRS~9 and CECL requires projecting point--in--time transition matrices over multiple years. A persistent weakness is that macroeconomic forecast errors compound across horizons, producing unstable and volatile PD term structures. This paper reformulates the problem in a state--space framework and shows that a direct Kalman filter leaves non--vanishing variability. We then introduce an anchored observation model, which incorporates a neutral long--run economic state into the filter. The resulting error dynamics exhibit asymptotic stochastic stability, ensuring convergence in probability of the lifetime PD term structure. Simulation on a synthetic corporate portfolio confirms that anchoring reduces forecast noise and delivers smoother, more interpretable projections.</description>

      <title>Online Slip Detection and Friction Coefficient Estimation for Autonomous Racing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate knowledge of the tire-road friction coefficient (TRFC) is essential for vehicle safety, stability, and performance, especially in autonomous racing, where vehicles often operate at the friction limit. However, TRFC cannot be directly measured with standard sensors, and existing estimation methods either depend on vehicle or tire models with uncertain parameters or require large training datasets. In this paper, we present a lightweight approach for online slip detection and TRFC estimation. Our approach relies solely on IMU and LiDAR measurements and the control actions, without special dynamical or tire models, parameter identification, or training data. Slip events are detected in real time by comparing commanded and measured motions, and the TRFC is then estimated directly from observed accelerations under no-slip conditions. Experiments with a 1:10-scale autonomous racing car across different friction levels demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves accurate and consistent slip detections and friction coefficients, with results closely matching ground-truth measurements. These findings highlight the potential of our simple, deployable, and computationally efficient approach for real-time slip monitoring and friction coefficient estimation in autonomous driving.</description>
