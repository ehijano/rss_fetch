      <title>Efficient Beamforming Optimization for STAR-RIS-Assisted Communications: A Gradient-Based Meta Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) has emerged as a promising technology to realize full-space coverage and boost spectral efficiency in next-generation wireless networks. Yet, the joint design of the base station precoding matrix as well as the STAR-RIS transmission and reflection coefficient matrices leads to a high-dimensional, strongly nonconvex, and NP-hard optimization problem. Conventional alternating optimization (AO) schemes typically involve repeated large-scale matrix inversion operations, resulting in high computational complexity and poor scalability, while existing deep learning approaches often rely on expensive pre-training and large network models. In this paper, we develop a gradient-based meta learning (GML) framework that directly feeds optimization gradients into lightweight neural networks, thereby removing the need for pre-training and enabling fast adaptation. Specifically, we design dedicated GML-based schemes for both independent-phase and coupled-phase STAR-RIS models, effectively handling their respective amplitude and phase constraints while achieving weighted sum-rate performance very close to that of AO-based benchmarks. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, for both phase models, the proposed methods substantially reduce computational overhead, with complexity growing nearly linearly when the number of BS antennas and STAR-RIS elements grows, and yielding up to 10 times runtime speedup over AO, which confirms the scalability and practicality of the proposed GML method for large-scale STAR-RIS-assisted communications.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Surrogate for Fast CIR Prediction in Reactive Molecular Diffusion Advection Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate channel impulse response (CIR) modeling in molecular communication (MC) often requires solving coupled reactive diffusion-advection equations, which is computationally expensive for large parameter sweeps or design loops. We develop a deep-learning surrogate for a three-dimensional duct MC channel with reactive diffusion-advection transport and reversible ligand-receptor binding on a finite ring receiver. Using a physics-based partial differential equation (PDE)-ordinary differential equation (ODE) model, we generate a large CIR dataset across broad transport, reaction, and geometric ranges and train a neural network that maps these parameters directly to the CIR. On an independent test set, the surrogate closely matches reference CIRs both qualitatively and quantitatively: the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) shows that 90% of test channels are predicted with error below 0.15, with only weak dependence on individual parameters. The surrogate therefore offers an accurate and computationally efficient replacement for repeated PDE-based CIR evaluations in MC system analysis and design.</description>

      <title>Robust Beamforming for Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna system (PASS) mitigates large-scale path loss by enabling flexible placement of pinching antennas (PAs) along the dielectric waveguide. However, most existing studies assume perfect channel state information (CSI), overlooking the impact of channel uncertainty. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a robust beamforming framework for both lossy and lossless waveguides. For baseband beamforming, the lossy case yields an second-order cone programming-based solution, while the lossless case admits a closed-form solution via maximum ratio transmission. The PAs' positions in both cases are optimized through the Gauss-Seidel-based method. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate that PASS exhibits superior robustness against channel uncertainty compared with conventional fixed-antenna systems. Notably, its worst-case achievable rate can even exceed the fixed-antenna baseline under perfect CSI.</description>

      <title>AI Assisted Next Gen Outdoor Optical Networks: Camera Sensing for Monitoring and User Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider outdoor optical access points (OAPs), which, enabled by recent advances in metasurface technology, have attracted growing interest. While OAPs promise high data rates and strong physical-layer security, practical deployments still expose vulnerabilities and misuse patterns that necessitate a dedicated monitoring layer - the focus of this work. We therefore propose a user positioning and monitoring system that infers locations from spatial intensity measurements on a photodetector (PD) array. Specifically, our hybrid approach couples an optics-informed forward model and sparse, model-based inversion with a lightweight data-driven calibration stage, yielding high accuracy at low computational cost. This design preserves the interpretability and stability of model-based reconstruction while leveraging learning to absorb residual nonidealities and device-specific distortions. Under identical hardware and training conditions (both with 5 x 10^5 samples), the hybrid method attains consistently lower mean-squared error than a generic deep-learning baseline while using substantially less training time and compute. Accuracy improves with array resolution and saturates around 60 x 60-80 x 80, indicating a favorable accuracy-complexity trade-off for real-time deployment. The resulting position estimates can be cross-checked with real-time network logs to enable continuous monitoring, anomaly detection (e.g., potential eavesdropping), and access control in outdoor optical access networks.</description>

      <title>CV Quantum Communications with Angular Rejection Filtering: Modeling and Security Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) over free-space optical links is a promising approach for secure communication, but its performance is limited by turbulence, pointing errors, and angular leakage that can be exploited by an eavesdropper. To mitigate this, we consider an angular rejection filter that defines a safe-zone at the receiver and blocks signals from outside the desired cone. A system and channel model is developed including turbulence, misalignment, and safe-zone effects, and information theoretic metrics are derived to evaluate security. Simulation results show that the safe zone significantly reduces information leakage and that careful tuning of beam waist, angular threshold, and aperture size is essential for maximizing the secret key rate. Larger apertures improve performance but increase receiver size, while longer links require sub 100 urad alignment accuracy. These results highlight safe-zone enforcement and parameter optimization as effective strategies for practical and secure CV-QKD.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Signal Reconstruction for Amplitude-Phase-Time Block Modulation-based Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operating power amplifiers (PAs) at lower input back-off (IBO) levels is an effective way to improve PA efficiency, but often introduces severe nonlinear distortion that degrades transmission performance. Amplitude-phase-time block modulation (APTBM) has recently emerged as an effective solution to this problem. By leveraging the intrinsic amplitude and phase constraints of each APTBM block, PA-induced nonlinear distortion can be mitigated through constraint-guided signal reconstruction. However, existing reconstruction methods apply these constraints only heuristically and statistically, limiting the achievable IBO reduction and PA efficiency improvement. This paper addresses this limitation by decomposing the nonlinear distortion into dominant and residual components, and accordingly develops a novel two-stage signal reconstruction algorithm consisting of coarse and fine reconstruction stages. The coarse reconstruction stage eliminates the dominant distortion by jointly exploiting the APTBM block structure and PA nonlinear characteristics. The fine reconstruction stage minimizes the residual distortion by formulating a nonconvex optimization problem that explicitly enforces the APTBM constraints. To handle this problem efficiently, a low-complexity iterative variable substitution method is introduced, which relaxes the problem into a sequence of trust-region subproblems, each solvable in closed form. The proposed algorithm is validated through comprehensive numerical simulations and testbed experiments. Results show that it achieves up to 4 dB IBO reduction in simulations and up to 2 dB IBO reduction in experiments while maintaining transmission performance, corresponding to PA efficiency improvements of 59.1\% and 33.9\%, respectively, over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Inference based Feature Pyramid Network for Sentimental Analysis using EEG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sentiment analysis using Electroencephalography (EEG) sensor signals provides a deeper behavioral understanding of a person's emotional state, offering insights into real-time mood fluctuations. This approach takes advantage of brain electrical activity, making it a promising tool for various applications, including mental health monitoring, affective computing, and personalised user experiences. An encoder-based model for EEG-to-sentiment analysis, utilizing the ZUCO 2.0 dataset and incorporating a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), is proposed to enhance this process. FPNs are adapted here for EEG sensor data, enabling multiscale feature extraction to capture local and global sentiment-related patterns. The raw EEG sensor data from the ZUCO 2.0 dataset is pre-processed and passed through the FPN, which extracts hierarchical features. In addition, extracted features are passed to a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model temporal dependencies, thereby enhancing the accuracy of sentiment classification. The ZUCO 2.0 dataset is utilized for its clear and detailed representation in 128 channels, offering rich spatial and temporal resolution. The experimental metric results show that the proposed architecture achieves a 6.88\% performance gain compared to the existing methods. Furthermore, the proposed framework demonstrated its efficacy on the validation datasets DEAP and SEED.</description>

      <title>RIS-Aided Spatial Nulling: Algorithms, Analysis, and Nulling Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have recently gained attention as a means to dynamically shape the wireless propagation environment through programmable reflection control. Among the numerous applications, an important emerging use case is employing RIS as an auxiliary mechanism for spatial interference nulling, particularly in large ground-based reflector antennas where sidelobe interference can significantly degrade the system performance. With the growing density of satellites and terrestrial emitters, algorithms with faster convergence speed and better performance are needed. This work investigates RIS-equipped reflector antennas as a representative example of RIS-assisted spatial nulling and develop algorithms for sidelobe cancellation at specific directions and frequencies under various constraints. For the continuous-phase case, we adapt the gradient projection (GP) and alternating projection (AP) algorithms for scalability and propose a closed-form near-optimal solution that achieves satisfactory nulling performance with significantly reduced complexity. For the discrete-phase case, we reformulate the problem using a penalty method and solve it via majorization-minimization, outperforming the heuristic methods from our earlier work. Further, we analyze the electric field characteristics across multiple interference directions and frequencies to quantify the nulling capability of the RIS-aided reflectors, and identify a simple criterion for the existence of unimodular weights enabling perfect nulls. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and confirm the theoretical nulling limits.</description>

      <title>On the Limits of Coherent Time-Domain Cancellation of Radio Frequency Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many sensing (viz., radio astronomy) and radar applications, the received signal of interest (SOI) exhibits a significantly wider bandwidth or weaker power than the interference signal, rendering it indistinguishable from the background noise. Such scenarios arise frequently in applications such as passive radar, cognitive radio, low-probability-of-intercept (LPI) radar, and planetary radar for radio astronomy, where canceling the radio frequency interference (RFI) is critical for uncovering the SOI. In this work, we examine the Demodulation-Remodulation (Demod-Remod) based interference cancellation framework for the RFI. This approach demodulates the unknown interference, creates a noise-free interference replica, and coherently subtracts it from the received signal. To evaluate the performance limits, we employ the performance metric termed \textit{interference rejection ratio} (IRR), which quantifies the interference canceled. We derive the analytical expressions of IRR as a function of the optimal estimation variances of the signal parameters. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the analytical expression for both single-carrier and multi-carrier interference signals and demonstrate that the method can substantially suppress the interference at a sufficient interference-to-noise ratio (INR), enabling enhanced detection and extraction of the SOI. We further extend the analysis to the scenario where the SOI is above the noise floor, and confirm the validity of the theoretical IRR expression in this scenario. Lastly, we compare the Demod-Remod technique to other time-domain cancellation methods. The result of the comparison identifies the conditions under which each method is preferred, offering practical guidelines for interference mitigation under different scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Choice of Line Lengths in Multiline Thru-Reflect-Line Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis and rigorous procedure for determining the optimal lengths of line standards in multiline thru-reflect-line (TRL) calibration of vector network analyzers (VNAs). The solution is obtained through nonlinear constrained optimization of the eigenvalue problem in multiline TRL calibration. Additionally, we propose a simplified approach for near-optimal length selection based on predefined sparse rulers. Alongside the length calculation, we discuss the required number of lines to meet bandwidth requirements. The sensitivity of the proposed procedure is evaluated numerically via Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating that the derived lengths have lower uncertainty than those from existing industry standards. Practical examples are provided for various applications, including lossy and dispersive lines, as well as banded solutions for waveguides.</description>

      <title>Multi-Waveguide Pinching Antenna Placement Optimization for Rate Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching antenna systems (PASS) have emerged as a technology that enables the large-scale movement of antenna elements, offering significant potential for performance gains in next-generation wireless networks. This paper investigates the problem of maximizing the average per-user data rate by optimizing the antenna placement of a multi-waveguide PASS, subject to a stringent physical minimum spacing constraint. To address this complex challenge, which involves a coupled fractional objective and a non-convex constraint, we employ the fractional programming (FP) framework to transform the non-convex rate maximization problem into a more tractable one, and devise a projected gradient ascent (PGA)-based algorithm to iteratively solve the transformed problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme significantly outperforms various geometric placement baselines, achieving superior per-user data rates by actively mitigating multi-user interference.</description>

      <title>DeepGuard: Defending Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding Against Eavesdropping at Physical-Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for efficient and robust information transmission. However, its intrinsic characteristics also pose new security challenges, notably an increased vulnerability to eavesdropping attacks. Existing studies on defending against eavesdropping attacks in DeepJSCC, while demonstrating certain effectiveness, often incur considerable computational overhead or introduce performance trade-offs that may adversely affect legitimate users. In this paper, we present DeepGuard, to the best of our knowledge, the first physical-layer defense framework for DeepJSCC against eavesdropping attacks, validated through over-the-air experiments using software-defined radios (SDRs). Considering that existing eavesdropping attacks against DeepJSCC are limited to simulation under ideal channels, we take a step further by identifying and implementing four representative types of attacks under various configurations in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems. These attacks are evaluated over-the-air under diverse scenarios, allowing us to comprehensively characterize the real-world threat landscape. To mitigate these threats, DeepGuard introduces a novel preamble perturbation mechanism that modifies the preamble shared only between legitimate transceivers. To realize it, we first conduct a theoretical analysis of the perturbation's impact on the signals intercepted by the eavesdropper. Building upon this, we develop an end-to-end perturbation optimization algorithm that significantly degrades eavesdropping performance while preserving reliable communication for legitimate users. We prototype DeepGuard using SDRs and conduct extensive over-the-air experiments in practical scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeepGuard effectively mitigates eavesdropping threats.</description>

      <title>Decentralized GNSS at Global Scale via Graph-Aware Diffusion Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18773v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network-based Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) underpin critical infrastructure and autonomous systems, yet typically rely on centralized processing hubs that limit scalability, resilience, and latency. Here we report a global-scale, decentralized GNSS architecture spanning hundreds of ground stations. By modeling the receiver network as a time-varying graph, we employ a deep linear neural network approach to learn topology-aware mixing schedules that optimize information exchange. This enables a gradient tracking diffusion strategy wherein stations execute local inference and exchange succinct messages to achieve two concurrent objectives: centimeter-level self-localization and network-wide consensus on satellite correction products. The consensus products are broadcast to user receivers as corrections, supporting precise point positioning (PPP) and precise point positioning-real-time kinematic (PPP-RTK). Numerical results demonstrate that our method matches the accuracy of centralized baselines while significantly outperforming existing decentralized methods in convergence speed and communication overhead. By reframing decentralized GNSS as a networked signal processing problem, our results pave the way for integrating decentralized optimization, consensus-based inference, and graph-aware learning as effective tools in operational satellite navigation.</description>

      <title>Domain Adaptation in Structural Health Monitoring of Civil Infrastructure: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive review of domain adaptation (DA) techniques in vibration-based structural health monitoring (SHM). As data-driven models increasingly support the assessment of civil structures, the persistent challenge of transferring knowledge across varying geometries, materials, and environmental conditions remains a major obstacle. DA offers a systematic approach to mitigate these discrepancies by aligning feature distributions between simulated, laboratory, and field domains while preserving the sensitivity of damage-related information. Drawing on more than sixty representative studies, this paper analyzes the evolution of DA methods for SHM, including statistical alignment, adversarial and subdomain learning, physics-informed adaptation, and generative modeling for simulation-to-real transfer. The review summarizes their contributions and limitations across bridge and building applications, revealing that while DA has improved generalization significantly, key challenges persist: managing domain discrepancy, addressing data scarcity, enhancing model interpretability, and enabling adaptability to multiple sources and time-varying conditions. Future research directions emphasize integrating physical constraints into learning objectives, developing physics-consistent generative frameworks to enhance data realism, establishing interpretable and certifiable DA systems for engineering practice, and advancing multi-source and lifelong adaptation for scalable monitoring. Overall, this review consolidates the methodological foundation of DA for SHM, identifies existing barriers to generalization and trust, and outlines the technological trajectory toward transparent, physics-aware, and adaptive monitoring systems that support the long-term resilience of civil infrastructure.</description>

      <title>RIS-Enabled Smart Wireless Environments: Fundamentals and Distributed Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter overviews the concept of Smart Wireless Environments (SWEs) motivated by the emerging technology of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs). The operating principles and state-of-the-art hardware architectures of programmable metasurfaces are first introduced. Subsequently, key performance objectives and use cases of RIS-enabled SWEs, including spectral and energy efficiency, physical-layer security, integrated sensing and communications, as well as the emerging paradigm of over-the-air computing, are discussed. Focusing on the recent trend of Beyond-Diagonal (BD) RISs, two distributed designs of respective SWEs are presented. The first deals with a multi-user Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) system operating within the area of influence of a SWE comprising multiple BD-RISs. A hybrid distributed and fusion machine learning framework based on multi-branch attention-based convolutional Neural Networks (NNs), NN parameter sharing, and neuroevolutionary training is presented, which enables online mapping of channel realizations to the BD-RIS configurations as well as the multi-user transmit precoder. Performance evaluation results showcase that the distributedly optimized RIS-enabled SWE achieves near-optimal sum-rate performance with low online computational complexity. The second design focuses on the wideband interference MISO broadcast channel, where each base station exclusively controls one BD-RIS to serve its assigned group of users. A cooperative optimization framework that jointly designs the base station transmit precoders as well as the tunable capacitances and switch matrices of all metasurfaces is presented. Numerical results demonstrating the superior sum-rate performance of the designed RIS-enabled SWE for multi-cell MISO networks over benchmark schemes, considering non-cooperative configuration and conventional diagonal metasurfaces, are presented.</description>

      <title>A 100-GHz CMOS-Compatible RIS-on-Chip Based on Phase-Delay Lines for 6G Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-chip reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are expected to play a vital role in future 6G communication systems. This work proposed a CMOS-compatible on-chip RIS capable of achieving beam steering for the first time. The proposed unit cell design is a combination of a slot, a phase-delay line with VO2, and a ground. Under the two states of the VO2, the unit cell has a 180 deg phase difference at the center frequency, while maintaining reflection magnitudes better than -1.2 dB. Moreover, a 60by60 RIS array based on the present novel unit is designed, demonstrating the beam-steering capability. Finally, to validate the design concept, a prototype is fabricated, and the detailed fabrication process is presented. The measurement result demonstrates a 27.1 dB enhancement between ON and OFF states. The proposed RIS has the advantages of low loss, CMOS-compatibility, providing a foundation for future 6G applications.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Cooperative Beamforming for Networked LEO Satellites with Statistical CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inter-satellite-link-enabled low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite constellations are evolving toward networked architectures that support constellation-level cooperation, enabling multiple satellites to jointly serve user terminals through cooperative beamforming. While such cooperation can substantially enhance link budgets and achievable rates, its practical realization is challenged by the scalability limitations of centralized beamforming designs and the stringent computational and signaling constraints of large LEO constellations. This paper develops a fully decentralized cooperative beamforming framework for networked LEO satellite downlinks. Using an ergodic-rate-based formulation, we first derive a centralized weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) solution as a performance benchmark. Building on this formulation, we propose a topology-agnostic decentralized beamforming algorithm by localizing the benchmark and exchanging a set of globally coupled variables whose dimensions are independent of the antenna number and enforcing consensus over arbitrary connected inter-satellite networks. The resulting algorithm admits fully parallel execution across satellites. To further enhance scalability, we eliminate the consensus-related auxiliary variables in closed form and derive a low-complexity per-satellite update rule that is optimal to local iteration and admits a quasi-closed-form solution via scalar line search. Simulation results show that the proposed decentralized schemes closely approach centralized performance under practical inter-satellite topologies, while significantly reducing computational complexity and signaling overhead, enabling scalable cooperative beamforming for large LEO constellations.</description>

      <title>FAS-RIS for V2X: Unlocking Realistic Performance Analysis with Finite Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synergy of fluid antenna systems (FAS) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) is poised to unlock robust Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. However, a critical gap persists between theoretical predictions and real-world performance. Existing analyses predominantly rely on the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), an assumption valid only for a large number of RIS elements, which fails to represent practical, finite-sized deployments constrained by cost and urban infrastructure. This paper bridges this gap by presenting a novel framework that unlocks a realistic performance analysis for FAS-RIS systems with finite elements. Leveraging a Gamma distribution approximation, we derive a new, tractable closed-form expression for the outage probability. Numerical results validate our approach, demonstrating that it offers a significantly more accurate performance characterization than conventional CLT-based methods, particularly in the practical regime of small-scale RIS. This work provides a crucial foundation for the design and deployment of reliable FAS-RIS-aided vehicular networks.</description>

      <title>An Fluid Antenna Array-Enabled DOA Estimation Method: End-Fire Effect Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation serves as a critical sensing technology poised to play a vital role in future intelligent and ubiquitous communication systems. Despite the development of numerous mature super-resolution algorithms, the inherent end-fire effect problem in fixed antenna arrays remains inadequately addressed. This work proposed a novel array architecture composed of fluid antennas. By exploiting the spatial reconfigurability of their positions to equivalently modulate the array steering vector and integrating it with the classical MUSIC algorithm, this approach achieved high-precision DOA estimation. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed method delivers outstanding estimation performance even in highly challenging end-fire regions.</description>

      <title>Reimagining Wireless Connectivity: The FAS-RIS Synergy for 6G Smart Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS) represents the concept of treating antenna as a reconfigurable physical-layer resource to broaden system design and network optimization and inspire next-generation reconfigurable antennas. FAS can unleash new degree of freedom (DoF) via antenna reconfigurations for novel spatial diversity. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) on the other hand can reshape wireless propagation environments but often face limitations from double path-loss and minimal signal processing capability when operating independently. This article envisions a transformative FAS-RIS integrated architecture for future smart city networks, uniting the adaptability of FAS with the environmental control of RIS. The proposed framework has five key applications: FAS-enabled base stations (BSs) for large-scale beamforming, FAS-equipped user devices with finest spatial diversity, and three novel RIS paradigms -- fluid RIS (FRIS) with reconfigurable elements, FAS-embedded RIS as active relays, and enormous FAS (E-FAS) exploiting surface waves on facades to re-establish line-of-sight (LoS) communication. A two-timescale control mechanism coordinates network-level beamforming with rapid, device-level adaptation. Applications spanning from simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) to integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), with challenges in co-design, channel modeling, and optimization, are discussed. This article concludes with simulation results demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of the FAS-RIS system.</description>

      <title>PalpAid: Multimodal Pneumatic Tactile Sensor for Tissue Palpation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tactile properties of tissue, such as elasticity and stiffness, often play an important role in surgical oncology when identifying tumors and pathological tissue boundaries. Though extremely valuable, robot-assisted surgery comes at the cost of reduced sensory information to the surgeon; typically, only vision is available. Sensors proposed to overcome this sensory desert are often bulky, complex, and incompatible with the surgical workflow. We present PalpAid, a multimodal pneumatic tactile sensor equipped with a microphone and pressure sensor, converting contact force into an internal pressure differential. The pressure sensor acts as an event detector, while the auditory signature captured by the microphone assists in tissue delineation. We show the design, fabrication, and assembly of sensory units with characterization tests to show robustness to use, inflation-deflation cycles, and integration with a robotic system. Finally, we show the sensor's ability to classify 3D-printed hard objects with varying infills and soft ex vivo tissues. Overall, PalpAid aims to fill the sensory gap intelligently and allow improved clinical decision-making.</description>

      <title>The MIMO-ME-MS Channel: Analysis and Algorithm for Secure MIMO Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies precoder design for secure MIMO integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) by introducing the MIMO-ME-MS channel, where a multi-antenna transmitter serves a legitimate multi-antenna receiver in the presence of a multi-antenna eavesdropper while simultaneously enabling sensing via a multi-antenna sensing receiver. Using sensing mutual information as the sensing metric, we formulate a nonconvex weighted objective that jointly captures secure communication (via secrecy rate) and sensing performance. A high-SNR analysis based on subspace decomposition characterizes the maximum achievable weighted degrees of freedom and reveals that a quasi-optimal precoder must span a "useful subspace," highlighting why straightforward extensions of classical wiretap/ISAC precoders can be suboptimal in this tripartite setting. Motivated by these insights, we develop a practical two-stage iterative algorithm that alternates between sequential basis construction and power allocation via a difference-of-convex program. Numerical results show that the proposed approach captures the desirable precoding structure predicted by the analysis and yields substantial gains in the MIMO-ME-MS channel.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Subcarrier-Level CQI Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) is a fundamental component of channel state information (CSI) that enables adaptive modulation and coding by selecting the optimal modulation and coding scheme to meet a target block error rate. While AI-enabled CSI feedback has achieved significant advances, especially in precoding matrix index feedback, AI-based CQI feedback remains underexplored. Conventional subband-based CQI approaches, due to coarse granularity, often fail to capture fine frequency-selective variations and thus lead to suboptimal resource allocation. In this paper, we propose an AI-driven subcarrier-level CQI feedback framework tailored for 6G and NextG systems. First, we introduce CQInet, an autoencoder-based scheme that compresses per-subcarrier CQI at the user equipment and reconstructs it at the base station, significantly reducing feedback overhead without compromising CQI accuracy. Simulation results show that CQInet increases the effective data rate by 7.6% relative to traditional subband CQI under equivalent feedback overhead. Building on this, we develop SR-CQInet, which leverages super-resolution to infer fine-grained subcarrier CQI from sparsely reported CSI reference signals (CSI-RS). SR-CQInet reduces CSI-RS overhead to 3.5% of CQInet's requirements while maintaining comparable throughput. These results demonstrate that AI-driven subcarrier-level CQI feedback can substantially enhance spectral efficiency and reliability in future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Wireless sEMG-IMU Wearable for Real-Time Squat Kinematics and Muscle Activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the design and implementation of a wireless, wearable system that combines surface electromyography (sEMG) and inertial measurement units (IMUs) to analyze a single lower-limb functional task: the free bodyweight squat in a healthy adult. The system records bipolar EMG from one agonist and one antagonist muscle of the dominant leg (vastus lateralis and semitendinosus) while simultaneously estimating knee joint angle, angular velocity, and angular acceleration using two MPU6050 IMUs. A custom dual-channel EMG front end with differential instrumentation preamplification, analog filtering (5-500 Hz band-pass and 60 Hz notch), high final gain, and rectified-integrated output was implemented on a compact 10 cm x 12 cm PCB. Data are digitized by an ESP32 microcontroller and transmitted wirelessly via ESP-NOW to a second ESP32 connected to a PC. A Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) displays EMG and kinematic signals in real time, manages subject metadata, and exports a summary of each session to Excel. The complete system is battery-powered to reduce electrical risk during human use. The resulting prototype demonstrates the feasibility of low-cost, portable EMG-IMU instrumentation for integrated analysis of muscle activation and squat kinematics and provides a platform for future biomechanical applications in sports performance and rehabilitation.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Sky Mirrors: SAC-Driven MF-RIS Optimization for Secure NOMA in Low-Altitude Economy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-altitude economy (LAE) has become a key driving force for smart cities and economic growth. To address spectral efficiency and communication security challenges in LAE, this paper investigates secure energy efficiency (SEE) maximization using intelligent sky mirrors, UAV-mounted multifunctional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (MF-RIS) assisting nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. These aerial mirrors intelligently amplify legitimate signals while simultaneously generating jamming against eavesdroppers. We formulate a joint optimization problem encompassing UAV trajectory, base station power allocation, RIS phase shifts, amplification factors, and scheduling matrices. Given the fractional SEE objective and dynamic UAV scenarios, we propose a two-layer optimization scheme: SAC-driven first layer for trajectory and power management, and channel alignment-based second layer for phase optimization. Simulations demonstrate that our proposed scheme significantly outperforms benchmark approaches.</description>

      <title>Specific Multi-emitter Identification: Theoretical Limits and Low-complexity Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Specific emitter identification (SEI) distinguishes emitters by utilizing hardware-induced signal imperfections. However, conventional SEI techniques are primarily designed for single-emitter scenarios. This poses a fundamental limitation in distributed wireless networks, where simultaneous transmissions from multiple emitters result in overlapping signals that conventional single-emitter identification methods cannot effectively handle. To overcome this limitation, we present a specific multi-emitter identification (SMEI) framework via multi-label learning, treating identification as a problem of directly decoding emitter states from overlapping signals. Theoretically, we establish performance bounds using Fano's inequality. Methodologically, the multi-label formulation reduces output dimensionality from exponential to linear scale, thereby substantially decreasing computational complexity. Additionally, we propose an improved SMEI (I-SMEI), which incorporates multi-head attention to effectively capture features in correlated signal combinations. Experimental results demonstrate that SMEI achieves high identification accuracy with a linear computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed I-SMEI scheme significantly improves identification accuracy across various overlapping scenarios compared to the proposed SMEI and other advanced methods.</description>

      <title>Energy Optimization for Time-of-Arrival Based Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper analyzes energy allocation in a scenario where the position of a moving target is tracked by exploiting the Time-of-Arrivals of bandwidth-constrained signals received by or transmitted from a fixed number of anchors located at known positions. The signal of each anchor is generated by transmitting a sequence of known symbols, allowing for amplitude and duration (number of symbols) to be different from anchor to anchor. The problem is the minimization of the sum of the energies of the transmitted signals imposing a constraint on the performance of the tracking procedure. Specifically, the constraint is the Posterior Cramer-Rao Bound, below the mean square error achieved by any unbiased estimator. The main improvement over the previous literature is the derivation of a formula that, at each step of the tracking, allows to calculate in closed form the first-order variation of the Posterior Cramer-Rao Bound as a function of the variation of the total energy. To concretely show the application of our approach, we present also two numerical algorithms that implement the constrained optimization in the case of signals of fixed amplitude and variable duration transmitted from the anchors in a time division multiplexing scheme.</description>

      <title>How is remifentanil dosed without dedicated indicator?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the paradigm of intraoperative analgesic dosage using a data-driven approach based on retrospective clinical data. Remifentanil, an analgesic widely used during anesthesia, presents a dosing challenge due to the absence of an universally accepted indicator of analgesia. To examine how changes in patient state correlate with adjustments in remifentanil target concentration triggered by the practitioner, we analyzed data from two sources: VitalDB (Seoul, Korea) and PREDIMED (Grenoble, France). Results show that only features derived from arterial pressure are consistently associated with changes in remifentanil targets. This finding is robust across both datasets despite variations in specific thresholds. In particular, increases in remifentanil targets are associated with high or rising arterial pressure over short periods (1--2 minutes), whereas decreases are linked to low, stable, or declining arterial pressure over longer periods (5--7 minutes). By capturing anesthesiologists' dosing strategies we provide a foundation for the future development of closed-loop control algorithms. Beyond the specific example of remifentanil's change prediction, the proposed feature generation and associated sparse fitting approach can be applied to other domain where human decision can be viewed as sensors interpretation.</description>

      <title>Anti-Malicious ISAC: How to Jointly Monitor and Disrupt Your Foes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems are key enablers of future networks but raise significant security concerns. In this realm, the emergence of malicious ISAC systems has amplified the need for authorized parties to legitimately monitor suspicious communication links and protect legitimate targets from potential detection or exploitation by malicious foes. In this paper, we propose a new wireless proactive monitoring paradigm, where a legitimate monitor intercepts a suspicious communication link while performing cognitive jamming to enhance the monitoring success probability (MSP) and simultaneously safeguard the target. To this end, we derive closed-form expressions of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) at the user (UE), sensing access points (S-APs), and an approximating expression of the SINR at the proactive monitor. Moreover, we propose an optimization technique under which the legitimate monitor minimizes the success detection probability (SDP) of the legitimate target, by optimizing the jamming power allocation over both communication and sensing channels subject to total power constraints and monitoring performance requirement. To enhance the monitor's longevity and reduce the risk of detection by malicious ISAC systems, we further propose an adaptive power allocation scheme aimed at minimizing the total transmit power at the monitor while meeting a pre-selected sensing SINR threshold and ensuring successful monitoring. Our numerical results show that the proposed algorithm significantly compromises the sensing and communication performance of malicious ISAC.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Streamable Generative Speech Restoration with Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have greatly impacted the speech processing field in recent years, exhibiting high speech naturalness and spawning a new research direction. Their application in real-time communication is, however, still lagging behind due to their computation-heavy nature involving multiple calls of large DNNs.
  Here, we present Stream.FM, a frame-causal flow-based generative model with an algorithmic latency of 32 milliseconds (ms) and a total latency of 48 ms, paving the way for generative speech processing in real-time communication. We propose a buffered streaming inference scheme and an optimized DNN architecture, show how learned few-step numerical solvers can boost output quality at a fixed compute budget, explore model weight compression to find favorable points along a compute/quality tradeoff, and contribute a model variant with 24 ms total latency for the speech enhancement task.
  Our work looks beyond theoretical latencies, showing that high-quality streaming generative speech processing can be realized on consumer GPUs available today. Stream.FM can solve a variety of speech processing tasks in a streaming fashion: speech enhancement, dereverberation, codec post-filtering, bandwidth extension, STFT phase retrieval, and Mel vocoding. As we verify through comprehensive evaluations and a MUSHRA listening test, Stream.FM establishes a state-of-the-art for generative streaming speech restoration, exhibits only a reasonable reduction in quality compared to a non-streaming variant, and outperforms our recent work (Diffusion Buffer) on generative streaming speech enhancement while operating at a lower latency.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliable Connectivity: Measurement-Driven Assessment of Starlink and OneWeb Non-Terrestrial and 5G Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of commercial satellite communications networks, such as Starlink and OneWeb, has significantly transformed the communications landscape over the last years. As a complement to terrestrial cellular networks, non-terrestrial systems enable coverage extension and reliability enhancement beyond the limits of conventional infrastructure. Currently, the high reliance on terrestrial networks exposes communications to vulnerabilities in the event of terrestrial infrastructure failures, e.g., due to natural disasters. Therefore, this work proposes the joint evaluation of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for two non-terrestrial satellite networks (Starlink and OneWeb) and two terrestrial cellular networks to assess the current performance of these technologies across three different environments: (i) urban, (ii) suburban, and (iii) forest scenarios. Additionally, multi-connectivity techniques are explored to determine the benefits in connectivity when two technologies are used simultaneously. For instance, the outage probability of Starlink and OneWeb in urban areas is reduced from approximately 12-21\% to 2\% when both solutions are employed together. Finally, the joint analysis of KPIs in both terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks demonstrates that their integration enhances coverage, improves performance, and increases reliability, highlighting the benefits of combining satellite and terrestrial systems in the analyzed environments.</description>

      <title>FOODER: Real-time Facial Authentication and Expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for the safe deployment of neural networks, as it enables the identification of samples outside the training domain. We present FOODER, a real-time, privacy-preserving radar-based framework that integrates OOD-based facial authentication with facial expression recognition. FOODER operates using low-cost frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar and exploits both range-Doppler and micro range-Doppler representations. The authentication module employs a multi-encoder multi-decoder architecture with Body Part (BP) and Intermediate Linear Encoder-Decoder (ILED) components to classify a single enrolled individual as in-distribution while detecting all other faces as OOD. Upon successful authentication, an expression recognition module is activated. Concatenated radar representations are processed by a ResNet block to distinguish between dynamic and static facial expressions. Based on this categorization, two specialized MobileViT networks are used to classify dynamic expressions (smile, shock) and static expressions (neutral, anger). This hierarchical design enables robust facial authentication and fine-grained expression recognition while preserving user privacy by relying exclusively on radar data. Experiments conducted on a dataset collected with a 60 GHz short-range FMCW radar demonstrate that FOODER achieves an AUROC of 94.13% and an FPR95 of 18.12% for authentication, along with an average expression recognition accuracy of 94.70%. FOODER outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods and several transformer-based architectures while operating efficiently in real time.</description>

      <title>FedWiLoc: Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving WiFi Indoor Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current data-driven Wi-Fi-based indoor localization systems face three critical challenges: protecting user privacy, achieving accurate predictions in dynamic multipath environments, and generalizing across different deployments. Traditional Wi-Fi localization systems often compromise user privacy, particularly when facing compromised access points (APs) or man-in-the-middle attacks. As IoT devices proliferate in indoor environments, developing solutions that deliver accurate localization while robustly protecting privacy has become imperative. We introduce FedWiLoc, a privacy-preserving indoor localization system that addresses these challenges through three key innovations. First, FedWiLoc employs a split architecture where APs process Channel State Information (CSI) locally and transmit only privacy-preserving embedding vectors to user devices, preventing raw CSI exposure. Second, during training, FedWiLoc uses federated learning to collaboratively train the model across APs without centralizing sensitive user data. Third, we introduce a geometric loss function that jointly optimizes angle-of-arrival predictions and location estimates, enforcing geometric consistency to improve accuracy in challenging multipath conditions. Extensive evaluation across six diverse indoor environments spanning over 2,000 sq. ft. demonstrates that FedWiLoc outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 61.9% in median localization error while maintaining strong privacy guarantees throughout both training and inference.</description>

      <title>A Data-Centric Approach to Generalizable Speech Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving robust generalization in speech deepfake detection (SDD) remains a primary challenge, as models often fail to detect unseen forgery methods. While research has focused on model-centric and algorithm-centric solutions, the impact of data composition is often underexplored. This paper proposes a data-centric approach, analyzing the SDD data landscape from two practical perspectives: constructing a single dataset and aggregating multiple datasets. To address the first perspective, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to characterize the data scaling laws for SDD, quantifying the impact of source and generator diversity. To address the second, we propose the Diversity-Optimized Sampling Strategy (DOSS), a principled framework for mixing heterogeneous data with two implementations: DOSS-Select (pruning) and DOSS-Weight (re-weighting). Our experiments show that DOSS-Select outperforms the naive aggregation baseline while using only 3% of the total available data. Furthermore, our final model, trained on a 12k-hour curated data pool using the optimal DOSS-Weight strategy, achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming large-scale baselines with greater data and model efficiency on both public benchmarks and a new challenge set of various commercial APIs.</description>

      <title>Regularized Distributed MPC for UAV Networks: Stabilizing Coupled Motion and Hybrid Beam Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter investigates the coupled control problem in UAV networks utilizing high-frequency hybrid beamsteering. While phased arrays enable rapid electronic scanning, their finite Field of View (FoV) imposes a fundamental constraint that necessitates active mechanical steering of the airframe to maintain connectivity. We propose a decentralized Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that jointly optimizes trajectory and heading to maximize network sum-capacity subject to safety constraints. Addressing the numerical instability caused by fast-fading channel nulls, we introduce a regularized surrogate cost function based on discrete spatial smoothing. We analytically prove that this approximation bounds the cost curvature, restoring the Lipschitz continuity of the gradient. Crucially, we derive a sufficient condition linking this Lipschitz constant to the controller gain, guaranteeing the contraction and linear convergence of the distributed best-response dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively navigates the trade-off between electronic beam tracking and kinematic safety, significantly systematically outperforming velocity-aligned baselines.</description>

      <title>The Illusion of Consistency: Selection-Induced Bias in Gated Kalman Innovation Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Validation gating is a fundamental component of classical Kalman-based tracking systems. Only measurements whose normalized innovation squared (NIS) falls below a prescribed threshold are considered for state update. While this procedure is statistically motivated by the chi-square distribution, it implicitly replaces the unconditional innovation process with a conditionally observed one, restricted to the validation event. This paper shows that innovation statistics computed after gating converge to gate-conditioned rather than nominal quantities. Under classical linear--Gaussian assumptions, we derive exact expressions for the first- and second-order moments of the innovation conditioned on ellipsoidal gating, and show that gating induces a deterministic, dimension-dependent contraction of the innovation covariance. The analysis is extended to NN association, which is shown to act as an additional statistical selection operator. We prove that selecting the minimum-norm innovation among multiple in-gate measurements introduces an unavoidable energy contraction, implying that nominal innovation statistics cannot be preserved under nontrivial gating and association. Closed-form results in the two-dimensional case quantify the combined effects and illustrate their practical significance.</description>

      <title>How Many Pinching Antennas Are Enough?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programmable wireless environments (PWEs) have emerged as a key paradigm for next-generation communication networks, aiming to transform wireless propagation from an uncontrollable phenomenon into a reconfigurable process that can adapt to diverse service requirements. In this framework, pinching-antenna systems (PASs) have recently been proposed as a promising enabling technology, as they allow the radiation location and effective propagation distance to be adjusted by selectively exciting radiating points along a dielectric waveguide. However, most existing studies on PASs rely on the idealized assumption that pinching-antenna (PA) positions can be continuously adjusted along the waveguide, while realistically only a finite set of pinching locations is available. Motivated by this, this paper analyzes the performance of two-state PASs, where the PA positions are fixed and only their activation state can be controlled. By explicitly accounting for the spatial discreteness of the available pinching points, closed-form analytical expressions for the outage probability and the ergodic achievable data rate are derived. In addition, we introduce the pinching discretization efficiency to quantify the performance gap between discrete and continuous pinching configurations, enabling a direct assessment of the number of PAs required to approximate the ideal continuous case. Finally, numerical results validate the analytical framework and show that near-continuous performance can be achieved with a limited number of PAs, offering useful insights for the design and deployment of PASs in PWEs.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication for Rate-Limited Closed-Loop Distributed Communication-Sensing-Control Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing integration of distributed integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) with closed-loop control in intelligent networks demands efficient information transmission under stringent bandwidth constraints. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a unified framework for goal-oriented semantic communication in distributed SCC systems. Building upon Weaver's three-level model, we establish a hierarchical semantic formulation with three error levels (L1: observation reconstruction, L2: state estimation, and L3: control) to jointly optimize their corresponding objectives. Based on this formulation, we propose a unified goal-oriented semantic compression and rate adaptation framework that is applicable to different semantic error levels and optimization goals across the SCC loop. A rate-limited multi-sensor LQR system is used as a case study to validate the proposed framework. We employ a GRU-based AE for semantic compression and a PPO-based rate adaptation algorithm that dynamically allocates transmission rates across sensors. Results show that the proposed framework effectively captures task-relevant semantics and adapts its resource allocation strategies across different semantic levels, thereby achieving level-specific performance gains under bandwidth constraints.</description>

      <title>Time-Vertex Machine Learning for Optimal Sensor Placement in Temporal Graph Signals: Applications in Structural Health Monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety and resilience of infrastructure. As sensor networks grow in scale and complexity, identifying the most informative sensors becomes essential to reduce deployment costs without compromising monitoring quality. While Graph Signal Processing (GSP) has shown promise by leveraging spatial correlations among sensor nodes, conventional approaches often overlook the temporal dynamics of structural behavior. To overcome this limitation, we propose Time-Vertex Machine Learning (TVML), a novel framework that integrates GSP, time-domain analysis, and machine learning to enable interpretable and efficient sensor placement by identifying representative nodes that minimize redundancy while preserving critical information. We evaluate the proposed approach on two bridge datasets for damage detection and time-varying graph signal reconstruction tasks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing SHM systems by providing a robust, adaptive, and efficient solution for sensor placement.</description>

      <title>Fully Asynchronous Unsourced Random Access over Fading Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine unsourced random access in a fully asynchronous setup, where active users transmit their data without restriction on the start time over a fading channel. In the proposed scheme, the transmitted signal consists of a pilot sequence and a polar codeword, with the polar codeword distributed across the data part of the packet in an on-off pattern. The receiver uses a double sliding-window decoder, where the inner window employs iterative decoding with joint timing and pilot detection, channel estimation, single-user decoding, and successive interference cancellation to recover the message bits, while the outer window enhances interference cancellation. The numerical results indicate that the proposed scheme exhibits only a slight performance loss compared to the synchronous benchmark while being more applicable in practice.</description>

      <title>Constant Modulus Waveform Design with Space-Time Sidelobe Reduction for DFRC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18951v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) is a key enabler of location-based services for next-generation communication systems. In this paper, we investigate the problem of designing constant modulus multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) waveforms for DFRC systems. We jointly shape the spatial beam pattern and ambiguity function of the transmit space-time matrix to improve target localization accuracy and enhance target resolution in cluttered environments. For communications, we employ constructive interference (CI)-based precoding, which exploits multi-user and radar-induced interference to enhance MIMO symbol detection. We develop two novel solution algorithms based on majorization-minimization (MM) and the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers (LADMM) principles. For the MM approach, we introduce a novel diagonal majorizer for complex quadratic functions, yielding a tighter surrogate and faster convergence than standard largest eigenvalue-based surrogates. After majorization, we decompose the approximated problem into independent subproblems that can be efficiently solved via parallelizable coordinate descent. To accommodate large MIMO dimensions, we further develop a low-complexity LADMM solution. We combine a biconvex reformulation and first-order proximal approximations to handle the nonconvex quartic objective without requiring costly matrix inversions. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in comparison to the existing DFRC algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can substantially enhance target detection and imaging performance due to the reduction of space-time sidelobes.</description>

      <title>Activity-dependent resolution adjustment for radar-based human activity recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rising demand for detecting hazardous situations has led to increased interest in radar-based human activity recognition (HAR). Conventional radar-based HAR methods predominantly rely on micro-Doppler spectrograms for recognition tasks. However, conventional spectrograms employ a fixed resolution regardless of the varying characteristics of human activities, leading to limited representation of micro-Doppler signatures. To address this limitation, we propose a time-frequency domain representation method that adaptively adjusts the resolution based on activity characteristics. This approach adaptively adjusts the spectrogram resolution in a nonlinear manner, emphasizing frequency ranges that vary with activity intensity and are critical to capturing micro-Doppler signatures. We validate the proposed method by training deep learning-based HAR models on datasets generated using our adaptive representation. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained with our method achieve superior recognition accuracy compared to those trained with conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Chip-Surface Based Visual Authentication for Integrated Circuits</title>

Abstract: The rapid development of the semiconductor industry and the ubiquity of electronic devices have led to a significant increase in the counterfeiting of integrated circuits (ICs). This poses a major threat to public health, the banking industry, and military defense sectors that are heavily reliant on electronic systems. The electronic physically unclonable functions (PUFs) are widely used to authenticate IC chips at the unit level. However, electronic PUFs are limited by their requirement for IC chips to be in working status for measurements and their sensitivity to environmental variations. This paper proposes using optical PUFs for IC chip authentication by leveraging the unique microscopic structures of the packaging surface of individual IC chips. The proposed method relies on color images of IC chip surfaces acquired using a flatbed scanner or mobile camera. Our initial study reveals that these consumer-grade imaging devices can capture meaningful physical features from IC chip surfaces. We then propose an efficient, lightweight verification scheme leveraging specular-reflection-based features extracted from videos, achieving an equal error rate (EER) of 0.0008. We conducted factor, sensitivity, and ablation studies to understand the detailed characteristics of the proposed lightweight verification scheme. Our work is the first to apply the optical PUF principle for the authentication of IC chips, synergizing image and video processing with semiconductor chip technology and demonstrating the potential to significantly enhance the security of the semiconductor supply chain.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Beyond-Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: Modeling, Architectures, System Design and Optimization, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Written by its inventors, this first tutorial on Beyond-Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (BD-RISs) provides the readers with the basics and fundamental tools necessary to appreciate, understand, and contribute to this emerging and disruptive technology. Conventional (Diagonal) RISs (D-RISs) are characterized by a diagonal scattering matrix $\mathbf{\Theta}$ such that the wave manipulation flexibility of D-RIS is extremely limited. In contrast, BD-RIS refers to a novel and general framework for RIS where its scattering matrix is not limited to be diagonal (hence, the ``beyond-diagonal'' terminology) and consequently, all entries of $\mathbf{\Theta}$ can potentially help shaping waves for much higher manipulation flexibility. This physically means that BD-RIS can artificially engineer and reconfigure coupling across elements of the surface thanks to inter-element reconfigurable components which allow waves absorbed by one element to flow through other elements. Consequently, BD-RIS opens the door to more general and versatile intelligent surfaces that subsumes existing RIS architectures as special cases. In this tutorial, we share all the secret sauce to model, design, and optimize BD-RIS and make BD-RIS transformative in many different applications. Topics discussed include physics-consistent and multi-port network-aided modeling; transmitting, reflecting, hybrid, and multi-sector mode analysis; reciprocal and non-reciprocal architecture designs and optimal performance-complexity Pareto frontier of BD-RIS; signal processing, optimization, and channel estimation for BD-RIS; hardware impairments (discrete-value impedance and admittance, lossy interconnections and components, wideband effects, mutual coupling) of BD-RIS; benefits and applications of BD-RIS in communications, sensing, power transfer.</description>

      <title>A Synoptic Review of High-Frequency Oscillations as a Biomarker in Neurodegenerative Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs), rapid bursts of brain activity above 80 Hz, have emerged as a highly specific biomarker for epileptogenic tissue. Recent evidence suggests that HFOs are also present in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), reflecting underlying network hyperexcitability and offering a promising, noninvasive tool for early diagnosis and disease tracking. This synoptic review provides a comprehensive analysis of publicly available electroencephalography (EEG) datasets relevant to HFO research in neurodegenerative disorders. We conducted a bibliometric analysis of 1,222 articles, revealing a significant and growing research interest in HFOs, particularly within the last ten years. We then systematically profile and compare key public datasets, evaluating their participant cohorts, data acquisition parameters, and accessibility, with a specific focus on their technical suitability for HFO analysis. Our comparative synthesis highlights critical methodological heterogeneity across datasets, particularly in sampling frequency and recording paradigms, which poses challenges for cross-study validation, but also offers opportunities for robustness testing. By consolidating disparate information, clarifying nomenclature, and providing a detailed methodological framework, this review serves as a guide for researchers aiming to leverage public data to advance the role of HFOs as a cross-disease biomarker for AD and related conditions.</description>

      <title>Predictive Communications for Low-Altitude Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of dense, mission-driven aerial networks supporting the low-altitude economy presents unique communication challenges, including extreme channel dynamics and severe cross-tier interference. Traditional reactive communication paradigms are ill-suited to these environments, as they fail to leverage the network's inherent predictability. This paper introduces predictive communication, a novel paradigm transforming network management from reactive adaptation to proactive optimization. The approach is enabled by fusing predictable mission trajectories with stable, large-scale radio environment models (e.g., radio maps). Specifically, we present a hierarchical framework that decomposes the predictive cross-layer resource allocation problem into three layers: strategic (routing), tactical (timing), and operational (power). This structure aligns decision-making timescales with the accuracy levels and ranges of available predictive information. We demonstrate that this foresight-driven framework achieves an order-of-magnitude reduction in cross-tier interference, laying the groundwork for robust and scalable low-altitude communication systems.</description>

      <title>A Non-Uniform Quantization Framework for Time-Encoding Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time encoding machines (TEMs) provide an event-driven alternative to classical uniform sampling, enabling power-efficient representations without a global clock. While prior work analyzed uniform quantization (UQ) of firing intervals, we show that these intervals are inherently non-uniformly distributed, motivating the use of non-uniform quantization (NUQ). We derive the probability distribution of firing intervals for a class of bandlimited signals and design a power-law-based NUQ scheme tailored to this distribution. Simulations demonstrate that NUQ significantly outperforms UQ under the same bit budget. We also compare TEMs with non-uniform sampling (NUS), where both amplitudes and timings require quantization, and show that TEM--NUQ achieves lower error at half the transmission cost. These results highlight the advantages of distribution-aware quantization and establish TEM--NUQ as an efficient alternative to conventional UQ and NUS schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a sensing-centric joint communication and millimeter-wave radar paradigm to facilitate collaboration among intelligent vehicles.
  We first propose a chirp waveform-based delay-Doppler quadrature amplitude modulation (DD-QAM) that modulates data across delay, Doppler, and amplitude dimensions.
  Building upon this modulation scheme, we derive its achievable rate to quantify the communication performance.
  We then introduce an extended Kalman filter-based scheme for four-dimensional (4D) parameter estimation in dynamic environments, enabling the active vehicles to accurately estimate orientation and tangential-velocity beyond traditional 4D radar systems.
  Furthermore, in terms of communication, we propose a dual-compensation-based demodulation and tracking scheme that allows the passive vehicles to effectively demodulate data without compromising their sensing functions.
  Simulation results underscore the feasibility and superior performance of our proposed methods, marking a significant advancement in the field of autonomous vehicles.

      <title>Large Model Enabled Embodied Intelligence for 6G Integrated Perception, Communication, and Computation Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of sixth-generation (6G) places intelligence at the core of wireless architecture, fusing perception, communication, and computation into a single closed-loop. This paper argues that large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) can endow base stations with perception, reasoning, and acting capabilities, thus transforming them into intelligent base station agents (IBSAs). We first review the historical evolution of BSs from single-functional analog infrastructure to distributed, software-defined, and finally LAM-empowered IBSA, highlighting the accompanying changes in architecture, hardware platforms, and deployment. We then present an IBSA architecture that couples a perception-cognition-execution pipeline with cloud-edge-end collaboration and parameter-efficient adaptation. Subsequently,we study two representative scenarios: (i) cooperative vehicle-road perception for autonomous driving, and (ii) ubiquitous base station support for low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicle safety monitoring and response against unauthorized drones. On this basis, we analyze key enabling technologies spanning LAM design and training, efficient edge-cloud inference, multi-modal perception and actuation, as well as trustworthy security and governance. We further propose a holistic evaluation framework and benchmark considerations that jointly cover communication performance, perception accuracy, decision-making reliability, safety, and energy efficiency. Finally, we distill open challenges on benchmarks, continual adaptation, trustworthy decision-making, and standardization. Together, this work positions LAM-enabled IBSAs as a practical path toward integrated perception, communication, and computation native, safety-critical 6G systems.</description>

      <title>Semi-Blind Joint Channel and Symbol Estimation for Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) is a recent architecture in which scattering elements are interconnected to enhance the degrees of freedom for wave control, yielding performance gains over traditional single-connected RISs. For BD-RIS, channel estimation - well-studied for conventional RIS - becomes more challenging due to the complex connections and a larger number of coefficients. Prior works rely on pilot-assisted estimation followed by data decoding. This paper introduces a semi-blind tensor-based approach for joint channel and symbol estimation that eliminates the need for training sequences by leveraging data symbols directly. A practical scenario with time-varying user terminal-RIS channels under mobility is considered. By reformulating the received signal from a tensor decomposition perspective, we develop two semi-blind receivers: a two-stage method transforming the fourth-order PARATUCK model into a third-order PARAFAC model, and a single-stage iterative process based on fourth-order TUCKER decomposition. Identifiability conditions for reliable joint recovery are derived, and numerical results demonstrate the performance advantages and trade-offs of the proposed schemes over existing solutions.</description>

      <title>Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Nonlinear Matrix Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for solving nonlinear matrix decompositions (NMD). Given an input matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ and a factorization rank $r \ll \min(m, n)$, NMD seeks matrices $W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times r}$ and $H \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times n}$ such that $X \approx f(WH)$, where $f$ is an element-wise nonlinear function. We evaluate our method on several representative nonlinear models: the rectified linear unit activation $f(x) = \max(0, x)$, suitable for nonnegative sparse data approximation, the component-wise square $f(x) = x^2$, applicable to probabilistic circuit representation, and the MinMax transform $f(x) = \min(b, \max(a, x))$, relevant for recommender systems. The proposed framework flexibly supports diverse loss functions, including least squares, $\ell_1$ norm, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and can be readily extended to other nonlinearities and metrics. We illustrate the applicability, efficiency, and adaptability of the approach on real-world datasets, highlighting its potential for a broad range of applications.</description>

Abstract: This article focuses on the measurement and evolution modeling of Standardized Kalman filtering for brain activity estimation using non-invasive electroencephalography data. Here, we propose new parameter tuning and a model that uses the rate of change in the brain activity distribution to improve the stability of otherwise accurate estimates. Namely, we propose a backward-differentiation-based measurement model for the change rate, which notably improves the filtering-parametrization-stability of the tracking. Simulated data and data from a real subject were used in experiments.</description>

      <title>Personalized and Resilient Distributed Learning Through Opinion Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address two practical challenges of distributed learning in multi-agent network systems, namely personalization and resilience. Personalization is the need of heterogeneous agents to learn local models tailored to their own data and tasks, while still generalizing well; on the other hand, the learning process must be resilient to cyberattacks or anomalous training data to avoid disruption. Motivated by a conceptual affinity between these two requirements, we devise a distributed learning algorithm that combines distributed gradient descent and the Friedkin-Johnsen model of opinion dynamics to fulfill both of them. We quantify its convergence speed and the neighborhood that contains the final learned models, which can be easily controlled by tuning the algorithm parameters to enforce a more personalized/resilient behavior. We numerically showcase the effectiveness of our algorithm on synthetic and real-world distributed learning tasks, where it achieves high global accuracy both for personalized models and with malicious agents compared to standard strategies.</description>

      <title>Fast Compressed-Domain N-Point Discrete Fourier Transform: The "Twiddless" FFT Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23718v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present the \emph{twiddless fast Fourier transform (TFFT)}, a novel algorithm for computing the $N$-point discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The TFFT's divide strategy builds on recent results that decimate an $N$-point signal (by a factor of $p$) into an $N/p$-point compressed signal whose DFT readily yields $N/p$ coefficients of the original signal. However, existing compression-domain DFT analyses have been limited to computing only the even-indexed DFT coefficients. With TFFT, we overcome this limitation by efficiently computing both \emph{even- and odd-indexed} DFT coefficients in the compressed domain with $O(N \log N)$ complexity. TFFT introduces a new recursive decomposition of the DFT problem, wherein $N/2^i$ coefficients of the original input are computed at recursion level $i$, with no need for twiddle factor multiplications or butterfly structures. Additionally, TFFT generalizes the input length to $N = c \cdot 2^k$ (for $k \geq 0$ and non-power-of-two $c &gt; 0$), reducing the need for zero-padding and potentially improving efficiency and stability over classical FFTs. We believe TFFT represents a \emph{novel paradigm} for DFT computation, opening new directions for research in optimized implementations, hardware design, parallel computation, and sparse transforms.</description>

Abstract: Today, Wi-Fi is over 25 years old. Yet, despite sharing the same branding name, today's Wi-Fi boasts entirely new capabilities that were not even on the roadmap 25 years ago. This article aims to provide a holistic and comprehensive technical and historical tutorial on Wi-Fi, beginning with IEEE 802.11b (Wi-Fi 1) and looking forward to IEEE 802.11bn (Wi-Fi 8). This is the first tutorial article to span these eight generations. Rather than a generation-by-generation exposition, we describe the key mechanisms that have advanced Wi-Fi. We begin by discussing spectrum allocation and coexistence, and detailing the IEEE 802.11 standardization cycle. Second, we provide an overview of the physical layer and describe key elements that have enabled data rates to increase by over 1,000x. Third, we describe how Wi-Fi Medium Access Control has been enhanced from the original Distributed Coordination Function to now include capabilities spanning from frame aggregation to wideband spectrum access. Fourth, we describe how Wi-Fi 5 first broke the one-user-at-a-time paradigm and introduced multi-user access. Fifth, given the increasing use of mobile, battery-powered devices, we describe Wi-Fi's energy-saving mechanisms over the generations. Sixth, we discuss how Wi-Fi was enhanced to seamlessly aggregate spectrum across 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands to improve throughput, reliability, and latency. Finally, we describe how Wi-Fi enables nearby Access Points to coordinate in order to improve performance and efficiency. In the Appendix, we further discuss Wi-Fi developments beyond 802.11bn, including integrated mmWave operations, sensing, security and privacy extensions, and the adoption of AI/ML.</description>

      <title>Joint parameter estimation and multidimensional reconciliation for continuous-variable quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate quantum channel parameter estimation is essential for effective information reconciliation in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). However, conventional maximum likelihood (ML) estimators rely on a large amount of discarded data (or pilot symbols), leading to a significant loss in symbol efficiency. Moreover, the separation between the estimation and reconciliation phases can introduce error propagation. In this paper, we propose a novel joint message-passing scheme that unifies channel parameter estimation and information reconciliation within a Bayesian framework. By leveraging the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, the proposed method simultaneously estimates unknown parameters during decoding, eliminating the need for separate ML estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid multidimensional rotation scheme that removes the requirement for norm feedback, significantly reducing classical channel overhead. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to unify multidimensional reconciliation and channel parameter estimation in CV-QKD, providing a practical solution for high-efficiency reconciliation with minimal pilots.</description>

      <title>Nonasymptotic Convergence Rates for Plug-and-Play Methods With MMSE Denoisers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27211v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) denoiser under Gaussian noise can be written as a proximal operator, which suffices for asymptotic convergence of plug-and-play (PnP) methods but does not reveal the structure of the induced regularizer or give convergence rates. We show that the MMSE denoiser corresponds to a regularizer that can be written explicitly as an upper Moreau envelope of the negative log-marginal density, which in turn implies that the regularizer is 1-weakly convex. Using this property, we derive (to the best of our knowledge) the first sublinear convergence guarantee for PnP proximal gradient descent with an MMSE denoiser. We validate the theory with a one-dimensional synthetic study that recovers the implicit regularizer. We also validate the theory with imaging experiments (deblurring and computed tomography), which exhibit the predicted sublinear behavior.</description>

      <title>SSAS: Cross-subject EEG-based Emotion Recognition through Source Selection with Adversarial Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals have long been applied in the field of affective brain-computer interfaces (aBCIs). Cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition has demonstrated significant potential in practical applications due to its suitability across diverse people. However, most studies on cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition neglect the presence of inter-individual variability and negative transfer phenomena during model training. To address this issue, a cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition through source selection with adversarial strategy is introduced in this paper. The proposed method comprises two modules: the source selection network (SS) and the adversarial strategies network (AS). The SS uses domain labels to reverse-engineer the training process of domain adaptation. Its key idea is to disrupt class separability and magnify inter-domain differences, thereby raising the classification difficulty and forcing the model to learn domain-invariant yet emotion-relevant representations. The AS gets the source domain selection results and the pretrained domain discriminators from SS. The pretrained domain discriminators compute a novel loss aimed at enhancing the performance of domain classification during adversarial training, ensuring the balance of adversarial strategies. This paper provides theoretical insights into the proposed method and achieves outstanding performance on two EEG-based emotion datasets, SEED and SEED-IV.
