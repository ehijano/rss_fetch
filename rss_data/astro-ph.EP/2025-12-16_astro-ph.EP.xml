      <title>The Brown-dwarf Desert Persists as a Mass-ratio Desert around Low-mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sun-like stars are known to host a paucity of brown dwarf companions at close separations. Direct imaging surveys of intermediate-mass stars have suggested that the brown dwarf desert may be fundamentally a feature in the mass ratio. Microlensing surveys provide a unique opportunity to investigate the nature of this desert around low mass stars, as microlensing hosts have typical masses of 0.05-0.8 $M_\odot$. Here, we perform a statistical analysis of homogeneously selected binary-lens microlensing events in the literature, and identify a companion mass-ratio desert at $0.02\lesssim q\lesssim0.05$ and projected separations around 1-5 au. We derive a statistically significant truncation to the giant-planet mass-ratio distribution at $q\simeq0.02$, above which the occurrence rate density drops by approximately an order of magnitude. Due to the possibility that the small number of detected companions in this desert orbit white dwarfs, this mass-ratio desert may be closer to being completely dry around main-sequence stars. Below this desert, we derive a giant-planet ($q&gt;4\times10^{-4}$) occurrence rate density of $5.8\pm0.8$% per decade of projected separation. Our analysis furthers the hypothesis that the brown dwarf desert is fundamentally a feature in the mass ratio, separating distinct populations of planetary and non-planetary companions that are likely formed via core accretion and gravitational instability, respectively. The persistence of this desert across stellar types suggests that both gas-giant planets and sub-stellar companions form in a scale-invariant fashion, with planets growing to a maximum of approximately 2% their host masses.</description>

      <title>From Earths to Super-Earths: Five New Small Planets Transiting M Dwarf Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth-sized planets transiting M dwarf stars present one of the best opportunities with current facilities for studying the atmospheric and bulk compositions of terrestrial worlds. Here, we statistically validate five new transiting Earth and super-Earth sized planets orbiting M dwarf stars using a combination of light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, multi-color observations from Palomar and Las Cumbres Observatory, high-resolution imaging, and stellar spectroscopy. The sample includes: TOI-5716 b, an Earth-sized planet (R_p = 0.96 $\pm$ 0.05 Rearth) with a 6.766-day orbit around a metal-poor thin-disk star ([Fe/H] = -0.54 $\pm$ 0.10); TOI-5728 b, a super-Earth (R_p = 1.31 $\pm$ 0.05 Rearth) on an 11.497-day orbit; and TOI-5736 b, a larger planet (R_p = 1.56 $\pm$ 0.07 Rearth) with an ultra-short period of just 0.649 days. We also statistically validate a multi-planet system, TOI-5489, hosting two similarly-sized super-Earths: TOI-5489 b (R_p = 1.40 $\pm$ 0.05 R_earth) and TOI-5489 c (R_p = 1.28 $\pm$ 0.07 R_earth) with orbital periods of 3.152 and 4.921 days, respectively. Due to their longer orbital periods, TOI-5716 b and TOI-5728 b both have equilibrium temperatures $\leq$ 400 K, making them useful test cases for studies of atmospheric mass loss. If TOI-5728 b is confirmed to have an Earth-like bulk composition, it would join the very small sample of rocky planets orbiting mid- to late-M dwarfs that lie below the cosmic shoreline and therefore may have retained high mean molecular weight atmospheres.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRSpec Detects Warm CO Emission in the Terrestrial-Planet Zone of HD 131488</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have obtained a high-resolution, JWST NIRSpec $2.87$ -- $5.14$ $\mu$m spectrum of the debris disk around HD 131488. We discover CO fundamental emission indicating the presence of warm fluorescent gas within $\sim10$ AU of the star. The large discrepancy in CO's vibrational and rotational temperature indicates that CO is out of thermal equilibrium and is excited with UV fluorescence. Our UV fluorescence model gives a best fit of $1150\,$K with an effective temperature of $450$, $332$, and $125\,$K for the warm CO gas kinetic temperature within $0.5$, $1$, and $10\,$AU to the star and a gas vibrational temperature of $8800\,$K. The newly discovered warm CO gas population likely resides between sub-AU scales and $\sim\,10\,$AU, interior to the cold CO reservoir detected beyond $35\,$AU with HST STIS and ALMA. The discovery of warm, fluorescent gas in a debris disk is the first such detection ever made. The detection of warm CO raises the possibility of unseen molecules (H$_2$O, H$_2$, etc) as collisional partners to excite the warm gas. We estimated a lower mass limit for CO of $1.25\times 10^{-7}\text{M}_{\oplus}$, which is $10^{-5}$ of the cold CO mass detected with ALMA and HST. We demonstrate that UV fluorescence emerges as a promising avenue for detecting tenuous gas at $10^{-7}$ Earth-mass level in debris disks with JWST.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Sulfur Chemistry Network with Excited S(1D) and SO(1{\Delta}) for XODIAC Photochemical Model: Validation on Venus and Implications for Exo-Venus Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sulfur chemistry is fundamental to understanding the structure, cloud formation, and atmospheric composition of Venus and Venus-like exoplanets. However, many key reactions involving ground- and excited-state sulfur species remain poorly characterized, and current photochemical models rely on networks that lack accurate kinetic data under high-temperature, high-CO2 conditions. We compute kinetic parameters for reactions of ground-state S(3P) and excited-state S(1D) with CO2 under Venus-like conditions. These reactions form SO(3Sigma), SO(1Delta), and CO. The potential energy surfaces reveal intermediates, and temperature-dependent rate coefficients are obtained using a master-equation approach based on the chemically significant eigenvalue method. NASA 7-term polynomial coefficients are also derived for ground- and excited-state S and SO for consistent use in photochemical models. Incorporating these data into the one-dimensional photochemical model XODIAC shows that these reactions exert only a minor influence above 60 km in the Venus atmosphere due to competing pathways. The model agrees with observations for most sulfur-bearing species except S3 and S4. Introducing a 1 ppm near-surface atomic sulfur mixing ratio, representing a possible deep-atmosphere or surface source or accounting for missing sulfur processes, increases S3 and S4 by 1-2 orders of magnitude and improves agreement with measurements. For exo-Venus analogs with stratospheric isotherms and strong stellar irradiation, the new reactions significantly modify the vertical profiles of major sulfur species above 30 km and enhance S(1D) and SO(1Delta) more strongly than in scenarios with only isotherms or only irradiation. These results underscore the importance of accurate excited-state sulfur kinetics and the need for updated reaction networks when modeling Venus and exo-Venus atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Collisional Evolution of Debris Clusters in an Asteroid System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Rotational instability of rubble-pile asteroids can trigger mass shedding, forming transient debris clouds that may provide the initial conditions for secondary formation in binary systems. Aims. We investigate the dynamical and collisional evolution of a debris cloud numerically generated around a Didymos-like progenitor, as a representative case for the early formation of Dimorphos. The analysis focuses on the growth and structural properties of clusters composed of centimetre- to decimetre-scale particles. Methods. We perform full-scale simulations of debris evolution around a near-critically rotating asteroid using a cross-spatial-scale approach combined with the discrete element method (DEM). To overcome computational timescale limitations, an equivalent cluster-scale simulation framework is introduced to capture the essential collisional growth processes efficiently. These simulations quantify the efficiency of cluster growth and the structural evoution within the debris cloud. Results. Our simulations reveal that particles shed from a rotationally unstable asteroid exhibit a consistent migration pattern toward low-geopotential regions, which governs the mass distribution and dynamical structure of the debris cloud. The collisional velocity are well described by a Weibull distribution (lambda = 0.0642, k = 1.8349), where low-velocity impacts favor accretion. These collisions enable clusters to grow from centimeter-decimeter scales to meter-sized bodies, developing compact, moderately porous structures (Delta I \approx 0.8, phi \approx 0.52). Collisions between meter-sized clusters do not exhibit a bouncing barrier: low-velocity impacts yield Dinkinesh-like shapes, while moderate velocities promote plastic merging and continued growth.</description>

      <title>On the use of polarized thermal emission to constrain cloud grain size and temperature structure of sub-stellar objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emission spectroscopy is an invaluable tool for probing the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and exoplanets, but interpretations based on flux spectra alone often suffer from degeneracies among temperature structure, chemical composition, and cloud properties. Thermal emission spectropolarimetry offers complementary sensitivity to these atmospheric characteristics. Previous studies have shown that linear polarization in fixed bandpasses depends on emission angle, temperature profile, and cloud scattering. In this study, we revisit these dependencies, emphasizing the wavelength-dependent effects that shape polarized spectra. We show that thermal polarization spectrum is primarily governed by: (1) a combination of temperature, temperature gradient, and wavelength; (2) cloud particle size; and (3) cloud optical thickness. Using the 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code ARTES, we simulate polarization spectra from a modeled 1D atmosphere. We find that, for a fixed cloud optical thickness, the polarization exhibits peaks at size parameters near 0.2 and 1. However, the dependence on cloud optical thickness is more pronounced and tends to dominate the broadband polarization. We further show that much narrower polarization features in molecular absorption band, can in principle trace the local temperature gradient at the photosphere of each wavelength. Future low-resolution (resolving power around 100) spectropolarimeter operating at 1-2 micron with sensitivities of 1e-5 would be able to capture these polarization features, and may provide a new diagnostic for breaking degeneracies that commonly affect flux-only retrievals. This work represents an incremental step toward the challenging goal of jointly interpreting atmosphere from both intensity and polarization spectra.</description>

      <title>Pre-perihelion detection of a wobbling high-latitude jet in the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations of the detection of a faint high-latitude jet in the inner coma of comet 3I/ATLAS that coincides with the broad plume detected in visible images along PA $280 \pm 10^{\circ}$. A detailed analysis shows that the jet was clearly detected on seven nights (2025, August~3, 5, 18, 19, 21, 24, and~29). The jet maintains an almost, though not perfectly, constant position angle (PA) throughout these epochs. High-precision PA measurements at a projected distance of 6000~km from the cometary optocenter reveal a periodic modulation centered at ~ 280 degrees, consistent with a high-latitude jet undergoing precessional motion around the sky-projected spin axis of the nucleus. This is the first periodic jet-angle modulation detected in an interstellar comet. The derived periodicity of $7.74 \pm 0.35$ h may imply a nucleus rotation period of $P_{\mathrm{rot}} = 15.48 \pm 0.70$ h if the jet originates from a single active source near one of the poles. This value is slightly shorter than the period of $P_{\mathrm{rot}} = 16.79 \pm 0.23$ h derived from the photometric time series. From the measured PA range, the sky-projected orientation of the spin axis is derived as $\mathrm{PA} = 280.7 \pm 0.2^{\circ}$</description>

      <title>The Flying Saucer edge-on disc's Near Infrared silhouette revealed by the JWST JEDIce program</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge-on discs offer a unique opportunity to probe radial and vertical dust and gas distributions in the protoplanetary phase. This study aims to investigate the distribution of micron-sized dust particles in the Flying Saucer (BKLT J162813-243139) in Rho Ophiuchi, leveraging the unique observational conditions of a bright infrared background that enables the edge-on disc to be seen in both silhouette and scattered light at certain, specific wavelengths. As part of the JWST Edge-on Disc Ice program ('JEDIce'), we use NIRSpec IFU observations of the Flying Saucer, serendipitously observed against a PAH-emitting background, to constrain the dust distribution and grain sizes through radiative transfer modelling. Observation of the Flying Saucer in silhouette at 3.29 microns reveals that the midplane radial extent of small dust grains is ~235 au, larger than the large-grain disc extent previously determined to be 190 au from millimetre data. The scattered light observed in emission probes micron sized icy grains at large vertical distances above the midplane. The vertical extent of the disc silhouette is similar at visible, near-IR, and mid-IR wavelengths, corroborating the conclusion that dust settling is inefficient for grains as large as tens of microns, vertically and radially.</description>

      <title>Eccentric Binaries Accreting from Thin Disks: Orbital Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circumbinary disks crucially affect the orbital and electromagnetic properties of binary systems across the universe, from stars in our galactic neighborhood to supermassive black hole binaries formed as the result of tumultuous galactic mergers. Previous simulations have focused nearly exclusively on thick accretion disks, appropriate for studying stellar binaries, and have found encouraging agreement with observations thereof. We present herein the first systematic study of eccentric binary systems accreting from thin disks, focusing on binary orbital evolution. Our main results are that (1) thinner disk not only drive binaries to rapidly inspiral, but also excite binary eccentricities at much higher rates; (2) while thick disks may drive binaries to a stable fixed point of $e\approx0.425$, thinner disks pump binary eccentricities to $e\gtrsim0.6$; (3) the range of near-zero eccentricities that are damped towards zero depends on both disk thickness and viscosity, thinner disks and those with $\alpha$ viscosities driving binaries towards circularity over a much narrower range of eccentricities. These differences follow largely from the effects of pressure support on accretion streams and shocks within the inner regions of the accretion flow. Our results suggest that accreting binary black holes should have high eccentricities well into the frequency range probed by pulsar timing arrays and space-based gravitational wave interferometers, affecting the spectrum and isotropy of the gravitational wave background. Our results also suggest that circumbinary disks may play an important role in shaping the orbits of close binary stars, but much less so those of wider binaries.</description>

      <title>X-ray Evolution of Young Stars: Early Dimming and Coronal Softening in Solar-Mass Stars with Implications for Planetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) emission from young stars plays a critical role in shaping the evolution of planetary atmospheres and the conditions for habitability. To assess the long-term impact of high-energy stellar radiation, it is essential to empirically trace how X-ray luminosities and spectral hardness evolve during the first ~&lt;1 Gyr, when atmospheric loss and chemical processing are most active. This study extends the X-ray activity-mass-age analysis of &lt;25 Myr stars by Getman et al. (2022) to ages up to 750 Myr, using Gaia-based cluster memberships, new Chandra observations of five rich open clusters (~45--100 Myr), and archival ROSAT and Chandra data for three older clusters (~220--750 Myr). We find a mass-dependent decay in X-ray luminosity: solar-mass stars undergo a far more rapid and sustained decline, accompanied by coronal softening and the disappearance of hot plasma by ~100 Myr, compared to their lower-mass siblings. These trends in solar-mass stars are likely linked to reduced magnetic dynamo efficiency and diminished ability to sustain large-scale, high-temperature coronal structures. The trends are significantly stronger than predicted by widely used XUV-rotation-age relations. The revised trends imply systematically lower rates of atmospheric mass loss and water photolysis, as well as altered ionization environments and chemical pathways relevant to the formation of prebiotic molecules, for planets in close orbits around solar analogs. These effects persist throughout at least the ~&lt;750 Myr interval probed in this study.</description>

      <title>ESO Expanding Horizons White Paper: Electromagnetic characterisation of millihertz gravitational-wave sources in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The millihertz band is densely populated by continuous gravitational-wave signals from Galactic compact binaries, dominated by double white dwarfs (DWDs; binaries of two white dwarfs) with contributions from systems containing neutron stars and black holes (Amaro-Seoane et al. 2023). As these binaries inspiral due to gravitational-wave radiation, they can reach contact and begin mass transfer in the millihertz band. Gravitational-wave detectors like LISA will survey such compact binaries across the Milky Way, yielding samples numbering in the tens of thousands, with essentially complete sensitivity to orbital periods shorter than ~10-20 min (e.g. Lamberts et al. 2019). Assessing the nature of the binary components - and deriving masses, temperatures and compositions - requires systematic electromagnetic characterisation that breaks gravitational-wave degeneracies and enables full atmospheric and orbital solutions. At present, no dedicated facility or coordinated survey is planned to deliver electromagnetic follow-up at the scale necessary to maximise the science return of the millihertz gravitational-wave data; this white paper discusses the need and requirements of such a capability.</description>

      <title>Toward the time-domain spectroscopic study of the dynamic life of stars: from accretion to magnetic activity</title>

Abstract: Stars and planets can be seen as the second fundamental building blocks of baryons in the universe (only second to the dust and gas in molecular clouds). Their formation involves dust grain growth of many orders of magnitude and a myriad of processes operating at time scales from a few tens to millions of years. Thus, investigating the formation and evolution of young stellar objects (YSOs) is of great importance in modern astronomy. Addressing this goal requires overcoming long-standing challenges in characterizing multifaceted phenomena that span a broad range of astrophysical processes (from protoplanetary disk evolution and planet formation to accretion dynamics and transient stellar events). Also, YSOs are complex systems that consist of several components: a central forming object, surrounded by a medium or disk from which the accretion process is at work, supersonic ejection of plasma in the form of collimated bipolar jets (which interact with the ambient medium through which they propagate) and all these components emit in a wide range of wavelengths. A facility capable of simultaneously tackling these diverse questions must deliver long-term, high-cadence spectroscopic monitoring of YSOs over time spans of at least a decade; especially because accretion/ejection processes in YSOs are characterized by a wide range of temporal variability: from short-term (hours-days) to long-term (months-years) variability due to rotation, accretion, magnetic activity, etc. Such a mission demands a spectroscopic platform considering a solid time-domain astronomy framework, providing repeated observations over wide fields and supporting multiple cadence strategies tailored to distinct scientific objectives.</description>

      <title>Transients as Determinants of Habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar magnetic activity, manifested through spots (faculae and flares), fundamentally shapes the exoplanets' environments. For low-mass stars in particular, where most habitable-zone planets reside, the variable magnetic phenomena can dominate atmospheric chemistry, surface radiation levels, long-term atmospheric escape, and ultimately habitability. However, physical characteristics of these transients (e.g. energy and temperature) and their spectra remain ill-constrained due to limitations in cadence and magnitude access of current spectroscopic facilities. A next-generation 12-m class ground-based observatory equipped with integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) and multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) at R$\sim$4,000 and $\sim$40,000 offers a transformational opportunity to characterize stellar activity in the time domain across large samples of exoplanet host stars. Such a facility would enable simultaneous monitoring of continuum variability, chromospheric and coronal line diagnostics, and particle-accelerated flare signatures, resolving the physics driving space weather and quantifying its impact on planetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Soot Planets instead of Water Worlds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some low-density exoplanets are thought to be water-rich worlds that formed beyond the snow line of their protoplanetary disc, possibly accreting coequal portions of rock and water. However, the compositions of bodies within the Solar System and the stability of volatile-rich solids in accretionary disks suggest that a planet rich in water should also acquire as much as 40% refractory organic carbon (``soot''). This would reduce the water mass fraction well below 50%, making the composition of these planets similar to those of Solar System comets. Here we show that soot-rich planets, with or without water, can account for the low average densities of exoplanets that were previously attributed to a binary combination of rock and water. Formed in locations beyond the soot and/or snow lines in disks, these planets are likely common in our galaxy and already observed by JWST. The surfaces and interiors of soot-rich planets will be influenced by the chemical and physical properties of carbonaceous phases, and the atmospheres of such planets may contain plentiful methane and other hydrocarbons, with implications for photochemical haze generation and habitability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A handful of enigmatic Jupiter-mass objects have been discovered orbiting pulsars. One such object, PSR\,J2322-2650b, uniquely resembles a hot Jupiter exoplanet due to its minimum density of 1.8 g/cm^3 and its ~1900 K equilibrium temperature. We use JWST to observe PSR J2322-2650b's emission spectrum across an entire orbit. In stark contrast to every known exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence star, we find an atmosphere rich in molecular carbon (C3, C2) with strong westward winds. Our observations open up new exoplanetary chemical (ultra-high C/O and C/N ratios of &gt;100 and &gt;10,000, respectively) and dynamical regimes (ultra-fast rotation with external irradiation) to observational study. The extreme carbon enrichment poses a severe challenge to the current understanding of ``black widow'' companions, which were expected to consist of a wider range of elements due to their origins as stripped stellar cores.</description>

      <title>HD 143811 AB b: A Directly Imaged Planet Orbiting a Spectroscopic Binary in Sco-Cen</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present confirmation of HD 143811 AB b, a substellar companion to spectroscopic binary HD 143811 AB through direct imaging with the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) and Keck NIRC2. HD 143811 AB was observed as a part of the Gemini Planet Imager Exoplanet Survey (GPIES) in 2016 and 2019 and is a member of the Sco-Cen star formation region. The exoplanet is detected $\sim 430$ mas from the host star by GPI. With two GPI epochs and one from Keck/NIRC2 in 2022, we confirm through common proper motion analysis that the object is bound to its host star. We derive an orbit with a semi-major axis of $64 ^{+32}_{-14}$ au and eccentricity ${0.23 ^{+0.24}_{-0.16}}$. Spectral analysis of the GPI $H$-band spectrum and NIRC2 \textit{L'} photometry provides additional proof that this object is a substellar companion. We compare the spectrum of HD 143811 AB b to PHOENIX stellar models and Exo-REM exoplanet atmosphere models and find that Exo-REM models provide the best fits to the data. From the Exo-REM models, we derive an effective temperature of $1042^{+178}_{-132}$ K for the planet and translate the derived luminosity of the planet to a mass of $5.6 \pm 1.1~M_\textrm{Jup}$ assuming hot-start evolutionary models. HD 143811 AB b is the first directly imaged planet around a binary that is not on an ultra-wide orbit. Future characterization of this object will shed light on the formation of planets around binary star systems.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Cloud-Driven Atmospheric Dynamics &amp; Chemistry of an Isolated Exoplanet Analog with Harmonic Signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02260v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Young planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs near the L/T spectral transition exhibit enhanced spectrophotometric variability over field brown dwarfs. Patchy clouds, auroral processes, stratospheric hot spots, and complex carbon chemistry have all been proposed as potential sources of this variability. Using time-resolved, low-to-mid-resolution spectroscopy collected with the JWST/NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments, we apply harmonic analysis to SIMP J013656.5+093347, a highly variable, young, isolated planetary-mass object. Odd harmonics (k = 3) at pressure levels ~ 1 bar, corresponding to iron and forsterite cloud formation, suggest a potential North-South hemispheric asymmetry in the cloudy, and likely equatorial, regions. We use the inferred harmonics, along with 1-D substellar atmospheric models, to map the flux variability by atmospheric pressure level. We identify distinct time-varying structures in the near-infrared that we interpret as planetary-scale wave (e.g., Rossby or Kelvin)-associated cloud modulation. We detect deviations from bulk (composite) variability in water (S/N = 14.0), carbon monoxide (S/N = 13.0), and methane (S/N = 14.9) molecular signatures. Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying carbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane absorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric chemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct harmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands, providing evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry. At the lowest pressures (&lt; 100 mbar), we find mapped methane lines transition from absorption to emission, supporting evidence of high-altitude auroral heating via electron precipitation.</description>

Abstract: Cometary activity from interstellar objects provides a unique window into the environs of other stellar systems. We report blue-sensitive integral field unit spectroscopy of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS from the Keck-II-mounted Keck Cosmic Web Imager on August 24, 2025 UT. We confirm previously reported CN and Ni outgassing, and present, for the first time, the radial profiles of Ni and CN emission in 3I/ATLAS. We find a characteristic $e$-folding radius of $593.7\pm14.8$ km for Ni and $841.0\pm15.4$ km for CN; this suggests that the Ni emission is more centrally concentrated in the nucleus of the comet and favors hypotheses involving easily dissociated species such as metal carbonyls or metal-polycyclic-aromatic-hydrocarbon molecules. Additional integral field spectroscopy after perihelion will offer a continued opportunity to determine the evolution of the radial distributions of species in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen-line profiles from accreting gas giants and their CPDs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Far fewer gas giants have been caught in their accretion phase than mature ones are known. Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) instruments will have a higher sensitivity and a smaller inner working angle than instruments up to now, which should allow more productive searches and detailed characterisation. We study the observability of accreting gas giants with METIS, the first-generation ELT spectrograph. We focus on the accretion-tracing hydrogen recombination lines accessible at a resolution R=1e5, mainly Brackett alpha and Pfund-series lines. Our approach is general but we take PDS 70 b as a fiducial case. To calculate high-resolution line profiles, we combine a semianalytical multidimensional description of the flow onto an accreting planet and its circumplanetary disc (CPD) with local non-equilibrium shock-emission models. We assume the limiting scenario of no extinction appropriate for gas giants in gaps and negligible contribution from magnetospheric accretion columns. We use simulated detector sensitivities to compute required observing times. Both the planet surface and the CPD surface shocks contribute to the total line profile, which is non-Gaussian and much narrower than the free-fall velocity. For the adopted baseline accretion rate onto PDS 70 b, the Br alpha line peak is equal to the photospheric continuum modulated mostly by water features. However, the rotation of the planet broadens the features, helping the shock excess stand out. At Br alpha, already the continuum of PDS 70 b should yield SNR=12 in 4 h. The peak excess should require only about 15 min to reach SNR=3. Br alpha is a potent planet formation tracer accessible to METIS in little integration time. Resolved line profiles will place independent constraints especially on the mass and radius of an accreting planet, and help identify the accretion mechanism(s) at work.</description>

      <title>Systematic determination of dust properties for a sample of 133 spatially resolved debris discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determination of the composition and size distribution of dust grains in debris discs is strongly dependent on constraining the underlying spatial distribution of that dust through multi-wavelength, spatially resolved imaging spanning near-infrared to millimetre wavelengths. To date, spatially resolved imaging exists for well over a hundred debris disc systems. Simple analytical radiative transfer models of debris dust emission can reveal trends in disc properties as a function of their host stars' luminosities. Here we present such an analysis for 133 debris discs, calculating the dust grain minimum sizes ($s_{\rm min}$), dust masses ($M_{\rm dust}$), and exponents of the size distribution ($q$) in conjunction with their architectures determined at far-infrared or millimetre wavelengths. The distribution of $q$ at far-infrared to millimetre wavelengths is characterised for the first time, finding a value of $3.49^{+0.38}_{-0.33}$. We further newly identify a trend between $q$ and $R_{\rm disc}$, which may be indicative of velocity dependent fragmentation, or grain growth at large radii. We find the disc masses inferred from this analysis are consistent with those of protoplanetary discs. Finally, we identify samples of debris discs suitable for further characterisation at millimetre and centimetre wavelengths, expanding the number of spatially resolved systems upon which future studies of these statistics can be based.</description>

      <title>Very Large Telescope Observations of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS. II. From Quiescence to Glow: Dramatic Rise of Ni i Emission and Incipient CN Outgassing at Large Heliocentric Distances*</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report VLT spectroscopy of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025~N1) from $r_{\rm h}\!\simeq\!4.4$ to $2.85$~au using X-shooter (300--550\,nm, $R\!\simeq\!3000$) and UVES (optical, $R\!\simeq\!35k-80k$). The coma is dust-dominated with a fairly constant red optical continuum slope ($\sim$21--22\%/1000\AA). We report detection of CN emission and also detect numerous Ni\,\textsc{ii}~lines while Fe\,\textsc{i}~remains undetected, potentially implying efficiently released gas-phase Ni. At $r_{\rm h}\!\simeq\!3.14$~au we derive $3\sigma$ limits of $Q({\rm OH})&lt;{1.48\times10^{26}}\ {\rm s^{-1}}$, but find no indications for [O\,\textsc{i}], C$_2$, C$_3$ or NH$_2$. From our latest X-shooter measurements conducted on 2025-08-21 ($r_{\rm h} = 2.85$\,au) we measure production rates of $\log~Q(\mathrm{CN}) = {24.81\pm 0.01}$ molecules s$^{-1}$ and $\log~Q$(Ni) $= {23.30\pm0.07}$ atoms s$^{-1}$, and characterize their evolution as the comet approaches perihelion.~We observe a steep heliocentric-distance scaling for the production rates $Q(\mathrm{Ni}) \propto r_h^{{-7.7 \pm 1.0}}$ and for $Q(\mathrm{CN}) \propto r_h^{{-6.7 \pm 0.2}}$, and predict a Ni--CO$_{(2)}$ correlation if the Ni\,\textsc{ii}\ emission is driven by the carbonyl formation channel.~Energetic considerations of activation barriers show that this behavior is inconsistent with direct sublimation of canonical metal/sulfide phases and instead favors low--activation--energy release from dust, e.g.~photon-stimulated desorption or mild thermolysis of metalated organics or Ni-rich nanophases, possibly including Ni--carbonyl-like complexes.~These hypotheses are testable with future coordinated ground-based and space-based monitoring as 3I becomes more active during its continued passage through the solar system.</description>

      <title>Dual-Backend Multibeam Position Switching Targeted SETI Observations toward Nearby Active Planet-Hosting Systems with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09654</link>

Abstract: The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, lists the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) as one of its key scientific objectives. In this work, we present a targeted SETI observation for 7 nearby active stars utilizing the FAST L-band multibeam receiver, employing a observational strategy that combines position switching with multibeam tracking to balance on-source integration time with the accuracy of the beam response. Using both pulsar and SETI backends, we perform a comprehensive search for narrowband drifting signals with Doppler drift rates within diversified drift rate ranges and channel-width periodic signal with periods between 0.12 and 100 s and duty cycles between 10% and 50%. No credible radio technosignatures were detected from any of the target systems. Based on this null result, we place constraints on the presence of transmitters at a 95% confidence level, ruling out narrowband transmitters with with EIRP above $3.98\times10^8 \,\mathrm{W}$ and periodic transmitter with EIRP above $1.80\times10^{10} \,\mathrm{W}$,respectively, within the observation band.</description>

      <title>The EBLM project XVI. Moderate spin-orbit misalignment of the low mass eclipsing binary EBLM J0021-16</title>

Abstract: Thousands of tight ($&lt;1$ AU) main sequence binaries have been discovered, but it is uncertain how they formed. There is likely too much angular momentum in a collapsing, fragmenting protostellar cloud to form such binaries in situ, suggesting some post processing. One probe of a binary's dynamical history is the angle between the stellar spin and orbital axes -- its obliquity. The classical method for determining stellar obliquity is the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. It has been applied to over 100 hot Jupiters, but less than a dozen stellar binaries. In this paper, we present the Rossiter-McLaughlin measurement of EBLM J0021-16, a $0.19M_\odot$ M-dwarf eclipsing a $1.05M_\odot$ G-dwarf on a 5.97 day, almost-circular orbit. We combine CORALIE spectroscopy with TESS photometry and a measured primary star rotation period of 7.04 days, according to star spot modulation. We show that the orbital axis is misaligned with the primary star's spin axis, with a true 3D obliquity of $\psi=28.9\pm2.1^{\circ}$. EBLM J0021-16, being neither spin-orbit aligned nor synchronized, yet with an almost circular orbit, is a curious case for tidal evolution in tight binaries. It becomes one of a handful of eclipsing binaries with true obliquity measurements. Finally, we derive the M-dwarf's mass and radius to a fractional precision better than 1\%. The radius of the M-dwarf is inflated by 6\% ($7.4\sigma$) with respect to stellar models, consistent with many other M-dwarfs in the literature.</description>

      <title>The HIP 54515 b Superjovian Planet as an Early, Critical Look at the Roman Coronagraph's Performance in the Faint Target Star, Small IWA Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Roman Coronagraph's capabilities in the faint star, small IWA limit has enormous scientific (programmatic) impacts. Testing its performance in this limit provides a first look at challenges that may be encountered with the Habitable Worlds Observatory in imaging rocky planets around the nearest K and M stars. We propose such a rigorous test with the HLC/575nm targeting a newly-discovered superjovian planet HIP 54515 b, whose predicted contrast is $\sim$4.7 $\times$10$^{-8}$--2.5 $\times$10$^{-7}$. The companion lies close to the coronagraph IWA (well interior to the TTR5 performance region) and orbits a V = 6.8 star, near the limit for which the coronagraph may yield deep contrasts. Multiple reference stars are available that will further test CGI's performance as a function of $\Delta$ pitch angle to assess how the telescope's thermal environment impacts contrasts.</description>
