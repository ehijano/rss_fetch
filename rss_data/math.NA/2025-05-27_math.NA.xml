      <title>A deep solver for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first deep-learning solver for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (BSVIEs) and their fully-coupled forward-backward variants. The method trains a neural network to approximate the two solution fields in a single stage, avoiding the use of nested time-stepping cycles that limit classical algorithms. For the decoupled case we prove a non-asymptotic error bound composed of an a posteriori residual plus the familiar square root dependence on the time step. Numerical experiments confirm this rate and reveal two key properties: \emph{scalability}, in the sense that accuracy remains stable from low dimension up to 500 spatial variables while GPU batching keeps wall-clock time nearly constant; and \emph{generality}, since the same method handles coupled systems whose forward dynamics depend on the backward solution. These results open practical access to a family of high-dimensional, path-dependent problems in stochastic control and quantitative finance.</description>

      <title>A structure-preserving local discontinuous Galerkin method for the Fokker-Planck-Landau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a structure-preserving local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method \cite{cockburn1998local} for solving the non-local non-linear Fokker-Planck-Landau (FPL) equations. We rephrase the structure-preserving strategy of Shiroto and Sentoku\cite{shiroto2019structure} in the language of numerical analysis, and extend it to the LDG framework. We propose a method that is not only conservative, but also stabilized through upwind flux. The apparent contradiction between conservation laws and numerical stabilization is elegantly resolved by leveraging the properties of the jump terms inherent to the LDG framework. In the numerical experiments, our scheme is tested with benchmark examples.</description>

      <title>Local Taylor-based polynomial quasi-Trefftz spaces for scalar linear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trefftz-type of Galerkin methods for numerical PDEs use discrete spaces of problem-dependent functions. While Trefftz methods leverage discrete spaces of local exact solutions to the governing PDE, Taylor-based quasi-Trefftz methods leverage discrete spaces of local approximate solutions to the governing PDE. This notion of approximate solution, understood in the sense of a small Taylor remainder, is defined for differential operators with smooth variable coefficients. In both cases, it is possible to use discrete spaces much smaller than standard polynomial space to achieve the same orders of approximation properties.
  The present work is the first systematic study of local Taylor-based polynomial quasi-Trefftz spaces characterized as the kernel of the quasi-Trefftz operator, defined as the composition of Taylor truncation with the differential operator. The proposed linear algebra framework reveals the general structure of this linear operator and applies to any non-trivial linear scalar differential operator with smooth coefficients. It results in a fully explicit procedure to construct a local quasi-Trefftz basis valid in all dimension and for operators of any order, guaranteeing a minimal computational cost for the construction of these equation-dependent bases.
  The local quasi-Trefftz space is formally defined as the kernel of a linear operator between spaces of polynomials. The systematic approach relies on a detailed study of the structure of this operator, strongly leveraging the graded structure of polynomial spaces.</description>

      <title>AMG with Filtering: An Efficient Preconditioner for Interior Point Methods in Large-Scale Contact Mechanics Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale contact mechanics simulations are crucial in many engineering fields such as structural design and manufacturing. In the frictionless case, contact can be modeled by minimizing an energy functional; however, these problems are often nonlinear, non-convex, and increasingly difficult to solve as mesh resolution increases. In this work, we employ a Newton-based interior-point (IP) filter line-search method; an effective approach for large-scale constrained optimization. While this method converges rapidly, each iteration requires solving a large saddle-point linear system that becomes ill-conditioned as the optimization process converges, largely due to IP treatment of the contact constraints. Such ill-conditioning can hinder solver scalability and increase iteration counts with mesh refinement. To address this, we introduce a novel preconditioner, AMG with Filtering (AMGF), tailored to the Schur complement of the saddle-point system. Building on the classical algebraic multigrid (AMG) solver, commonly used for elasticity, we augment it with a specialized subspace correction that filters near null space components introduced by contact interface constraints. Through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments on a range of linear and nonlinear contact problems, we demonstrate that the proposed solver achieves mesh independent convergence and maintains robustness against the ill-conditioning that notoriously plagues IP methods. These results indicate that AMGF makes contact mechanics simulations more tractable and broadens the applicability of Newton-based IP methods in challenging engineering scenarios. More broadly, AMGF is well suited for problems, optimization or otherwise, where solver performance is limited by a problematic low-dimensional subspace. This makes the method widely applicable beyond contact mechanics and constrained optimization.</description>

      <title>A generalized Riemann problem solver for a hyperbolic model of two-layer thin film flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a second-order generalized Riemann problem (GRP) solver is developed for a two-layer thin film model. Extending the first-order Godunov approach, the solver is used to construct a temporal-spatial coupled second-order GRP-based finite-volume method. Numerical experiments including comparisons to MUSCL finite-volume schemes with Runge-Kutta time stepping confirm the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of the higher-order ansatz.
  The construction of GRP methods requires to compute temporal derivatives of intermediate states in the entropy solution of the generalized Riemann problem. These derivatives are obtained from the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions as well as a characteristic decomposition using Riemann invariants. Notably, the latter can be computed explicitly for the two-layer thin film model, which renders this system to be very suitable for the GRP approach. Moreover, it becomes possible to determine the derivatives in an explicit, computationally cheap way.</description>

      <title>Automatic Verification of Floating-Point Accumulation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floating-point accumulation networks (FPANs) are key building blocks used in many floating-point algorithms, including compensated summation and double-double arithmetic. FPANs are notoriously difficult to analyze, and algorithms using FPANs are often published without rigorous correctness proofs. In fact, on at least one occasion, a published error bound for a widely used FPAN was later found to be incorrect. In this paper, we present an automatic procedure that produces computer-verified proofs of several FPAN correctness properties, including error bounds that are tight to the nearest bit. Our approach is underpinned by a novel floating-point abstraction that models the sign, exponent, and number of leading and trailing zeros and ones in the mantissa of each number flowing through an FPAN. We also present a new FPAN for double-double addition that is faster and more accurate than the previous best known algorithm.</description>

      <title>Discrete gradient methods for port-Hamiltonian differential-algebraic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete gradient methods are a powerful tool for the time discretization of dynamical systems, since they are structure-preserving regardless of the form of the total energy. In this work, we discuss the application of discrete gradient methods to the system class of nonlinear port-Hamiltonian differential-algebraic equations - as they emerge from the port- and energy-based modeling of physical systems in various domains. We introduce a novel numerical scheme tailored for semi-explicit differential-algebraic equations and further address more general settings using the concepts of discrete gradient pairs and Dirac-dissipative structures. Additionally, the behavior under system transformations is investigated and we demonstrate that under suitable assumptions port-Hamiltonian differential-algebraic equations admit a representation which consists of a parametrized port-Hamiltonian semi-explicit system and an unstructured equation. Finally, we present the application to multibody system dynamics and discuss numerical results to demonstrate the capabilities of our approach.</description>

      <title>Unconditionally Stable Mixed Finite Element Methods for Darcy Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconditionally stable finite element methods for Darcy flow are derived by adding least-squares residual forms of the governing equations to the classical mixed formulations. The proposed methods are free of mesh dependent stabilization parameters and allow the use of the classical continuous Lagrangian finite element spaces of any order for the velocity and the potential. Stability, convergence and error estimates are derived and numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed finite element formulations and to confirm the predicted rates of convergence.</description>

      <title>Error estimates for the interpolation and approximation of gradients and vector fields on protected Delaunay meshes in $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One frequently needs to interpolate or approximate gradients on simplicial meshes. Unfortunately, there are very few explicit mathematical results governing the interpolation or approximation of vector-valued functions on Delaunay meshes in more than two dimensions. Most of the existing results are tailored towards interpolation with piecewise linear polynomials. In contrast, interpolation with piecewise high-order polynomials is not well understood. In particular, the results in this area are sometimes difficult to immediately interpret, or to specialize to the Delaunay setting. In order to address this issue, we derive explicit error estimates for high-order, piecewise polynomial gradient interpolation and approximation on protected Delaunay meshes. In addition, we generalize our analysis beyond gradients, and obtain error estimates for sufficiently-smooth vector fields. Throughout the paper, we show that the quality of interpolation and approximation often depends (in part) on the minimum thickness of simplices in the mesh. Fortunately, the minimum thickness can be precisely controlled on protected Delaunay meshes in $\mathbb{R}^d$.</description>

      <title>Weak Physics Informed Neural Networks for Geometry Compatible Hyperbolic Conservation Laws on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), owing to their mesh-free nature, offer a powerful approach for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) in complex geometries, including irregular domains. This capability effectively circumvents the challenges of mesh generation that traditional numerical methods face in high-dimensional or geometrically intricate settings. While recent studies have extended PINNs to manifolds, the theoretical foundations remain scarce. Existing theoretical analyses of PINNs in Euclidean space often rely on smoothness assumptions for the solutions. However, recent empirical evidence indicates that PINNs may struggle to approximate solutions with low regularity, such as those arising from nonlinear hyperbolic equations. In this paper, we develop a framework for PINNs tailored to the efficient approximation of weak solutions, particularly nonlinear hyperbolic equations defined on manifolds. We introduce a novel weak PINN (wPINN) formulation on manifolds that leverages the well-posedness theory to approximate entropy solutions of geometry-compatible hyperbolic conservation laws on manifolds. Employing tools from approximation theory, we establish a convergence analysis of the algorithm, including an analysis of approximation errors for time-dependent entropy solutions. This analysis provides insight into the accumulation of approximation errors over long time horizons. Notably, the network complexity depends only on the intrinsic dimension, independent of the ambient space dimension. Our results match the minimax rate in the d-dimensional Euclidean space, demonstrating that PINNs can alleviate the curse of dimensionality in the context of low-dimensional manifolds. Finally, we validate the performance of the proposed wPINN framework through numerical experiments, confirming its ability to efficiently approximate entropy solutions on manifolds.</description>

      <title>State-based nested iteration solution of optimal control problems with PDE constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an abstract framework for the numerical solution of optimal control problems (OCPs) subject to partial differential equations (PDEs). Examples include not only the distributed control of elliptic PDEs such as the Poisson equation discussed in this paper in detail but also parabolic and hyperbolic equations. The approach covers the standard $L^2$ setting as well as the more recent energy regularization, also including state and control constraints. We discretize OCPs subject to parabolic or hyperbolic PDEs by means of space-time finite elements similar as in the elliptic case. We discuss regularization and finite element error estimates, and derive an optimal relation between the regularization parameter and the finite element mesh size in order to balance the accuracy, and the energy costs for the corresponding control. Finally, we also discuss the efficient solution of the resulting systems of algebraic equations, and their use in a state-based nested iteration procedure that allows us to compute finite element approximations to the state and the control in asymptotically optimal complexity. The numerical results illustrate the theoretical findings quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Efficient and robust solvers for a cell-by-cell dual-poroelasticity problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a scalable and robust solver for a cell-by-cell dual-poroelasticity model, describing the mechanical interactions between brains cells embedded in extracellular space. Explicitly representing the complex cellular shapes, the proposed approach models both intracellular and extracellular spaces as distinct poroelastic media, separated by a permeable cell membrane which allows hydrostatic and osmotic pressure-driven fluid exchange. The solver, which employs a three-field (displacement, total pressure, and fluid pressure) formulation, leverages the framework of norm-equivalent preconditioning and appropriately fitted norms to ensure robustness across all material parameters of the model. Scalability for large and complex geometries is achieved through efficient Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) approximations of the preconditioners' individual blocks. Furthermore, we accommodate diverse boundary conditions, including full Dirichlet boundary conditions for displacement, which we handle efficiently using the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula. Numerical experiments demonstrate the preconditioners' robustness and performance across various parameters relevant to realistic scenarios, and a large scale example of cellular swelling on a dense reconstruction of the mouse visual cortex highlights the method's potential for investigating complex physiological processes like cellular volume regulation in detailed biological structures.</description>

      <title>Efficient isogeometric Boundary Element simulation of elastic domains containing thin inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the Boundary Element simulation of elastic domains that contain thin inclusions that have elastic material properties, which are different to the domain. With thin inclusions we mean inclusions with extreme aspect ratios, i.e. where one dimension is much smaller than the other ones. Examples of this are reinforcements in civil/mechanical engineering or concrete linings in underground construction. The fact that an inclusion has an extreme aspect ratio poses a challenge to the numerical integration of the arising singular integrals and novel approaches are presented to deal with it. Several examples demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed methods and show that the results are in good agreement with analytical and other numerical solutions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic numerical hypocoercivity of the space-time discontinuous Galerkin method for Kolmogorov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with discretisations of the classical Kolmogorov equation by a standard space-time discontinuous Galerkin method. Kolmogorov equation serves as simple, yet rich enough in the present context, model problem for a wide range of kinetic-type equations: although it involves diffusion in one of the two spatial dimensions only, the combined nature of the first order transport/drift term and the degenerate diffusion are sufficient to `propagate dissipation' across the spatial domain in its entirety. This is a manifestation of the celebrated concept of hypocoercivity, a term coined and studied extensively by Villani in [27]. We show that the standard, classical, space-time discontinuous Galerkin method, admits a corresponding hypocoercivity property at the discrete level, asymptotically for large times. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of this kind for any standard Galerkin scheme. This property is shown by proving one part of a discrete inf-sup-type stability result for the method in a family of norms dictated by a modified scalar product motivated by the theory in [27]. This family of norms contains the full gradient of the numerical solution, thereby allowing for a full spectral gap/Poincar\'e-type inequality at the discrete level, thus, showcasing a subtle, discretisation-parameter-dependent, numerical hypocoercivity property. Further, we show that the space-time discontinuous Galerkin method is inf-sup stable in the family of norms containing the full gradient of the numerical solution, which may be a result of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents spline-based coupling methods for partitioned multiphysics simulations, specifically designed for isogeometric analysis (IGA) based solvers. Traditional vertex-based coupling approaches face significant challenges when applied to IGA solvers, including geometric accuracy issues, interpolation errors, and substantial communication overhead. The methodology draws on the IGA mathematical framework to deliver coupling solutions that preserve high-order continuity and exact geometric representation of splines. We develop two complementary strategies: (1) a spline-vertex coupling method enabling efficient interaction between IGA and conventional solvers, and (2) a fully isogeometric coupling approach maximizing accuracy for IGA-to-IGA communication.
  Both theoretical analysis and extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our spline-based methods significantly reduce communication overhead compared to traditional approaches while enhancing geometric accuracy through exact boundary representation and maintaining higher-order solution continuity across coupled interfaces. We quantitatively confirm communication efficiency benefits through systematic measurements of transfer times and data volumes across various mesh refinement levels. Our benchmark studies demonstrate geometric fidelity advantages while highlighting how splines naturally preserve solution derivatives across interfaces without requiring additional computation. This work provides efficient coupling strategies tailored to IGA-based solvers and establishes a practical bridge between IGA and traditional discretization methods, enabling broader adoption of IGA in established simulation workflows.</description>

      <title>Selective focusing of multiple particles in a layered medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse scattering in layered media has a wide range of applications, examples including geophysical exploration, medical imaging, and remote sensing. In this paper, we develop a selective focusing method for identifying multiple unknown buried scatterers in a layered medium. The method is derived through the asymptotic analysis of the time reversal operator using the layered Green's function and limited aperture measurements. We begin by showing the global focusing property of the time reversal operator. Then we demonstrate that each small sound-soft particle gives rise to one significant eigenvalue of the time reversal operator, while each sound-hard particle gives three. The associated eigenfunction generates an incident wave focusing selectively on the corresponding unknown particle. Finally, we employ the time reversal method as an initial indicator and propose an effective Bayesian inversion scheme to reconstruct multiple buried extended scatterers for enhanced resolution. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the efficiency.</description>

      <title>Reduced-Order Solution for Rarefied Gas Flow by Proper Generalised Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling rarefied gas flow via the Boltzmann equation plays a vital role in many areas. Due to the high dimensionality of this kinetic equation and the coexistence of multiple characteristic scales in the transport processes, conventional solution strategies incur prohibitively high computational costs and are inadequate for rapid response for parametric analysis and optimisation loops in engineering design simulations. This paper proposes an \textit{a priori} reduced-order method based on the proper generalised decomposition to solve the high-dimensional, parametrised Shakhov kinetic model equation. This method reduces the original problem into a few low-dimensional problem by formulating separated representations for the low-rank solution, as well as data and operators in the equation, thereby overcoming the curse of dimensionality. Furthermore, a general solution can be calculated once and for all in the whole range of the rarefaction parameter, enabling fast and multiple queries to a specific solution at any point in the parameter space. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the capability of the method to simulate rarefied gas flow with high accuracy and significant reduction in CPU time and memory requirements.</description>

      <title>Solving Implicit Inverse Problems with Homotopy-Based Regularization Path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit inverse problems, in which noisy observations of a physical quantity are used to infer a nonlinear functional applied to an associated function, are inherently ill posed and often exhibit non uniqueness of solutions. Such problems arise in a range of domains, including the identification of systems governed by Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations (ODEs/PDEs), optimal control, and data assimilation. Their solution is complicated by the nonlinear nature of the underlying constraints and the instability introduced by noise. In this paper, we propose a homotopy based optimization method for solving such problems. Beginning with a regularized constrained formulation that includes a sparsity promoting regularization term, we employ a gradient based algorithm in which gradients with respect to the model parameters are efficiently computed using the adjoint state method. Nonlinear constraints are handled through a Newton Raphson procedure. By solving a sequence of problems with decreasing regularization, we trace a solution path that improves stability and enables the exploration of multiple candidate solutions. The method is applied to the latent dynamics discovery problem in simulation, highlighting performance as a function of ground truth sparsity and semi convergence behavior.</description>

      <title>On some coupled local and nonlocal diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study problems in which a local model is coupled with a nonlocal one. We propose two energies: both of them are based on the same classical weighted $H^1$-semi norm to model the local part, while two different weighted $H^s$-semi norms, with $s \in (0,1)$, are used to model the nonlocal part. The corresponding strong formulations are derived. In doing so, one needs to develop some technical tools, such as suitable integration by parts formulas for operators with variable diffusivity, and one also needs to study the mapping properties of the Neumann operators that arise. In contrast to problems coupling purely local models, in which one requires transmission conditions on the interface between the subdomains, the presence of a nonlocal operator may give rise to nonlocal fluxes. These nonlocal fluxes may enter the problem as a source term, thereby changing its structure. Finally, we focus on a specific problem, that we consider most relevant, and study regularity of solutions and finite element discretizations. We provide numerical experiments to illustrate the most salient features of the models.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Adaptive Finite Element Algorithms for a Regularized Variational Model of Quasi-Static Brittle Fracture in "Strain-Limiting" Elastic Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rigorous convergence analysis of adaptive finite element methods for regularized variational models of quasi-static brittle fracture in strain-limiting elastic solids is presented. This work introduces two novel adaptive mesh refinement algorithms, based on robust local error indicators, designed to solve the underlying energy minimization problem efficiently. A comprehensive convergence analysis is provided for minimizer sequences generated by these distinct adaptive strategies. It is rigorously demonstrated that sequences from the first algorithm converge to a prescribed tolerance. Notably, the second algorithm is proven to yield inherently convergent sequences without requiring an explicit stopping criterion. The practical efficacy of the proposed adaptive framework is validated through extensive numerical simulations, where critical comparisons of energy components (bulk, surface, and total) demonstrate the performance of the two adaptive algorithms in the case of an edge crack in a strain-limiting solid subjected to anti-plane shear-type loading.</description>

      <title>A Galerkin Alternating Projection Method for Kinetic Equations in the Diffusive Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical approximation of high-dimensional evolution equations poses significant computational challenges, particularly in kinetic theory and radiative transfer. In this work, we introduce the Galerkin Alternating Projection (GAP) scheme, a novel integrator derived within the Dynamical Low-Rank Approximation (DLRA) framework. We perform a rigorous error analysis, establishing local and global accuracy using standard ODE techniques. Furthermore, we prove that GAP possesses the Asymptotic-Preserving (AP) property when applied to the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE), ensuring consistent behavior across both kinetic and diffusive regimes. In the diffusive regime, the K-step of the GAP integrator directly becomes the limit equation. In particular, this means that we can easily obtain schemes that even in the diffusive regime are free of a CFL condition, do not require well prepared initial data, and can have arbitrary order in the diffusive limit (in contrast to the semi-implicit and implicit schemes available in the literature). Numerical experiments support the theoretical findings and demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates for Tikhonov regularization on compact sets: application to neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider ill-posed inverse problems in which the forward operator is continuous and weakly closed, and the sought solution belongs to a weakly closed constraint set. We propose a regularization method based on minimizing the Tikhonov functional on a sequence of compact sets which is dense in the intersection between the domain of the forward operator and the constraint set. The index of the compact sets can be interpreted as an additional regularization parameter. We prove that the proposed method is a regularization, achieving the same convergence rates as classical Tikhonov regularization and attaining the optimal convergence rate when the forward operator is linear. Moreover, we show that our methodology applies to the case where the constrained solution space is parametrized by means of neural networks (NNs), and the constraint is obtained by composing the last layer of the NN with a suitable activation function. In this case the dense compact sets are defined by taking a family of bounded weight NNs with increasing weight bound. Finally, we present some numerical experiments in the case of Computerized Tomography to compare the theoretical behavior of the reconstruction error with that obtained in a finite dimensional and non-asymptotic setting. The numerical tests also show that our NN-based regularization method is able to provide piece-wise constant solutions and to preserve the sharpness of edges, thus achieving lower reconstruction errors compared to the classical Tikhonov approach for the same level of noise in the data.</description>

      <title>Robust feedback control of collisional plasma dynamics in presence of uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fusion aims to confine high-temperature plasma within a device, enabling the fusion of deuterium and tritium nuclei to release energy. Due to the very large temperatures involved, it is essential to isolate the plasma from the device walls to prevent structural damage and the external magnetic fields play a fundamental role in achieving this confinement. In realistic settings, the physical mechanisms governing plasma behavior are highly complex, involving numerous uncertain parameters and intricate particle interactions, such as collisions, that significantly affect both confinement efficiency and overall stability. In this work, we address particularly these challenges by proposing a robust feedback control strategy designed to steer the plasma towards a desired spatial region, despite the presence of uncertainties. From a modeling perspective, we consider a collisional plasma described by a Vlasov-Poisson-BGK system, which accounts for a self-consistent electric field and a strong external magnetic field, while incorporating uncertainty in the model. A key feature of the proposed control strategy is its independence from the random parameter, making it particularly suitable for practical applications. A series of numerical simulations confirms the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrates the ability of external magnetic fields to successfully confine plasma away from the device boundaries, even in the presence of uncertain conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey provides an overview of state-of-the art multirate schemes, which exploit the different time scales in the dynamics of a differential equation model by adapting the computational costs to different activity levels of the system. We start the discussion with the straightforward approach based on interpolating and extrapolating the slow--fast coupling variables; the multirate Euler scheme, used as a base example, falls into this class. Next we discuss higher order multirate schemes that generalize classical singlerate linear multistep, Runge-Kutta, and extrapolation methods.</description>

      <title>A structure-preserving multiscale solver for particle-wave interaction in non-uniform magnetized plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-wave interaction is of fundamental interest in plasma physics, especially in the study of runaway electrons in magnetic confinement fusion. Analogous to the concept of photons and phonons, wave packets in plasma can also be treated as quasi-particles, called plasmons. To model the ``mixture" of electrons and plasmons in plasma, a set of ``collisional" kinetic equations has been derived, based on weak turbulence limit and the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation.
  There are two main challenges in solving the electron-plasmon kinetic system numerically. Firstly, non-uniform plasma density and magnetic field results in high dimensionality and the presence of multiple time scales. Secondly, a physically reliable numerical solution requires a structure-preserving scheme that enforces the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy.
  In this paper, we propose a struture-preserving multiscale solver for particle-wave interaction in non-uniform magnetized plasmas. The solver combines a conservative local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) scheme for the interaction part with a trajectory averaging method for the plasmon Hamiltonian flow part. Numerical examples for a non-uniform magnetized plasma in an infinitely long symmetric cylinder are presented. It is verified that the LDG scheme rigorously preserves all the conservation laws, and the trajectory averaging method significantly reduces the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Verifiability and Limit Consistency of Eddy Viscosity Large Eddy Simulation Reduced Order Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large eddy simulation reduced order models (LES-ROMs) are ROMs that leverage LES ideas (e.g., filtering and closure modeling) to construct accurate and efficient ROMs for convection-dominated (e.g., turbulent) flows. Eddy viscosity (EV) ROMs (e.g., Smagorinsky ROM (S-ROM)) are LES-ROMs whose closure model consists of a diffusion-like operator in which the viscosity depends on the ROM velocity. We propose the Ladyzhenskaya ROM (L-ROM), which is a generalization of the S-ROM. Furthermore, we prove two fundamental numerical analysis results for the new L-ROM and the classical S-ROM: (i) We prove the verifiability of the L-ROM and S-ROM, i.e, that the ROM error is bounded (up to a constant) by the ROM closure error. (ii) We introduce the concept of ROM limit consistency (in a discrete sense), and prove that the L-ROM and S-ROM are limit consistent, i.e., that as the ROM dimension approaches the rank of the snapshot matrix, $d$, and the ROM lengthscale goes to zero, the ROM solution converges to the \emph{``true solution"}, i.e., the solution of the $d$-dimensional ROM. Finally, we illustrate numerically the verifiability and limit consistency of the new L-ROM and S-ROM in two under-resolved convection-dominated problems that display sharp gradients: (i) the 1D Burgers equation with a small diffusion coefficient; and (ii) the 2D lid-driven cavity flow at Reynolds number $Re=15,000$.</description>

      <title>Online Statistical Inference of Constrained Stochastic Optimization via Random Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constrained stochastic nonlinear optimization problems have attracted significant attention for their ability to model complex real-world scenarios in physics, economics, and biology. As datasets continue to grow, online inference methods have become crucial for enabling real-time decision-making without the need to store historical data. In this work, we develop an online inference procedure for constrained stochastic optimization by leveraging a method called Sketched Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming (SSQP). As a direct generalization of sketched Newton methods, SSQP approximates the objective with a quadratic model and the constraints with a linear model at each step, then applies a sketching solver to inexactly solve the resulting subproblem. Building on this design, we propose a new online inference procedure called random scaling. In particular, we construct a test statistic based on SSQP iterates whose limiting distribution is free of any unknown parameters. Compared to existing online inference procedures, our approach offers two key advantages: (i) it enables the construction of asymptotically valid confidence intervals; and (ii) it is matrix-free, i.e. the computation involves only primal-dual SSQP iterates $(\boldsymbol{x}_t, \boldsymbol{\lambda}_t)$ without requiring any matrix inversions. We validate our theory through numerical experiments on nonlinearly constrained regression problems and demonstrate the superior performance of our random scaling method over existing inference procedures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theoretical framework for optimal probability density control and propose a numerical algorithm that is scalable to solve the control problem in high dimensions. Specifically, we establish the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) for optimal density control and construct the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation of the value functional through rigorous derivations without any concept from Wasserstein theory. To solve the density control problem numerically, we propose to use reduced-order models, such as deep neural networks (DNNs), to parameterize the control vector-field and the adjoint function, which allows us to tackle problems defined on high-dimensional state spaces. We also prove several convergence properties of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate promising performances of our algorithm on a variety of density control problems with obstacles and nonlinear interaction challenges in high dimensions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an extension of the tensor grid method for stray field computation on rectangular domains that incorporates higher-order basis functions. Both the magnetization and the resulting magnetic field are represented using higher-order B-spline bases, which allow for increased accuracy and smoothness. The method employs a super-potential formulation, which circumvents the need to convolve with a singular kernel. The field is represented with high accuracy as a functional Tucker tensor, leveraging separable expansions on the tensor product domain and trained via a multilinear extension of the extreme learning machine methodology. Unlike conventional grid-based methods, the proposed mesh-free approach allows for continuous field evaluation. Numerical experiments confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method, demonstrating exponential convergence of the energy and linear computational scaling with respect to the multilinear expansion rank.</description>

      <title>Rapid Development of Efficient Participant-Specific Computational Models of the Wrist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While computational modeling may help to develop new treatment options for hand and wrist injuries, at present, few models exist. The time and expertise required to develop and use these models is considerable. Moreover, most do not allow for variation of material properties, instead relying on literature reported averages. We have developed a novel automated workflow combining non-linear morphing techniques with various algorithmic techniques to create participant-specific finite element models. Using this workflow, three participant-specific models were created from our existing four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) data. These were then used to perform two analyses to demonstrate the usefulness of the models to investigate clinical questions, namely optimization of ligament properties to participant-specific kinematics, and Monte Carlo (MC) analysis of the impacts of ligament injury on joint contact pressure, as an analogue for joint injury that may lead to osteoarthritis. Participant-specific models can be created in 2 hours and individual simulations performed in 45 seconds. This work lays the groundwork for future patient-specific modeling of the hand and wrist.</description>

      <title>Deep Spectral Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Deep Spectral Prior (DSP), a new formulation of Deep Image Prior (DIP) that redefines image reconstruction as a frequency-domain alignment problem. Unlike traditional DIP, which relies on pixel-wise loss and early stopping to mitigate overfitting, DSP directly matches Fourier coefficients between the network output and observed measurements. This shift introduces an explicit inductive bias towards spectral coherence, aligning with the known frequency structure of images and the spectral bias of convolutional neural networks. We provide a rigorous theoretical framework demonstrating that DSP acts as an implicit spectral regulariser, suppressing high-frequency noise by design and eliminating the need for early stopping. Our analysis spans four core dimensions establishing smooth convergence dynamics, local stability, and favourable bias-variance tradeoffs. We further show that DSP naturally projects reconstructions onto a frequency-consistent manifold, enhancing interpretability and robustness. These theoretical guarantees are supported by empirical results across denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution tasks, where DSP consistently outperforms classical DIP and other unsupervised baselines.</description>

      <title>Computing the matrix exponential and the Cholesky factor of a related finite horizon Gramian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, an efficient numerical method for computing both the matrix exponential and a finite horizon controllability Gramian in Cholesky-factored form is proposed. The method is applicable to general dense matrices of moderate size and produces a Cholesky factor of the Gramian without computing the full product. It is a generalization of the scaling-and-squaring approach for approximating the matrix exponential and exploits a similar doubling formula for the Gramian to compute both at once. The required computational effort is thereby kept modest. Most importantly, a rigorous backward error analysis is provided, which guarantees that the approximation is accurate to the round-off error level in double precision. This accuracy is illustrated in practice on a large number of standard test examples. The method has been implemented in the Julia package FiniteHorizonGramians.jl, which is available online under the MIT license. Code for reproducing the experimental results is included in this package, as well as code for determining the optimal method parameters. The analysis can thus easily be adapted to a different finite-precision arithmetic.</description>

      <title>An Unfitted Interface Penalty DG--FE Method for Elliptic Interface Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15402v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an unfitted interface penalty Discontinuous Galerkin-Finite Element Method (UIPDG-FEM) for elliptic interface problems. This hybrid method combines the interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (IPDG) terms near the interface-enforcing jump conditions via Nitsche method-with standard finite elements away from the interface. The UIPDG-FEM retains the flexibilities of IPDG, particularly simplifying mesh generation around complex interfaces, while avoiding its drawback of excessive number of global degrees of freedom. We derive optimal convergence rates independent of interface location and establish uniform flux error estimates robust to discontinuous coefficients. To deal with conditioning issues caused by small cut elements, we develop a robust two-dimensional merging algorithm that eliminates such elements entirely, ensuring the condition number of the discretized system remains independent of interface position. A key feature of the algorithm is a novel quantification criterion linking the threshold for small cuts to the product of the maximum interface curvature and the local mesh size. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

Abstract: This report provides an investigation into solving the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation in two spatial dimensions (2DKS) using a pseudo-spectral method on various rectangular periodic domains. The Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation is a fluid dynamics model that exhibits dynamical features that are highly dependent on the length of the periodic domain. The goals of this report are to describe the mathematical problem; explain the details of the chosen numerical method; inspect solutions and dynamical features for varying grid sizes, step sizes, and domains; and summarize the findings.</description>

      <title>The Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch equation on polytopal domains: Unique existence and finite element approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch equation (LLBE) describes the evolution of the magnetic spin field in ferromagnets at high temperatures. In this paper, we study the numerical approximation of the LLBE on bounded polytopal domains in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d\le 3$. We first establish the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions to the LLBE and propose a linear, fully discrete, conforming finite element scheme for its approximation. While this scheme is shown to converge, the obtained rate is suboptimal. To address this shortcoming, we introduce a viscous (pseudo-parabolic) regularisation of the LLBE, which we call the $\epsilon$-LLBE. For this regularised problem, we prove the unique existence of strong solutions and establish a rate of convergence of the solution $\boldsymbol{u}^\epsilon$ of the $\epsilon$-LLBE to the solution $\boldsymbol{u}$ of the LLBE as $\epsilon\to 0^+$. Furthermore, we propose a linear, fully discrete, conforming finite element scheme to approximate the solution of the $\epsilon$-LLBE. Given sufficiently smooth initial data, error analysis is performed to show stability and uniform-in-time convergence of the scheme. Finally, several numerical simulations are presented to corroborate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A Novel Interpolation-Based Method for Solving the One-Dimensional Wave Equation on a Domain with a Moving Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16483v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of solving the one-dimensional wave equation on a domain with moving boundary. In J. Math. Phys. 11, 2679 (1970), Moore introduced an interesting method to do so. As only in rare cases, a closed analytical solution is possible, one must turn to perturbative expansions of Moore's method. We investigate the then made minimal assumption for convergence of the perturbation series, namely that the boundary position should be an analytic function of time. Though, we prove here that the latter requirement is not a sufficient condition for Moore's method to converge. We then introduce a novel numerical approach based on interpolation which also works for fast boundary dynamics. In comparison with other state-of-the-art numerical methods, our method offers greater speed if the wave solution needs to be evaluated at many points in time or space, whilst preserving accuracy. We discuss two variants of our method, either based on a conformal coordinate transformation or on the method of characteristics, together with interpolation.</description>

      <title>Estimates of the numerical density for stochastic differential equations with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04991v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the estimates of the density for the traditional Euler-Maruyama discretization of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with multiplicative noise. Our estimates focus on two key aspects: (1) the $L^p$-upper bounds for derivatives of the logarithmic numerical density, (2) the sharp error order of the Euler scheme under the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence). For the first aspect, we present estimates for the first-order and second-order derivatives of the logarithmic numerical density. The key technique is to adopt the Malliavin calculus to derive expressions of the derivatives of the logarithmic Green's function and to obtain an estimate for the inverse Malliavin matrix. Moreover, for the relative entropy error, we obtain a bound that is second order in time step, which then naturally leads to first-order error bounds under the total variation distance and Wasserstein distances. Compared with the usual weak error estimate for SDEs, such estimate can give an error bound for the worst case of a family of test functions instead of one test function.</description>

      <title>Derivatives of the full QR factorisation and of the factored-form and compact WY representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: QR factorisation plays an important role in matrix computations. Within the context of optimisation and of automatic differentiation of such computations, we need to compute the derivative of this factorisation. For tall matrices, however, existing results only cover the so-called thin case. We provide for the first time expressions for the derivative of the full QR factorisation of a tall matrix, in the usual case where the Q factor is a product of Householder reflections. These expressions are obtained based on novel results for the derivative of the compact WY representation of Q, which also yield the derivative of the factored-form representation of Q, both of which are useful on their own. These three results can be used directly in applications such as variable projection for solving separable non-linear least squares problems, and can also extend the current linear algebra capabilities of automatic differentiation frameworks.</description>

      <title>A New Algorithm for Computing the Exponential of a Block Triangular Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exponential of block triangular matrices arises in a wide range of scientific computing applications, including exponential integrators for solving systems of ordinary differential equations, Hamiltonian systems in control theory, sensitivity analysis, and option pricing in finance. We propose a novel algorithm exploiting the block triangular structure for simultaneously computing the exponentials of the diagonal blocks and the off-diagonal block of the matrix exponential without direct involvement of the full block matrix in the computations. This approach generalizes the work of Al-Mohy and Higham on the Fr\'echet derivative of the matrix exponential. The generalization is established through a linear operator framework, facilitating efficient evaluation schemes and rigorous backward error analysis. The algorithm employs the scaling and squaring method using diagonal Pad\'e approximants with algorithmic parameters selected based on the backward error analysis. A key feature is that the selection of the scaling parameter relies solely on the maximal norm of the diagonal blocks with no dependence on the norm of the off-diagonal block. Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms existing algorithms in both accuracy and efficiency, making it a preferred choice for computing the matrix exponential of block triangular matrices.</description>

      <title>The velocity jump Langevin process and its splitting scheme: long time convergence and numerical accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Langevin dynamics is a diffusion process extensively used, in particular in molecular dynamics simulations, to sample Gibbs measures. Some alternatives based on (piecewise deterministic) kinetic velocity jump processes have gained interest over the last decade. One interest of the latter is the possibility to split forces (at the continuous-time level), reducing the numerical cost for sampling the trajectory. Motivated by this, a numerical scheme based on hybrid dynamics combining velocity jumps and Langevin diffusion, numerically more efficient than their classical Langevin counterparts, has been introduced for computational chemistry in [42]. The present work is devoted to the numerical analysis of this scheme. Our main results are, first, the exponential ergodicity of the continuous-time velocity jump Langevin process, second, a Talay-Tubaro expansion of the invariant measure of the numerical scheme on the torus, showing in particular that the scheme is of weak order 2 in the step-size and, third, a bound on the quadratic risk of the corresponding practical MCMC estimator (possibly with Richardson extrapolation). With respect to previous works on the Langevin diffusion, new difficulties arise from the jump operator, which is non-local.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we design an explicit non-resonant low-regularity integrator for the cubic nonlinear stochastic Schr$\ddot{\rm o}$dinger equation (SNLSE) with the aim of allowing long time simulations. First, we carry out a strong error analysis for the new integrator. Next we provide, for small initial data of size $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon), \varepsilon \in (0,1]$, and noise of size $\varepsilon^q, \ q&gt;2$, long-term error estimates in the space $L^{2p}(\Omega, H^1), p\ge 1$, revealing an error of size $\mathcal{O}\left(\tau^{\frac{1}{2}}\cdot \varepsilon^{{\rm min}(2,(q-2))}\right)$ up to time $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$. This is achieved with the regularity compensation oscillation technique \cite{sch0,bao}, which has been here introduced and exploited for the stochastic setting. A numerical experiment confirms the superior long-time behaviour of our new scheme, compared to other existing integrators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an entropy-enhanced Generative Pre-Trained Physics-Informed Neural Network with a transform layer (EGPT-PINN) for solving parameterized nonlinear conservation laws. The EGPT-PINN extends the traditional physics-informed neural networks and its recently proposed generative pre-trained strategy for linear model reduction to nonlinear model reduction and shock-capturing domains. By utilizing an adaptive meta-network, a simultaneously trained transform layer, entropy enhancement strategies, implementable shock interaction analysis, and a separable training process, the EGPT-PINN efficiently captures complex parameter-dependent shock formations and interactions. Numerical results of EGPT-PINN applied to the families of inviscid Burgers' equation and the Euler equations, parameterized by their initial conditions, demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed technique. It accurately solves the viscosity solution via very few neurons without leveraging any {\it a priori} knowledge of the equations or its initial condition. Moreover, via a simple augmentation of the loss function by model-data mismatch, we demonstrate the robustness of EGPT-PINN in solving inverse problems more accurately than the vanilla and entropy-enhanced versions of PINN.</description>

      <title>A subspace-conjugate gradient method for linear matrix equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficient solution of large-scale multiterm linear matrix equations is a challenging task in numerical linear algebra, and it is a largely open problem. We propose a new iterative scheme for symmetric and positive definite operators, significantly advancing methods such as truncated matrix-oriented Conjugate Gradients (CG). The new algorithm capitalizes on the low-rank matrix format of its iterates by fully exploiting the subspace information of the factors as iterations proceed. The approach implicitly relies on orthogonality conditions imposed over much larger subspaces than in CG, unveiling insightful connections with subspace projection methods. The new method is also equipped with memory-saving strategies. In particular, we show that for a given matrix $\mathbf{Y}$, the action $\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{Y})$ in low rank format may not be evaluated exactly due to memory constraints. This problem is often underestimated, though it will eventually produce Out-of-Memory breakdowns for a sufficiently large number of terms. We propose an ad-hoc randomized range-finding strategy that appears to fully resolve this shortcoming. Experimental results with typical application problems illustrate the potential of our approach over various methods developed in the recent literature.</description>

Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) are an effective approach for data-driven modeling of dynamical systems arising from simulations and experiments. One of the major shortcomings of NODEs, especially when coupled with explicit integrators, is its long-term stability, which impedes their efficiency and robustness when encountering stiff problems. In this work we present a structure-preserving NODE approach that learns a transformation into a system with a linear and nonlinear split. It is then integrated using an exponential integrator, which is an explicit integrator with stability properties comparable to implicit methods. We demonstrate that our model has advantages in both learning and deployment over standard explicit or even implicit NODE methods. The long-time stability is further enhanced by the Hurwitz matrix decomposition that constrains the spectrum of the linear operator, therefore stabilizing the linearized dynamics. When combined with a Lipschitz-controlled neural network treatment for the nonlinear operator, we show the nonlinear dynamics of the NODE are provably stable near a fixed point in the sense of Lyapunov. For high-dimensional data, we further rely on an autoencoder performing dimensionality reduction and Higham's algorithm for the matrix-free application of the matrix exponential on a vector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NODE approach in various examples, including the Robertson chemical reaction problem and the Kuramoto-Sivashinky equation.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Multigrid Minimization for Ptychographic Phase Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel stochastic multigrid minimization method for ptychographic phase retrieval. In our formulation, the challenging nonconvex and ill-posed inverse problem is recast as the iterative minimization of a quadratic surrogate model that majorizes the original objective function. Our general framework encompasses the Ptychographic Iterative Engine (PIE) family of algorithms. By efficiently solving the surrogate problem using a multigrid method, our approach delivers significant improvements in both convergence speed and reconstruction quality compared with conventional PIE techniques.</description>

      <title>Quasi-3D beam theory based on equilibrium stress definition and mixed element model for accurate analysis of functionally graded beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09127v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel quasi-3D theory and the corresponding mixed beam element model to achieve accurate solutions for functionally graded beams. The key innovations include the development of equilibrium-based stress expressions, the modified cross-sectional stiffness matrix, and the mixed beam element model based on semi-analytical definition of internal force fields. In contrast to the conventional quasi-3D theory where stress expressions are derived from constitutive equations and geometric relations, the stress expressions in this study are derived from the differential equilibrium equations among stresses, ensuring strict adherence of stress solutions to equilibrium conditions. To incorporate the influence of equilibrium-derived stress distributions, the modified cross-sectional stiffness matrix is derived, enhancing the theoretical and practical feasibility of the beam model. For beam element construction, the mixed variational principle of two-field variables is employed, with generalized internal forces and generalized displacements regarded as two independent fields. Especially, semi-analytical internal force fields, which partially satisfy the differential equilibrium equations, are introduced to improve the element performance. Numerical examples are conducted to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed theory and beam element.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on RBF-based meshless methods for approximating differential operators, one of the most popular being RBF-FD. Recently, a hybrid approach was introduced that combines RBF interpolation and traditional finite difference stencils. We compare the accuracy of this method and RBF-FD on a two-dimensional Poisson problem for standard five-point and nine-point stencils and different method parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study neural field equations, which are prototypical models of large-scale cortical activity, subject to random data. We view this spatially-extended, nonlocal evolution equation as a Cauchy problem on abstract Banach spaces, with randomness in the synaptic kernel, firing rate function, external stimuli, and initial conditions. We determine conditions on the random data that guarantee existence, uniqueness, and measurability of the solution in an appropriate Banach space, and examine the regularity of the solution in relation to the regularity of the inputs. We present results for linear and nonlinear neural fields, and for the two most common functional setups in the numerical analysis of this problem. In addition to the continuous problem, we analyse in abstract form neural fields that have been spatially discretised, setting the foundations for analysing uncertainty quantification (UQ) schemes.</description>

      <title>Stochastic collocation schemes for Neural Field Equations with random data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and analyse numerical schemes for uncertainty quantification in neural field equations subject to random parametric data in the synaptic kernel, firing rate, external stimulus, and initial conditions. The schemes combine a generic projection method for spatial discretisation to a stochastic collocation scheme for the random variables. We study the problem in operator form, and derive estimates for the total error of the schemes, in terms of the spatial projector. We give conditions on the projected random data which guarantee analyticity of the semi-discrete solution as a Banach-valued function. We illustrate how to verify hypotheses starting from analytic random data and a choice of spatial projection. We provide evidence that the predicted convergence rates are found in various numerical experiments for linear and nonlinear neural field problems.</description>

      <title>Perturbation Analysis of Randomized SVD and its Applications to Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.10262v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomized singular value decomposition (RSVD) is a class of computationally efficient algorithms for computing the truncated SVD of large data matrices. Given an $m \times n$ matrix $\widehat{{\mathbf M}}$, the prototypical RSVD algorithm outputs an approximation of the $k$ leading left singular vectors of $\widehat{\mathbf{M}}$ by computing the SVD of $\widehat{\mathbf{M}} (\widehat{{\mathbf M}}^{\top} \widehat{\mathbf{M}})^{g} \mathbf G$; here $g \geq 1$ is an integer and $\mathbf G \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times \widetilde{k}}$ is a random Gaussian sketching matrix with $\widetilde{k} \geq k$. In this paper we derive upper bounds for the $\ell_2$ and $\ell_{2,\infty}$ distances between the exact left singular vectors $\widehat{\mathbf{U}}$ of $\widehat{\mathbf{M}}$ and its approximation $\widehat{\mathbf{U}}_g$ (obtained via RSVD), as well as entrywise error bounds when $\widehat{\mathbf{M}}$ is projected onto $\widehat{\mathbf{U}}_g \widehat{\mathbf{U}}_g^{\top}$. These bounds depend on the singular values gap and number of power iterations $g$, and smaller gap requires larger values of $g$ to guarantee the convergences of the $\ell_2$ and $\ell_{2,\infty}$ distances. We apply our theoretical results to settings where $\widehat{\mathbf{M}}$ is an additive perturbation of some unobserved signal matrix $\mathbf{M}$. In particular, we obtain the nearly-optimal convergence rate and asymptotic normality for RSVD on three inference problems, namely, subspace estimation and community detection in random graphs, noisy matrix completion, and PCA with missing data.</description>

      <title>Feasible approximation of matching equilibria for large-scale matching for teams problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a numerical algorithm for computing approximately optimal solutions of the matching for teams problem. Our algorithm is efficient for problems involving large number of agent categories and allows for non-discrete agent type measures. Specifically, we parametrize the so-called transfer functions and develop a parametric formulation, which we tackle to produce feasible and approximately optimal primal and dual solutions. These solutions yield upper and lower bounds for the optimal value, and the difference between these bounds provides a sub-optimality estimate of the computed solutions. Moreover, we are able to control the sub-optimality to be arbitrarily close to 0. We subsequently prove that the approximate primal and dual solutions converge when the sub-optimality goes to 0 and their limits constitute a true matching equilibrium. Thus, the outputs of our algorithm are regarded as an approximate matching equilibrium. We also analyze the computational complexity of our approach. In the numerical experiments, we study three matching for teams problems: a business location distribution problem, the Wasserstein barycenter problem, and a large-scale problem involving 100 agent categories. We showcase that the proposed algorithm can produce high-quality approximate matching equilibria, provide quantitative insights about the optimal city structure in the business location distribution problem, and that the sub-optimality estimates computed by our algorithm are much less conservative than theoretical estimates.</description>

      <title>Construction and Accuracy of Electronic Continuum Models of Incommensurate Bilayer 2D Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-particle continuum models such as the popular Bistritzer-MacDonald model have become powerful tools for predicting electronic phenomena of incommensurate 2D materials and the development of many-body models aimed to model unconventional superconductivity and correlated insulators. In this work, we introduce a procedure to construct continuum models of arbitrary accuracy relative to tight-binding models for moir\'{e} incommensurate bilayers. This is done by recognizing the continuum model as arising from Taylor expansions of a high accuracy momentum space approximation of the tight-binding model. We apply our procedure in full detail to two models of twisted bilayer graphene and demonstrate both admit the Bistritzer-MacDonald model as the leading order continuum model, while higher order expansions reveal qualitative spectral differences.</description>

      <title>Homogenisation for Maxwell and Friends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We refine the understanding of continuous dependence on coefficients of solution operators under the nonlocal $H$-topology viz Schur topology in the setting of evolutionary equations in the sense of Picard. We show that certain components of the solution operators converge strongly. The weak convergence behaviour known from homogenisation problems for ordinary differential equations is recovered on the other solution operator components. The results are underpinned by a rich class of examples that, in turn, are also treated numerically, suggesting a certain sharpness of the theoretical findings. Analytic treatment of an example that proves this sharpness is provided too. Even though all the considered examples contain local coefficients, the main theorems and structural insights are of operator-theoretic nature and, thus, also applicable to nonlocal coefficients. The main advantage of the problem class considered is that they contain mixtures of type, potentially highly oscillating between different types of PDEs; a prototype can be found in Maxwell's equations highly oscillating between the classical equations and corresponding eddy current approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study theoretical guarantees for solving linear systems in-context using a linear transformer architecture. For in-domain generalization, we provide neural scaling laws that bound the generalization error in terms of the number of tasks and sizes of samples used in training and inference. For out-of-domain generalization, we find that the behavior of trained transformers under task distribution shifts depends crucially on the distribution of the tasks seen during training. We introduce a novel notion of task diversity and show that it defines a necessary and sufficient condition for pre-trained transformers generalize under task distribution shifts. We also explore applications of learning linear systems in-context, such as to in-context operator learning for PDEs. Finally, we provide some numerical experiments to validate the established theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a non-asymptotic analysis of the convergence of the stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) algorithm to a target measure in Wasserstein-1 and Wasserstein-2 distance. Crucially, compared to the existing literature on SGHMC, we allow its stochastic gradient to be discontinuous. This allows us to provide explicit upper bounds, which can be controlled to be arbitrarily small, for the expected excess risk of non-convex stochastic optimization problems with discontinuous stochastic gradients, including, among others, the training of neural networks with ReLU activation function. To illustrate the applicability of our main results, we consider numerical experiments on quantile estimation and on several optimization problems involving ReLU neural networks relevant in finance and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Weighted quantization using MMD: From mean field to mean shift via gradient flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximating a probability distribution using a set of particles is a fundamental problem in machine learning and statistics, with applications including clustering and quantization. Formally, we seek a weighted mixture of Dirac measures that best approximates the target distribution. While much existing work relies on the Wasserstein distance to quantify approximation errors, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) has received comparatively less attention, especially when allowing for variable particle weights. We argue that a Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao gradient flow is well-suited for designing quantizations optimal under MMD. We show that a system of interacting particles satisfying a set of ODEs discretizes this flow. We further derive a new fixed-point algorithm called mean shift interacting particles (MSIP). We show that MSIP extends the classical mean shift algorithm, widely used for identifying modes in kernel density estimators. Moreover, we show that MSIP can be interpreted as preconditioned gradient descent and that it acts as a relaxation of Lloyd's algorithm for clustering. Our unification of gradient flows, mean shift, and MMD-optimal quantization yields algorithms that are more robust than state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated via high-dimensional and multi-modal numerical experiments.</description>
