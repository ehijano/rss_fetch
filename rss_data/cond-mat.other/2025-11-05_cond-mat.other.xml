      <title>Deterministic generation of single B centers in hBN by one-to-one conversion from UV centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the variety of quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), blue-emitting color centers, or B centers, have gathered a particular interest owing to their excellent quantum optical properties. Moreover, the fact that they can be locally activated by an electron beam makes them suitable for top-down integration in photonic devices. However, in the absence of a real-time monitoring technique sensitive to individual emitters, the activation process is stochastic in the number of emitters, and its mechanism is under debate. Here, we implement an in-situ cathodoluminescence monitoring setup capable of detecting individual quantum emitters in the blue and ultraviolet (UV) range. We demonstrate that the activation of individual B centers is spatially and temporally correlated with the deactivation of individual UV centers emitting at 4.1 eV, which are ubiquitous in hBN. We then make use of the ability to detect individual B center activation events to demonstrate the controlled creation of an array with only one emitter per irradiation site. Additionally, we demonstrate a symmetric technique for heralded selective deactivation of individual emitters. Our results provide insights into the microscopic structure and activation mechanism of B centers, as well as versatile techniques for their deterministic integration.</description>

      <title>Exciton dynamics, Fano quantum interference and d-d excitation in the single crystal of two-dimensional antiferromagnetic Fe2P2S6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitonic quasiparticle and their interactions with phonons, magnons and charge carriers may play a pivotal role in governing the optical properties and their correlation with magnetic interactions in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic semiconductors. Further, in transition metal compounds, d-d electronic transitions, arising from excitations between crystal-field split d-orbitals, significantly influence the optical and magnetic properties, particularly in strongly correlated and low-dimensional systems. Fe2P2S6, a layered antiferromagnetic semiconductor, offers a rich platform for studying the interplay between spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom in these 2D systems. In this work, we investigate the photoluminescence (PL) properties of Fe2P2S6 to probe the exciton dynamics, intra-atomic transitions, and their temperature evolution. Two prominent d-d emission peaks are observed at ~ 1.63 eV (D1) and ~ 1.80 eV (D2), attributed to the crystal field-split Fe2+ states. An excitonic emission near the band edge is also identified, which exhibits a characteristic Fano asymmetric line shape. This asymmetry is attributed to the quantum interference between the discrete excitonic state and the d-d transition induced continuum (D2), revealing a Fano resonance behaviour. This exciton peak disappears well before the Neel temperature, indicating its faster destabilization than magnetic ordering. Temperature-dependent PL measurements show a quenching of the excitonic peak with increasing temperature. Our findings provide detailed insight into the optical excitation pathways in Fe2P2S6.</description>

      <title>Euler-Heisenberg action for fermions coupled to gauge and axial vectors: Hessian diagonalization, sector classification, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the closed-form one-loop Euler--Heisenberg effective actions for Dirac fermions coupled simultaneously to classical electromagnetic vector and massive pseudo-vector backgrounds within a controlled quasi-static approximation. Through complete diagonalization of the functional Hessian, we systematically delineate the parameter space into distinct sectors characterized by stability properties and spectral structure. We identify subspaces that encompass and extend results from previous studies into a broader class, admitting propagating axial fields as physically viable regimes; strikingly, we note a sector presenting chirality-asymmetric instability. This addresses long-standing questions regarding the well-defined nature, diagonalizability, and stability of the model. From the effective action, we derive novel nonperturbative pair-production rates for simultaneously propagating electromagnetic and axial vector backgrounds; remarkably, we find pronounced vacuum stabilization compared to previous results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this framework allows for a unified derivation of the chiral anomaly structures in the general case and show that the electromagnetic coupling induces instanton-like configurations for the axial field, even when it is not a fundamental gauge field. As a proof-of-concept, we analyze a cosmological toy model of baryogenesis driven by an axial vector, providing numerical estimates that support the viability of this hypothesis. Additionally, we outline qualitative predictions for Weyl/Dirac semi-metals and briefly discuss potential applications in related phenomena, such as the Strong-CP problem.</description>

      <title>Probing dynamical axion quasiparticles with two-photon correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical axion (quasi) particles are emergent collective excitations in topological magnetic insulators that break parity and time reversal invariance or in Weyl semimetals. They couple to electromagnetism via a topological Chern-Simons term, leading to their decay into two photons. We extend the Weisskopf-Wigner formulation of atomic spontaneous emission to the quantum field theory of dynamical axion quasiparticles, allowing us to obtain the quantum two-photon state emerging from axion decay in real time. This state features \emph{hyperentanglement} in momentum and polarization with a distinct polarization pattern, a consequence of the parity and time reversal breaking of the axion-photon interaction. Polarization aspects of this two-photon state are studied by introducing quantum Stokes operators. Whereas the two-photon quantum state features vanishing \emph{averages} of the degree of polarization and polarization asymmetry, there are non-trivial momentum correlations of the Stokes operators. In particular momentum correlations of the \emph{polarization asymmetry} can be obtained directly from coincident momentum and polarization resolved two photon detection. Correlations of Stokes operators are directly related to momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury-Brown Twiss second order coherences. This relationship suggests two-photon correlations as a direct probe of dynamical axion quasiparticles. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons and other systems where spontaneous emission yield hyperentangled two photon states are recognized, suggesting experimental avenues similar to tests of Bell inequalities to probe dynamical axion quasiparticles with coincident two photon detection.</description>

      <title>Mind the gaps: The fraught road to quantum advantage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is advancing rapidly, yet substantial gaps separate today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices from tomorrow's fault-tolerant application-scale quantum (FASQ) machines. We identify four related hurdles along the road ahead: (i) from error mitigation to active error detection and correction, (ii) from rudimentary error correction to scalable fault tolerance, (iii) from early heuristics to mature, verifiable algorithms, and (iv) from exploratory simulators to credible advantage in quantum simulation. Targeting these transitions will accelerate progress toward broadly useful quantum computing.</description>
