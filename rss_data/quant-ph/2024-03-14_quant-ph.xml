      <title>Entanglement detection in postquench nonequilibrium states: thermal Gibbs vs. generalized Gibbs ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use entanglement witnesses related to the entanglement negativity of the state to detect entanglement in the $XY$ chain in the postquench states in the thermodynamic limit after a quench when the parameters of the Hamiltonian are changed suddenly. The entanglement negativity is related to correlations, which in the postquench stationary state are described by a generalized Gibbs ensemble, in the ideal case. If, however, integrability breaking perturbations are present, the system is expected to thermalize. Here we compare the nearest-neighbor entanglement in the two circumstances.</description>

      <title>Challenges in certifying quantum teleportation: moving beyond conventional fidelity benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional certification method for quantum teleportation protocols relies on surpassing the highest achievable classical average fidelity between target and teleported states. Our investigation highlights the limitations of this approach: inconsistent conclusions can be obtained when it is considered different distance measures in the quantum state space, leading to contradictory interpretations. In particular, this behavior is manifested when modeling a very common noisy experimental scenario, in which the resource state takes the form of a Werner state generated by the influence of a depolarizing channel acting on the Bell state resource. Two additional noise models, based on amplitude-damping channel, are also analyzed. Our work, therefore, stresses the necessity of new certification methods for quantum teleportation.</description>

      <title>Quantum tunneling of the magnetization in systems with anisotropic 4f ion pairs: Rates from low temperature zero field relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic open shell 4f ions have magnetic moments that can be read and written as atomic bits. If it comes to qbits where the phase of the wave function has to be written, controlled and read, it is of advantage to rely on more than one atom that carries the quantum information of the system because states with different susceptibilities may be addressed. Such systems are realized for pairs of lanthanides in single molecule magnets, where four pseudospin states are found and mixed in quantum tunneling processes. For the case of endohedral fullerenes like Dy2S@C82 or Tb2ScN@C80 the quantum tunneling of the magnetisation is imprinted in the magnetisation lifetimes at sub-Kelvin temperatures. A Hamiltonian that includes quantum tunneling of the magnetisation predicts the lifting of the zero field ground state degeneracy and non-linear coupling to magnetic fields in such systems.</description>

      <title>51% Attack via Difficulty Increase with a Small Quantum Miner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a strategy for a single quantum miner with relatively low hashing power, with the same ramifications as a 51% attack. Bitcoin nodes consider the chain with the highest cumulative proof-of-work to be the valid chain. A quantum miner can manipulate the block timestamps to multiply the difficulty by $c$. The fork-choice rule counts every block with increased difficulty with weight $c$. By using Grover's algorithm, it is only $O(\sqrt c)$ harder for the quantum miner to mine such blocks. By picking a high enough $c$, the single quantum miner can create a competing chain with fewer blocks, but more cumulative proof-of-work. The time required is $O(\frac{1}{r^2})$ epochs, where $r$ is the fraction of the block rewards that the quantum miner would have received if they mined honestly.
  Most proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, are vulnerable to our attack. However, it will likely be impossible to execute in forthcoming years, as it requires an extremely fast and fault-tolerant quantum computer.</description>

      <title>What Can Quantum Information Theory Offer to Quantum Chemistry?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is the ultimate goal of this work to foster synergy between quantum chemistry and the flourishing field of quantum information theory. For this, we first translate quantum information concepts such as entanglement and correlation into the context of quantum chemical systems. In particular, we establish two conceptually distinct perspectives on `electron correlation' leading to a notion of orbital and particle correlation. We then demonstrate that particle correlation equals total orbital correlation minimized over all orbital bases. Accordingly, particle correlation resembles the minimal, thus intrinsic, complexity of many-electron wave functions while orbital correlation quantifies their complexity relative to a basis. We illustrate these concepts of intrinsic and extrinsic correlation complexity in molecular systems, which also manifests the crucial link between the two correlation pictures. Our results provide theoretical justification for the long-favored natural orbitals for simplifying electronic structures, and open new pathways for developing more efficient approaches towards the electron correlation problem.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of Contextual Advantage in minimum error and maximum confidence mirror-state discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextuality is well known as a vital resource for locating the boundary between classical and quantum theories, as well as identifying tasks showing quantum advantage. In a surge of recent works [Schmid and Spekkens, Phys.Rev.X 8, 011015 (2018); Mukherjee, Naonit and Pan, Phys.Rev.A 106, 012216 (2022); Flatt, Lee, Carceller, Brask and Bae, PRX QUANTUM 3, 030337 (2022)], it has also been shown that contextuality is the crucial resource in quantum state discrimination (QSD) tasks, including minimum error discrimination (MED) and maximum confidence discrimination (MCD), together with many other figure-of-merits. Despite the fundamental progress made by those aforementioned works, none of them mention about how to realize their fancy proposals, which is doubtlessly necessary for the final goal of applying this resource in real QSD tasks. In this paper, we report the first experimental demonstration of contextual advantage in both MED and MCD for three mirror-symmetric states using interferometric quantum walk, which can be easily generalized to any figure-of-merit in QSD. Our experiment agrees well with the result of theoretical simulation, and also shows the great potentiality of leveraging this method to explore a simpler version for the witness of contextuality, as well as demonstrating quanutm advantage of various tasks that require QSD.</description>

      <title>Recovery of contextuality based on mirror-like state discrimination in PT- and anti-PT-symmetric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decades, researches on parity-time (PT) and anti-parity-time(APT) systems have garnered unprecedented attention, showcasing their various intriguing characteristics and promising potentiality in extending canonical Hermitian quantum mechanics. However, despite significant endeavors devoted to this new field of physics, non-Hermitian dynamics of contextuality still remains an uncharted region, either in PT-symmetry or APT-symmetry systems. Since contextuality has also been proven to be the core resource for quantum state discrimination (QSD) tasks, here we systematically investigate the novel performance of contextuality through QSD in both systems, taking mirror-symmetric three-state minimum error discrimination (MED) and maximum confidence discrimination (MCD) scenarios as two examples. The time evolution of contextuality in two scenarios and eight regimes (four regimes for each scenario) are comprehensively compared and analyzed, with the difference of initial states also considered. In the symmetry-unbroken regimes, our simulation shows periodic oscillations of contextuality for both MED and MCD scenarios, the period of which is state-independent but related to non-Hermiticity of the system. Both MED and MCD shows non-trivial recovery of contextuality exceeding its initial value in PT system, which is only existent for MCD in APT system. In the symmetry-broken regimes, the success probabilities of both scenarios start from a prompt decay at first, ending up with a stable value which is constantly 1/3. Non-triviality is found only for MCD scenario in PT system, where the recovered contextuality exceeds its initial value.</description>

      <title>Simulation of a Diels-Alder Reaction on a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of chemical reactions is an anticipated application of quantum computers. Using a Diels-Alder reaction as a test case, in this study we explore the potential applications of quantum algorithms and hardware in investigating chemical reactions. Our specific goal is to calculate the activation barrier of a reaction between ethylene and cyclopentadiene forming a transition state. To achieve this goal, we use quantum algorithms for near-term quantum hardware (entanglement forging and quantum subspace expansion) and classical post-processing (many-body perturbation theory) in concert. We conduct simulations on IBM quantum hardware using up to 8 qubits, and compute accurate activation barriers in the reaction between cyclopentadiene and ethylene by accounting for both static and dynamic electronic correlation. This work illustrates a hybrid quantum-classical computational workflow to study chemical reactions on near-term quantum devices, showcasing the potential of quantum algorithms and hardware in accurately calculating activation barriers.</description>

      <title>Quantum Channel Conditioning and Measurement Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $H_1$ and $H_2$ are finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, a channel from $H_1$ to $H_2$ is a completely positive, linear map $\mathcal{I}$ that takes the set of states $\mathcal{S}(H_1)$ for $H_1$ to the set of states $\mathcal{S}(H_2)$ for $H_2$. Corresponding to $\mathcal{I}$ there is a unique dual map $\mathcal{I}^*$ from the set of effects $\mathcal{E}(H_2)$ for $H_2$ to the set of effects $\mathcal{E}(H_1)$ for $H_1$. We call $\mathcal{I}^*(b)$ the effect $b$ conditioned by $\mathcal{I}$ and the set $\mathcal{I}^c = \mathcal{I}^*(\mathcal{E}(H_2))$ the conditioned set of $\mathcal{I}$. We point out that $\mathcal{I}^c$ is a convex subeffect algebra of the effect algebra $\mathcal{E}(H_1)$. We extend this definition to the conditioning $\mathcal{I}^*(B)$ for an observable $B$ on $H_2$ and say that an observable $A$ is in $\mathcal{I}^c$ if $A=\mathcal{I}^*(B)$ for some observable $B$. We show that $\mathcal{I}^c$ is closed under post-processing and taking parts. We also define the conditioning of instruments by channels. These concepts are illustrated using examples of Holevo instruments and channels. We next discuss measurement models and their corresponding observables and instruments. We show that calculations can be simplified by employing Kraus and Holevo separable channels. Such channels allow one to separate the components of a tensor product.</description>

      <title>Efficiently verifiable quantum advantage on near-term analog quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing schemes for demonstrating quantum computational advantage are subject to various practical restrictions, including the hardness of verification and challenges in experimental implementation. Meanwhile, analog quantum simulators have been realized in many experiments to study novel physics. In this work, we propose a quantum advantage protocol based on single-step Feynman-Kitaev verification of an analog quantum simulation, in which the verifier need only run an $O(\lambda^2)$-time classical computation, and the prover need only prepare $O(1)$ samples of a history state and perform $O(\lambda^2)$ single-qubit measurements, for a security parameter $\lambda$. We also propose a near-term feasible strategy for honest provers and discuss potential experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian sensing in the absence of exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open systems possess unique potentials in high-precision sensing, yet the majority of previous studies rely on the spectral singularities known as exceptional points. Here we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate universal non-Hermitian sensing in the absence of exceptional points. The scheme makes use of the intrinsic sensitivity of a non-Hermitian probe to weak external fields, which can be understood as the direct consequence of non-Hermiticity. We confirm the basic mechanism by simulating the sensor-field dynamics using photon interferometry, and, as a concrete example, demonstrate the enhanced sensing of signals encoded in the setting angle of a wave plate. While the sensitivity of the probe is ultimately limited by the measurement noise, we find the non-Hermitian sensor showing superior performance under background noises that cannot be suppressed through repetitive measurements. Our experiment opens the avenue of enhanced sensing without exceptional points, complementing existing efforts aimed at harnessing the unique features of open systems.</description>

      <title>Zero modes of velocity field and topological invariant in quantum torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the velocity field approach to characterize topological invariants of quantum states. We introduce the indexes of the velocity field flow based on the zero modes of the velocity field and find that these zero modes play the role of effective topological charges or defects linking to Euler characteristic by the Poincar\'{e}-Hopf theorem. The global property of the indexes is topological invariants against the parameter deformation. We demonstrate this approach by the quantum torus model and compare the topological invariant with that obtained from the Chern number. We find that the physical mechanism of the topological invariant based on the zero modes of the velocity field is different from that of the topological invariant by the Chern number. The topological invariant characterized by the velocity field describes a homeomorphic topological invariant associated with the zero modes on the submanifold of the base manifold of the SU(2)-fibre bundle for quantum torus, whereas the Chern number characterizes a homotopy invariant associated with the exceptional points in the Brillouin zone. We also propose the generalized winding number in terms of the velocity field for both Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems. This gives a connection between the zero mode and winding number in the velocity space. These results enrich the topological invariants of quantum states and promises us a novel insight to understanding topological invariants of quantum states as well as expected to be further applied in more generic models.</description>

      <title>Optical-Cavity Manipulation Strategies of Conical Intersections Mediated Singlet Fission Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We offer a theoretical perspective on simulation and engineering of polaritonic conical-intersection-driven singlet-fission (SF) materials. Using rubrene as an example and applying the numerically accurate Davydov-Ansatz methodology, we derive dynamic and spectroscopic responses of the system and demonstrate key mechanisms capable of SF manipulation, viz. cavity-induced enhancement/weakening/suppression of SF, population localization on the singlet state via engineering of the cavity-mode excitation, polaron/polariton decoupling, collective enhancement of SF. We outline unsolved problems and challenges in the field, and share our views on the development of the future lines of research. We emphasize the significance of careful modeling of cascades of polaritonic conical intersections in high excitation manifolds and envisage that collective geometric phase effects may remarkably affect the SF dynamics and yield. We argue that microscopic interpretation of the main regulatory mechanisms of the polaritonic conical-intersection-driven SF can substantially deepen our understanding of this process, thereby providing novel ideas and solutions for improving conversion efficiency in photovoltaics.</description>

      <title>Spin relaxation in inhomogeneous magnetic fields with depolarizing boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field-inhomogeneity-induced relaxation of atomic spins confined in vapor cells with depolarizing walls is studied. In contrast to nuclear spins, such as noble-gas spins, which experience minimal polarization loss at cell walls, atomic spins in uncoated cells undergo randomization at the boundaries. This distinct boundary condition results in a varied dependence of the relaxation rate on the field gradient. By solving the Bloch-Torrey equation under fully depolarizing boundary conditions, we illustrate that the relaxation rate induced by field inhomogeneity is more pronounced for spins with a smaller original relaxation rate (in the absence of the inhomogeneous field). We establish an upper limit for the relaxation rate through calculations in the perturbation regime. Moreover, we connect it to the spin-exchange-relaxation-free magnetometers, demonstrating that its linewidth is most sensitive to inhomogeneous fields along the magnetometer's sensitive axis. Our theoretical result agrees with the experimental data for cells subjected to small pump power. However, deviations in larger input-power scenarios underscore the importance of considering pump field attenuation, which leads to uniformly distributed light shift that behaves as an inhomogeneous magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking quantum master equations beyond ultraweak coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Nathan and Rudner derived a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation from the Redfield equation. The claim is that the level of approximation is equal to that of the Redfield equation. This is ground breaking work since a quantum master equation that guarantees physical states and that is as accurate as the Redfield equation is still missing. Here we benchmark the Nathan-Rudner equation (NRE) against the exact solution of a damped harmonic oscillator and compare its performance to that of the time-dependent Redfield equation (RE). We find that which of the equations performs better depends on the regime considered. It turns out that the short-time dynamics is generally much better captured by the RE, whereas the NRE delivers similar results to the rotating-wave approximation. For the steady state, in the high-temperature limit the RE also performs better and its solution approaches the exact result for ultrahigh temperatures. Nevertheless, also here the NR equation constitutes a good approximation. In the low-temperature limit, in turn, the NRE still provides a good approximation to the steady state, while the solution of the RE becomes unphysical for too strong coupling. Moreover, we show that, like the RE, also the NRE approaches the correct steady state in the limit of vanishing system-bath coupling. However, in second-order system-bath coupling, where the RE is known to provide the steady-state coherences correctly but not the populations, the NRE generally neither reproduces the correct populations nor the coherences.</description>

      <title>A continuous beam monochromator for matter waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atom and, of late, molecule interferometers find application in both the crucible of fundamental research and industrial pursuits. A prevalent methodology in the construction of atom interferometers involves the utilisation of gratings fashioned from laser beams. While this approach imparts commendable precision, it is hampered by its incapacity to attain exceedingly short wavelengths and its dependence on intricate laser systems for operational efficacy. All applications require the control of matter waves, particularly the particle's velocity. In this manuscript, we propose a continuous beam monochromator scheme reaching enormously high velocity purification with speed ratios in the order of $10^3$ based on atom-surface diffraction. Beyond these high purifications, the proposed scheme simplifies the application by reducing the degree of freedom to a single angle, selecting the wanted particle's velocity.</description>

      <title>Complementarity of which-path information in induced and stimulated coherences via four-wave mixing process from warm Rb atomic ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a systematic approach for establishing a complementary relationship between the interference visibility, concurrence, and predictability in the crossing of induced and stimulated coherences of two-mode squeezed coherent states. This is achieved using a double-path interferometer involving two independent four-wave mixing (FWM) atomic samples generated via spontaneous and stimulated FWM processes from a warm atomic ensemble of 87Rb. We demonstrate that the transition from quantum to classical behavior can be characterized by the induced coherence effect, distinguishing between the two-mode squeezed vacuum and coherent states. Moreover, our experimental scheme, employing two FWM atomic ensembles with long-coherent photons, provides valuable insights into the complementarity of which-path information in induced and stimulated coherences.</description>

      <title>Stochastic action for the entanglement of a noisy monitored two-qubit system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of local unitary noise on the entanglement evolution of a two-qubit system subject to local monitoring and inter-qubit coupling. We construct a stochastic Hamiltonian by incorporating the noise into the Chantasri-Dressel-Jordan path integral and use it to identify the optimal entanglement dynamics and to develop a diagrammatic method for a closed-form approximation of the average entanglement dynamics with an analytical dependence on the noise and measurement intensity. We find that both the optimal trajectory and diagrammatic expansion capture the oscillations of entanglement at short times. Numerical investigation of long-time steady-state entanglement reveals a non-monotonic relationship between concurrence and noise strength.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer ground states: theory, algorithms and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stabilizer states have been commonly utilized in quantum information, quantum error correction, and quantum circuit simulation due to their simple mathematical structure. In this work, we apply stabilizer states to tackle quantum many-body problems and introduce the concept of stabilizer ground states. We present a simplified equivalent formalism for identifying stabilizer ground states of general Pauli Hamiltonians. Moreover, we also develop an exact and linear-scaled algorithm to obtain stabilizer ground states of 1D local Hamiltonians and thus free from discrete optimization. This proposed theoretical formalism and linear-scaled algorithm are not only applicable to finite-size systems, but also adaptable to infinite periodic systems. The scalability and efficiency of the algorithms are numerically benchmarked on different Hamiltonians. Finally, we demonstrate that stabilizer ground states can find various promising applications including better design on variational quantum algorithms, qualitative understanding of phase transitions, and cornerstones for more advanced ground state ansatzes.</description>

      <title>Dielectric microwave resonator with large optical apertures for spin-based quantum devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Towards a spin-based quantum microwave-optical photon transducer, we demonstrate a low-loss dielectric microwave resonator with an internal quality factor of $2.30\times10^4$ while accommodating optical apertures with a diameter of $8\, \mathrm{mm}$. The two seemingly conflicting requirements, high quality factor and large optical apertures, are satisfied thanks to the large dielectric constant of rutile ($\mathrm{TiO_2}$). The quality factor is limited by radiation loss, and we confirmed by numerical simulation that this dielectric resonator can achieve a quality factor exceeding $10^6$ by extending the height of the resonator enclosure. Using this resonator, we performed both continuous-wave (cw) and pulse electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) crystalline powder and P1 centers in a diamond crystal in a dilution refrigerator. The cw ESR spectroscopy demonstrated high-cooperativity and strong spin-resonator coupling with the DPPH and P1 centers respectively, while the pulse ESR spectroscopy successfully measured longitudinal and transverse relaxation times.</description>

      <title>Symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in symmetric random circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry, which serves as a diagnostic tool for symmetry breaking and a proxy for thermalization, has recently been proposed and studied in the context of symmetry restoration for quantum many-body systems undergoing a quench. In this Letter, we investigate symmetry restoration in various symmetric random quantum circuits, particularly focusing on the U(1) symmetry case. In contrast to non-symmetric random circuits where the U(1) symmetry of a small subsystem can always be restored at late times, we reveal that symmetry restoration can fail in U(1) symmetric circuits for certain small symmetry-broken initial states in finite-size systems. In the early-time dynamics, we observe an intriguing quantum Mpemba effect implying that symmetry is restored faster when the initial state is more asymmetric. Furthermore, we also investigate the entanglement asymmetry dynamics for SU(2) and $Z_{2}$ symmetric circuits and identify the presence and absence of the quantum Mpemba effect for the corresponding symmetries, respectively. A unified understanding of these results is provided through the lens of quantum thermalization with conserved charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic systems with negative Wigner function superposition states are fundamentally witnessing nonlinear quantum dynamics beyond linearized systems and, recently, have become essential resources of quantum technology with many applications. Typically, they appear due to sophisticated combination of external drives, nonlinear control, measurements or strong nonlinear dissipation of subsystems to an environment. Here, we propose a conceptually different and more autonomous way to obtain such states, avoiding these ingredients, using purely sudden interaction decay in the paradigmatic interacting qubit-oscillator system weakly coupled to bath at thermal equilibrium in a low-temperature limit. We demonstrate simultaneously detectable unconditional negative Wigner function and quantum coherence and their qualitative enhancement employing more qubits.</description>

      <title>Emergent Continuous Time Crystal in Dissipative Quantum Spin System without Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time crystal, a nonequilibrium phenomenon extending spontaneous symmetry breaking into the temporal dimension, holds fundamental significance in understanding quantum many-body physics. In this work, we explore the nonequilibrium phase diagram of a two-dimensional dissipative Heisenberg spin system in the absence of explicit driving. We numerically identify the emergence of novel nonstationary oscillatory states by analyzing the spin dynamics. These states are categorized as limit cycle and chaos based on the Lyapunov exponent. Remarkably, the observed limit cycle behavior represents a continuous time crystal (CTC), spontaneously breaking the continuous time translation symmetry of the system. We further confirm those oscillatory behaviors by studying the stability against local perturbations applied to the system. Finally, we investigate the robustness of the emergent CTC by introducing isotropic Gaussian-type white noise into the interactions. This study provides many insights into the intricate interplay between dissipation-induced decay processes and interaction-induced spin precession, deepening our understanding of dissipative quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a chirped-pulse driving protocol and reveal its exceptional property for quantum coherent control. The nonadiabatic passage generated by the driving protocol, which includes the population inversion and the nonadiabaticity-induced transition as its ingredients, is shown to be robust against pulse truncation. We further demonstrate that the protocol allows for universal manipulation on the qubit system through designing pulse sequences with either properly adjusted sweeping frequency or pulsing intensity.</description>

Abstract: Platforms based on transmission lines are nowadays employed for the simulation of standard phenomena in quantum electrodynamics and quantum field theory. In this work, we propose a hybrid platform, in which a right-handed transmission line is connected to a left-handed transmission line by means of a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). We examine the interaction between the two transmission lines, as well as the excitation flow along the composed platform. We show that, by activating specific resonance conditions, this platform can be used as a quantum simulator of different phenomena in quantum optics, multimode quantum systems and quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Projective Quantum Eigensolver via Adiabatically Decoupled Subsystem Evolution: a Resource Efficient Approach to Molecular Energetics in Noisy Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers hold immense potential in the field of chemistry, ushering new frontiers to solve complex many body problems that are beyond the reach of classical computers. However, noise in the current quantum hardware limits their applicability to large chemical systems. This work encompasses the development of a projective formalism that aims to compute ground-state energies of molecular systems accurately using Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware in a resource efficient manner. Our approach is reliant upon the formulation of a bipartitely decoupled parameterized ansatz within the disentangled unitary coupled cluster (dUCC) framework based on the principles of synergetics. Such decoupling emulates the total parameter optimization in a lower dimensional manifold, while a mutual synergistic relationship among the parameters is exploited to ensure characteristic accuracy. Without any pre-circuit measurements, our method leads to a highly compact fixed-depth ansatz with shallower circuits and fewer expectation value evaluations. Through analytical and numerical demonstrations, we demonstrate the method's superior performance under noise while concurrently ensuring requisite accuracy in future fault-tolerant systems. This approach enables rapid exploration of emerging chemical spaces by efficient utilization of near-term quantum hardware resources.</description>

      <title>Time-bin entanglement in the deterministic generation of linear photonic cluster states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate strategies for the efficient deterministic creation of trains of time-bin entangled photons using an individual quantum emitter described by a $\Lambda$-type electronic system. We explicitly demonstrate generation of high-quality linear cluster states of substantial length in our full microscopic numerical simulations. The underlying scheme is based on the manipulation of ground state coherences through precise optical driving. One important finding is that the most easily accessible quality metrics, the achievable rotation fidelities, fall short in assessing the actual quantum correlations of the emitted photons in the face of losses. To address this, we explicitly calculate stabilizer generator expectation values as a superior gauge for the quantum properties of the many-photon state. Our results illustrate that with controlled minimization of losses and realistic system parameters for quantum-dot type systems, useful linear cluster states of significant lengths can be generated, showcasing promise of scalability for quantum information processing endeavors.</description>

      <title>System-bath correlations and finite-time operation enhance the efficiency of a dissipative quantum battery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reduced state of a small system strongly coupled to a thermal bath may be athermal and used as a small battery once disconnected. If the disconnecting process is too slow, the coupling between the battery and the bath weakens, and at some point, the battery will be in a thermal state that can not be used as a battery. Thus, the unitarily extractable energy (a.k.a ergotropy) decreases with the disconnection time. The work required to disconnect the battery also depends on the disconnection time. We study the efficiency of this battery, defined as the ratio between the ergotropy to the work cost of disconnecting and connecting the battery back to the bath to close the cycle, as a function of the disconnecting time in the Caldeira-Leggett model of a quantum battery. We consider two scenarios. In the first scenario, we assume that the discharged battery is uncorrelated to the bath at the connecting time and find that the efficiency peaks at an optimal disconnecting time. In the second scenario, the discharged battery is correlated to the bath, and find that the optimal efficiency corresponds to an instantaneous disconnection. On top of these results, we analyze various thermodynamic quantities for these Caldeira-Leggett quantum batteries that allow us to express the first and second laws of thermodynamics in the mentioned cycles in simple form despite the system-bath initial correlations and strong coupling regime of the working device.</description>

      <title>Coherent competition and control between three-wave mixing and four-wave mixing in superconducting circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring intermixing and interplay between different frequency-mixing processes has always been one of the interesting subjects at the interface of nonlinear optics with quantum optics. Here we investigate coherent competition and control between three-wave mixing (TWM) and four-wave mixing (FWM) in a cyclic three-level superconducting quantum system. In the weak control-field regime, strong competition leads to an alternating oscillation between TWM and FWM signals and this oscillation is a signature of strong energy exchange between these two nonlinear processes. In particular, such oscillation is absent from conventional multi-wave mixing in atomic systems. Surprisingly, synchronous TWM and FWM processes are demonstrated in the strong control-field regime and, at the same time, their efficiencies can be as high as 40% and 45%, respectively. Our study shows that these competitive behaviors between TWM and FWM can be manipulated by tuning the control-field intensity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between the electric dipole moments of a quantum emitter and a metal nanoparticle gives rise to unique optical properties, such as interference-induced photon correlations, that could be useful for enhanced intensity-based sensing. Using the quantum theory of photodetection, we propose a nanosensor system comprising a quantum emitter and a metal nanoparticle that explores the possibility of utilizing higher-order photon correlations for refractive index sensing. Both the refractive index sensitivity and resolution of the nanosensor, whose scattering spectrum lies within the visible region, are predicted. The sensor is supported by a substrate and driven weakly by a coherent field. By calculating the mean photocount and its second factorial moment resulting from the scattered field of the system, the sensing performance of the intensity and intensity-intensity correlation, are compared at optimal driving wavelengths. The mean photocount was found to be inherently low, inhibiting the role of interference-induced photon antibunching in minimizing the sensor's intensity shot noise. However, a regime in which the noise could be reduced below the shot noise limit is identified, leading to a quantum enhancement in the sensing performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superradiant phase transitions play a fundamental role in understanding the mechanism of collective light-matter interaction at the quantum level. Here we investigate multiple superradiant phases and phase transitions with different symmetry-breaking patterns in a two-mode V-type Dicke model. Interestingly, we show that there exists a quadruple point where one normal phase, one global symmetry-breaking superradiant phase and two local symmetry-breaking superradiant phases meet. Such a global phase results from the phase competition between two local superradiant phases and can not occur in the standard $\Lambda$- and $\Xi$-type three-level configurations in quantum optics. Moreover, we exhibit a sequential first-order quantum phase transition from one local to the global again to the other local superradiant phase. Our study opens up a perspective of exploring multi-level quantum critical phenomena with global symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Environment-Induced Information Scrambling Transition with Charge Conservations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In generic closed quantum systems, the complexity of operators increases under time evolution governed by the Heisenberg equation, reflecting the scrambling of local quantum information. However, when systems interact with an external environment, the system-environment coupling allows operators to escape from the system, inducing a dynamical transition between the scrambling phase and the dissipative phase. This transition is known as the environment-induced information scrambling transition, originally proposed in Majorana fermion systems. In this work, we advance this dicovery by investigating the transition in charge-conserved systems with space-time randomness. We construct solvable Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models of complex fermions coupled to an environment, enabling the analytical computation of operator growth. We determine the critical dissipation strength, which is proportional to $n(1-n)$ with $n$ being the density of the complex fermions, arising from the suppression in the quantum Lyapunov exponent due to the Pauli blockade in the scattering process. We further analyze the density dependence of maximally scrambled operators at late time. Our results shed light on the intriguing interplay between information scrambling, dissipation, and conservation laws.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing can potentially provide advantages for specific computational tasks. The simulation of fermionic systems is one such task that lends itself well to quantum computation, with applications in nuclear physics and electronic systems. Here we present work in which we use a variance minimisation method to find the full spectrum of energy eigenvalues of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model; an exactly-solvable nuclear shell model-type system. We perform these calculations using both quantum simulators and real quantum hardware accessed via IBM cloud-based quantum computers. Using these IBM quantum computers we are able to obtain all eigenvalues for the cases of three and seven fermions (nucleons) in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model.</description>

      <title>Entangled Photon-pair Generation in Nonlinear Thin-films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a fully vectorial and non-paraxial formalism to describe spontaneous parametric down-conversion in nonlinear thin films. The formalism is capable of treating slabs with a sub-wavelength thickness, describe the associated Fabry-P\'erot effects, and even treat absorptive nonlinear materials. With this formalism, we perform an in-depth study of the dynamics of entangled photon-pair generation in nonlinear thin films, to provide a needed theoretical understanding for such systems that have recently attracted much experimental attention as sources of photon pairs. As an important example, we study the far-field radiation properties of photon pairs generated from a high-refractive-index nonlinear thin-film with Zinc-Blende structure, that is deposited on a linear low-refractive-index substrate. In particular, we study the thickness-dependent effect of Fabry-P\'erot interferences on the far-field radiation pattern of the photon pairs. We also pay special attention to study of entanglement generation, and find the conditions under which maximally polarization-entangled photon pairs can be generated and detected in such nonlinear thin-films.</description>

      <title>Ancilla-free measurement of out-of-time-ordered correlation functions: General measurement protocol and Rydberg atom implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a protocol that gives access to out-of-time-ordered correlation functions in many-body quantum systems. Unlike other such protocols, our proposal, which can be applied to arbitrary initial states, neither requires ancilla degrees of freedom to the quantum system of interest, nor has the need for randomized measurements. Nontrivial experimental capabilities required to implement the protocol are single-site measurements, single-site rotations, and backwards time evolution. To exemplify the implementation of the protocol, we put forward a strategy for Hamiltonian sign inversion $H\to-H$ in arrays of Rydberg-dressed atoms. In this way, a complete and practical toolbox is obtained for the measurement of out-of-time-ordered correlations in equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a single neutral \textsuperscript{87}Rb atom held in an optical trap, and "quantum jump" detection of single-photon-initiated state changes, we demonstrate an intrinsically-narrowband single-photon detector, of interest for separating weak signals from strong optical background. Using novel statistical analysis, we measure quantum efficiency of \SI{2.9+-0.2e-3}{}, a record for single-pass quantum jump production, and dark counts of \SI{9+-20e-3}{counts\per\second} during passive accumulation plus \SI{1.8+-0.1e-2}{counts} per readout, orders of magnitude below those of traditional single-photon detectors. The \SI{6}{\mega\hertz} detection bandwidth is orders of magnitude narrower than existing atomic filters. Available methods can substantially improve \QJPDAcronym{} quantum efficiency, dark counts, bandwidth, and tunability.</description>

      <title>Optimal adaptation of surface-code decoders to local noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information obtained from noise characterization of a quantum device can be used in classical decoding algorithms to improve the performance of quantum error-correcting codes. Focusing on the surface code under local (i.e. single-qubit) noise, we present a simple method to determine the maximum extent to which adapting a surface-code decoder to a noise feature can lead to a performance improvement. Our method is based on a tensor-network decoding algorithm, which uses the syndrome information as well as a process matrix description of the noise to compute a near-optimal correction. By selectively mischaracterizing the noise model input to the decoder and measuring the resulting loss in fidelity of the logical qubit, we can determine the relative importance of individual noise parameters for decoding. We apply this method to several physically relevant uncorrelated noise models with features such as coherence, spatial inhomogeneity and bias. While noise generally requires many parameters to describe completely, we find that to achieve near optimal decoding it appears only necessary adapt the decoder to a small number of critical parameters.</description>

      <title>Controlled-Joint Remote Implementation of Operators and its Possible Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existing notion of the shared entangled state-assisted remote preparation of unitary operator (equivalently the existing notion of quantum remote control) using local operation and classical communication is generalized to a scenario where under the control of a supervisor two users can jointly implement arbitrary unitaries (one unknown unitary operation by each or equivalently a single unitary decomposed into two unitaries of the same dimension and given to two users) on an unknown quantum state available with a geographically separated user. It is explicitly shown that the task can be performed using a four-qubit hyperentangled state, which is entangled simultaneously in both spatial and polarization degrees of freedom of photons. The proposed protocol which can be viewed as primitive for distributed photonic quantum computing is further generalized to the case that drops the restrictions on the number of controllers and the number of parties performing unitaries and allows both the numbers to be arbitrary. It is also shown that all the existing variants of quantum remote control schemes can be obtained as special cases of the present scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient simulation of quantum computers relies on understanding and exploiting the properties of quantum states. This is the case for methods such as tensor networks, based on entanglement, and the tableau formalism, which represents stabilizer states. In this work, we integrate these two approaches to present a generalization of the tableau formalism used for Clifford circuit simulation. We explicitly prove how to update our formalism with Clifford gates, non-Clifford gates, and measurements, enabling universal circuit simulation. We also discuss how the framework allows for efficient simulation of more states, raising some interesting questions on the representation power of tensor networks and the quantum properties of resources such as entanglement and magic, and support our claims with simulations.</description>

      <title>Efficient and practical Hamiltonian simulation from time-dependent product formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we propose an approach for implementing time-evolution of a quantum system using product formulas. The quantum algorithms we develop have provably better scaling (in terms of gate complexity and circuit depth) than a naive application of well-known Trotter formulas, for systems where the evolution is determined by a Hamiltonian with different energy scales (i.e., one part is "large" and another part is "small"). Our algorithms generate a decomposition of the evolution operator into a product of simple unitaries that are directly implementable on a quantum computer. Although the theoretical scaling is suboptimal compared with state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g., quantum signal processing), the performance of the algorithms we propose is highly competitive in practice. We illustrate this via extensive numerical simulations for several models. For instance, in the strong-field regime of the 1D transverse-field Ising model, our algorithms achieve an improvement of one order of magnitude in both the system size and evolution time that can be simulated with a fixed budget of 1000 arbitrary 2-qubit gates, compared with standard Trotter formulas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a M\"obius strip comprising of two antiferromagnetically coupled spin chains. To satisfy the boundary condition, magnon excitations feature linear polarization of the N\'eel vector devoid of chirality, forming two non-degenerate branches of modes that can neither be smoothly connected to nor be decomposed by the circularly-polarized magnons of opposite chirality commonly found in antiferromagnets. Only one branch supports standing-wave formation on the M\"obius strip while the other does not, owing to its spectral shift incurred by the boundary condition. Our findings unravel the profound impact of topology-induced symmetry breaking on magnons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Feynman path integral plays a crucial role in quantum mechanics, offering significant insights into the interaction between classical action and propagators, and linking quantum electrodynamics (QED) with Feynman diagrams. However, the formulations of path integrals in classical quantum mechanics and QED are neither unified nor interconnected, suggesting the potential existence of an important bridging theory that could be key to solving existing puzzles in quantum mechanics. In this work, we delve into the theoretical consistency, completeness, and integration with established path integral theories, revealing this concealed path integral form. This newly uncovered form not only connects various path integral approaches but also demonstrates its potential in explaining quantum phenomena like the origin of spin and quantum nonlocal correlations. It transcends conventional quantum mechanics, proposing a more profound and fundamental physical principle.</description>

      <title>Dissipative frequency converter: from Lindblad dynamics to non-Hermitian topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A topological frequency converter represents a dynamical counterpart of the integer quantum Hall effect, where a two-level system enacts a quantized time-averaged power transfer between two driving modes of incommensurate frequency. Here, we investigate as to what extent temporal coherence in the quantum dynamics of the two-level system is important for the topological quantization of the converter. To this end, we consider dissipative channels corresponding to spontaneous decay and dephasing in the instantaneous eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian as well as spontaneous decay in a fixed basis. The dissipation is modelled using both a full Lindblad and an effective non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian description. For all three dissipation channels we find a transition from the unperturbed dynamics to a quantum watchdog effect, which destroys any power transfer in the strong coupling limit. This is striking because the watchdog effect leads to perfectly adiabatic dynamics in the instantaneous eigenbasis, at first glance similar to the unperturbed case. Furthermore, it is found that dephasing immediately leads to an exponential decay of the power transfer in time due to loss of polarisation in the mixed quantum state. Finally, we discuss the appearance in the effective NH trajectory description of non-adiabatic processes, which are suppressed in the full Lindblad dynamics.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Quantum Divide(s)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores the possible divides resulting from the introduction of emerging quantum technologies (QT) to society. It provides the multidirectional impacts of QT on science, technology, geopolitics, and societal structures. We aim to challenge the idea of a singular "quantum divide" by presenting a more comprehensive perspective. To complement the existing literature on the quantum divide, we propose four distinct divides that could result from the emergence of QT. Firstly, we examine the "Quantum Divide in Science", representing the paradigmatic gap among scientists and inequalities in access to knowledge/resources within research communities. We suggest the "Quantum Divide in Technologies through Path-dependency" as the second possible divide, examining the adoption processes of certain technologies to be developed by nations, firms, and research communities. The discussion extends internationally, focusing on the "Quantum Divide between Countries," by dealing with the reasons and outcomes of the adoption processes between countries of different development levels (economically, industrially, and technologically). As the final divide, we put forth our perspective on the "Quantum Divide within Societies", one of the most explored ones in the literature, addressing societal implications. For each type of the divide, we propose several directions to navigate them, some complementary, some incompatible. Finally, we discuss the interconnectedness and distinctness of different types of divides and how they impact the directions to navigate them. This study serves as a guidance for those interested in a more in-depth investigation of the concept of quantum divide, possible directions of navigating the divides, and how the introduction of QT might affect the innovation ecosystems by impacting the scientific, technological, international, and societal institutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hilbert bimodules are morphisms between C*-algebraic models of quantum systems, while symplectic dual pairs are morphisms between Poisson geometric models of classical systems. Both of these morphisms preserve representation-theoretic structures of the relevant types of models. Previously, it has been shown that one can functorially associate certain symplectic dual pairs to Hilbert bimodules through strict deformation quantization. We show that, in the inverse direction, strict deformation quantization also allows one to functorially take the classical limit of a Hilbert bimodule to reconstruct a symplectic dual pair.</description>

      <title>Ultra-long relaxation of a Kramers qubit formed in a bilayer graphene quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic valley degree of freedom makes bilayer graphene a unique platform for emerging types of semiconducting qubits. The single-carrier quantum dot ground state exhibits a two-fold degeneracy where the two states have opposite spin and valley quantum numbers. By breaking the time-reversal symmetry of this ground state with an out-of-plane magnetic field, a novel type of qubit (Kramers qubit), encoded in the two-dimensional spin-valley subspace, becomes accessible. The Kramers qubit is robust against known spin- and valley-mixing mechanisms, as it requires a simultaneous change of both quantum numbers, potentially resulting in long relaxation and coherence times. We measure the relaxation time of a single carrier in the excited states of a bilayer graphene quantum dot at small ($\sim \mathrm{mT}$) and zero magnetic fields. We demonstrate ultra-long spin-valley relaxation times of the Kramers qubit exceeding $30~\mathrm{s}$, which is about two orders of magnitude longer than the spin relaxation time of $400~\mathrm{ms}$. The demonstrated high-fidelity single-shot readout and long relaxation times are the foundation for novel, long-lived semiconductor qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new theory of superconductivity has been put forward that attributes the origin of superconductivity to the appearance of a non-trivial Berry connection from many-electron wave functions.
  This theory reproduces the major results of the BCS theory with conserving the particle number, and predicts the single-electron supercurrent tunneling across the Josephson junction with keeping the correct Josephson relation. We re-examine the quantization of superconducting qubit circuits by taking into account the above development, and show that the dynamical variables used in the standard theory, the flux nodes relating to the voltage, should be replaced by those relating to the electromagnetic vector potential. The fact that the Josephson junction tunneling allows the single-electron supercurrent tunneling is the reason for the existence of excited single electrons in superconducting qubits with Josephson junctions. We predict that it will be avoided by weakening the coupling between two superconductors in the Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>A Parallel Beam Splitting Based on Gradient Metasurface: Preparation and Fusion of Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient metasurface, formed by a set of subwavelength unit cells with different phase modulation, is widely used in polarized beam splitting (BS) in the classical and quantum optics. Specifically, its phase gradient allows the path and polarization of multiple output lights to be locked by corresponding inputs.Using this unique path-polarization locked property, we demonstrate that the single metasurface can function as sequentially linked beamsplitters, enabling the parallelization of a series of BS processes. Such a parallel BS metasurface provides a multi-beam interference capability for both classical and quantum light manipulation. Taking this advantage, we first prepare path and polarization hybrid entangled states of two, three, and multi photons from unentangled photon sources. Then, the ability of parallel BS-facilitated entanglement is applied to demonstrate entanglement fusion among entangled photon pairs, which can greatly enlarge the entanglement dimension. The principle of parallel BS through the metasurface opens up a versatile way to manipulate the quantum state at the micro/nano scale, which will have potential applications in on-chip quantum optics and quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A general framework for analyzing topology of quantum channels of single-particle systems is developed to find a class of genuinely dynamical topological phases that can be realized by means of discrete quantum feedback control. We provide a symmetry classification of quantum channels by identifying ten symmetry classes of discrete quantum feedback control with projective measurements. We construct various types of topological feedback control by using topological Maxwell's demons that achieve robust feedback-controlled chiral or helical transport against noise and decoherence. Topological feedback control thus offers a versatile tool for creating and controlling nonequilibrium topological phases in open quantum systems that are distinct from non-Hermitian and Lindbladian systems and should provide a guiding principle for topology-based design of quantum feedback control.</description>

Abstract: Chaotic Floquet systems at sufficiently low driving frequencies are known to heat up to an infinite temperature ensemble in the thermodynamic limit. However at high driving frequencies, Floquet systems remain energetically stable in a robust prethermal phase with exponentially long heating times. We propose sensitivity (susceptibility) of Floquet eigenstates against infinitesimal deformations of the drive, as a sharp and sensitive measure to detect this heating transition. It also captures various regimes (timescales) of Floquet thermalization accurately. Particularly, we find that at low frequencies near the onset of unbounded heating, Floquet eigenstates are maximally sensitive to perturbations and consequently the scaled susceptibility develops a sharp maximum. We further connect our results to the relaxation dynamics of local observables to show that near the onset of Floquet heating, the system is nonergodic with slow glassy dynamics despite being nonintegrable at all driving frequencies.</description>

      <title>An optically defined phononic crystal defect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a phononic crystal with a defect mode defined and controlled entirely by optical forces. By applying a strong optical trap to a single unit cell of a Si$_3$N$_4$ phononic crystal membrane, we coherently couple many modes to each other, and smoothly transfer a single defect mode into the phononic bandgap. This is accompanied by localization of the mode's spatial profile from one spanning the entire crystal to one confined within just a few unit cells, as evidenced by a 37-fold reduction in the participating mass. This proof-of-concept coupling between light and mechanical mode shape significantly broadens the optomechanical design space. It also demonstrates the feasibility of optically programmable lattice potentials, enabling (in addition to defects) reconfigurable waveguides, superlattices, and disorder, with corresponding avenues of research toward creating unique states of macroscopic quantum motion.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Conical Intersections Without Explicit Use of Non-Adiabatic Couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two alternative methods for optimizing minimum energy conical intersection (MECI) molecular geometries without knowledge of the derivative coupling (DC). These methods are based on the utilization of Lagrange multipliers: i) one method uses an approximate calculation of the DC, while the other ii) do not require the DC. Both methods use the fact that information of the DC is contained in the Hessian of the squared energy difference. Tests done on a set of small molecular systems, in comparison with other methods, show the ability of the proposed methods to optimize MECIs. Finally, we apply the methods to the furimamide molecule, to optimize and characterize its S$_1$ /S$_2$ MECI, and to optimizing the S$_0$ /S$_1$ MECI of the silver trimer.</description>

      <title>Local Binary and Multiclass SVMs Trained on a Quantum Annealer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Support vector machines (SVMs) are widely used machine learning models (e.g., in remote sensing), with formulations for both classification and regression tasks. In the last years, with the advent of working quantum annealers, hybrid SVM models characterised by quantum training and classical execution have been introduced. These models have demonstrated comparable performance to their classical counterparts. However, they are limited in the training set size due to the restricted connectivity of the current quantum annealers. Hence, to take advantage of large datasets (like those related to Earth observation), a strategy is required. In the classical domain, local SVMs, namely, SVMs trained on the data samples selected by a k-nearest neighbors model, have already proven successful. Here, the local application of quantum-trained SVM models is proposed and empirically assessed. In particular, this approach allows overcoming the constraints on the training set size of the quantum-trained models while enhancing their performance. In practice, the FaLK-SVM method, designed for efficient local SVMs, has been combined with quantum-trained SVM models for binary and multiclass classification. In addition, for comparison, FaLK-SVM has been interfaced for the first time with a classical single-step multiclass SVM model (CS SVM). Concerning the empirical evaluation, D-Wave's quantum annealers and real-world datasets taken from the remote sensing domain have been employed. The results have shown the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach, but also its practical applicability in a real-world large-scale scenario.</description>

Abstract: Efficient and accurate algorithm for partition function, free energy and thermal entropy calculations is of great significance in statistical physics and quantum many-body physics. Here we present an unbiased but low-technical-barrier algorithm within the quantum Monte Carlo framework, which has exceptionally high accuracy and no systemic error. Compared with the conventional specific heat integral method and Wang-Landau sampling algorithm, our method can obtain a much more accurate result of the sub-leading coefficient of the entropy. This method can be widely used in both classical and quantum Monte Carlo simulations and is easy to be parallelized on computer.</description>

Abstract: As quantum computing hardware becomes more complex with ongoing design innovations and growing capabilities, the quantum computing community needs increasingly powerful techniques for fabrication failure root-cause analysis. This is especially true for trapped-ion quantum computing. As trapped-ion quantum computing aims to scale to thousands of ions, the electrode numbers are growing to several hundred with likely integrated-photonic components also adding to the electrical and fabrication complexity, making faults even harder to locate. In this work, we used a high-resolution quantum magnetic imaging technique, based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, to investigate short-circuit faults in an ion trap chip. We imaged currents from these short-circuit faults to ground and compared to intentionally-created faults, finding that the root-cause of the faults was failures in the on-chip trench capacitors. This work, where we exploited the performance advantages of a quantum magnetic sensing technique to troubleshoot a piece of quantum computing hardware, is a unique example of the evolving synergy between emerging quantum technologies to achieve capabilities that were previously inaccessible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atom interferometers are an exquisite measurement tool for inertial forces. However, they are commonly limited to one single sensitive axis, allowing high-precision multi-dimensional sensing only through subsequent or postcorrected measurements. Here, we introduce a novel 2D-array-arrangement of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC) initialized utilizing time-averaged optical potentials for simultaneous multi-axis inertial sensing. Deploying a 3 x 3 BEC array covering 1.6 mm^2, we perform measurements of angular velocity and acceleration of a rotating reference mirror, as well as a linear acceleration, e.g., induced by gravity, gradients, and higher order derivatives. We anticipate increased sensitivity of our method in interferometers with large scale factors in long-baseline or satellite atom interferometry. Our work paves the way for simple high-precision multi-axis inertial sensing and we envision further applications, e.g., for three-dimensional wave front characterization.</description>

Abstract: Adaptive construction of ansatz circuits offers a promising route towards applicable variational quantum eigensolvers on near-term quantum hardware. Those algorithms aim to build up optimal circuits for a certain problem and ansatz circuits are adaptively constructed by selecting and adding entanglers from a predefined pool. In this work, we propose a way to construct entangler pools with reduced size by leveraging classical algorithms. Our method uses mutual information between the qubits in classically approximated ground state to rank and screen the entanglers. The density matrix renormalization group method is employed for classical precomputation in this work. We corroborate our method numerically on small molecules. Our numerical experiments show that a reduced entangler pool with a small portion of the original entangler pool can achieve same numerical accuracy. We believe that our method paves a new way for adaptive construction of ansatz circuits for variational quantum algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Any given density matrix can be represented as an infinite number of ensembles of pure states. This leads to the natural question of how to uniquely select one out of the many, apparently equally suitable, possibilities. Following Jaynes' information-theoretic perspective, this can be framed as an inference problem. We propose the Maximum Geometric Quantum Entropy Principle to exploit the notions of Quantum Information Dimension and Geometric Quantum Entropy. These allow us to quantify the entropy of fully arbitrary ensembles and select the one that maximizes it. After formulating the principle mathematically, we give the analytical solution to the maximization problem in a number of cases and discuss the physical mechanism behind the emergence of such maximum entropy ensembles.</description>

Abstract: Various Hamiltonian simulation algorithms have been proposed to efficiently study the dynamics of quantum systems on a quantum computer. The existing algorithms generally approximate the time evolution operators, which may need a deep quantum circuit that is beyond the capability of near-term noisy quantum devices. Here, focusing on the time evolution of a fixed input quantum state, we propose an adaptive approach to construct a low-depth time evolution circuit. By introducing a measurable quantifier that characterizes the simulation error, we use an adaptive strategy to learn the shallow quantum circuit that minimizes that error. We numerically test the adaptive method with electronic Hamiltonians of the $\mathrm{H_2O}$ and $\mathrm{H_4}$ molecules, and the transverse field Ising model with random coefficients. Compared to the first-order Suzuki-Trotter product formula, our method can significantly reduce the circuit depth (specifically the number of two-qubit gates) by around two orders while maintaining the simulation accuracy. We show applications of the method in simulating many-body dynamics and solving energy spectra with the quantum Krylov algorithm. Our work sheds light on practical Hamiltonian simulation with noisy-intermediate-scale-quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: In the well known Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum mechanics, advocated by N. Bohr, the physical objects and the experimental results can be described only in a macroscopic language, leaving any possible microscopic description as unspeakable. This point of view has been deepened by C. Rovelli in the relational interpretation of Quantum mechanics. Most of the alternative interpretations, which try a detailed microscopic description of physical phenomena and of their evolution, have in common the explicit introduction of the wave function as the basic element of the theory. These interpretations require the notion of quantum state as the fundamental concept of the theory, which is the typical unspeakable physical element according to the Copenhagen interpretation. The two basic physical entities are intimately bound together by the integrity of the wave function. These interpretations are usually indicated as realistic. It is well known that the use of the wave function and its time evolution in the description of the physical processes leads unavoidably to some difficulties or so-called paradoxes. The measurement problem is at the center of these difficulties, mainly because it requires the introduction of the reduction process of the wave function, which is not included explicitly within the mathematical formalism of Quantum Mechanics. In this paper we build up and propose a model which goes beyond the standard formalism and which is able to solve the measurement problem and all the other difficulties which, in a way or in another, are related to it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.07741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are few explicit examples of two player nonlocal games with a large gap between classical and quantum value. One of the reasons is that estimating the classical value is usually a hard computational task. This paper is devoted to analyzing classical values of the so-called linear games (generalization of XOR games to a larger number of outputs). We employ nontrivial results from graph theory and combine them with number theoretic results used earlier in the context of harmonic analysis to obtain a novel tool -- {\it the girth method} -- allowing to provide explicit examples of linear games with prescribed low classical value. In particular, we provide games with minimal possible classical value. We then speculate on the potential unbounded violation, by comparing the obtained classical values with a known upper bound for the quantum value. If this bound can be even asymptotically saturated, our games would have the best ratio of quantum to classical value as a function of the product of the number of inputs and outputs when compared to other explicit (i.e. non-random) constructions.</description>

Abstract: The manipulation of topologically-ordered phases of matter to encode and process quantum information forms the cornerstone of many approaches to fault-tolerant quantum computing. Here we demonstrate that fault-tolerant logical operations in these approaches can be interpreted as instances of anyon condensation. We present a constructive theory for anyon condensation and, in tandem, illustrate our theory explicitly using the color-code model. We show that different condensation processes are associated with a general class of domain walls, which can exist in both space- and time-like directions. This class includes semi-transparent domain walls that condense certain subsets of anyons. We use our theory to classify topological objects and design novel fault-tolerant logic gates for the color code. As a final example, we also argue that dynamical `Floquet codes' can be viewed as a series of condensation operations. We propose a general construction for realising planar dynamically driven codes based on condensation operations on the color code. We use our construction to introduce a new Calderbank-Shor Steane-type Floquet code that we call the Floquet color code.</description>

      <title>How to determine the local unitary equivalence of sets of generalized Bell states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classification is a common method to study quantum entanglement, and local unitary equivalence (LU-equivalence) is an effective classification tool. The purpose of this work is to show how to determine the LU-equivalence of sets of generalized Bell states (GBSs) in an arbitrary dimensional bipartite quantum system $\mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}$ ($d$ is an integer no less than 3). The idea is that, for a given GBS set $\mathcal{M}$, try to find all the GBS sets that are LU-equivalent to $\mathcal{M}$, then we can determine whether another GBS set is LU-equivalent to $\mathcal{M}$ by comparison. In order to accomplish this intention, we first reduce the LU-equivalence of two GBS sets to the unitary conjugate equivalence (UC-equivalence) of two generalized Pauli matrix (GPM) sets. Then we give the necessary and sufficient conditions for a 2-GPM set UC-equivalent to a special 2-GPM set $\{ X^{a}, Z^{b} \}$ ($a, b$ are nonnegative integers and factors of $d$). The general case, that is, the UC-equivalence of two general GPM sets, follows by the particular case. Moreover, these results are programmable, that is, we provide programs that can give all standard GPM sets that are UC-equivalent to a given GPM set, as well as programs that can determine all standard GPM sets that are unitary equivalent (U-equivalent) to a given GPM set, and then the U-equivalence of two arbitrary GPM sets (or LU-equivalence of two GBS sets) can be determined by comparison. To illustrate the role of the programs, we provide two examples, one showing that all 4-GBS sets (58905 items) in $\mathbb{C}^{6}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{6}$ can be divided into 31 LU-equivalence classes, and the other providing a complete LU-equivalent classification of all 4-GBS sets in $\mathbb{C}^{4}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{4}$.</description>

Abstract: We propose a unifying paradigm for analyzing and constructing topological quantum error correcting codes as dynamical circuits of geometrically local channels and measurements. To this end, we relate such circuits to discrete fixed-point path integrals in Euclidean spacetime, which describe the underlying topological order: If we fix a history of measurement outcomes, we obtain a fixed-point path integral carrying a pattern of topological defects. As an example, we show that the stabilizer toric code, subsystem toric code, and CSS Floquet code can be viewed as one and the same code on different spacetime lattices, and the honeycomb Floquet code is equivalent to the CSS Floquet code under a change of basis. We also use our formalism to derive two new error-correcting codes, namely a Floquet version of the $3+1$-dimensional toric code using only 2-body measurements, as well as a dynamic code based on the double-semion string-net path integral.</description>

Abstract: To run large-scale algorithms on a quantum computer, error-correcting codes must be able to perform a fundamental set of operations, called logic gates, while isolating the encoded information from noise~\cite{Harper2019,Ryan-Anderson2021,Egan2021fault, Chen2022calibrated, Sundaresan2022matching, ryananderson2022implementing, Postler2022demonstration, GoogleAI2023}. We can complete a universal set of logic gates by producing special resources called magic states~\cite{Bravyi2005universal,Maier2013magic, Chamberland2022building}. It is therefore important to produce high-fidelity magic states to conduct algorithms while introducing a minimal amount of noise to the computation. Here, we propose and implement a scheme to prepare a magic state on a superconducting qubit array using error correction. We find that our scheme produces better magic states than those we can prepare using the individual qubits of the device. This demonstrates a fundamental principle of fault-tolerant quantum computing~\cite{Shor96}, namely, that we can use error correction to improve the quality of logic gates with noisy qubits. Additionally, we show we can increase the yield of magic states using adaptive circuits, where circuit elements are changed depending on the outcome of mid-circuit measurements. This demonstrates an essential capability we will need for many error-correction subroutines. Our prototype will be invaluable in the future as it can reduce the number of physical qubits needed to produce high-fidelity magic states in large-scale quantum-computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Unification of spatiotemporal quantum formalisms: mapping between process and pseudo-density matrices via multiple-time states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the relation between three different approaches to defining quantum states across several times and locations: the pseudo-density matrix (PDM), the process matrix, and the multiple-time state approaches. Previous studies have shown that bipartite two-time states can reproduce the statistics of bipartite process matrices. Here, we show that the operational scenarios underlying two-time states can be represented as PDMs, and thereby construct a mapping from process matrices with measurements to PDMs. The existence of this mapping implies that PDMs can, like the process matrix, model processes with indefinite causal orders. The results contribute to the unification of quantum models of spatiotemporal states.</description>

Abstract: Spin qubits in semiconductor structures bring the promise of large-scale 2D integration, with the possibility to incorporate the control electronics on the same chip. In order to perform error correction on this platform, the characteristic features of spin qubits need to be accounted for. E.g., qubit readout involves an additional qubit which necessitates careful reconsideration of the qubit layout. The noise affecting spin qubits has further peculiarities such as the strong bias towards dephasing. In this work we consider state-of-the-art error correction codes that require only nearest-neighbour connectivity and are amenable to fast decoding via minimum-weight perfect matching. Compared to the surface code, the XZZX code, the reduced-connectivity surface code, the XYZ$^2$ matching code, and the Floquet code all bring different advantages in terms of error threshold, connectivity, or logical qubit encoding. We present the spin-qubit layout required for each of these error correction codes, accounting for reference qubits required for spin readout. The performance of these codes is studied under circuit-level noise accounting for distinct error rates for gates, readout and qubit decoherence during idling stages.</description>

      <title>Efficient quantum amplitude encoding of polynomial functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10917v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Loading functions into quantum computers represents an essential step in several quantum algorithms, such as quantum partial differential equation solvers. Therefore, the inefficiency of this process leads to a major bottleneck for the application of these algorithms. Here, we present and compare two efficient methods for the amplitude encoding of real polynomial functions on $n$ qubits. This case holds special relevance, as any continuous function on a closed interval can be uniformly approximated with arbitrary precision by a polynomial function. The first approach relies on the matrix product state representation. We study and benchmark the approximations of the target state when the bond dimension is assumed to be small. The second algorithm combines two subroutines. Initially we encode the linear function into the quantum registers with a swallow sequence of multi-controlled gates that loads the linear function's Hadamard-Walsh series, exploring how truncating the Hadamard-Walsh series of the linear function affects the final fidelity. Applying the inverse discrete Hadamard-Walsh transform transforms the series coefficients into an amplitude encoding of the linear function. Then, we use this construction as a building block to achieve a block encoding of the amplitudes corresponding to the linear function on $k_0$ qubits and apply the quantum singular value transformation that implements a polynomial transformation to the block encoding of the amplitudes. This unitary together with the Amplitude Amplification algorithm will enable us to prepare the quantum state that encodes the polynomial function on $k_0$ qubits. Finally we pad $n-k_0$ qubits to generate an approximated encoding of the polynomial on $n$ qubits, analyzing the error depending on $k_0$. In this regard, our methodology proposes a method to improve the state-of-the-art complexity by introducing controllable errors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a quantum system that is being continuously monitored, giving rise to a measurement signal. From such a stream of data, information needs to be inferred about the underlying system's dynamics. Here we focus on hypothesis testing problems and put forward the usage of sequential strategies where the signal is analyzed in real time, allowing the experiment to be concluded as soon as the underlying hypothesis can be identified with a certified prescribed success probability. We analyze the performance of sequential tests by studying the stopping-time behavior, showing a considerable advantage over currently-used strategies based on a fixed predetermined measurement time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Bell correlations may arise as a special sort of selection artefact, produced by ordinary control of the initial state of the experiments concerned. This accounts for nonlocality, without recourse to any direct spacelike causality or influence. The argument improves an earlier proposal in (arXiv:2101.05370v4 [quant-ph], arXiv:2212.06986 [quant-ph]) in two main respects: (i) in demonstrating its application in a real Bell experiment; and (ii) in avoiding the need for a postulate of retrocausality. This version includes an Appendix, discussing the relation of the proposal to the conclusions of Wood and Spekkens (arXiv:1208.4119 [quant-ph]).</description>

      <title>Particle detector models from path integrals of localized quantum fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16083v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral, we draw a connection between localized quantum field theories and more commonly used models of local probes in Relativistic Quantum Information (RQI). By integrating over and then tracing out the inaccessible modes of the localized field being used as a probe, we show that, at leading order in perturbation theory, the dynamics of any finite number of modes of the probe field is exactly that of a finite number of harmonic-oscillator Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors. The equivalence is valid for a rather general class of input states of the probe-target field system, as well as for any arbitrary number of modes included as detectors. The path integral also provides a closed-form expression which gives us a systematic way of obtaining the corrections to the UDW model at higher orders in perturbation theory due to the existence of the additional modes that have been traced out. This approach vindicates and extends a recently proposed bridge between detector-based and field-theory-based measurement frameworks for quantum field theory [T. R. Perche et al., Particle detectors from localized quantum field theories, Phys. Rev. D 109, 045013 (2024)], and also points to potential connections between particle detector models in RQI and other areas of physics where path integral methods are more commonplace -- in particular, the Wilsonian approach to the renormalization group and effective field theories.</description>

      <title>Fast Generation of GHZ-like States Using Collective-Spin XYZ Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state is a key resource for quantum information processing and quantum metrology. The atomic GHZ state can be generated by one-axis twisting (OAT) interaction $H_{\mathrm{OAT}}=\chi J_{z}^{2}$ with $\chi $ the interaction strength, but it requires a long evolution time $\chi t=\pi /2$ and is thus seriously influenced by decoherence and losses. Here we propose a three-body collective-spin XYZ model which creates a GHZ-like state in a very short timescale $\chi t\sim \ln {N}/N$ for $N$ particles. We show that this model can be effectively produced by applying Floquet driving to an original OAT Hamiltonian. Compared with the ideal GHZ state, the GHZ-like state generated using our model can maintain similar metrological properties reaching the Heisenberg-limited scaling, and it shows better robustness to decoherence and particle losses. This work opens the avenue for generating GHZ-like states with a large particle number, which holds great potential for the study of macroscopic quantum effects and for applications in quantum metrology and quantum information.</description>

      <title>Inspiration from machine learning on example of optimization of the Bose-Einstein condensate of thulium atoms in a 1064-nm trap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06795v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The number of atoms in Bose-Einstein condensate determines the scale of experiments that can be performed, making it crucial for quantum simulations. Optimization of the number of atoms in the condensate is a complex problem which could be efficiently solved using machine learning technique. Nevertheless, this approach usually does not give any insight in the underlying physics. Here we demonstrate possibility to learn physics from the machine learning on an example of condensation of thulium atoms at a 1064-nm dipole trap. Optimization of the number of condensed atoms revealed a saturation, which was explained as limitation imposed by a 3-body recombination process. This limitation was successfully overcome by leveraging Fano-Feshbach resonances.</description>

Abstract: Bosonic codes with rotational symmetry are currently one of the best performing quantum error correcting codes. Little is known about error propagation and code distance for these rotation codes in contrast with qubit codes and Bosonic codes with translation symmetry. We use a general purpose error basis that is naturally suited to codes with rotation symmetry to compute how errors propagate through gates. This error basis allows us to give an explicit error detection, decoding, and correction scheme for any code with rotation symmetry. We also prove that codes with an $N$-fold rotation symmetry have a distance of $(d_n, d_\theta)=(N, \pi/N)$ with respect to number and rotation errors.</description>

Abstract: Two-way microwave-optical quantum transduction is an essential capability to connect distant superconducting qubits via optical fiber, and to enable quantum networking at a large scale. In Bl\'esin, Tian, Bhave, and Kippenberg's article, ``Quantum coherent microwave-optical transduction using high overtone bulk acoustic resonances" (Phys. Rev. A, 104, 052601 (2021)), they lay out a quantum transduction system that accomplishes this by combining a piezoelectric interaction to convert microwave photons to GHz-scale phonons, and an optomechanical interaction to up-convert those phonons into telecom-band photons using a pump laser set to an adjacent telecom-band tone. In this work, we discuss these coupling interactions from first principles in order to discover what device parameters matter most in determining the transduction efficiency of this new platform, and to discuss strategies toward system optimization for near-unity transduction efficiency, as well as how noise impacts the transduction process.
  In addition, we address the post-transduction challenge of separating single photons of the transduced light from a classically bright pump only a few GHz away in frequency by proposing a novel optomechanical coupling mechanism using phonon-photon four-wave mixing via stress-induced optical nonlinearity and its thermodynamic connection to higher-orders of electrostriction. Where this process drives transduction by consuming pairs instead of individual pump photons, it will allow a clean separation of the transduced light from the classically bright pump driving the transduction process.</description>

Abstract: We present analytical and numerical solutions of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the scattered wavefunctions generated by confocal parabolic billiards and parabolic segments with various $\delta$-type potential-strength functions. The analytical expressions are expressed as summations of products of parabolic cylinder functions $D_m$. We numerically investigate the resonances and tunneling in the confocal parabolic billiards by employing an accurate boundary wall method that provides a complete inside-outside picture. The criterion for discretizing the parabolic sides of the billiard is explained in detail. We discuss the phenomenon of transparency at certain eigenenergies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study heat radiation and radiative heat transfer for nanoparticles in the presence of an infinitely long cylinder in different geometrical configurations, based on its electromagnetic Green's tensor. The heat radiation of a single particle can be enhanced by placing it close to a nanowire, and this enhancement can be much larger as compared to placing it close to a plate of the same material. The heat transfer along a cylinder decays much slower than through empty vacuum, being especially long-ranged in the case of a perfectly conducting nanowire, and showing nonmonotonic behavior in the case of a SiC cylinder. Exploring the dependence on the relative azimuthal angle of the nanoparticles, we find that the results are insensitive to small angles, but they can be drastically different when the angle is large, depending on the material. Finally, we demonstrate that a cylinder can either enhance or block the heat flux when placed perpendicular to the interparticle distance line, where the blocking in particular is strongly enhanced compared to the geometry of a sphere of same radius.</description>

Abstract: We report on the first realization of a novel neutral atom qubit encoded in the metastable fine-structure states ${^3\rm{P}_0}$ and ${^3\rm{P}_2}$ of single $^{88}$Sr atoms trapped in an optical tweezer. Raman coupling of the qubit states promises rapid single-qubit rotations on par with the fast Rydberg-mediated two-body gates. We demonstrate preparation, read-out, and coherent control of the qubit. In addition to driving Rabi oscillations bridging an energy gap of more than 17 THz using a pair of phase-locked clock lasers, we also carry out Ramsey spectroscopy to extract the transverse qubit coherence time $T_2$. When the tweezer is tuned into magic trapping conditions, which is achieved in our setup by tuning the tensor polarizability of the ${^3\rm{P}_2}$ state via an external control magnetic field, we measure $T_2 = 1.2$ ms. A microscopic quantum mechanical model is used to simulate our experiments including dominant noise sources. We identify the main constraints limiting the observed coherence time and project improvements to our system in the immediate future. Our work opens the door for a so far unexplored qubit encoding concept for neutral atom based quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Entanglement Measure: Applications to Multipartite Entanglement of Graph States and Bosonic Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computationally feasible multipartite entanglement measures are needed to advance our understanding of complex quantum systems. An entanglement measure based on the Fubini-Study metric has been recently introduced by Cocchiarella and co-workers, showing several advantages over existing methods, including ease of computation, a deep geometrical interpretation, and applicability to multipartite entanglement. Here, we present the Gaussian Entanglement Measure (GEM), a generalization of geometric entanglement measure for multimode Gaussian states, based on the purity of fragments of the whole systems. Our analysis includes the application of GEM to a two-mode Gaussian state coupled through a combined beamsplitter and a squeezing transformation. Additionally, we explore 3-mode and 4-mode graph states, where each vertex represents a bosonic mode, and each edge represents a quadratic transformation for various graph topologies. Interestingly, the ratio of the geometric entanglement measures for graph states with different topologies naturally captures properties related to the connectivity of the underlying graphs. Finally, by providing a computable multipartite entanglement measure for systems with a large number of degrees of freedom, we show that our definition can be used to obtain insights into a free bosonic field theory on $\mathbb R_t\times S^1$, going beyond the standard bipartite entanglement entropy approach between different regions of spacetime. The results presented herein suggest how the GEM paves the way for using quantum information-theoretical tools to study the topological properties of the space on which a quantum field theory is defined.</description>

      <title>Wave-particle correlations in multiphoton resonances of coherent light-matter interaction</title>

Abstract: We discuss the conditional measurement of field amplitudes by a nonclassical photon sequence in the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model under multiphoton operation. We do so by employing a correlator of immediate experimental relevance to reveal a distinct nonclassical evolution in the spirit of [G. T. Foster et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 85 3149 (2000)]. The correlator relies on the complementary nature of the pictures obtained from different unravelings of a JC source master equation. We demonstrate that direct photodetection entails a conditioned separation of timescales, a quantum beat and a semiclassical oscillation, produced by the coherent light-matter interaction in its strong-coupling limit. We single the quantum beat out in the analytical expression for the waiting-time distribution, pertaining to the particle nature of the scattered light, and find a negative spectrum of quadrature amplitude squeezing, characteristic of its wave nature for certain operation settings. Finally, we jointly detect the dual aspects through the wave-particle correlator, showing an asymmetric regression of fluctuations to the steady state which depends on the quadrature amplitude being measured.</description>

      <title>A 4-8 GHz Kinetic Inductance Travelling-Wave Parametric Amplifier Using Four-Wave Mixing with Near Quantum-Limit Noise Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinetic inductance traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (KI-TWPA) have a wide instantaneous bandwidth with near quantum-limited sensitivity and a relatively high dynamic range. Because of this, they are suitable readout devices for cryogenic detectors and superconducting qubits and have a variety of applications in quantum sensing. This work discusses the design, fabrication, and performance of a KI-TWPA based on four-wave mixing in a NbTiN microstrip transmission line. This device amplifies a signal band from 4 to 8~GHz without contamination from image tones, which are produced in a separate higher frequency band. The 4 - 8~GHz band is commonly used to read out cryogenic detectors, such as microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) and Josephson junction-based qubits. We report a measured maximum gain of over 20 dB using four-wave mixing with a 1-dB gain compression point of -58 dBm at 15 dB of gain over that band. The bandwidth and peak gain are tunable by adjusting the pump-tone frequency and power. Using a Y-factor method, we measure an amplifier-added noise of $ 0.5 \leq N_{added} \leq 1.5$ photons from 4.5 - 8 GHz.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlations in the steady state of light-emitter ensembles from perturbation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling of a quantum system to an environment leads generally to decoherence, and it is detrimental to quantum correlations within the system itself. Yet some forms of quantum correlations can be robust to the presence of an environment - or may even be stabilized by it. Predicting (let alone understanding) them remains arduous, given that the steady state of an open quantum system can be very different from an equilibrium thermodynamic state; and its reconstruction requires generically the numerical solution of the Lindblad equation, which is extremely costly for numerics. Here we focus on the highly relevant situation of ensembles of light emitters undergoing spontaneous decay; and we show that, whenever their Hamiltonian is perturbed away from a U(1) symmetric form, steady-state quantum correlations can be reconstructed via pure-state perturbation theory. Our main result is that in systems of light emitters subject to single-emitter or two-emitter driving, the steady state perturbed away from the U(1) limit generically exhibits spin squeezing; and it has minimal uncertainty for the collective-spin components, revealing that squeezing represents the optimal resource for entanglement-assisted metrology using this state.</description>

      <title>Matrix decompositions in Quantum Optics: Takagi/Autonne, Bloch-Messiah/Euler, Iwasawa, and Williamson</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we summarize four important matrix decompositions commonly used in quantum optics, namely the Takagi/Autonne, Bloch-Messiah/Euler, Iwasawa, and Williamson decompositions. The first two of these decompositions are specialized versions of the singular-value decomposition when applied to symmetric or symplectic matrices. The third factors any symplectic matrix in a unique way in terms of matrices that belong to different subgroups of the symplectic group. The last one instead gives the symplectic diagonalization of real, positive definite matrices of even size. While proofs of the existence of these decompositions exist in the literature, we focus on providing explicit constructions to implement these decompositions using standard linear algebra packages and functionalities such as singular-value, polar, Schur and QR decompositions, and matrix square roots and inverses.</description>

      <title>Strict hierarchy of optimal strategies for global estimations: Mapping global estimations into local ones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A crucial yet challenging issue in quantum metrology is to ascertain the ultimate precision achievable in estimation strategies. While there are two paradigms of estimations, local and global, current research is largely confined to local estimations, which are useful once the parameter of interest is approximately known. In this Letter we target a paradigm shift towards global estimations, which can operate reliably even with a few measurement data and no substantial prior knowledge about the parameter. The key innovation here is to develop a technique, dubbed virtual imaginary time evolution, capable of mapping global estimations into local ones. This offers an intriguing pathway to surmount challenges in the realm of global estimations by leveraging powerful tools tailored for local estimations. We explore our technique to unveil a strict hierarchy of achievable precision for different global estimation strategies, including parallel, sequential, and indefinite-causal-order strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying high-energy collisions of composite particles, such as hadrons and nuclei, is an outstanding goal for quantum simulators. However, preparation of hadronic wave packets has posed a significant challenge, due to the complexity of hadrons and the precise structure of wave packets. This has limited demonstrations of hadron scattering on quantum simulators to date. Observations of confinement and composite excitations in quantum spin systems have opened up the possibility to explore scattering dynamics in spin models. In this article, we develop two methods to create entangled spin states corresponding to wave packets of composite particles in analog quantum simulators of Ising spin Hamiltonians. One wave-packet preparation method uses the blockade effect enabled by beyond-nearest-neighbor Ising spin interactions. The other method utilizes a quantum-bus-mediated exchange, such as the native spin-phonon coupling in trapped-ion arrays. With a focus on trapped-ion simulators, we numerically benchmark both methods and show that high-fidelity wave packets can be achieved in near-term experiments. We numerically study scattering of wave packets for experimentally realizable parameters in the Ising model and find inelastic-scattering regimes, corresponding to particle production in the scattering event, with prominent and distinct experimental signals. Our proposal, therefore, demonstrates the potential of observing inelastic scattering in near-term quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: Quantum density matrix represents all the information of the entire quantum system, and novel models of meaning employing density matrices naturally model linguistic phenomena such as hyponymy and linguistic ambiguity, among others in quantum question answering tasks. Naturally, we argue that the quantum density matrix can enhance the image feature information and the relationship between the features for the classical image classification. Specifically, we (i) combine density matrices and CNN to design a new mechanism; (ii) apply the new mechanism to some representative classical image classification tasks. A series of experiments show that the application of quantum density matrix in image classification has the generalization and high efficiency on different datasets. The application of quantum density matrix both in classical question answering tasks and classical image classification tasks show more effective performance.</description>

      <title>Defining an universal "sign" to strictly probe phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mystery of the infamous sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations mightily restricts applications of the method in fermionic and frustrated systems. A recent work [Science \textbf{375}, 418 (2022)] made a remarkable breakthrough in the sign problem by pointing out that the sign can be used to probe phase transition. In this work, we proposed a general argument based on the definition of the sign that is related to the difference in free energy between the original and reference systems to clarify that the sign problem and phase transition cannot always be strictly related. The sign can exactly probe phase transition only if the free energy in the reference system is flat under variable parameters, which is almost impossible to design. Generally speaking, the conclusion that the sign can probe phase transition is survivorship bias without universality. To solve this problem, we define a modified sign that excludes the influence of the reference system, which can probe the phase transition strictly. The work gives an unbiased solution for detecting phase transition by the new modified sign.</description>

      <title>Quantum Control of Radical Pair Dynamics beyond Time-Local Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We realize arbitrary waveform-based control of spin-selective recombination reactions of radical pairs in the low magnetic field regime. To this end, we extend the Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) paradigm to allow for optimizing reaction yields. This overcomes drawbacks of previously suggested time-local optimization approaches for the reaction control of radical pairs, which were limited to high biasing fields. We demonstrate how efficient time-global optimization of the recombination yields can be realized by gradient based methods augmented by time-blocking, sparse sampling of the yield, and evaluation of the central single time-step propagators and their Fr\'echet derivatives using iterated Trotter-Suzuki splittings. Results are shown for both a toy model, previously used to demonstrate coherent control of radical pair reactions in the simpler high-field scenario, and furthermore for a realistic exciplex-forming donor-acceptor system comprising 16 nuclear spins. This raises prospects for the spin-control of actual radical pair systems in ambient magnetic fields, by suppressing or boosting radical reaction yields using purpose-specific radio-frequency waveforms, paving the way for reaction-yield-dependent quantum magnetometry and potentially applications of quantum control to biochemical radical pair reactions. We demonstrate the latter aspect for two radical pairs implicated in quantum biology.</description>

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots operated dynamically are the basis of many quantum technologies such as quantum sensors and computers. Hence, modelling their electrical properties at microwave frequencies becomes essential to simulate their performance in larger electronic circuits. Here, we develop a self-consistent quantum master equation formalism to obtain the admittance of a quantum dot tunnel-coupled to a charge reservoir under the effect of a coherent photon bath. We find a general expression for the admittance that captures the well-known semiclassical (thermal) limit, along with the transition to lifetime and power broadening regimes due to the increased coupling to the reservoir and amplitude of the photonic drive, respectively. Furthermore, we describe two new photon-mediated regimes: Floquet broadening, determined by the dressing of the QD states, and broadening determined by photon loss in the system. Our results provide a method to simulate the high-frequency behaviour of QDs in a wide range of limits, describe past experiments, and propose novel explorations of QD-photon interactions.</description>

      <title>Complex dynamics approach to dynamical quantum phase transitions: the Potts model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces complex dynamics methods to study dynamical quantum phase transitions in the one- and two-dimensional quantum 3-state Potts model. The quench involves switching off an infinite transverse field. The time-dependent Loschmidt echo is evaluated by an exact renormalization group (RG) transformation in the complex plane where the thermal Boltzmann factor is along the positive real axis, and the quantum time evolution is along the unit circle. One of the characteristics of the complex dynamics constituted by repeated applications of RG is the Julia set, which determines the phase transitions. We show that special boundary conditions can alter the nature of the transitions, and verify the claim for the one-dimensional system by transfer matrix calculations. In two dimensions, there are alternating symmetry-breaking and restoring transitions, both of which are first-order, despite the criticality of the Curie point. In addition, there are finer structures because of the fractal nature of the Julia set. Our approach can be extended to multi-variable problems, higher dimensions, and approximate RG transformations expressed as rational functions.</description>

Abstract: In this work we analytically explain the origin of the mobility edge in the partially disordered random regular graphs of degree d, i.e., with a fraction $\beta$ of the sites being disordered, while the rest remain clean. It is shown that the mobility edge in the spectrum survives in {a certain range of parameters} $(d,\beta)$ at infinitely large uniformly distributed disorder. The critical curve separating extended and localized states is derived analytically and confirmed numerically. The duality in the localization properties between the sparse and extremely dense RRG has been found and understood.</description>

Abstract: The nonequilibrium dynamics of a periodically driven extended XY model, in the presence of linear time dependent magnetic filed, is investigated using the notion of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs). Along the similar lines to the equilibrium phase transition, the main purpose of this work is to search the fundamental concepts such as scaling and universality at the ramped quench DQPTs. We have shown that the critical points of the model, where the gap closing occurs, can be moved by tuning the driven frequency and consequently the presence/absence of DQPTs can be flexibly controlled by adjusting the driven frequency. %Taking advantage of this property, We have uncovered that, for a ramp across the single quantum critical point, the critical mode at which DQPTs occur is classified into three regions: the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) region, where the critical mode scales linearly with the square root of the sweep velocity, pre-saturated (PS) region, and the saturated (S) region where the critical mode makes a plateau versus the sweep velocity. While for a ramp that crosses two critical points, the critical modes disclose just KZ and PS regions. On the basis of numerical simulations, we find that the dynamical free energy scales linerly with time, as approaches to DQPT time, with the exponent $\nu=1\pm 0.01$ for all sweep velocities and driven frequencies.</description>

Abstract: A detection scheme is explored for light dark matter, such as axion dark matter or dark photon dark matter, using a Paul ion trap system. We first demonstrate that a qubit, constructed from the ground and first excited states of vibrational modes of ions in a Paul trap, can serve as an effective sensor for weak electric fields due to its resonant excitation. As a consequence, a Paul ion trap allows us to search for weak electric fields induced by light dark matter with masses around the neV range. Furthermore, we illustrate that an entangled qubit system involving $N$ ions can enhance the excitation rate by a factor of $N^2$. The sensitivities of the Paul ion trap system to axion-photon coupling and gauge kinetic mixing can reach previously unexplored parameter space.</description>

Abstract: A quantum wave function with localization on classical periodic orbits in a mesoscopic elliptic billiard has been achieved by appropriately superposing nearly degenerate eigenstates expressed as products of Mathieu functions. We analyze and discuss the rotational and librational regimes of motion in the elliptic billiard. Simplified line equations corresponding to the classical trajectories can be extracted from the quantum state as an integral equation involving angular Mathieu functions. The phase factors appearing in the integrals are connected to the classical initial positions and velocity components. We analyze the probability current density, the phase maps, and the vortex distributions of the periodic orbit quantum states for both rotational and librational motions; furthermore, they may represent traveling and standing trajectories inside the elliptic billiard.</description>

Abstract: Krylov methods have reappeared recently, connecting physically sensible notions of complexity with quantum chaos and quantum gravity. In these developments, the Hamiltonian and the Liouvillian are tridiagonalized so that Schrodinger/Heisenberg time evolution is expressed in the Krylov basis. In the context of Schrodinger evolution, this tridiagonalization has been carried out in Random Matrix Theory. We extend these developments to Heisenberg time evolution, describing how the Liouvillian can be tridiagonalized as well until the end of Krylov space. We numerically verify the analytical formulas both for Gaussian and non-Gaussian matrix models.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of SU(3) Lattice Yang Mills Theory at Leading Order in Large N</title>

Abstract: A Hamiltonian lattice formulation of SU(3) gauge theory opens the possibility for quantum simulations of the non-perturbative dynamics of QCD. By parametrizing the gauge invariant Hilbert space in terms of plaquette degrees of freedom, we show how the Hilbert space and interactions can be expanded in inverse powers of N_c. At leading order in this expansion, the Hamiltonian simplifies dramatically, both in the required size of the Hilbert space as well as the type of interactions involved. Adding a truncation of the resulting Hilbert space in terms of local energy states we give explicit constructions that allow simple representations of SU(3) gauge fields on qubits and qutrits. The limitations of these truncations are explored using Monte Carlo methods. This formulation allows a simulation of the real time dynamics of a SU(3) lattice gauge theory on a $5\times5$ and $8\times8$ lattice on ibm_torino with a CNOT depth of 113.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced phase transitions by matrix product states scaling</title>

Abstract: We study the time evolution of long quantum spin chains subjected to continuous monitoring via matrix product states (MPS) at fixed bond dimension, with the Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) algorithm. The latter gives an effective classical non-linear evolution with a conserved charge, which approximates the real quantum evolution up to an error. We show that the error rate displays a phase transition in the monitoring strength, which can be well detected by scaling analysis with relatively low values of bond dimensions. The method allows for an efficient numerical determination of the critical measurement-induced phase transition parameters in many-body quantum systems. Moreover, in the presence of U(1) global spin charge, we show the existence of a charge-sharpening transition well separated from the entanglement transition which we detect by studying the charge fluctuations of a local sub-part of the system at very large times. Our work substantiates the TDVP time evolution as a method to identify measured-induced phase transitions in systems of arbitrary dimensions and sizes.</description>

      <title>Implementation and characterization of the dice lattice in the electron quantum simulator</title>

Abstract: Materials featuring touching points, localized states, and flat bands are of great interest in condensed matter and artificial systems due to their implications in topology, quantum geometry, superconductivity, and interactions. In this theoretical study, we propose the experimental realization of the dice lattice with adjustable parameters by arranging carbon monoxide molecules on a two-dimensional electron system at a (111) copper surface. First, we develop a theoretical framework to obtain the spectral properties within a nearly free electron approximation and then compare them with tight-binding calculations. Our investigation reveals that the high mobility of Shockley state electrons enables an accurate theoretical description of the artificial lattice using a next-nearest-neighbor tight-binding model, resulting in the emergence of a touching point, a quasi-flat band, and localized lattice site behavior in the local density of states. Additionally, we present theoretical results for a long-wavelength low-energy model that accounts for next-nearest-neighbor hopping terms. Furthermore, we theoretically examine the model's behavior under an external magnetic field by employing Peierl's substitution, a commonly used technique in theoretical physics to incorporate magnetic fields into lattice models. Our theoretical findings suggest that, owing to the exceptional electron mobility, the highly degenerate eigenenergy associated with the Aharonov-Bohm caging mechanism may not manifest in the proposed experiment.</description>
