      <title>Thin Coalgebraic Behaviours Are Inductive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coalgebras for analytic functors uniformly model graph-like systems where the successors of a state may admit certain symmetries. Examples of successor structure include ordered tuples, cyclic lists and multisets. Motivated by goals in automata-based verification and results on thin trees, we introduce thin coalgebras as those coalgebras with only countably many infinite paths from each state. Our main result is an inductive characterisation of thinness via an initial algebra. To this end, we develop a syntax for thin behaviours and capture with a single equation when two terms represent the same thin behaviour. Finally, for the special case of polynomial functors, we retrieve from our syntax the notion of Cantor-Bendixson rank of a thin tree.</description>

      <title>A Uniform Framework for Handling Position Constraints in String Solving (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07033v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel decision procedure for solving the class of position string constraints, which includes string disequalities, not-prefixof, not-suffixof, str$.$at, and not-str$.$at. These constraints are generated frequently in almost any application of string constraint solving. Our procedure avoids expensive encoding of the constraints to word equations and, instead, reduces the problem to checking conflicts on positions satisfying an integer constraint obtained from the Parikh image of a polynomial-sized finite automaton with a special structure. By the reduction to counting, solving position constraints becomes NP-complete and for some cases even falls into PTime. This is much cheaper than the previously used techniques, which either used reductions generating word equations and length constraints (for which modern string solvers use exponential-space algorithms) or incomplete techniques. Our method is relevant especially for automata-based string solvers, which have recently achieved the best results in terms of practical efficiency, generality, and completeness guarantees. This work allows them to excel also on position constraints, which used to be their weakness. Besides the efficiency gains, we show that our framework may be extended to solve a large fragment of not-contains (in NExpTime), for which decidability has been long open, and gives a hope to solve the general problem. Our implementation of the technique within the Z3-Noodler solver significantly improves its performance on position constraints.</description>
