      <title>Thermoelectric effect at the quantum Hall-superconductor interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interfaces of quantum Hall insulators with superconductors have emerged as a promising platform to realise interesting physics that may be relevant for topologically protected quantum computing. However, these interfaces can host other effects which obscure the detection of the desired excitations. Here we present measurements of the thermoelectric effect at the quantum Hall-superconductor interface. We explain the heat transport by considering the formation of a hotspot at the interface, which results in a non-equilibrium distribution of electrons that can propagate across the superconductor through vortex cores. The observed thermoelectric effect results in a voltage which changes sign on quantum Hall plateaus and responds to the rearrangement of vortices in the wire. These observations highlight the complex interplay of thermal and charge phenomena at the quantum Hall -- superconductor interfaces and should be considered when interpreting transport measurements in similar systems.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Systems: Coupling Single-Molecule Magnet Qudits with Industrial Silicon Spin Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular spin qudits offer an attractive platform for quantum memory, combining long coherence times with rich multi-level spin structures. Terbium bis(phthalocyaninato) (TbPc$_2$) exemplifies such systems, with demonstrated quantum control and chemical reproducibility. In hybrid quantum architectures, TbPc$_2$ can act as the primary memory element, with semiconductor qubits providing scalable readout and coupling. Here we present a step toward such a hybrid system: using an industrially manufactured silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (SiMOS) spin qubit to detect electronic spin transitions of an ensemble of TbPc$_2$ molecules. The readout is based on a compact and robust protocol that applies a microwave pulse while all gate voltages defining the qubit are held at a fixed operating point. This protocol, which combines simultaneous Rapid adiabatic Passage and Spin- Selective tunneling (RPSS), enables high-contrast resonance detection and avoids repeated $\pi$-pulse recalibration common in decoupling schemes. By demonstrating ensemble detection, we establish a foundation for integrating molecular quantum memories with industrial qubit platforms and mark an important step toward single-molecule hybrid quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Magnetic Domain Walls in Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic domain walls play a critical role in the nanoscale evolution of magnetic devices. Despite the early efforts, a complete understanding of the micromagnetic evolution of the width and the type of magnetic domain walls has still remained missing. Here, we report a combined analytical and micromagnetic simulation study and establish the scaling of the magnetic domains as a function of the exchange stiffness (A), uniaxial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (Ku), saturation magnetization (Ms), and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), and shape anisotropy of the magnetic device. We find that the width of both Bloch and Neel walls scales excellently with the analytical prediction. The DMI is found to have little influence on the domain wall width but strongly affect the type of the domain wall. The domain wall has a Bloch configuration at zero DMI and gradually transitions to Neel configuration upon increase of the DMI. The shape anisotropy of the magnetic domain wall also affects the domain wall width. These results have established a comprehensive, conclusive understanding of the magnetic domain walls within spintronics devices.</description>

      <title>Roles of Electrically Excited Magnons in Unidirectional Magnetoresistance of Metallic Magnetic Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) in metallic bilayers arises from nonlinear spin-charge transport mediated by broken time-reversal and inversion symmetries, yet the role of magnons remains unsettled. We develop a theoretical framework that incorporates coupled electron-magnon dynamics, revealing cross diffusion and spin-angular-momentum transfer between the two subsystems, which renormalize the characteristic electron and magnon spin-diffusion lengths. We show that nonequilibrium magnons, indirectly excited by the electric field, can suppress UMR by absorbing spin angular momentum from conduction electrons. We also analyze the magnetic-field, thickness, and temperature dependencies and identify distinct features that constitute experimental fingerprints of magnonic contributions to UMR in metallic bilayers, providing qualitative to semiquantitative guidance for elucidating the underlying physical mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum heat transport by electrons in ballistic channels is usually well-described in the Landauer-B\"uttiker framework, which fails when introducing strong Coulomb interactions. We theoretically show that a chain of small metallic dots where charge cannot accumulate, connected by chiral ballistic channels, conducts heat better than charge. We relate this feature to the competition between heat diffusion by neutral excitations and Coulomb interactions in the chain, which defines a temperature gradient over a finite characteristic length. We show that the Lorenz ratio can be arbitrarily large, scaling as the square root of the chain's length, which suggests new approaches for heat manipulation in mesoscopic systems.</description>

      <title>Constructing a Nanopipette-based DNA Electro-Mechanical Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state nanopore and nanopipette sensors are powerful devices for the detection, quantification and structural analysis of biopolymers such as DNA and proteins, especially in carrier-enhanced resistive-pulse sensing. However, hundreds of different molecules typically need to be sampled from solution and analysed to obtain statistically robust information. This limits the applicability of such sensors and complicates associated workflows. Here, we present a new strategy to trap DNA structures in the sensing region of a nanopipette through end functionalisation and nanoparticle capping. We develop a robust set of descriptors to characterise the insertion and presence of nanoparticle-DNA constructs in the nanopipette tip and, furthermore, show that they remain mobile and responsive to external electric fields over extended periods of time. This allows for repeated readout of the same DNA structure and could enable new applications for such sensors, for example in flow and in confined environments.</description>

      <title>Time domain braiding of anyons revealed through a nonequilibrium fluctuation dissipation theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a novel fluctuation--dissipation theorem (FDT) valid for nonequilibrium initial states that imprint the braiding of anyons in the time domain. The derivation is carried out within the Unifying Nonequilibrium Perturbative Theory (UNEPT), which applies to both standard reservoir geometries and configurations with one or two quantum point contacts (QPCs) injecting dilute anyonic fluxes. Based on this FDT, we propose complementary methods to determine the time-domain braiding phase. The first method relates the DC backscattering noise to the integral of the current with respect to DC drives, while the second connects the AC current phase shift to the DC noise. The latter provides a particularly robust probe of the statistical angle $\theta$, offering an intrinsic calibration and cancelling certain nonuniversal renormalization effects. Specializing to a thermalized Tomonaga--Luttinger liquid (TLL), we further show that in the quantum regime the phase shift enables a direct determination of the scaling dimension $\delta$ when $\delta &gt; 1/2$. These results define experimentally accessible schemes to extract either $\theta$ or $\delta$ in minimal single-QPC setups, without relying on interferometry or cross-correlation measurements.</description>

      <title>RKKY interaction in Weyl semimetal nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effective couplings induced between localized impurities on the surface of a Weyl semimetal (WSM) nanowire within the framework of Ruderman--Kittel--Kasuya--Yosida (RKKY) theory. The itinerant electrons from the chiral Fermi arc surface states mediate impurity-impurity interaction at low energies. As a result, the spin-momentum locking naturally plays a central role in shaping the spin-spin correlations. We show that the dominant interaction channels have distinct origins: while the azimuthal coupling, $J_{\phi\phi}$ term arises exclusively from Fermi arc states with identical spin polarization, the couplings $J_{\mu\nu}$ ($\mu,\nu = z,r$) are governed by Fermi arc states with opposite spin polarizations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that purely surface-mediated contributions exhibit different scaling behavior compared to those involving Fermi arcs and low-energy bulk states. We systematically untangle the contributions from bulk and surface states to the RKKY couplings, using analytical and numerical methods. Our results establish WSM nanowires as a versatile platform for engineering and simulating a broad class of spin models.</description>

      <title>Non-unitary Time Evolution via the Chebyshev Expansion Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chebyshev expansion method is a well-established technique for computing the time evolution of quantum states, particularly in Hermitian systems with a bounded spectrum. Here, we show that the applicability of the Chebyshev expansion method extends well beyond this constraint: It remains valid across the entire complex plane and is thus suitable for arbitrary non-Hermitian matrices. We identify that numerical rounding errors are the primary source of errors encountered when applying the method outside the conventional spectral bounds, and they are not caused by fundamental limitations. By carefully selecting the spectral radius and the time step, we show how these errors can be effectively suppressed, enabling accurate time evolution calculations in non-Hermitian systems. We derive an analytic upper bound for the rounding error, which serves as a practical guideline for selecting time steps in numerical simulations. As an application, we illustrate the performance of the method by computing the time evolution of wave packets in the Hatano-Nelson model.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Charge Noise Sources in Quantum Dot Spin Qubits via Impedance Spectroscopy, DLTS, and C-V Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10861v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherence and fidelity of quantum dot (QD) spin qubits are fundamentally limited by charge noise arising from electrically active trap states at oxide interfaces, heterostructure boundaries, and within the bulk semiconductor. These traps introduce electrostatic fluctuations that couple to the qubit via spin-orbit interactions or charge-sensitive confinement potentials, leading to dephasing and gate errors. In this work, we present a general trap characterization framework for identifying and quantifying the spectral signatures of these trap states using AC impedance spectroscopy, deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS), and conventional capacitance-voltage (C-V) analysis. While our case study focuses on strained Ge/SiGe quantum well heterostructures, the approach is broadly applicable to other material systems and qubit types. We demonstrate that each class of traps (oxide interface, quantum well interface, and bulk) exhibits distinct fingerprints across frequency- and time-domain measurements. Oxide traps dominate the low-frequency conductance peaks and appear strongly in Nyquist and transient spectra. QW interface traps, despite being nearly invisible at low densities in conventional C-V and AC impedance analysis, are clearly resolved through multi-exponential decay signatures in time-domain response. Bulk traps contribute to high-frequency admittance and steady-state leakage currents. By correlating each trap type to its characteristic time constant, spatial location, and spectral impact, we provide a diagnostic toolset for disentangling noise sources that degrade qubit performance. This unified methodology bridges traditional defect metrology with emerging qubit noise analysis and enables material- and process-level strategies for coherence optimization in scalable quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional flat-bands in Moire-diamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of flat-bands in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene has underscored the potential of moire engineering for correlated states, but such phases are notoriously difficult to realize and highly fragile against perturbations. Here, we propose an alternative route to flat-bands by introducing sp3 hybridization in twisted graphite. Instead of relying on fine-tuned magic angles, our approach identifies flat-band states at relatively large twist angles with short moire periods. In this regime, sp3-induced reconstructions generate electronic states that, once formed, are locked by substantial energy barriers, rendering them robust against external perturbations. Using twisted graphite as a prototype, we uncover a series moire-diamond that host two-dimensional flat conduction of valence bands, where carriers are localized within specific momentum planes but remain dispersive along orthogonal directions. The emergence of dimensional flat-bands opens a new platform for flat-band-driven correlated physics and suggests opportunities for designing quantum materials with highly directional electronic functionalities.</description>

      <title>Local-Antisymmetric Flat Band and Coexisting Correlated stripe charge orders in WSe2-Modulated Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insulating, atomically flat transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) like WSe2 are ideal substrates for probing intrinsic graphene properties. Conventionally, their influence on graphene's band structure is assumed negligible, particularly when small moire patterns form. Combining scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and theoretical analysis, we reveal that the atomic registry in graphene/WSe2 heterostructures profoundly modulates the electronic structure of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). At special graphene/WSe2 twist angles, an incommensurate moire superlattice hosts three distinct atomic stacking configurations (A, B, X types). These induce position-dependent potentials that asymmetrically shift MATBG's flat bands, transforming them from hole-side to electron-side asymmetric within a single AA-stacked region. This symmetry breaking enables the unprecedented coexistence of orthogonal stripe charge orders in the correlated regime-a phenomenon previously considered mutually exclusive due to Coulomb repulsion. This band modulation arises from the synergistic effects of the graphene/WSe2 interfacial atomic registry and heterostrain within the MATBG, exhibiting multi-field tunability. Our work establishes interfacial atomic registry as a critical, previously overlooked tuning parameter for flat-band physics, opening avenues to engineer correlated quantum states in van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Should it really be that hard to model the chirality induced spin selectivity effect?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chirality induced spin selectivity effect remains a challenge to capture with theoretical modeling. While at least a decade was spent on independent electron models, which completely fail to reproduce the experimental results, the lesson to be drawn out of these efforts is that a correct modeling of the effect has to include interactions among the electrons. In the discussion of the phenomenon ones inevitably encounters the Onsager reciprocity and time-reversal symmetry, and questions whether the observations violate these fundamental concepts, or whether we have not been able to identify what it is that make those concepts redundant in this context. The experimental fact is that electrons spin-polarize by one or another reason, when traversing chiral molecules. The set-ups are simple enough to enable effective modeling, however, overcoming the grand failures of the theoretical efforts, thus far, and formulating a theory which is founded on microscopic modeling appears to be a challenge. A discussion of the importance of electron correlations is outlined, pointing to possible spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry and Onsager reciprocity.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional topological superconductors with nonsymmorphic symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present example four-band Hermitian tight-binding Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonians and Kramer's degenerate Hamiltonians in one dimension. Starting from a generalized Rice-Mele model, we incorporate superconducting terms to obtain a four-band BdG Hamiltonian with intrinsic charge-conjugation symmetry, and constrain it using symmorphic or nonsymmorphic time-reversal symmetries. In position space we find that each form of time-reversal symmetry, when applied to random BdG matrices, results in a unique block diagonalization of the Hamiltonian when translational symmetry is also enforced. We provide representative models in all relevant symmorphic symmetry classes, including the non-superconducting CII class. For nonsymmorphic time-reversal symmetry, we identify a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological index with two phases supporting Majorana zero modes and two without, and study disorder effects in the presence of topological solitons. We further generalize a winding-number method, previously applied only to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants without Kramer's degeneracy, to compute indices for both the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ model and a non-superconducting AII model with nonsymmorphic chiral symmetry and Kramer's degeneracy. We propose topolectric circuit implementations of the charge-density-wave and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ models which agree with the topological calculations. Finally, we show that, in one dimension, nonsymmorphic unitary symmetries do not produce new topological classifications beyond $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}_2$ indices.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Switching in Altermagnets via Asymmetric Sublattice Spin Current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a deterministic switching mechanism in collinear altermagnets driven by asymmetric sublattice spin currents. Unlike conventional antiferromagnets, where combined parity-time-reversal symmetry enforces purely staggered sublattice spin torques, altermagnets host symmetry-protected nonrelativistic spin splitting that produces unequal torques on the two sublattices. Using doped FeSb$_2$ as a representative $d$-wave altermagnet, our Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert simulations show that these torques enable magnetic-field-free and deterministic 180$^\circ$ N\'eel vector reversal over picosecond timescale. The mechanism is generic to even-parity altermagnets and remains effective even in centrosymmetric, weak spin-orbit coupled systems, where the N\'eel spin-orbit torque mechanism fails. Our results establish an experimentally accessible mechanism for switching of altermagnetic order, opening pathways for realizing ultrafast, low-power altermagnet spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Intermediate chiral edge states in quantum Hall Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A transfer-matrix-based theoretical framework is developed to study transport in superconductor-quantum Hall-Superconductor (SQHS) Josephson junctions modulated by local potential barriers in the quantum-Hall regime. The method allows one to evaluate the change in the conductivity of such SQHS Josephson junctions contributed by the intermediate chiral edge states (ICES) induced by these local potential barriers at their electrostatic boundaries at specific electron filling-fractions. It is particularly demonstrated how these ICES created at different Landau levels (LL) overlap with each other through intra- and inter-LL ICES mixing with the change in strength and width of the potential barriers. This results in different mechanisms for forming Landau bands when an array of such potential barriers are present. It is also demonstrated that our theoretical framework can be extended to study the lattice effect in a bounded domain in such SQHS Josephson junctions by simultaneously submitting the normal region to a transverse magnetic field and periodic potential.</description>

      <title>Chirality reversal at finite magnetic impurity strength and local signatures of a topological phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the honeycomb lattice with a single magnetic impurity modeled by adding imaginary next-nearest-neighbor hopping ih on a single hexagon. This Haldane defect gives a topological mass term to the gapless Dirac cones and generates chirality. For a small density of defects Neehus et al [arXiv:2405.19289] found that the system's chirality reverses at a critical hc ~ 0.95 associated with an unexpected tri-critical point of Dirac fermions at zero defect density. We investigate this zero-density limit by analyzing a single defect and computing two experimentally relevant measures of chirality: (1) orbital magnetization via local Chern marker, a bulk probe of all occupied states; and (2) electronic currents of low-energy states. Both probes show a chirality reversal at a critical hc ~ 0.9--1. Motivated by this consistency we propose a defect-scale toy model whose low energy states reverse their chirality at hc' ~ 0.87. Remarkably, the same pair of zero energy bound states also generate the critical point hc in the full impurity projected T-matrix. Our results show how the chirality reversal produced by an impurity can be observed either in local probes or in the global topology and suggest a possible role of the microscopic defect structure at the critical point.</description>

      <title>Vari-Cool: a non-unitary quantum variational protocol for simulated cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a variational approach for preparing low energy states of arbitrary target Hamiltonians. The protocol is defined in terms of a repeated cycle consisting of p layers of unitary gates applied to the system and ancilla "bath" qubits, followed by reset of the bath qubits. The gate parameters within each cycle are optimized such that the steady state achieved after many cycles has a low energy expectation value with respect to the target Hamiltonian, and that the energy converges toward the steady state value in as few cycles as possible. We illustrate the protocol for the transverse field Ising model, and study its systematic behaviors with respect to system size, model parameters, and noise using tensor network based classical simulations. We then experimentally demonstrate its operation on IBM's ibm_kingston quantum processor for up to 28 system qubits coupled to 14 bath sites. Classical training on small system sizes and with few unitary layers per cycle gives robust results that transfer well to larger system sizes and to noisy hardware.</description>

      <title>Raman Digital Twin of Monolayer Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a key class of two-dimensional (2D) materials with broad technological potential. Their Janus counterparts exhibit unique properties due to broken out-of-plane symmetry and further enrich the functionalities of TMDs. However, experimental synthesis and identification of Janus TMDs remain challenging. It is thus highly desirable to have a rapid, simple, and in situ characterization technique to monitor, in real time, the conversion process from the parent to Janus structure. Raman spectroscopy stands out for such a task as it is a powerful, non-destructive, and very commonly used tool to characterize 2D materials both in situ and ex situ. To realize the full potential of Raman spectroscopy on rapid characterization of Janus TMDs, we present a computational "Raman digital twin" library for various monolayer Janus TMDs in both 2H and Td phases. We focus on group-6 TMDs: MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WSe$_2$, MoTe$_2$, WTe$_2$ and their Janus variants: MoSSe, MoSTe, MoSeTe, WSSe, WSTe, and WSeTe. Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we calculate their vibrational properties and predict distinct Raman fingerprints. These phonon and Raman signatures reflect each material's structural symmetry and atomic composition, enabling clear identification via Raman spectroscopy. Our theoretical work supports experimental efforts by providing benchmarks for material identification, structural analysis, and quality control. The computational library expedites the discovery and development of Janus 2D materials, facilitating tighter integration between theoretical predictions and experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Structural Duality of Graphene Grain Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grain boundaries (GBs) are ubiquitous in large-scale graphene samples, playing a crucial role in their overall performance. Due to their complexity, they are usually investigated as model structures, under the assumption of a fully relaxed interface. Here, we present cantilever-based non-contact atomic force microscopy (ncAFM) as a suitable technique to resolve, atom by atom, the complete structure of these linear defects. Our experimental findings reveal a richer scenario than expected, with the coexistence of energetically stable and metastable graphene GBs. Although both GBs are structurally composed of pentagonal and heptagonal like rings, they can be differentiated by the irregular geometric shapes present in the metastable boundaries. Theoretical modeling and simulated ncAFM images, accounting for the experimental data, show that metastable GBs form under compressive uniaxial strain and exhibit vertical corrugation, whereas stable GBs remain in a fully relaxed, flat configuration. By locally introducing energy with the AFM tip, we show the possibility to manipulate the metastable GBs, driving them toward their minimum energy configuration. Notably, our high-resolution ncAFM images reveal a clear dichotomy: while the structural distortions of metastable grain boundaries are confined to just a few atoms, their impact on graphene's properties extends over significantly larger length scales.</description>

Abstract: Magnets with controllable magnetization and high critical temperature are essential for practical spintronics devices, among which the two-dimensional 1T-CrTe2 stands out because of its high experimental critical temperature up to about 300K down to the single layer limit. By using ab initio density functional theory, we investigate the magnetic properties of monolayer and bilayer 1T-CrTe2 and demonstrate that the magnetic properties, such as the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, critical Curie temperature and magnetizations, can be influenced by strain or electric fields.</description>

      <title>Weak-anti-localization-to-spin-dependent scattering at a proximity-magnetized heavy metal interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A change in a materials electrical resistance with magnetic field (magnetoresistance) results from quantum interference effects and, or spin-dependent transport, depending on materials properties and dimensionality. In disordered conductors, electron interference leads to weak localization or anti-localization; in contrast, ferromagnetic conductors support spin-dependent scattering, leading to giant magnetoresistance (GMR). By varying the thickness of Au between 4 and 28 nm in a EuS/Au/EuS spin-switches, we observe a crossover from weak anti-localization to interfacial GMR. The crossover is related to a magnetic proximity effect in Au due to electron scattering at the insulating EuS interface. The proximity-induced exchange field in Au suppresses weak anti-localization, consistent with Maekawa-Fukuyama theory. With increasing Au thickness, GMR emerges along with spin Hall magnetoresistance. These findings demonstrate spin transport governed by interfacial exchange fields, building a framework for spintronic functionality without metallic magnetism.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Squeezing-Induced Algebraic Non-Hermitian Skin Effects and Ultra Spectral Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The well-established non-Bloch band theory predicts exponential localization of skin-mode eigenstates in one-dimensional (1D) non-Hermitian systems. Recent studies, however, have uncovered anomalous algebraic localization in higher dimensions. Here, we extend these ideas to Hermitian bosonic quadratic Hamiltonians incorporating quantum squeezing, offering a genuine quantum framework to explore non-Hermitian phenomena without external reservoirs. We construct a two-dimensional (2D) bosonic lattice model with two-mode squeezing and study its spectral properties of bosonic excitation within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) formalism. We demonstrate an algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by quasi-long-range power-law localization of complex eigenstates. The system shows ultra spectral sensitivity to double infinitesimal on-site and long-range hopping impurities, while remaining insensitive to single impurities. Analytical treatment via the Green's function reveals that this sensitivity originates from the divergence of the nonlocal Green's function associated with the formation of nonlocal bound states between impurities. Our study establishes a framework for realizing novel higher-dimensional non-Hermitian physics in Hermitian bosonic platforms such as superconducting circuits, photonic lattices, and optomechanical arrays, with the demonstrated ultraspectral sensitivity enabling quantum sensing and amplification via bosonic squeezing.</description>

      <title>Fluidity and morphological stability of an amorphous thin film with radiation-induced defect kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is common to model ion-irradiated amorphous thin films as if they were highly viscous fluids. In such models, one is frequently concerned with the ion-enhanced fluidity, a measure of the ability of the free interface to relax surface energy. Motivated by usual fluid dynamics problems, the ion-enhanced fluidity is near-universally treated as a constant throughout the amorphous layer. However, for an irradiated thin film, the fluidity is ultimately caused by radiation-induced defect kinetics within the film, leading to regions with greater or lesser fluidity, and sensitive dependence on ion energy, species, flux, irradiation angle, temperature, and other experimental parameters. Here, we develop and analyze a model of radiation-induced defect kinetics coupled to the continuum equations of a viscous thin film. Using realistic parameter values, we show that defect kinetics can meaningfully alter theoretical predictions of surface relaxation and ion-enhanced fluidity. Implications for aligning theoretical and experimental work, especially for surface nano-patterning of silicon induced by low-energy argon irradiation, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of degenerate Fermi gases on spherical Fermi surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the description of a Fermi gas of free electrons given by the Boltzmann--Fermi--Dirac equation, and aim at providing a precise mathematical understanding of the Fermi ground state and its first-order approximation of excited states on the Fermi sphere.
  In order to achieve that, using the framework of hydrodynamic limits in collisional kinetic theory, we identify the low-temperature regimes in which charge-density fluctuations concentrate on the Fermi sphere. In three spatial dimensions or higher, we also characterize the thermodynamic equilibra and energy spectra of fluctuations. This allows us to derive the macroscopic hydrodynamic equations describing how charge densities flow and propagate in metals, thereby providing a precise description of plasma oscillations in conductors. The two-dimensional case is fundamentally different and is handled in a companion article.
  Remarkably, our results establish that excited electrons and their energy can be distributed on the Fermi sphere anisotropically, which deviates from the common intuitive assumption that electrons and their energy should be distributed uniformly in all directions.
  The hydrodynamic regimes featured in this work are akin to the acoustic limit of the classical Boltzmann equation. However, we emphasize that our derivation holds for arbitrarily fast rates of convergence of the Knudsen number, which significantly extends the applicability of the known proofs of the classical acoustic limit. This suggest that low-temperature limits of Fermi gases provide a promising avenue of research toward a complete understanding of the compressible Euler limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixing the fields generated by different light sources has emerged as a powerful approach for engineering non-Gaussian quantum states. Understanding and controlling the resulting photon statistics is useful for emerging quantum technologies that are underpinned by interference. In this work, we investigate intensity correlation functions arising from the interference of resonance fluorescence from a quantum emitter with a coherent laser field. We show that the observed bunching behavior results from a subtle interplay between quantum interference and the normalization of the correlation functions. We show that by adjusting the mixing ratio and phase one can achieve full tunability of the second-order correlation, ranging from anti-bunching to bunching. We further extend our analysis to third-order correlation functions, both experimentally and theoretically, to provide new insights into the interpretation of higher-order correlations and offer practical tools for shaping quantum optical fields.</description>

Abstract: Quantum spintronics is an emerging field focused on developing novel applications by utilizing the quantum coherence of magnetic systems. A key challenge in this context is achieving scalable long-range quantum information transmission in magnetic systems. Here, we propose a novel transmission scheme based on topological spin textures in a hybrid architecture combining a magnetic racetrack and localized spin qubits. We demonstrate this principle by employing the domain wall (DW), the most fundamental texture, to transport quantum signal between distant qubits. We introduce a measurement-free protocol that utilizes DW mobility to enable high-fidelity and tunable entanglement generation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that spin qubits can function as quantum stations on the racetrack, enabling flexible state transfer among fast-moving DWs on a single track. Finally, we discuss concrete material platforms to implement the proposed scheme. Our work introduces a new hybrid quantum platform that merges topological spin textures with solid-state qubits, offering a scalable architecture for quantum information processing and opening promising directions for quantum spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among all materials, mono-crystalline diamond has one of the highest measured thermal conductivities, with values above 2000 W/m/K at room temperature. This stems from momentum-conserving `normal' phonon-phonon scattering processes dominating over momentum-dissipating `Umklapp' processes, a feature that also suggests diamond as an ideal platform to experimentally investigate phonon heat transport phenomena that violate Fourier's law. Here, we introduce dilute nitrogen-vacancy color centers as in-situ, highly precise spin defect thermometers to image temperature inhomogeneities in single-crystal diamond microstructures heated from ambient conditions. We analyze cantilevers with cross-sections in the range from about 0.2 to 2.6 $\mu$m$^2$, observing a strong reduction of the cantilevers' conductivity as the width decreases. We use first-principles simulations based on the linearized phonon Boltzmann transport equation and viscous heat equations to quantitatively predict the cantilevers' thermal transport properties, rationalizing how the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic phonon scattering mechanisms determines the observed non-diffusive behavior. Our temperature-imaging method paves the way for the exploration of unconventional, non-diffusive heat transport phenomena in devices and nanostructures of arbitrary geometries.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric properties of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene-superconductor hetero-junction: effect of valley polarization and trigonal warping</title>

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric properties (electronic contribution) of a normal-superconductor (NS) hybrid junction, where the normal region consists of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). The superconducting region is characterized by a common $s$-wave superconductor closely proximitized to the MATBG. We compute various thermoelectric coefficients, including thermal conductance, thermopower, and the figure of merit ($zT$), using the scattering matrix formalism. These results are further supported by calculations based on a lattice-regularized version of the effective Hamiltonian. Additionally, we explore the impact of trigonal warping and valley polarization on the thermoelectric coefficients. Notably, we find a significant variation in $zT$ as a function of these parameters, reaching values as high as 2.5. Interestingly, we observe a violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law near the charge neutrality point with the superconducting correlation, indicating that MATBG electrons behave as slow Dirac fermions in this regime. This observation is further confirmed by the damped oscillatory behavior of the thermal conductance as a function of the barrier strength when an insulating barrier is modelled at the interface of the NS junction. Beyond theoretical insights, our findings suggest new possibilities for thermoelectric applications using MATBG based NS junctions.</description>

Abstract: Optical vortex beams are a type of topological light characterized by their inherent orbital angular momentum, leading to the propagation of a spiral-shaped wavefront. In this study, we focus on two-dimensional electrons with Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions and examine how they respond to pulsed vortex beams in the terahertz frequency band. Spin-orbital interactions play a vital role in transferring the orbital angular momentum of light to electron systems and generating spatiotemporal spin textures. We show that the spatiotemporal spin polarization of electrons reflects orbital angular momentum carried by optical vortex pulses. These findings demonstrate how optical vortices facilitate ultrafast spin manipulation in spin-orbit-coupled electrons. Our results can be straightforwardly extended to the case of higher-frequency vortex beams for other two-dimensional metals with a larger Fermi energy.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian band topology in twisted bilayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing the established Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG), we theoretically investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) topological properties of this in the presence of non-reciprocal (NR) hopping on both layers and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) induced mass term incorporated only on the top layer of the tBLG system. It is well known that the hBN mass term breaks the \(C_{2}\) symmetry of tBLG and gaps out the Dirac cones inducing a valley Hall insulating phase. However, when NR hopping is introduced, this system transits into a NH valley Hall insulator (NH-VHI). Our analysis reveals that, in the chiral limit, the bandwidth of the system vanishes under NH effects for a wide range of twist angles. Such range can be visibly expanded as we enhance the degree of non-Hermiticity (\(\beta\)). At the magic angle, we observe that enhancement of \(\beta\) inflates the robustness of the gapless Dirac points, requiring a progressively larger mass term to induce a gap in the NH tBLG system. Additionally, for a fixed NH parameter, we identify a range of twist angles where gap formation is significantly obstructed. To explore the topological aspects of the NH tBLG, we analyze the direct band gap in the Moir\'e Brillouin zone (mBZ) and compute the Chern number for the NH system. We find that the corresponding topological phase transitions are associated with corresponding direct band gap closings in the mBZ.</description>

      <title>Quantized Transport of $\nu = 2/3$ Fractional Quantum Hall Edge with Disordered Superconducting Proximity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Hall edge states in proximity to a superconductor (SC) usually acquire a non-quantized electron-to-hole conversion probability in transport, due to non-universal SC couplings and disorders. With counter-propagating modes, we show that the situation can be the opposite in the $\nu=2/3$ fractional quantum Hall (FQH) edge states with SC proximity, where disordered SC-couplings can reconstruct the edge states into an infinite set of stable phases with quantized electron-to-hole conversion probability along a long edge. Each phase is dominated by a disordered SC-coupling that tunnels $\pm |q_N|$ Cooper pairs, which can take values $|q_N|=1, 4, 15$, etc. We predict that this gives rise to a quantized downstream resistance $R_d = h/(2q^2_Ne^2)$ in an FQH-SC junction, serving as a quantized electrical transport signature beyond the Hall conductance. Higher-order nonlinear transport due to irrelevant Cooper pair tunneling or vortex dissipation is further studied, which becomes dominant when the edge is in a normal phase. Our results apply to both the single-layer state (as a particle-hole conjugate of $\nu=1/3$) and the bilayer Halperin-(112) state, revealing a rich landscape of disorder-stabilized phases in FQH edge states with SC proximity, and may as well apply to fractional Chern insulators recently observed at the same filling.</description>

      <title>Topological Flat Minibands and Fractional Chern Insulators in Rashba Systems with Tunable Superlattice Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a programmable platform for engineering topological flat minibands by imposing a tunable electrostatic superlattice potential on a Rashba spin-orbit-coupled thin film subject to a Zeeman field. The interplay between the superlattice potential and Zeeman coupling produces an isolated flat miniband with Chern number $\mathcal{C}=1$. Using many-body exact diagonalization, we show that this miniband supports fractional Chern insulators at filling factors $n = 1/3$ and $2/3$, both of which remain robust over broad parameter ranges. We further identify realistic material candidates and the corresponding device conditions that enable experimental realization. These results establish a versatile and experimentally accessible platform for engineering topological flat minibands and exploring correlated topological phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) induces strong momentum-dependent spin splitting and plays a crucial role in fields like spintronics and topological photonics. We here theoretically investigate the collective excitations in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (ML-TMDs) hosting RSOC, and conceive an approach to precisely quantify the strength of RSOC using plasmons. We determine the electron energy loss function (EELF) and plasmon dispersions for n-type ML-TMD from the dynamic dielectric function in the framework of the standard random phase approximation (RPA). In this system, both optical and acoustic plasmon modes are observed in the EELF and plasmon dispersions. Moreover, the plasmonic and spectral properties are tunable by electron density and dependent on RSOC. Crucially, we identify a minimum energy gap between the two plasmon modes to serve as a direct spectral signature of the RSOC strength. These results establish plasmons as a non-invasive, precise, and broadly tunable technique for determining RSOC in TMD van der Waals heterostructures and devices.</description>

      <title>Optical Signatures of Band Flatness and Anisotropic Quantum Geometry in Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the degree of band flatness and anisotropic quantum geometry in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene by varying the twist angle and the lattice relaxation through optical conductivity. We show that the degree of band flatness and its quantum geometry can be revealed through optical absorption and its resulting optical bounds, which are based on the trace condition in quantum geometry. More specifically, the narrow and isolated peak of optical absorption in the low-energy region provides information about the bandwidth between two flat bands. When this value is smaller than the electron interaction, it serves as a critical condition for the emergence of flat band superconductivity. Furthermore, optical absorption also provides the gap value between the flat band and the dispersive band, and when this gap is larger than the electron interaction, it facilitates the realization of fractional Chern insulating phases. We show that the narrow and isolated peak of optical bound near zero energy decreases as lattice relaxation increases. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that the imaginary part of generalized optical Hall conductivity reveals the vanishing of the negative part of Berry curvature, which is enforced by the refined trace-determinant inequality. Accordingly, we show that the total amount of the negative part and component of the Berry curvature approaches zero in the single ideal flat-band case. In contrast, when considering all occupied bands, the total amount of the negative component is slightly different from zero. Finally, we demonstrate that the condition of vanishing of flat band velocities and the emergent chiral symmetry are sufficient for the saturation of the trace condition, which pertains to the isotropic case.</description>

      <title>Gate Voltage Tunable Second Harmonic Generation in Mono- and Bi-layer Black Phosphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black phosphorene (BP) has emerged as a promising platform for tunable nonlinear photonics due to its layer-dependent bandgap, high carrier mobility, and remarkable in-plane anisotropy. This study investigates the second-harmonic generation (SHG) of monolayer and bilayer BP under an external static electric field, with describing the electronic states by a tight-binding model and the dynamics by semiconductor Bloch equations. Our results reveal that BP exhibits large second-order nonlinear optical response along the armchair direction, with significant resonant enhancement when the incident photon energy approaches half of its bandgap. Under an applied electric field of $10^7$ V/m, the effective second-order nonlinear susceptibility of BP can be as large as $10^3$ pm/V, surpassing that of the conventional nonlinear crystal AgGaSe$_2$ by more than an order of magnitude. With respect to the static electric field induced by gate voltage, we discuss the relation between the electric-field-induced second harmonic (EFISH) generation and conventional SHG -- under lower gate voltage, the EFISH approach agrees well with the SHG solutions, whereas the former is no longer applicable under higher gate voltage. Specifically, as the increasing gate voltage, monolayer BP exhibits the bandgap expansion and the corresponding blue-shift in the SHG resonant peak. In contrast, bilayer BP undergoes a semiconductor-to-semimetal transition, forming Dirac cone and generating divergent SHG spectra as photon energy goes to zero. Additionally, the chemical potential allows for precise control over interband and intraband nonlinear responses. This work provides important theoretical foundations for the development of BP-based tunable nonlinear photonic devices and expands the application potential of anisotropic two-dimensional materials in nonlinear optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of coherent electronics aims to advance electronic functionalities by utilizing quantum coherence. Here, we demonstrate a viable and versatile methodology for controlling electron dynamics optically in graphene nanoribbons. In particular, we propose to flatten the band structure of armchair graphene nanoribbons via control electrodes, arranged periodically along the extended direction of the nanoribbon. This addresses a key mechanism for dephasing in solids, which derives from the momentum dependence of the energy gap between the valence and the conduction band. We design an optimal driving field pulse to produce collective Rabi oscillations between these bands, in their flattened configuration. As an example for coherent control, we show that these optimized pulses can be used to invert the entire electronic band population by a $\pi$ pulse in a reversible fashion, and to create a superposition state via a $\pi/2$ pulse, which generates an alternating photocurrent. Our proposal consists of a platform and methodological approach to optically control the electron dynamics of graphene nanoribbons, paving the way toward novel coherent electronic and quantum information processing devices in solid-state materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions are theoretically predicted to harbor zero-energy Majorana bound states (MBS) in a tunable two-dimensional geometry, at the two ends of the middle metallic channel. Here we show that three distinct topological superconducting regimes, governing the localization of the near-zero-energy MBS, appear in these planar Josephson junctions. The topologically-protected MBS appear near the narrow edges of the junction -- not only in the middle metallic channel but also in the superconducting leads which have widths similar to the values used in recent experiments. We incorporate random fluctuation in the chemical potential to investigate the influence of non-magnetic disorder on the localization of the MBS in different topological regimes and find that the MBS are quite robust against disorder because of the two-dimensional geometry. Interestingly, moderate amount of disorder reduces the splitting between the MBS pairs, possibly by minimizing the wave function overlap of the MBS. We also discuss the changes in the topological superconducting phases when the superconducting lead width is varied. Our results reveal a rich structure of the localization of topologically protected multiple MBS in experimentally-accessible planar Josephson junctions, and call for their experimental confirmation.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting qubits equipped with quantum non-demolition readout and active feedback can be used as information engines to probe and manipulate microscopic degrees of freedom, whether intentionally designed or naturally occurring in their environment. In the case of spin systems, the required magnetic field bias presents a challenge for superconductors and Josephson junctions. Here we demonstrate a granular aluminum nanojunction fluxonium qubit (gralmonium) with spectrum and coherence resilient to fields beyond one Tesla. Sweeping the field reveals a paramagnetic spin-1/2 ensemble, which is the dominant gralmonium loss mechanism when the electron spin resonance matches the qubit. We also observe a suppression of MHz range fast flux noise in magnetic field, suggesting the freezing of surface spins. Using an active state stabilization sequence, the qubit hyperpolarizes long-lived two-level systems (TLSs) in its environment, previously speculated to be spins. Surprisingly, the coupling to these TLSs is unaffected by magnetic fields, leaving the question of their origin open. The robust operation of gralmoniums in Tesla fields offers new opportunities to explore unresolved questions in spin environment dynamics and facilitates hybrid architectures linking superconducting qubits with spin systems.</description>

      <title>The Low-Temperature Phenomenology of Gap Inhomogeneity in the Cuprate Superconductors: High-Energy Granularity, Low-Energy Homogeneity, and Spectral Kinks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments on a number of cuprate superconductors have revealed that these materials are highly inhomogeneous. However, even though this inhomogeneity is well-characterized experimentally, a theoretical understanding of the effect of an inhomogeneous superconducting $d$-wave order parameter on various observables is still not complete. Here, we focus on the particular role played by the length scale of superconducting order-parameter inhomogeneity. We make use of a model involving square patches tiling the system, with each patch hosting a broadly distributed random value of the $d$-wave parameter. By using large-scale simulations, we are able to study how the size of the patches affects the correspondence between various measures of the superconducting gap and the underlying order parameter. If the length scale of the inhomogeneity is smaller than the average superconducting coherence length, the resulting $d$-wave superconductor is homogeneous. However, when the order parameter varies on the scale of the coherence length, we find the emergence of a striking low-/high-energy dichotomy, in which the low-energy regime is homogeneous while the high-energy states are strongly inhomogeneous. Kinks in the local spectra are found at the energy demarcating the homogeneous-inhomogeneous transition. We also observe that the gap extracted from the low-energy slope of the LDOS is extremely uniform. We find in both of these regimes that the distribution of the spectral gap is narrower than that of the order parameter; these start to match only when the size of the patches becomes parametrically larger than the coherence length. We comment on the applicability of these results to the cuprates, discuss the limitations of the inhomogeneous $d$-wave model, and point out where beyond-mean-field correlation effects are likely to be present in addition to inhomogeneity.</description>

Abstract: Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation, which dictates that the emissivity of a surface equals its absorptivity under thermal equilibrium, which dictates that the emissivity of a surface equals its absorptivity under thermal equilibrium, fundamentally limits the efficiency of photonic systems by enforcing reciprocal energy exchange between source and detector. Breaking this reciprocity is particularly important for advancing photonic devices for energy conversion, radiative cooling, and mid-infrared sensing and imaging. Driven by the growing need for photonic platforms to overcome reciprocity constraints, we present the first demonstration of spatiotemporally modulated nonreciprocal metasurfaces operating at mid-infrared frequencies suitable for the violation of the Kirchhoff's law at room temperature. We fabricate a graphene-based integrated photonic structure and experimentally demonstrate nonreciprocal reflection from a metasurface modulated at gigahertz frequencies. We develop a theoretical framework to relate nonreciprocal scattering under spatiotemporal modulation with unequal absorptivity and emissivity for violation of the spectral directional Kirchhoff's law. Our experiment and theory imply effective decoupling of absorption and emission channels by breaking time-reversal symmetry at thermal wavelengths.</description>
