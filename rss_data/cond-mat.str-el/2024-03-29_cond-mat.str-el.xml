      <title>(2+1)D topological phases with RT symmetry: many-body invariant, classification, and higher order edge modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is common in condensed matter systems for reflection ($R$) and time-reversal ($T$) symmetry to both be broken while the combination $RT$ is preserved. In this paper we study invariants that arise due to $RT$ symmetry. We consider many-body systems of interacting fermions with fermionic symmetry groups $G_f = \mathbb{Z}_2^f \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{RT}$, $U(1)^f \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2^{RT}$, and $U(1)^f \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{RT}$. We show that (2+1)D invertible fermionic topological phases with these symmetries have a $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_8$, $\mathbb{Z}^2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$, and $\mathbb{Z}^2 \times \mathbb{Z}_4$ classification, respectively, which we compute using the framework of $G$-crossed braided tensor categories. We provide a many-body $RT$ invariant in terms of a tripartite entanglement measure, and which we show can be understood using an edge conformal field theory computation in terms of vertex states. For $G_f = U(1)^f \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2^{RT}$, which applies to charged fermions in a magnetic field, the non-trivial value of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant requires strong interactions. For symmetry-preserving boundaries, the phases are distinguished by zero modes at the intersection of the reflection axis and the boundary. Additional invariants arise in the presence of translation or rotation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Theory of moir\'e magnetism and multi-domain spin textures in twisted Mott insulator - semimetal heterobilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental developments in van der Waals heterostructures, we investigate the emergent magnetism in Mott insulator - semimetal moir\'e superlattices by deriving effective spin models and exploring their phase diagram by Monte Carlo simulations. Our analysis indicates that the stacking-dependent interlayer Kondo interaction can give rise to different types of magnetic order, forming domains within the moir\'e unit cell. In particular, we find that the AB (AA) stacking regions tend to order (anti)ferromagnetically for an extended range of parameters. The remaining parts of the moir\'e unit cell form ferromagnetic chains that are coupled antiferromagnetically. We show that the decay length of the Kondo interaction can control the extent of these phases. Our results highlight the importance of stacking-dependent interlayer exchange and the rich magnetic spin textures that can be obtained in van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Einstein relation for subdiffusive relaxation in Stark chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate chains of interacting spinless fermions subject to a finite external field $F$ (also called Stark chains) and focus on the regime where the charge thermalization follows the subdiffusive hydrodynamics. First, we study reduced models conserving the dipole moment and derive an explicit Einstein relation which links the subdiffusive transport coefficient with the correlations of the dipolar current. This relation explains why the decay rate, $\Gamma_q$, of the density modulation with wave-vector $q$ shows $q^4$-dependence. In the case of the Stark model, a similar Einstein relation is also derived and tested using various numerical methods. They confirm an exponential reduction of the transport coefficient with increasing $F$. On the other hand, our study of the Stark model indicates that upon increasing $q$ there is a crossover from subdiffusive behavior, $\Gamma_q \propto q^4$, to the normal diffusive relaxation, $\Gamma_q \propto q^2$, at the wave vector $q^*$ which vanishes for $F \to 0$.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic domains in a single crystal of the A-type spin-7/2 trigonal topological insulator EuSn$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EuSn$_2$As$_2$ is a trigonal A-type antiferromagnetic topological insulator with the moments aligned in the $ab$ plane and with a N\'eel temperature $T_{\rm N} = 23.5$ K. Here we report that an EuSn$_2$As$_2$ crystal exhibits a broad peak at $H_{\rm c1} = 1100$ Oe in the field derivative $dM_{ab}/dH$ of the $ab$-plane magnetization $M_{ab}(H)$ at temperature $T=2$ K, demonstrating the presence of trigonal antiferromagnetic domains. We model these $M_{ab}(H,\,T=2\,{\rm K})$ data and obtain the trigonal anisotropy-energy coefficient $K_3$ that is 13.3 and 3.7 times larger than those we previously reported for single crystals of the trigonal compounds EuMg$_2$Sb$_2$ and EuMg$_2$Bi$_2$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Fusion of one-dimensional gapped phases and their domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite depth quantum circuits provide an equivalence relation between gapped phases. Moreover, there can be nontrivial domain walls either within the same gapped phase or between different gapped phases, whose equivalence relations are given by finite depth quantum circuits in one lower dimension. In this paper, we use such unitary equivalence relations to study the fusion of one-dimensional gapped phases. In particular, we use finite depth circuits to fuse two gapped phases, local unitaries to fuse two domain walls, and a combination of both to fuse gapped phases with domain walls. This provides a concrete illustration of some simple aspects of the `higher-category' structure of gapped defects in a higher-dimensional trivial gapped bulk state.</description>

      <title>First Landau Level Physics in Second Moir\'e Band of $2.1^\circ$ Twisted Bilayer MoTe${}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent experimental discovery of the fractional quantum spin Hall effect in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ at a twist angle of 2.1 degrees highlights the unique properties of its second moir\'e band. Inspired by this finding, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical investigation of the half-filled second moir\'e band at this angle, utilizing an effective continuum model. Our analysis reveals that the band not only exhibits characteristics akin to the first Landau level, $K=\int_\mathrm{BZ}\mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{k}\:\mathrm{tr}\:\eta(\mathbf{k}) \approx 3$, but also that its projected Coulomb interaction strikingly mirrors the Haldane pseudopotentials of the first Landau level. They together strongly indicate the potential emergence of a non-Abelian fractional quantum anomalous Hall state at the half-filling under the Coulomb interactions. By performing exact diagonalization calculations, we validate this hypothesis and construct a global phase diagram around this non-Abelian fractional quantum anomalous Hall states. We also introduce a novel metric of 1LL-ness of a band, which quantitatively measures the alignment of the projected Coulomb interaction with the Haldane pseudopotentials in Landau levels. This metric is then compared with the global phase diagram including the non-Abelian fractional quantum anomalous Hall state, revealing its utility in predicting the parameter region of the 1LL-ness. Finally, we discuss the potential implications on experiments.</description>

      <title>Challenges in extracting nonlinear current-induced phenomena in Ca2RuO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An appealing direction to change the properties of strongly correlated materials is to induce nonequilibrium steady states by the application of a direct current. While access to these novel states is of high scientific interest, Joule heating due to current flow often constitutes a hurdle to identify nonthermal effects. The biggest challenge usually resides in measuring accurately the temperature of a sample subjected to direct current, and to use probes that give direct information of the material. In this work, we exploit the simultaneous measurement of electrical transport and magnetisation to probe non-equilibrium steady states in Ca2RuO4. In order to reveal non-thermal current-induced effects, we employ a simple model of Joule self-heating to remove the effects of heating and discuss the importance of temperature inhomogeneity within the sample. Our approach provides a solid basis for investigating current-induced phenomena in highly resistive materials.</description>

      <title>Finite-time Scaling beyond the Kibble-Zurek Prerequisite: Driven Critical Dynamics in Strongly Interacting Dirac Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional quantum critical point (QCP) characterized by order parameter fluctuations, the celebrated Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) and finite-time scaling (FTS) theory provide universal descriptions of the driven critical dynamics. However, in strongly correlated fermionic systems where gapless fermions are usually present in vicinity of QCP, the driven dynamics has rarely been explored. In this Letter, we investigate the driven critical dynamics in two-dimensional Dirac systems, which harbor semimetal and Mott insulator phases separated by the QCP triggered by the interplay between fluctuations of gapless Dirac fermions and order-parameter bosons. By studying the evolution of physical quantities for different driving rates through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we confirm that the driven dynamics is described by the FTS form. Accordingly, our results significantly generalize the KZM theory by relaxing its requirement for a gapped initial state to the system accommodating gapless Dirac fermionic excitation. Through successfully extending the KZM and FTS theory to Dirac QCP, our work not only brings new fundamental perspective into the nonequilibrium critical dynamics, but also provides a novel theoretical approach to fathom quantum critical properties in fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Origin of multiple Lifshitz transitions in the Weyl semi-metal RhSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known from density functional theory (DFT) calculations that RhSi has a multifold degenerate Dirac point at the Fermi energy, with the dominant states in the low-energy region displaying mostly Rh $d$ character. Using DFT+U, we calculate the band structure by considering an effective local interaction on the Rh $d$ states, with a realistic effective Hubbard $U_\textrm{eff}=2.5$ eV derived from a constrained random-phase approximation calculation, and find the emergence of a double hump structure close to the Fermi energy.By further deriving a low-energy tight-binding model from our first-principles results, we show that the double hump is a direct consequence of a competition between the Rh $d$-Rh $d$ and Rh $d$-Si $p$ interactions, which differ in their momentum dependence. As a consequence, through an artificial tuning of the energy level of the Si $p$ orbitals this hump structure can be suppressed due to the effectively reduced Rh $d$ -Si $p$ interaction.This peculiar low-energy electronic structure additionally results in that a small hole/electron doping ($\sim$ 0.1 $\%$) can tune the Fermi surface topology, going from closed to open Fermi surfaces, which has dramatic consequences for the thermal transport.</description>

      <title>Kitaev Interactions Through an Extended Superexchange Pathway in the jeff = 1/2 Ru3+ Honeycomb Magnet, RuP3SiO11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic materials are composed of the simple building blocks of magnetic moments on a crystal lattice that interact via short-range magnetic exchange interactions. Yet from these simple building blocks emerges a remarkable diversity of magnetic states. Some of these, such as ferromagnetism, are familiar in our everyday lives, while others reveal the deep quantum mechanical origins of magnetism. A prime example of the latter are quantum spin liquid (QSL) states in which -- unlike in a ferromagnet where magnetic moments are driven by their exchange interactions to adopt long-range order -- magnetic moments remain disordered at low temperatures but are simultaneously correlated over long length scales through quantum entanglement. A particularly promising theoretical model of a QSL is the Kitaev model, composed of unusual bond-dependent exchange interactions between magnetic moments on a honeycomb lattice. However, the Kitaev QSL is extremely challenging to realise experimentally as it is unstable to competing exchange interactions and crystal lattice perturbations that inevitably arise in real materials. This makes it essential to understand the relationship between the structure and interactions that may give rise to Kitaev interactions in new candidate materials. Here we show that the material requirements for the Kitaev QSL survive for an extended pseudo-edge-sharing superexchange pathway of Ru3+ 4d5 octahedra within the honeycomb layers of the inorganic framework solid, RuP3SiO11. Through materials synthesis and structural characterisation, resonant inelastic X-ray and neutron scattering experiments, we confirm the requisite jeff = 1/2 state of Ru3+ in RuP3SiO11 and resolve the hierarchy of exchange interactions that provide experimental access to an otherwise unexplored region of the extended Kitaev phase diagram.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic quantum oscillations (MQO) of Hall coefficient are measured in rare-earth tritelluride TmTe$_{3}$ and shown to be much stronger and persist to higher temperature than the Shubnikov oscillations. It is general for MQO in strongly anisotropic metals, and the combined measurements of Hall and diagonal magnetoresistance provide useful informations about the electronic structure. The ratio of their MQO amplitudes depends linearly on magnetic field, and its slope gives a simple and accurate measurement tool of the electron mean free time and its temperature dependence.</description>

      <title>Topological Phases and Phase Transitions with Dipolar Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems with dipole moment conservation have been of recent interest, as they realize both novel quantum dynamics and exotic ground state phases. In this work, we study some generic properties of 1-D and 2-D dipole-conserving fermionic models at integer fillings. We find that a dipolar symmetry-breaking phase can result in a mean-field band insulator whose topological indices can strongly affect the low-energy physics of the dipolar Goldstone modes. We study the 2-D topological phase transition of the mean-field ground states in the presence of the Goldstone modes. The critical theory resembles the 2+1d quantum electrodynamics coupled to massless Dirac fermions with some crucial differences and shows a novel quantum critical point featuring a nontrivial dynamical exponent. We also discuss the analogous case of 1-D dipole-conserving models and the role of topological invariants.</description>

      <title>Feynman Diagrams as Computational Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a computational graph representation of high-order Feynman diagrams in Quantum Field Theory (QFT), applicable to any combination of spatial, temporal, momentum, and frequency domains. Utilizing the Dyson-Schwinger and parquet equations, our approach effectively organizes these diagrams into a fractal structure of tensor operations, significantly reducing computational redundancy. This approach not only streamlines the evaluation of complex diagrams but also facilitates an efficient implementation of the field-theoretic renormalization scheme, crucial for enhancing perturbative QFT calculations. Key to this advancement is the integration of Taylor-mode automatic differentiation, a key technique employed in machine learning packages to compute higher-order derivatives efficiently on computational graphs. To operationalize these concepts, we develop a Feynman diagram compiler that optimizes diagrams for various computational platforms, utilizing machine learning frameworks. Demonstrating this methodology's effectiveness, we apply it to the three-dimensional uniform electron gas problem, achieving unprecedented accuracy in calculating the quasiparticle effective mass at metal density. Our work demonstrates the synergy between QFT and machine learning, establishing a new avenue for applying AI techniques to complex quantum many-body problems.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling approach to temperature dependence of competing orders of superconductivity: Possible time-reversal symmetry breaking and nontrivial topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use strong-coupling Eliashberg theory to study the competition of separate superconducting orders at low temperatures. Specifically, we study magnon-mediated superconductivity in a trilayer heterostructure with a thin normal metal between two antiferromagnetic insulators. Spin-triplet $p$-wave, spin-triplet $f$-wave, and spin-singlet $d$-wave superconducting gaps have been predicted to occur close to the critical temperature for the superconducting instability. The gap symmetry with the largest critical temperature depends on parameters in the model. We confirm that the same gap symmetries appear at any temperature below the critical temperature. Furthermore, we show that the temperature can affect the competition between the different superconducting orders. In addition, we consider time-reversal-symmetry-breaking, complex linear combinations of candidate pairings, such as chiral $p$-, $f$-, and $d$-wave gaps, as well as $p_x+if_y$-wave gaps. We find indications that some of these time-reversal-symmetry-breaking, nodeless gaps offer a greater condensation energy than the time-reversal symmetric gaps. This indicates that superconducting states with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry and nontrivial topology may be preferred in this system.</description>

      <title>Anyon braiding and telegraph noise in a graphene interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for anyons, quasiparticles with fractional charge and exotic exchange statistics, has inspired decades of condensed matter research. Quantum Hall interferometers enable direct observation of the anyon braiding phase via discrete interference phase jumps when the quasiparticle number changes. Here, we observe the universal anyonic braiding phase in both the $\nu = 1/3$ and $4/3$ fractional quantum Hall states by probing three-state random telegraph noise (RTN) in real-time. We find that the observed RTN stems from anyon quasiparticle number $n$ fluctuations and reconstruct three Aharonov-Bohm oscillation signals phase shifted by $2\pi/3$, corresponding to the three possible interference branches from braiding around $n$ (mod 3) anyons. Hence, we fully characterize the anyon exchange statistics using new methods that can readily extend to non-abelian states.</description>

      <title>Probing Causation Dynamics in Quantum Chains near Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distinguishing causation from correlation is crucial and requires careful consideration. In this study, we utilize a recent quantum extension of Liang information to investigate causation in quantum chains across their phase diagram. Our analysis encompasses two distinct scenarios: (i) the Aubry-Andr$\'e$-Harper model, characterized by a spectrum-wide phase transition, and (ii) the Anisotropic Transverse Field Ising (ANNNI) model, which demonstrates a ground state transition. We discern a notable shift in causation behavior across the critical point with each case exhibiting distinct hallmarks, different from correlation measures. Especially, in the latter case, we observe maximum causation in the ordered phase just preceding the critical point.</description>

      <title>Normal Fermi Surface in the Nodal Superconductor CeCoIn$_5$ Revealed via Thermal Conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal conductivity of heavy-fermion superconductor CeCoIn$_5$ was measured with a magnetic field rotating in the tetragonal a-b plane, with the heat current in the anti-nodal direction, $J$ || [100]. We observe a sharp resonance in thermal conductivity for the magnetic field at an angle $\theta$ $\sim$ 12$^{\circ}$, measured from the heat current direction [100]. This resonance corresponds to the reported resonance at an angle $\theta'$ $\sim$ 33$^{\circ}$ from the direction of the heat current applied along the nodal direction, $J$ || [110]. Both resonances, therefore, occur when the magnetic field is applied in the same crystallographic orientation in the two experiments, regardless of the direction of the heat current, proving conclusively that these resonances are due to the structure of the Fermi surface of CeCoIn$_5$. We argue that the uncondensed Landau quasiparticles, emerging with field, are responsible for the observed resonance. We support our experimental results with density-functional-theory model calculations of the density of states in a rotating magnetic field. Our calculations, using a model Fermi surface of CeCoIn$_5$, reveal several sharp peaks as a function of the field direction. Our study demonstrates that the thermal-conductivity measurement in rotating magnetic field can probe the normal parts of the Fermi surface deep inside the superconducting state.</description>

      <title>Reference Energies for Double Excitations: Improvement and Extension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of photochemistry, the significance of double excitations (also known as doubly-excited states), where two electrons are concurrently elevated to higher energy levels, lies in their involvement in key electronic transitions essential in light-induced chemical reactions as well as their challenging nature from the computational theoretical chemistry point of view. Based on state-of-the-art electronic structure methods (such as high-order coupled-cluster, selected configuration interaction, and multiconfigurational methods), we improve and expand our prior set of accurate reference excitation energies for electronic states exhibiting a substantial amount of double excitations [http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b01205; Loos et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2019, 15, 1939]. This extended collection encompasses 47 electronic transitions across 26 molecular systems that we separate into two distinct subsets: (i) 28 "genuine" doubly-excited states where the transitions almost exclusively involve doubly-excited configurations and (ii) 19 "partial" doubly-excited states which exhibit a more balanced character between singly- and doubly-excited configurations. For each subset, we assess the performance of high-order coupled-cluster (CC3, CCSDT, CC4, and CCSDTQ) and multiconfigurational methods (CASPT2, CASPT3, PC-NEVPT2, and SC-NEVPT2). Using as a probe the percentage of single excitations involved in a given transition ($\%T_1$) computed at the CC3 level, we also propose a simple correction that reduces the errors of CC3 by a factor of 3, for both sets of excitations. We hope that this more complete and diverse compilation of double excitations will help future developments of electronic excited-state methodologies.</description>

      <title>Orbital-Selective Spin-Triplet Superconductivity in Infinite-Layer Lanthanum Nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates has ignited stark interest within the scientific community, particularly regarding its likely unconventional origin. Conflicting magnetotransport measurements report either isotropic or anisotropic suppression of superconductivity in an external magnetic field, with distinct implications for the nature of superconducting order. In order to ensure a most suited model subject to subsequent many-body analysis, we develop a first-principles-guided minimal theory including Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$, La $d_{3z^2-r^2}$, and La $d_{xy}$ orbitals. Amended by the consideration of orbital-selective pairing formation, which emphasises the correlation state of the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, we calculate the superconducting ordering susceptibility mediated by spin fluctuations. We find a parametric competition between even-parity $d$-wave and, in contrast to previous studies, odd-parity $p$-wave pairing, which becomes favorable through a large quasiparticle weight renormalization for Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons. Our findings not only shed light on the distinctiveness of LaNiO$_{2}$ as compared to cuprate superconductors or nickelates of different rare-earth composition but also provoke similarities to other pending candidate odd-parity superconductors.</description>

      <title>Anyonic statistics and slow quasiparticle dynamics in a graphene fractional quantum Hall interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anyons are two dimensional particles with fractional exchange statistics that emerge as elementary excitations of fractional quantum Hall phases. Experimentally, anyonic statistics manifest directly in the edge-state Fabry-P\'erot interferometer geometry, where the presence of $N_{qp}$ localized anyons in the interferometer bulk contributes a phase $N_{qp} \theta_a$ to the observed interference pattern, where $\theta_a$ is twice the statistical exchange phase. Here, we report a measurement of $\theta_a$ in a monolayer graphene Fabry-P\'erot interferometer at $\nu$ = 1/3. We find a preponderance of phase slips with magnitudes $\Delta \theta \approx 2 \pi / 3$, confirming the result of past experiments in GaAs quantum wells and consistent with expectations for the tunneling of Abelian anyons into the interferometer bulk. In contrast to prior work, however, single anyon tunneling events manifest as instantaneous and irreversible phase slips, indicative of quasiparticle equilibration times exceeding 20 minutes in some cases. We use the discrepancy between the quasiparticle equilibration rate and our measurement speed to vary the interferometer area and $N_{qp}$ independently, allowing us to precisely determine the interferometer phase and monitor the entry and exit of individual anyons to the interferometer loop in the time domain. Besides providing a replication of previous interferometric measurements sensitive to $\theta_a$ in GaAs, our results bring anyon dynamics into the experimental regime and suggest that the average `topological charge' of a mesoscopic quantum Hall device can be held constant over hour long timescales.</description>

      <title>Magnetostriction, piezomagnetism and domain nucleation in a kagome antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whenever the elastic energy of a solid depends on magnetic field, there is a magnetostrictive response. Field-linear magnetostriction implies piezomagnetism and vice versa. Here, we show that Mn$_3$Sn, a non-collinear antiferromanget with Weyl nodes, hosts a large and almost perfectly linear magnetostriction even at room temperature. The longitudinal and transverse magnetostriction, with opposite signs and similar amplitude are restricted to the kagome planes and the out-of-plane response is negligibly small. By studying four different samples with different Mn:Sn ratios, we find a clear correlation between the linear magnetostriction, the spontaneous magnetization and the concentration of Sn vacancies. The recently reported piezomagnetic data fits in our picture. We show that linear magnetostriction and piezomagnetism are both driven by the field-induced in-plane twist of spins. A quantitative account of the experimental data requires the distortion of the spin texture by Sn vacancies. We find that the field-induced domain nucleation within the hysteresis loop corresponds to a phase transition. Within the hysteresis loop, a concomitant mesoscopic modulation of local strain and spin twist angles, leading to twisto-magnetic stripes, arises as a result of the competition between elastic and magnetic energies.</description>

Abstract: Fracton order describes novel quantum phases of matter that host quasiparticles with restricted mobility, and thus lies beyond the existing paradigm of topological order. In particular, excitations that cannot move without creating multiple excitations are called fractons. Here we address a fundamental open question -- can the notion of self-exchange statistics be naturally defined for fractons, given their complete immobility as isolated excitations? Surprisingly, we demonstrate how fractons can be exchanged, and show that their self-statistics is a key part of the characterization of fracton orders. We derive general constraints satisfied by the fracton self-statistics in a large class of Abelian fracton orders. Finally, we show the existence of nontrivial fracton self-statistics in some twisted variants of the checkerboard model and Haah's code, establishing that these models are in distinct quantum phases as compared to their untwisted cousins.</description>

      <title>Non-standard Hubbard model and two-electron pairing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a non-standard Hubbard model applicable to arbitrary single-particle potential profiles and inter-particle interactions. Our approach involves a novel treatment of Wannier functions, free from the ambiguities of conventional methods and applicable to finite systems without periodicity constraints. To ensure the consistent evaluation of Wannier functions, we develop a perturbative approach, utilizing the barrier penetration coefficient as a perturbation parameter. With the newly defined Wannier functions as a basis, we derive the Hubbard Hamiltonian, revealing the emergence of density-induced and pair tunneling terms alongside standard contributions. Our investigation demonstrates that long-range inter-particle interactions can induce a novel mechanism for repulsive particle pairing. This mechanism relies on the effective suppression of single-particle tunneling due to density-induced tunneling. Contrary to expectations based on the standard Hubbard model, an increase in inter-particle interaction does not lead to an insulating state. Instead, our proposed mechanism implies the coherent motion of correlated electron pairs, similar to bound states within a multi-well system, resistant to decay from single-electron tunneling transitions. These findings carry significant implications for various phenomena, including the formation of flat bands, the emergence of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene, and the possibility of a novel metal-insulator transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of "quantum geometric nesting'' (QGN) to characterize the idealized ordering tendencies of certain flat-band systems implicit in the geometric structure of the flat-band subspace. Perfect QGN implies the existence of an infinite class of local interactions that can be explicitly constructed and give rise to solvable ground states with various forms of possible fermion bi-linear order, including flavor ferromagnetism, density waves, and superconductivity. For the ideal Hamiltonians constructed in this way, we show that certain aspects of the low-energy spectrum can also be exactly computed including, in the superconducting case, the phase stiffness. Examples of perfect QGN include flat bands with certain symmetries (e.g. chiral or time-reversal), and non-symmetry-related cases exemplified with an engineered model for pair-density-wave. Extending this approach, we obtain exact superconducting ground states with nontrivial pairing symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many strongly correlated systems, including high-temperature superconductors such as the cuprates, exhibit strange metallic behavior in certain parameter regimes characterized by anomalous transport properties that are irreconcilable with a Fermi-liquid-like description in terms of quasiparticles. The Hubbard model is a standard theoretical starting point to examine the properties of such systems and also exhibits non-Fermi-liquid behavior in simulations. Here we analytically study the two-dimensional hole-doped Hubbard model, first identifying a percolation transition that occurs in the low-energy sector at critical hole doping $p_c\sim 0.19$. We then use the critical properties near this transition to rewrite the Hubbard Hamiltonian in a way that motivates a large-$N$ model with strange metallic properties. In particular, we show that this model has the linear-in-$T$ resistivity and power-law optical conductivity $\sim |\omega|^{-2/3}$ observed in the strange metal regime of cuprates, suggesting potential relevance for describing this important class of materials.</description>

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are exotic many-body states featured with long-range entanglement and fractional anyon quasiparticles. Quantum phase transitions of spin liquids are particularly interesting problems related with novel phenomena of anyon condensation and anyon confinement. Here we study a quantum dimer model which implements a transition between a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid ($\mathbb{Z}_2$SL) and a valence bond solid (VBS) on the kagome lattice. The transition is driven by the condensation of vison excitation of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid, which impacts on other anyon excitations especially leading to the confinement of spinon excitations. By numerical exact diagonalization of the dimer model, we directly measure the vison condensation using vison string operators, and explicitly check a confining potential acting on spinon excitations in the VBS state. It is observed that topological degeneracy of the spin liquid state is lifted concomitantly with the vison condensation. The dimer ordering pattern of the VBS state is identified by investigating dimer structure factor. Furthermore, we find an interesting state that exhibits features of spin liquid and VBS simultaneously. We discuss the origin of the mixed behaviors and possible scenarios expected in thermodynamic limit. This work complements the previous analytical studies on the dimer model, Phys. Rev. B 87, 104408 (2013) and Phys. Rev. B 92, 205131 (2015), by providing numerical evidences on the vison condensation and the spinon confinement in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$SL-to-VBS transition.</description>

      <title>Origin of competing charge density waves in kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding competing charge density wave (CDW) orders in the bilayer kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ remains a challenge. Experimentally, upon cooling, short-range CDW order with the wave vector $\mathbf{q}_{2}=(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2})$ is observed, which is subsequently suppressed by the condensation of the long-range CDW order $\mathbf{q}_{3}=(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3})$ at lower temperature. In conflict with these observations, theoretical calculations overestimate the transition temperature by a few thousand Kelvin and incorrectly predict the $\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW order to be the ground state. Here, we develop a theory of CDW order in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ based on anharmonic phonon-phonon calculations combined with density functional theory. We predict a temperature-driven phase transition from the high-temperature $\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW to the low-temperature $\mathbf{q}_{3}$ CDW order, fully explaining experimental observations. Additionally, we clarify that both multi-phonon effects and semi-core electron states play a crucial role in stabilizing the $\mathbf{q}_{3}$ order. Finally, we construct a phase diagram of the competing CDWs in the lattice parameter space and demonstrate that the out-of-plane lattice parameter plays a pivotal role in manipulating the competing CDWs in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, motivating us to propose compressive bi-axial strain as an experimental protocol to stabilize the $\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW order. Our work provides a full theory of CDWs in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, rationalizing experimental observations and resolving ealier discrepancies between theory and experiment. Overall, our work contributes to the wider effort of understanding CDWs in the kagome metal family.</description>

Abstract: This work verifies the SOC-induced evolution of $nodal-arcs$ into Weyl nodes under the effect of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in NbAs &amp; NbP. The obtained features mimics the observations as reported for TaAs &amp; TaP in our previous work. In addition, this work reports that the number of nodes in TaAs class of Weyl semimetals (WSMs) can be altered via creating strain along a or c direction of the crystal. For instance, the number of nodes in NbAs under SOC-effect along with 2% (3%) compressive-strain in $a$ direction is found to be 20 (28). Besides the nodes, such strain are found to have considerable impact on the nodal-rings of these WSMs when effect of SOC is ignored. Apart from this, the work discusses the role of Weyl physics in affecting the Seebeck coefficient ($S$) of any WSM. In this direction, it is discussed that how a symmetric Weyl cone, even if tilted, have no contribution to the $S$ of WSMs. Furthermore, the work highlights the conditions under which a Weyl cone can contribute to the $S$ of any given WSM. Lastly, the discussion of Weyl contribution to $S$ is validated over TaAs class of WSMs via investigating the features of its Weyl cones and calculating the contributions of these cones to the $S$ of these semimetals. The value of $S$ contributed from Weyl cone is found to be as large as $\sim$65 $\mu$$\textit{V}$/$\textit{K}$ below 25 K in case of TaAs. The findings of this work present a possibility of engineering the topological properties of TaAs class of WSMs via creating strain in their crystal. It also makes the picture of Weyl physics impact on the $S$ of WSMs a more clear.</description>

Abstract: A quantum cellular automaton (QCA) or a causal unitary is by definition an automorphism of local operator algebra, by which local operators are mapped to local operators. Quantum circuits of small depth, local Hamiltonian evolutions for short time, and translations (shifts) are examples. A Clifford QCA is one that maps any Pauli operator to a finite tensor product of Pauli operators. Here, we obtain a complete table of groups $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p)$ of translation invariant Clifford QCA in any spatial dimension $\mathsf d \ge 0$ modulo Clifford quantum circuits and shifts over prime $p$-dimensional qudits, where the circuits and shifts are allowed to obey only coarser translation invariance. The group $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p)$ is nonzero only for $\mathsf d = 2k+3$ if $p=2$ and $\mathsf d = 4k+3$ if $p$ is odd where~$k \ge 0$ is any integer, in which case $\mathfrak C(\mathsf d,p) \cong \widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_p)$, the classical Witt group of nonsingular quadratic forms over the finite field $\mathbb F_p$. It is well known that $\widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_2) \cong \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$, $\widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_p) \cong \mathbb Z/4\mathbb Z$ if $p = 3 \bmod 4$, and $\widetilde{\mathfrak W}(\mathbb F_p)\cong \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z \oplus \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$ if $p = 1 \bmod 4$. The classification is achieved by a dimensional descent, which is a reduction of Laurent extension theorems for algebraic $L$-groups of surgery theory in topology.</description>

      <title>Topological superconductivity induced by spin-orbit coupling, perpendicular magnetic field and superlattice potential</title>

Abstract: Topological superconductors support Majorana modes, which are quasiparticles that are their own antiparticles and which obey non-Abelian statistics in which successive exchanges of particles do not always commute. Here we investigate whether a two-dimensional superconductor with ordinary s-wave pairing can be rendered topological by the application of a strong magnetic field. To address this, we obtain the self-consistent solutions to the mean field Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, which are a large set of nonlinearly coupled equations, for electrons moving on a lattice. We find that the topological "quantum Hall superconductivity" is facilitated by a combination of spin-orbit coupling, which locks an electron's spin to its momentum as it moves through a material, and a coupling to an external periodic potential which gives a dispersion to the Landau levels and also distorts the Abrikosov lattice. We find that, for a range of parameters, the Landau levels broadened by the external periodic potential support topological superconductivity, which is typically accompanied by a lattice of "giant" $h/e$ vortices as opposed to the familiar lattice of $h/2e$ Abrikosov vortices. In the presence of a periodic potential, we find it necessary to use an ansatz for the pairing potential of the form $\Delta(\vec{r})e^{i2\vec{Q}\cdot\vec{r}}$ where $\Delta(\vec{r})$ has a periodicity commensurate with the periodic potential. However, despite this form of the pairing potential, the current in the ground state is zero. In the region of ordinary superconductivity, we typically find a lattice of dimers of $h/2e$ vortices. Our work suggests a realistic proposal for achieving topological superconductivity, as well as a helical order parameter and unusual Abrikosov lattices.</description>

      <title>Dipolar Weyl semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In time-reversal symmetry-broken Weyl semimetals, Weyl points act as monopoles and antimonopoles of the Berry curvature, with a monopole-antimonopole pair producing a net zero Berry flux. The two-dimensional (2D) planes that separate a monopole-antimonopole pair of Weyl points carry quantized Berry flux. In this work, we introduce a class of symmetry-protected Weyl semimetals which host monopole-antimonopole pairs of Weyl points that generate a quantized dipolar Berry flux. Consequently, topologically distinct 2D planes coexist in the Brillouin zone, carrying either quantized monopolar or dipolar flux. We construct a topological invariant -- the staggered Chern number -- to measure the quantized dipolar flux and employ it to topologically distinguish between various Weyl points. Finally, through a minimal two-band model, we investigate physical signatures of bulk topology, including surface Fermi arcs, zero-energy hinge states, and response to insertion of a $\pi$-flux vortex.</description>

      <title>Engineering flat bands in twisted-bilayer graphene away from the magic angle with chiral optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) is a recently discovered two-dimensional superlattice structure which exhibits strongly-correlated quantum many-body physics, including strange metallic behavior and unconventional superconductivity. Most of TBG exotic properties are connected to the emergence of a pair of isolated and topological flat electronic bands at the so-called magic angle, $\theta \approx 1.05^{\circ}$, which are nevertheless very fragile. In this work, we show that, by employing chiral optical cavities, the topological flat bands can be stabilized away from the magic angle in an interval of approximately $0.8^{\circ}&lt;\theta&lt;1.3^{\circ}$. As highlighted by a simplified theoretical model, time reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB), induced by the chiral nature of the cavity, plays a fundamental role in flattening the isolated bands and gapping out the rest of the spectrum. Additionally, TRSB suppresses the Berry curvature and induces a topological phase transition, with a gap closing at the $\Gamma$ point, towards a band structure with two isolated flat bands with Chern number equal to $0$. The efficiency of the cavity is discussed as a function of the twisting angle, the light-matter coupling and the optical cavity characteristic frequency. Our results demonstrate the possibility of engineering flat bands in TBG using optical devices, extending the onset of strongly-correlated topological electronic phases in moir\'e superlattices to a wider range in the twisting angle.</description>

      <title>Phase Crossover induced by Dynamical Many Body Localization in Periodically Driven Long-Range Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical many-body freezing occurs in periodic transverse field-driven integrable quantum spin systems. Under freezing conditions, quantum dynamics causes practically infinite hysteresis in the drive response, maintaining its starting value. We find similar resonant freezing in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model. In the LMG, the freezing conditions in the driving field suppresses the heating postulated by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) by inducing dynamical many-body localization, or DMBL. This is in contrast to Many Body Localization (MBL), which requires disorder to suppress ETH. DMBL has been validated by the inverse participation ratio (IPR) of the quasistationary Floquet modes. Similarly to the TFIM, the LMG exhibits high-frequency localization only at freezing points. IPR localization in the LMG deteriorates with an inverse system size law at lower frequencies, which indicates heating to infinite temperature. Furthermore, adiabatically increasing frequency and amplitude from low values raises the Floquet state IPR in the LMG from nearly zero to unity, indicating a phase crossover. This occurrence enables a future technique to construct an MBL engine in clean systems that can be cycled by adjusting drive parameters only.</description>

Abstract: We explore the possibilities for spin-singlet superconductivity in newly discovered altermagnets. Investigating $d$-wave altermagnets, we show that finite-momentum superconductivity can easily emerge in altermagnets even though they have no net magnetization, when the superconducting order parameter also has $d$-wave symmetry with nodes coinciding with the altermagnet nodes. Additionally, we find a rich phase diagram when both altermagnetism and an external magnetic field are considered, including superconductivity appearing at high magnetic fields from a parent zero-field normal state.</description>

      <title>Theory of correlated Chern insulators in twisted bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15982v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene is the best studied physical platform featuring moire potential induced narrow bands with non-trivial topology and strong electronic correlations. Despite their significance, the Chern insulating states observed at a finite magnetic field -- and extrapolating to a band filling, $s$, at zero field -- remain poorly understood. Unraveling their nature is among the most important open problems in the province of moir\'e materials. Here we present the first comprehensive study of interacting electrons in finite magnetic field while varying the electron density, twist angle and heterostrain. Within a panoply of correlated Chern phases emerging at a range of twist angles, we uncover a unified description for the ubiquitous sequence of states with the Chern number $t$ for $(s,t)=\pm (0,4), \pm(1,3),\pm(2,2)$ and $\pm(3,1)$. We also find correlated Chern insulators at unconventional sequences with $s+t\neq \pm 4$, as well as with fractional $s$, and elucidate their nature.</description>

      <title>Exotic Symmetry Breaking Properties of Self-Dual Fracton Spin Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fracton codes host unconventional topological states of matter and are promising for fault-tolerant quantum computation due to their large coding space and strong resilience against decoherence and noise. In this work, we investigate the ground-state properties and phase transitions of two prototypical self-dual fracton spin models -- the tetrahedral Ising model and the fractal Ising model -- which correspond to error-correction procedures for the representative fracton codes of type-I and type-II, the checkerboard code and the Haah's code, respectively, in the error-free limit. They are endowed with exotic symmetry-breaking properties that contrast sharply with the spontaneous breaking of global symmetries and deconfinement transition of gauge theories. To show these unconventional behaviors, which are associated with sub-dimensional symmetries, we construct and analyze the order parameters, correlators, and symmetry generators for both models. Notably, the tetrahedral Ising model acquires an extended semi-local ordering moment, while the fractal Ising model fits into a polynomial ring representation and leads to a fractal order parameter. Numerical studies combined with analytical tools show that both models experience a strong first-order phase transition with an anomalous $L^{-(D-1)}$ scaling, despite the fractal symmetry of the latter. Our work provides new understanding of sub-dimensional symmetry breaking and makes an important step for studying quantum-error-correction properties of the checkerboard and Haah's codes.</description>

      <title>Emergent Fano-Feshbach resonance in two-band superconductors with an incipient quasi-flat band: Enhanced critical temperature evading particle-hole fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In superconductivity, a surge of interests in enhancing $T_{\rm c}$ is ever mounting, where a recent focus is toward multi-band superconductivity. In $T_{\rm c}$ enhancements specific to two-band cases, especially around the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) crossover considered here, we have to be careful about how quantum fluctuations affect the many-body states, i.e., particle-hole fluctuations suppressing the pairing for attractive interactions. Here we explore how to circumvent the suppression by examining multichannel pairing interactions in two-band systems. With the Gor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov (GMB) formalism for particle-hole fluctuations in a continuous space, we look into the case of a deep dispersive band accompanied by an incipient heavy-mass (i.e., quasi-flat) band. We find that, while the GMB corrections usually suppress $T_{\rm c}$ significantly, this in fact competes with the enhanced pairing arising from the heavy band, with the trade-off leading to a peaked structure in $T_{\rm c}$ against the band-mass ratio when the heavy band is incipient. The system then plunges into a strong-coupling regime with the GMB screening vastly suppressed. This occurs prominently when the chemical potential approaches the bound state lurking just below the heavy band, which can be viewed as a Fano-Feshbach resonance, with its width governed by the pair-exchange interaction. The diagrammatic structure comprising particle-particle and particle-hole channels is heavily entangled, so that the emergent Fano-Feshbach resonance dominates all the channels, suggesting a universal feature in multiband superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scarring in $2+1$D Gauge Theories with Dynamical Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) has emerged as an intriguing paradigm of weak ergodicity breaking in nonintegrable quantum many-body models, particularly lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in $1+1$ spacetime dimensions. However, an open question is whether QMBS exists in higher-dimensional LGTs with dynamical matter. Given that nonergodic dynamics in $d{=}1$ spatial dimension tend to vanish in $d{&gt;}1$, it is important to probe this question. Using matrix product state techniques for both finite and infinite systems, we show that QMBS occurs in the $2{+}1$D $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link model (QLM), as evidenced in persistent coherent oscillations in local observables, a marked slowdown in the growth of the bipartite entanglement entropy, and revivals in the fidelity. Interestingly, we see that QMBS is more robust when the matter degrees of freedom are bosonic rather than fermionic. Our results further shed light on the intimate connection between gauge invariance and QMBS, and highlight the persistence of scarring in higher spatial dimensions. Our findings can be tested in near-term analog and digital quantum simulators, and we demonstrate their accessibility on a recently proposed cold-atom analog quantum simulator.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scars for Arbitrary Integer Spin in $2+1$D Abelian Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of Quantum Many-Body Scars has been established across different quantum many-body systems, including spin-1/2 Quantum Link Models. We systematically identify scars for pure gauge theories with arbitrarily large integer spin $S$ in $2+1$D, concretely for Truncated Link Models, where the electric field is truncated rather than replaced by spins. Through an explicit analytic construction, we show that the presence of scars is widespread. We confirm these findings numerically for small truncated spin and $S=1$ Quantum Link Models. The proposed analytic construction establishes the presence of scars far beyond volumes and spins that can be probed with existing numerical methods.</description>

      <title>The Wilson-Fisher Fixed point revisited: importance of the form of the cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we re-examine the Wilson Fisher fixed point. We study Wilsonian momentum space renormalization group (RG) flow for various forms of the cutoff. We show that already at order $\left(4-d\right)^{1}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the $\phi^{4}$ theory, there are changes to the position of the fixed point and the direction of irrelevant coupling parameters. We also show in a multi-flavor $\phi^{4}$ model that symmetries of the Lagrange function can be destroyed if the different flavors have different cutoffs (that is the Lagrangian can flow to a non-symmetric fixed point). Some related comments are made about a similar situation in parquet RG (pRG). In future works we will study Wilsonian RG to order $\left(4-d\right)^{2}$ and find non-universal critical exponents that depend on the cutoff.</description>
