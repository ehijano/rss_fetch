      <title>On Explaining Proxy Discrimination and Unfairness in Individual Decisions Made by AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems in high-stakes domains raise concerns about proxy discrimination, unfairness, and explainability. Existing audits often fail to reveal why unfairness arises, particularly when rooted in structural bias. We propose a novel framework using formal abductive explanations to explain proxy discrimination in individual AI decisions. Leveraging background knowledge, our method identifies which features act as unjustified proxies for protected attributes, revealing hidden structural biases. Central to our approach is the concept of aptitude, a task-relevant property independent of group membership, with a mapping function aligning individuals of equivalent aptitude across groups to assess fairness substantively. As a proof of concept, we showcase the framework with examples taken from the German credit dataset, demonstrating its applicability in real-world cases.</description>

      <title>NePTune: A Neuro-Pythonic Framework for Tunable Compositional Reasoning on Vision-Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel environments.</description>

      <title>R1-Code-Interpreter: LLMs Reason with Code via Supervised and Multi-stage Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Practical guidance on training Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage Code Interpreter across diverse tasks remains lacking. We present R1-Code-Interpreter, an extension of a text-only LLM trained via multi-turn supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to autonomously generate multiple code queries during step-by-step reasoning. Unlike prior RL + tool-use efforts focused on narrow domains such as math or retrieval, we curate 144 diverse reasoning and planning tasks and show that training a general-purpose Code Interpreter across them presents significant challenges due to task heterogeneity and scarcity of effective samples. To address this, we introduce a multi-stage curriculum learning approach that partitions training samples by measured improvement potential. The RL training prioritizes samples with higher potential and gradually shifts to lower-potential ones, increasing the average RL gains from merely +3.4% to +9.3% across Qwen-2.5 models (3/7/14B). Our final model, R1-CI-14B, improves average accuracy on the 37 test tasks from 44.1% to 72.4%, outperforming text-only GPT-4o (58.6%) and GPT-4o with Code Interpreter (70.9%). Notably, R1-CI-14B also exhibits emergent self-checking behavior through code generation. Datasets, Codes, and Models are available at https://github.com/yongchao98/R1-Code-Interpreter and https://huggingface.co/yongchao98.</description>
