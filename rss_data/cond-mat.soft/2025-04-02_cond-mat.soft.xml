      <title>Engineering living worms and active crystals with colloidal "feedback-pullers"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using computer simulations, we study the dynamics of colloidal particles with time-delayed feedback interactions. In particular, here we consider "feedback-pullers", i.e.~colloidal particles that are pulled away from their current position towards an attractive ring centred around their past position. For a single particle, small rings lead to reduced diffusive motion while large rings render activity to the particle. For multiple particles, the particles not only feel their own attractive ring but are also attracted by the rings around all other particles. As expected, for ring sizes larger than the particle diameter, the feedback leads to crystallites whose lattice constant is set by the feedback ring radius. However, here we demonstrate that for long delays (compared to the Brownian time) the colloidal particles start to oscillate around their lattice positions, with the crystallites ultimately collapsing to a close-packed lattice whose lattice constant corresponds to the particle diameter. This effect is caused by the time delay between the particle misplacement within the lattice and the corresponding change in the feedback force. Further, we show that apart from the expected hexagonal crystallites, the time delay may result in the formation of uncommon new states in the case that the ring size is chosen slightly smaller than the particle diameter. Here, particles self-assemble into and move collaboratively as "living worms" or as active square-lattice crystallites.</description>

      <title>Unifying Interpretations of Phase Transitions in the Vicsek Model: Correlation Length as a Diagnostic Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vicsek Model is widely used in simulations of dry active matter. We re-examined two typical phase transitions in the original Vicsek model by using the velocity correlation length. One is the noise-driven disordered-to-ordered phase transition driven by noise, which was initially considered as a second-order transition (continuous transition), but was later demonstrated by Chate's detailed study to be a first-order transition. The other one is the disordered-to-ordered phase transition driven by average distance between particles, which is a second-order transition and satisfies the hyper-scaling relation of continuous transitions. We have discovered the change of correlation length during transition indicates a critical point in continuous transition while not in the discontinuous situation. We have also provided a method to classify phase transitions in active matter systems by using the correlation length and summarized previous work within the same framework. Finally, we end up with a potential application in experiments of bactirial swarms and robotic swarms. We hope our work paves the way for both theory and experiment development of active matter.</description>

      <title>Bridging-induced Aggregation in Neutral Polymers: Dynamics and Morphologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the aggregation behavior of neutral stiff (rod-like) and flexible polymer chains mediated by attractive crowders. Attractive crowders serve as bridging agents, inducing aggregation through effective intra-polymer attractions. The critical monomer-crowder attraction strength ($\epsilon_{mc}^*$) required for aggregation differs notably between rigid rods and flexible polymers. Interestingly, this aggregation threshold closely matches the critical attraction required for the extended-to-collapsed (coil-globule) transition of a single flexible polymer chain, suggesting a fundamental connection between single-chain collapse and multi-chain aggregation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $\epsilon_{mc}^*$ decreases with increasing system density and larger crowder sizes, highlighting the synergistic roles of crowding effects and crowder dimensions. Aggregate morphologies exhibit strong dependence on polymer flexibility: rigid rods predominantly form elongated cylindrical bundles, whereas flexible polymers aggregate into compact spherical clusters. These findings provide comprehensive insights into how bridging interactions driven by attractive crowders regulate polymer aggregation dynamics and morphologies, emphasizing the importance of polymer rigidity, crowder size, and system density.</description>

      <title>Shear Stress Build-up Under Constant Strain Conditions in Soft Glassy Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the transient rheological behavior of two soft glassy materials: a clay dispersion and a silica gel, emphasizing their unconventional shear stress build-up behavior under conditions of constant imposed strain. For both materials, the elastic modulus and static yield stress undergo time-dependent evolution or aging. In addition, following an intense period of pre-shearing (i.e. shear-melting or destructuration), the material relaxation time is observed to show a stronger than linear dependence on the sample age, suggestive of hyper-aging dynamics. We show that these features are consistent with non-monotonic steady-state shear stress/shear rate flow curves characterized by a local stress minimum. When a steady shear flow is suddenly ceased, and the total imposed sample strain is held constant, both materials show an initial relaxation of the shear stress followed by a period of shear stress buildup, resulting in a local minimum in the evolution of shear stress with time. For the clay dispersion, the intensity of these effects increases with higher pre-shear rates, whereas for the silica gel, the effects are largely independent of the pre-shear rate. We also propose a simple time-dependent linear Maxwell model, which qualitatively predicts the experimentally observed trends in which the shear stress build-up is directly related to a monotonic increase in the elastic modulus, giving keen insight into this peculiar phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Bimodality of local structural ordering in extremely confined hard disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By combining computer simulations and a unit cell model approach, we study the apparent bimodality of local structural ordering in a system of confined hard disks. It is shown that a two-dimensional (2D) array of hard disks confined laterally within a quasi-1D hard wall channel of the width commensurate with the bulk 2D triangular lattice at disk close packing, possesses a bimodal probability distribution for the distance between disks' left and right nearest neighbors. The observed feature aligns with the concept of locally favored structures intensively exploited in the studies of anomalous thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of hydrogen-bonding fluids, except that the reported case is driven by entropic bonding only. The bimodality is observed in a range of densities associated with the vicinity of freezing transition in bulk 2D hard disks, indicating a crossover from the "gas-like" to "liquid-like" state in confined quasi-1D hard disks. Such a phenomenon was not reported for bulk 2D hard disks and is physically unexpected for confined q1D hard disks.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Pillar Induced Poiseuille-like Flow in Microfluidic Channels with Viscous and Viscoelastic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mucociliary clearance in mammals serves as the primary defense mechanism for removing particulate matter deposited in the pulmonary airways. Dysfunctions in this process are linked to serious respiratory diseases and can hinder effective drug delivery to the lungs. Microfluidic systems have emerged as a promising alternative for replicating lung functions in non-cellular physiological environments, offering a simpler and more controllable approach compared to in vivo and in vitro assays. Here we present a microfluidic platform featuring a closed-loop circular microchannel, integrating thousand 75 micrometer high magnetic pillars arranged in a square array. Made of polydimethylsiloxane and loaded with iron microparticles, the pillars are studied using scanning electron microscopy and magnetometry; their internal structure and bending response to a magnetic field are quantitatively analyzed. Using a combination of experimental data and finite element simulations, we found that the magnetic torque induced by permanent magnets dominates over magnetic force, generating fluid flow in the microchannel. Under the application of a rotating field, the time-dependent deflection of the pillars closely mimics the behavior of lung cilia, exhibiting alternating recovery phases and rapid whip-like movements. The velocity profiles of viscous and viscoelastic fluids are examined, and shown to display Poiseuille-type flow. By varying the viscosity of the fluids across four orders of magnitude, we identified a transition in propulsion regimes between viscous and elastic-driven flows. This active microfluidic platform offers a promising approach for modeling mucociliary clearance in drug delivery applications.</description>

      <title>Passive objects in a chiral active bath: from micro to macro</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed derivation of the Langevin dynamics obeyed by a massive rigid body immersed in a chiral active bath. We show how the antisymmetric nature of the noise leads to an unusual relationship between the Langevin equation describing stochastic trajectories and the Fokker-Planck equation governing the time-evolution of the probability density. The chirality of the bath endows the object dynamics with odd diffusivity, odd mobility, and rotational ratchet effects that depend on the object symmetries. For rotationally-symmetric objects, we show that a hidden time-reversal symmetry leads to separate effective equilibrium descriptions for the translational and rotational degrees of freedom. Finally, starting from the bath dynamics, we construct a multipole expansion to quadrupolar order that allows predicting the far-field current and density modulation induced by the object on the bath.</description>

      <title>Viscosity of polymer melts using non-affine theory based on vibrational modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.</description>

      <title>Active Hydrodynamic Theory of Euchromatin and Heterochromatin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The genome contains genetic information essential for cell's life. The genome's spatial organization inside the cell nucleus is critical for its proper function including gene regulation. The two major genomic compartments -- euchromatin and heterochromatin -- contain largely transcriptionally active and silenced genes, respectively, and exhibit distinct dynamics. In this work, we present a hydrodynamic framework that describes the large-scale behavior of euchromatin and heterochromatin, and accounts for the interplay of mechanical forces, active processes, and nuclear confinement. Our model shows contractile stresses from cross-linking proteins lead to the formation of heterochromatin droplets via mechanically driven phase separation. These droplets grow, coalesce, and in nuclear confinement, wet the boundary. Active processes, such as gene transcription in euchromatin, introduce non-equilibrium fluctuations that drive long-range, coherent motions of chromatin as well as the nucleoplasm, and thus alter the genome's spatial organization. These fluctuations also indirectly deform heterochromatin droplets, by continuously changing their shape. Taken together, our findings reveal how active forces, mechanical stresses and hydrodynamic flows contribute to the genome's organization at large scales and provide a physical framework for understanding chromatin organization and dynamics in live cells.</description>

      <title>A theoretical framework for investigating the role of stiffness heterogeneity in structure and dynamics of flexible polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heteropolymers are ubiquitous in both synthetic systems, such as block copolymers, and biological macromolecules, including proteins and nucleic acids. Beyond their chemical composition, these polymers often exhibit spatial variations in physical properties. For instance, in biopolymers such as chromatin, stiffness heterogeneity arises from inherent molecular features as well as extensile or contractile active forces. In this letter, we develop a theoretical framework that extends the physics of flexible polymers, a widely used tool to describe biopolymer dynamics, to incorporate spatially varying stiffness. Using this approach, we specifically analyze the structure and dynamics of flexible heteropolymers with periodic stepwise stiffness profiles. We find that stiffness heterogeneity leads to qualitative deviations in dynamical observables such as mean squared displacement while also increasing structural anisotropy. Altogether, this framework provides a platform to interpret stiffness heterogeneity from experimental data especially for biopolymers as well as to design heteropolymers with tailored structural and dynamic properties.</description>

      <title>Penetration of surface effects on structural relaxation and particle hops in glassy films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A free surface induces enhanced dynamics in glass formers. We study the dynamical enhancement of glassy films with a distinguishable-particle lattice model of glass free of elastic effects. We demonstrate that the thickness of the surface mobile layer depends on temperature differently under different definitions, although all are based on local structure relaxation rate. The rate can be fitted to a double exponential form with an exponential-of-power-law tail. Our approach and results exclude elasticity as the unique mechanism for the tail. Layer-resolved particle hopping rate, potentially a key measure for activated hopping, is also studied but it exhibits much shallower surface effects.</description>

      <title>Solving the Kinetic Ising Model with Non-Reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions are a generic feature of non-equilibrium systems. We define a non-reciprocal generalization of the kinetic Ising model in one spatial dimension. We solve the model exactly using two different approaches for infinite, semi-infinite and finite systems with either periodic or open boundary conditions. The exact solution allows us to explore a range of novel phenomena tied to non-reciprocity like non-reciprocity induced frustration and wave phenomena with interesting parity-dependence for finite systems of size $N$.
  We study dynamical questions like the approach to equilibrium with various boundary conditions. We find new regimes, separated by $N^{th}$-order exceptional points, which can be classified as overdamped, underdamped and critically damped phases. Despite these new regimes, long-time order is only present at zero temperature. Additionally, we explore the low-energy behavior of the system in various limits, including the ageing and spatio-temporal Porod regimes, demonstrating that non-reciprocity induces unique scaling behavior at zero temperature. Lastly, we present general results for systems where spins interact with no more than two spins, outlining the conditions under which long-time order may exist.</description>

      <title>Odd dynamics of passive objects in a chiral active bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When submerged in a chiral active bath, a passive object becomes a spinning ratchet imbued with odd transport properties. We present the most general Langevin dynamics for a rigid body in a chiral active bath, in the adiabatic limit of large object mass. For rotationally symmetric objects, odd diffusion and odd mobility are connected by an Einstein relation, that we show numerically to break down outside the adiabatic limit. As the object symmetry decreases, its dynamics becomes increasingly irreversible: a massive disk exhibits an effective equilibrium dynamics, while a rod admits distinct translational and rotational temperatures, and a wedge is fully irreversible.Conversely, this departure from equilibrium can be read in universal far-field currents and density modulations of the bath, which we measure numerically and derive analytically.</description>
