      <title>Channel Ordering for Fairness in Elastic Optical Networks via a LLM-Guided Bottleneck TSP Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In flexible-grid elastic optical networks (EONs), the ordering of frequency channels plays a crucial role in managing inter-channel interference and ensuring signal quality. We address the Channel Ordering Problem (COP) by reformulating it as a Bottleneck Traveling Salesman Problem (BTSP), where interference among channels is represented as edge weights in a graph structure. To tackle this challenge efficiently, we develop a scalable approach that integrates statistical exploration with guidance from large language models (LLMs). Extensive simulations using both the Gaussian Noise (GN) model and the split-step Fourier method demonstrate that our method achieves near-optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance and offers robust scalability across diverse network settings, making it well-suited for practical deployment in large-scale optical communication systems.</description>

      <title>Optical multistability in a compact microcavity enabled by near-exceptional coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multistability -- the emergence of multiple stable states under identical conditions -- is a hallmark of nonlinear complexity and an enabling mechanism for multilevel optical memory and photonic computing. Its realization in a compact footprint, however, is limited by intrinsically weak optical nonlinearities and the enlarged free spectral range that raises the multistability threshold. Here, we overcome this constraint by engineering a pair of spectrally close, ultra-high-Q resonances in a photonic crystal microcavity. Leveraging structural perturbations that deliberately introduce non-Hermitian coupling through a shared radiation channel, we drive the resonances toward an exceptional point with nearly degenerate wavelengths and balanced quality factors approaching $10^6$. This configuration substantially enhances thermo-optical nonlinearity and produces pronounced tristability and hysteresis loops within a footprint of 20 {\mu}m at input powers below 240 {\mu}W. We further demonstrate proof-of-concept optical random-access memory through controlled switching among multistable states. These results establish a general strategy for nonlinear microcavities to achieve energy-efficient multistability for reconfigurable all-optical memories, logic, and neuromorphic processors.</description>

      <title>Temperature bandgaps and thermal dopants arising from photothermal nonlinearities in high-Q silicon metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong light-matter interactions in silicon metasurfaces give rise to photothermal nonlinearities. While the effect of this strong coupling on light has been extensively studied, its impact on matter remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate photothermal energy harvesting using strong light-matter interactions in high-quality-factor metasurfaces. First, we show that maximum metasurface temperatures can differ by $90^\circ C$ based on the spectral excitation pathway: direct excitation of the metasurface from its nominal equilibrium by a single wavelength results in lower metasurface temperatures compared to continuous spectral scans. Investigating the temporal dynamics of this thermo-optic nonlinearity, we show an initial linear rise to a critical temperature over $~10s$ of seconds, followed by a rapid rise to the high temperature steady state in $~33ms$ around the bistable transition point. This linear rise time increases sharply around the bistable transition point. Most significantly, we show emergence of a Q-factor-dependent temperature band splitting and energy gap of around $60^\circ C$ between the critical temperature and the high temperature steady state of the metasurface under single wavelength illumination. This forbidden equilibrium temperature band signifies that the high temperature steady state of the metasurface resonance after transitioning across the laser wavelength is further away from its nominal resonance than its linewidth. Interestingly, hyperspectrally accumulated nonlinearities from prior wavelengths effectively dope the metasurface with optical states within this bandgap. These thermal nonlinearities are tunable using the geometry and material of the metasurface. Collectively, these results show how high-Q metasurfaces enable strongly localized, path-dependent photothermal heating to drive site-selective on-chip catalytic and biochemical transformations.</description>

      <title>100 Mfps ghost imaging with wavelength division multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ghost imaging (GI) and single-pixel imaging (SPI) techniques enable image reconstruction without spatially resolved detectors, offering unique access to wide spectral ranges and challenging imaging environments. Yet, their adoption has been limited by the slow generation of mask patterns, which constrains achievable frame rates. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast GI that achieves a spatial-temporal information flow of 78.4 gigapixels per second for a single wavelength, at least two orders of magnitude larger than those reported for previous training-data-free GI approaches. This breakthrough is enabled by 25 GHz speckle pattern switching and allows parallelizing the pattern illumination using a wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) technique. We show that the proposed approach is capable of reconstructing 28$\times$28-pixel images at the exposure time of 10 ns, achieving 100 megaframes per second (Mfps), and demonstrate the GI of a microsecond-scale dynamic event. This approach opens avenues for studying rapid processes in physics, chemistry, and biology, where conventional cameras are limited by detector bandwidth, readout speed, or cost.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Residual Timing Jitter in Pump-Probe Interferometry via Weak Value Amplification and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a hybrid methodology that synergistically combines weak value amplification (WVA) and deep learning to suppress the limiting effects of residual timing jitter in pump-probe interferometry, achieved through simulations of pump-induced time delays at a few-attosecond resolution. The WVA protocol, employing real weak values, amplifies the minute delay induced by sample perturbation, thereby translating it into a measurable shift of interference fringes. However, this amplification introduces significant fringe distortion. To address this, we deploy deep learning architectures as high-precision parameter estimators: a convolutional neural network regressor (CNN-Regressor) for direct delay estimation and a classifier (CNN-Classifier) for discrete delay categorization. These are systematically benchmarked against traditional Fourier-transform-based analysis. Two key conclusions are drawn: (i) The WVA technique consistently enhances measurement precision across all estimators by effectively increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). (ii) Both deep learning models surpass the traditional FFT approach; the CNN-Regressor achieves a higher SNR at small weak values, while the CNN-Classifier enables accurate estimation even under a challenging "$\pi$ phase shift" condition where conventional analysis fails. This synergistic combination of WVA and deep learning establishes a powerful framework for attosecond metrology, paving the way for enhanced precision in ultrafast spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Observation of Joule-Thomson photon-gas expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, a self-consistent optical thermodynamic framework has emerged that offers a systematic methodology to understand, harness and exploit the complex collective dynamics of multimode nonlinear systems. These developments now allow consideration of a series of longstanding problems in optics, including the prospect of funnelling the entire power flowing in a multimode system into its ground state, for which no methodology currently exists. Here, we demonstrate an all-optical Joule-Thomson expansion process mediated by photon-photon interactions whereby the temperature of the optical gas drops abruptly to zero. Our experiments in various configurations of coupled multicore nonlinear waveguide arrangements illustrate how light undergoing expansion-induced cooling can be channelled from arbitrary input states into the fundamental mode with near-unity efficiency. We show that the stability of the post-expansion state is ensured through an irreversible process of energy conversion. The all-optical thermodynamic phenomena explored in this study may enable innovative techniques where various uncorrelated but identical sources are merged into a unified spatially coherent state, offering a route for direct beam combining.</description>

      <title>Three-Photon Saturable Absorption in Atomically Thin Phlogopite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials, due to their remarkable physical and chemical properties, hold significant potential for future optical and electrical applications. In this study, the synthesis of 2D phlogopite (magnesium-rich mica) via liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) is reported using an efficient and scalable procedure. XRD structural analysis revealed a preferential orientation along the (033) plane, whereas AFM and SEM demonstrated a nanoscale thickness and homogeneous morphology. Optical characterisation by UV-Vis and Raman spectroscopy shows tuneable band gaps up to 4.52 eV for the exfoliated 2D phlogopite and distinct vibrational modes indicative of structural evolution. At intense laser conditions, three-photon saturable absorption (3PSA) behaviour was evidenced by light-modulated electrical property studies, which emphasise the potential for optical limiting, switching, and mode-locking applications. The present investigation indicates 2D phlogopite as a versatile material for next-generation optoelectronic devices of high-intensity light modulation.</description>

      <title>Photonic spin Hall effect in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric non-Hermitian cavity magnomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian cavity magnomechanics (CMM), which incorporates the magnon-photon and magnon-phonon interactions simultaneously, enables rich physical phenomena, including exceptional-point-enhanced sensing, and offers pathways toward topological transitions and nonreciprocal quantum transformation. These interactions exert a pivotal influence on the optical response of a weak probe field and pave the way for novel applications in quantum technologies. In this work, we consider a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere coupled to a microwave cavity. The magnon mode of the YIG sphere is directly excited through microwave field coupling, whereas the cavity mode is probed via a weak-field interrogation scheme. The direct interaction of a traveling field with the magnon mode induces gain in the system, thereby establishing non-Hermitian dynamics. The parity-time (PT)-symmetric behavior of a hybrid non-Hermitian CMM is designed and investigated. Eigenvalue spectrum analysis demonstrates that a third-order exceptional point (EP_3) emerges under tunable effective magnon-photon coupling when the traveling field is oriented at an angle of \pi/2 relative to the cavity's x-axis. The photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) in a reflected probe field is subsequently examined in such a system. Under balanced gain and loss conditions and in the presence of effective magnon-phonon coupling, tunable effective magnon-photon coupling enables coherent control of the PSHE across the broken PT-symmetric phase, at the EP_3, and in the PT-symmetric phase. Investigation reveals that the PSHE can be significantly enhanced or suppressed via effective magnon-photon coupling. The influence of intracavity length on the PSHE is further explored, providing an additional parameter for fine-tuning the transverse shift. These findings establish a direct correspondence between the PSHE and the underlying non-Hermitian eigenvalue spectrum.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Fusion Network for Micro-displacement Measurement via Michelson Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12192v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a multimodal fusion network (MFN) for precise micro-displacement measurement using a modified Michelson interferometer. The model resolves the intrinsic half-wave displacement ambiguity that limits conventional single-wavelength interferometry by introducing a dual-head learning mechanism: one head performs sub-half-wave displacement regression, and the other classifies integer interference orders. Unlike dual-wavelength or iterative fitting methods, which require high signal quality and long computation time, MFN achieves robust, real-time prediction directly from interferometric images.
  Trained on 2x10^5 simulated interferograms and fine-tuned with only about 0.24% of real experimental data (about 500 images), the model attains a displacement precision of 4.84(15) nm and an order-classification accuracy of 98%. Even under severe noise, MFN maintains stable accuracy (about 16 nm RMSE), whereas conventional heuristic algorithms exhibit errors exceeding 100 nm. These results demonstrate that MFN offers a fast, noise-tolerant, and cost-efficient solution for single-wavelength interferometric metrology, eliminating the need for multi-wavelength hardware or complex phase fitting.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Programmable Topological Transitions in Plasmonic Moire Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological transitions are fundamental phenomena in electronics, photonics, and quantum technologies. However, the scalability and tunability of Topological transitions in these systems have still been constrained by their material properties or structural rigidities. Here, we demonstrate that plasmonic Moire superlattices offer a platform for large-range and programmable topological transitions via wavefront engineering. By tailoring the phases of elementary evanescent waves in hexagonal systems, we create Moire-structured optical skyrmion lattices whose topological invariants evolve programmably and scalably. Theoretical calculations indicate that the topological invariants span from -58 to +58 and are extendable by tuning the Moire angle. Remarkably, their values are constrained by symmetry to exclude integer multiples of 3/2, revealing an intrinsic link between symmetry and topological quantization. Our work establishes a versatile real-space topology control platform for exploring topological transitions mechanisms and studying topologically critical phenomena, and further promoting breakthroughs in structured light, photonic computing, and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Pulsed heterodyne Brillouin microscopy enables high-specificity, low-phototoxicity biomechanical imaging with single-ended access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brillouin microscopy (BM) enables three-dimensional, non-contact viscoelastic imaging with high spatial resolution. Since its introduction in 2008, different BM modalities have balanced accessibility and spectral performance. Spontaneous BM offers single-ended access but limited spectral resolution, while stimulated BM provides higher resolution but requires a dual-objective configuration, restricting sample types and thicknesses. Heterodyne BM combines single-ended access with high spectral resolution, yet its demand for high optical power (276 mW) and long pixel dwell time (100 ms) limits biological applications. Here, we present pulsed heterodyne Brillouin microscopy (PHBM), which reduces excitation energy by two orders of magnitude while maintaining high spectral resolution and precision. Using only 10 mW average power and 10 ms pixel dwell time, PHBM achieves 27 MHz intrinsic spectral resolution and 10 MHz shift precision in water. The low phototoxicity of PHBM enables imaging of sensitive single cells, revealing subcellular mechanical features. Moreover, we resolve double Brillouin peaks with frequency separations as small as 200 MHz, demonstrating high mechanical specificity. High-quality imaging of ex vivo porcine cornea further highlights the benefits of single-ended access for thick and complex tissues. The high-resolution, high-accuracy, calibration-free, alignment-free, compact and robust characteristics of PHBM opens new opportunities in biomedical research.</description>

      <title>Direct Photochemical Patterning of Lithium Niobate Thin Films for Scalable Nonlinear Optical Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium niobate is one of the most sought-after materials for nanophotonic devices, including frequency converters, modulators, and quantum light sources. Integration of lithium niobate into optical devices, however, is hampered by significant top-down fabrication challenges due to its exceptional chemical resistance. Scalable fabrication methods that preserve material quality while reducing fabrication complexity and cost are, therefore, crucial to advancing lithium niobate devices. We present a photochemical metal-organic decomposition technique for the scalable patterning of lithium niobate at ambient conditions, eliminating the need for harsh etching conditions and cleanroom protocols. The method utilizes a solution of a custom-prepared photosensitive organometallic precursor as a negative photoresist. The UV light exposure of the thin films of the precursor through a photomask, followed by rinsing with ethanol, yields amorphous patterns, which transform into crystalline lithium niobate after a calcination step. This method enables a scalable fabrication of a range of complex geometric shapes with a feature resolution down to $30\,\mu\mathrm{m}$. The patterned lithium niobate structures exhibit a tunable second harmonic generation activity with an isotropic optical response. This approach offers a scalable and low-cost pathway for manufacturing lithium niobate photonics and the potential to fabricate other materials (e.g., barium titanite and lithium tantalate).</description>

      <title>Generation of Bright and Controllable Isolated Attosecond X-Ray Pulses from Synchronized Mid-Infrared and Ultra-short Ultraviolet Laser Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate, by solving the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation in the single-active-electron approximation in helium, a two-color scheme for tabletop high-order harmonic generation (HHG) that combines a mid-infrared (MIR) driving field with an ultrashort ultraviolet (UV) pulse that could be generated via resonant dispersive wave emission in gas-filled hollow-core fibers. This configuration enables the generation of bright, isolated, and tunable attosecond X-ray pulses. In contrast to single-color driving schemes, which suffer from low conversion efficiency, unfavorable wavelength scaling, and limited spectral control, the MIR+UV approach provides a practical and controllable route for advancing tabletop ultrafast spectroscopy and real-time molecular imaging within current experimental capabilities.</description>

      <title>Spectro-Polarimetric Holographic Multiplexing Metasurface with Super-High Capacity Empowered by Mechanical Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanically reconfigurable metasurfaces capable of translation, rotation, and permutation have attracted considerable attention for high-capacity optical information storage and full-color holographic displays, owing to their low-power and high functional scalability, despite the additional system-level complexity introduced by precision rotation stages. This study presents a differentiable inverse design framework for such metasurfaces, creating an accurate mapping between meta-atom geometries and their multi-channel optical responses across diverse optical dimensions. Using a deep neural network-driven, end-to-end optimization pipeline, the framework enables intelligent, iterative refinement of rotatable metasurface within constrained design space. Using this approach, we show high-fidelity holographic video display by rotating a single element in a cascaded metasurface doublet around the optical axis. The doublet enables pixel-resolved holographic imaging with 288 independent channels, and by switching input/output polarization states, the system demonstrates four distinct full-color dynamic holographic videos. This work establishes an alternative paradigm for optical parameter multiplexing and end-to-end inverse design in mechanically reconfigurable metasurfaces, suggesting applications in compact optical systems, dynamic holography, information processing, and optical computing.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{PT}$-like phase transitions from square roots of supersymmetric Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for realizing $\mathcal{PT}$-like phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems without imposing explicit parity--time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. The approach is based on constructing a Hamiltonian as the square root of a supersymmetric partner energy-shifted by a constant. This formulation naturally leads to bipartite dynamics with balanced gain and loss and can incorporate non-reciprocal couplings. The resulting systems exhibit entirely real spectra over a finite parameter range precisely when the corresponding passive Hamiltonian lacks a zero mode. As the non-Hermitian parameter representing gain and loss increases, the spectrum undergoes controlled real-to-complex transitions at second-order exceptional points. We demonstrate the versatility of this framework through several examples, including well-known models such as the Hatano--Nelson (HN) and complex Su--Schrieffer--Heeger (cSSH) lattices. Extending the formalism to $q$-commuting matrices further enables the systematic realization of higher-order exceptional points in systems with unidirectional couplings. Overall, this work uncovers new links between non-Hermitian physics and supersymmetry, offering a practical route to engineer photonic arrays with tunable spectral properties beyond what is achievable with explicit $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically circularly polarized bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of bound states in the continuum (BICs) in all-dielectric periodic structures, near which resonant states approach ideal circularly polarized states (CPSs). We term these BICs {\em asymptotically circularly polarized BICs} ({\em acp}-BICs) and identify two types: single-angle and all-angle. Single-angle {\em acp}-BICs permit convergence to left- or right-handed CPSs only along a single momentum-space direction, whereas all-angle {\em acp}-BICs exhibit convergence to CPSs of a single handedness throughout the entire momentum space, rendering them exceptionally promising for chiral optical applications. We reveal that the existence of {\em acp}-BICs is underpinned by total reflection of circularly polarized waves.
  Moreover, all-angle {\em acp}-BICs qualify as super-BICs, with uniform nearby polarization being an intrinsic property.
  In addition, a bifurcation theory is developed to analyze the emergence of genuine CPSs from {\em acp}-BICs
  under $C_{2}$-symmetric structural perturbations.
  Our results suggest {\em acp}-BICs as a platform for singular and chiral optical responses in all-dielectric systems.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Integrated Terahertz Vortex Beam Emitters with Staged-Annealing Topology Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photonics is increasingly demanded in applications such as large-scale data centers, intelligent sensing, and next-generation wireless communications, where compact, multifunctional, and energy-efficient components are essential. Inverse-designed photonics, empowered by optimization and learning algorithms, have emerged as a powerful paradigm for realizing compact and multifunctional integrated photonic components. In this work, we develop a staged-annealing topological optimization (SATO) framework tailored for the design of integrated terahertz (THz) beam-shaping devices. Employing this inverse-designed framework, we experimentally demonstrate a class of compact THz vortex beam emitters on an all-silicon on-chip platform. These devices efficiently convert the in-plane fundamental transverse electric (TE) waveguide mode into free-space vortex beams with mode purity up to 87% and energy conversion efficiency up to 74% across the target wavelength range (680 {\mu}m to 720 {\mu}m). The inverse-designed emitters exhibit ultracompact footprints (lateral size &lt; 4{\lambda}) and a free-standing configuration, enabling the generation of dual-directional vortex beams carrying opposite topological charges. The proposed SATO framework provides a generalizable and fabrication-compatible approach for THz photonic device engineering, offering a scalable pathway toward complex structured beam manipulation in next-generation wireless communication systems and on-chip integrated THz photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Dual-Mode Asymmetric Transmission based on Asymmetric and Orthogonal Gratings: Polarization-Dependent and -Independent Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dual-mode asymmetric transmission (AT) nanodevice based on the asymmetric and orthogonal grating-film-grating (AO-GFG) structure is proposed and systematically investigated theoretically. The device supports two distinct localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) modes for forward transmission, corresponding to the polarization-dependent (M1) and the polarization-independent (M2) resonances, respectively. This results in the fact that when x-polarized light is incident, only M2 exists; when y-polarized light is incident, both M1 and M2 exist. Besides, both modes yield the maximum isolation ratio of more than 10 dB. The electric field distributions further indicate that M2 exhibits strong confinement and efficient tunneling through the metallic film, while M1 shows weaker but more polarization-sensitive hybridization. The coexistence and tunability of these two modes constitute the physical basis of dual-mode AT, highlighting the AO-GFG structure as a promising platform for high-isolation and polarization-tunable plasmonic devices in the visible and near-infrared regions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between free electrons and optical modes underlies a variety of quantum and nanoscale light-matter phenomena, yet the associated momentum exchange with the sample largely remained overlooked. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the momentum transfer from free electrons to planar samples during optical mode excitation using momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy. The momentum transfer to the sample modifies the apparent dispersion relation which is significant when the planner sample is tilted. Under specific conditions, the sample receives momentum opposite to the electron beam direction.</description>

      <title>Visualized Geometric Phase of Caustic Geometric Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting Pancharatnam-Berry geometric phases of light typically requires interferometry or diffraction through a specially truncated aperture. Here, we introduce a simpler method that allows direct and fully visual detection of geometric phases in structured light without using interferometers or beam truncation. Our approach takes advantage of the geometric phase that naturally arises in SU(2) structured beams, where spatial wave packets follow caustic trajectories during propagation. By observing the evolution of these caustic-linked wave packets, we directly visualize both the geometric phase and the Gouy phase. This visual detection method provides new insight into geometric phases in complex optical fields and expands the possibilities for designing optical systems that exploit phase geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider theoretical models of the nanolaser and logic gates on carbon nanotubes (CNTs). In our work, it is shown at pumping the nanoresonator of the nanolaser on CNT by optical radiation using a quantum dot as nano light emitted diode (LED), the coherent flow of surface plasmon-polaritons arises when the generation threshold is exceeded. The coherent plasmonic flow from the partially reflecting mirror of the nanolaser enters the attached CNT plasmonic waveguide. Plasmonic logic gates NOT and OR based on CNTs represent the complete functional basis for binary logic. The proposed nanolaser and logic gates on CNTs can be used in plasmonic circuitry in the telecommunication frequency band.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an inverse method to compute freeform optical surfaces that transform a light distribution, parameterized by two source planes, into two separate target distributions. The surfaces can be reflectors or lenses, and control both the spatial and directional source and target coordinates of light rays. From energy conservation we derive Jacobian equations for optical mappings, and the optical path length provides generating functions for the optical surfaces. A three-stage least-squares algorithm numerically solves the resulting equations. We present examples with complex source and target distributions.</description>

      <title>Extreme polaritonic interactions in a room-temperature deterministic sub-nanocavity quantum electrodynamic platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pushing nanoscale optical confinement to its ultimate limits defines the regime of nano-cavity quantum electrodynamics (nano-cQED), where light--matter interactions approach the fundamental quantum limits of individual atoms, e.g., picocavities. However, realizing such extreme confinement in a stable and controllable manner remains a key challenge. Here, we introduce a van der Waals material-based nano-cQED platform by coupling monolayer MoS2 excitons to plasmonic sub-nanocavities formed via assembly of ultrasmall gold clusters (3-5 nm) in the nanogap of a nanoparticle-on-mirror nanocavity. These clusters emulate the field-confining role of atomic protrusions of the picocavities through a resonance-insensitive lightning-rod effect, achieving deep-subwavelength mode volumes. In this nano-cQED testbed, we observe pronounced multi-branch Rabi splittings and ultrastrong lower-branch polaritonic photoluminescence with up to 10^4-fold enhancement. This deterministic architecture provides a controllable pathway to access picocavity-like behavior and opens new opportunities for single-molecule spectroscopy and the exploration of nano-cQED.</description>

      <title>Programmable photonic Ising machine enabled by a reconfigurable interferometric processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The general-purpose programmable photonic processors offer a scalable and reconfigurable solution for a wide range of RF and optical applications. Therefore, implementing photonic Ising machines using programmable processors leverages the advantages of high speed and parallelism, enabling efficient hardware acceleration for finding ground-state solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. In this work, we demonstrate a novel programmable photonic Ising solver based on a hexagonal mesh general-purpose programmable photonic platform. The integrated system allows reconfigurable matrix multiplication and computes the Hamiltonian iteratively using an annealing algorithm that facilitates spin updates and effectively searches for the ground state. As a proof of concept, we experimentally solve two benchmark optimization problems, a fundamental three-node ferromagnetic coupling problem with external bias that demonstrates nontrivial spin interactions, and a four-node Max-Cut problem with arbitrary coupling matrices. Furthermore, to establish a large-scale capability, we emulated Ising problems with sizes up to N = 50, achieving success probabilities exceeding 80\%. Additionally, we examined the impact of errors, such as phase and coupling, on the performance of the programmable photonic Ising machine. Our general-purpose photonic Ising machine paves the way for implementing large-scale, programmable architectures for solving optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Calibration of Microscope-coupled Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometers for CW and Modulated Light Emission Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement of low power infrared light emission spectra from microstructures can be challenging, but is of key importance in several research fields. Fourier transform infrared spectrometers (FTIR) can be used for characterizing such weak light emitters, but this requires additional custom user calibration compared to traditional FTIR measurements of, e.g., transmission or reflection. These calibration techniques are well documented for standalone FTIR instruments but not for microscope coupled-FTIRs, even though such an architecture greatly simplifies collection of light from micro and nano scale structures. We propose and demonstrate a calibration method for microsope-FTIRs based on the well-known emissivity of doped silicon at high temperature. With this method, we measure responsivity and noise floor of a recently installed microscope-FTIR instrument (Bruker\textsuperscript{\textcopyright} Invenio\textsuperscript{\textregistered} R coupled with a Hyperion II microscope), which is found to be within theoretically predicted values. The method is demonstrated for two different detectors (Mercury Cadmium Telluride and Indium Antimonide), in both continuous wave (CW) and modulated (step-scan) emission measurements mode.</description>

      <title>Molecular Engineering for Enhanced Second-Order Nonlinear Response in Spontaneously-Oriented Evaporated Organic Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with large second-order nonlinearities are crucial for next-generation integrated photonics. Spontaneously oriented organic thin films prepared by physical vapor deposition offer a promising poling-free and scalable approach. This study investigates molecular engineering strategies to enhance the second-order nonlinear response of derivatives based on the donor-acceptor molecule 2-(4'-diphenylaminobiphenyl-4-yl)quinoxaline-6,7-dicarbonitrile (TPA-QCN). Four derivatives incorporating modifications designed to increase molecular hyperpolarizability ($\beta$) or promote favorable orientation were synthesized and characterized. The most successful modification, intramolecular bridge-locking, simultaneously increases hyperpolarizability and enhances spontaneous orientation by reducing detrimental electrostatic interactions during deposition. It leads to a significant enhancement of the second-order nonlinear response, achieving off-resonance $\chi^{(2)}_{31} \approx 16$ pm V$^{-1}$ and $\chi^{(2)}_{33} \approx 18$ pm V$^{-1}$ at 1550 nm, a twofold improvement over the parent TPA-QCN. Analysis combining nonlinear optical measurements, surface potential measurement, optical anisotropy, and density functional theory calculations indicates that improved molecular orientation, rather than increased $\beta$ alone, is the primary driver for the enhanced performance in the leading derivatives. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of targeting molecular orientation via structural design and position spontaneously oriented organic films as compelling poling-free candidates for integrated nonlinear photonic applications where the increased electrode-induced optical losses, fabrication complexity and footprint are a critical limitation.</description>

      <title>In-Situ Growth of Halide Perovskite Single Crystals and Thin Films on Optical Fiber End Facets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide perovskites exhibit significant advantages for active optical components such as light emitting diodes, solar cells and photodetectors due to their excellent optoelectronic properties. Their nonlinear optical effects and other characteristics also make them suitable for integration into waveguide components, such as optical fibers, for applications like optical modulation. Although some efforts have been made to integrate perovskite nanomaterials with optical fibers, technological challenges have hindered reliable in-situ preparation methods. Herein, we propose an area-selective wetting strategy for optical fibers, which utilizes hydrophobic sidewalls and hydrophilic end facets to reliably hold small precursor droplets. By introducing a space confinement strategy to suppress the kinetics of solvent evaporation, Methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) perovskite single crystals were successfully grown in-situ on the fiber end facet. The versatility of this in-situ growth method for single crystals on fiber end facets of various sizes has also been verified. In a separate approach, the controllable in-situ preparation of CsPbBr3 polycrystalline thin films was achieved through vacuum-assisted rapid crystallization. Our strategy provides a controllable platform for the integration of perovskite materials and optical fibers, enabling further development in optical applications.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Photoelastic Imaging for Three-Dimensional Stress Estimation in a Transparent Cubical Block</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional photoelastic methods are largely limited to two-dimensional stress visualization, leaving a gap in techniques that can capture three-dimensional force interactions with high sensitivity at low stress levels, a capability that is critical for biomechanics and dynamic force analysis. This study develops and demonstrates a cubic photoelastic model that enables accurate fringe-order estimation from three orthogonal views, providing a foundation for reconstructing full three-dimensional stress states. A transparent, low-elasticity epoxy cube, free of prestress, was fabricated and examined using combined transmission and reflection photoelastic imaging. Three mutually orthogonal isochromatic fringe fields were recorded simultaneously under a single applied load. Image analysis employed a peak-valley intensity method to extract sub-fringe orders and to resolve low-stress cases with minimal noise. The cubic block produced high-quality fringe patterns in all directions, enabling separation of tangential and normal stress components. Independent orthogonal views confirmed directional sensitivity and yielded consistent fringe-order estimates under low loading, with response times on the order of tens of microseconds. These results establish a practical approach for three-dimensional photoelastic stress measurement from orthogonal views and create a pathway toward full vector force reconstruction with strong potential for biomedical applications and studies of dynamic loading.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an all-optical quantum-enhanced diagnostic for electric fields in low-temperature plasmas. Trace amounts of rubidium vapor, added to argon plasma, allow us to produce spectrally narrow electric field-sensitive optical resonances via quantum optical effect of Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency, and to non-invasively measure electric field in plasma with sensitivity exceeding 1 V/cm. By collecting fluorescence from the illuminated region of interest, we reconstruct a 2D spatial profile of the electric field magnitude with $30~\mu$m resolution. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we measured the changes in electric field within the plasma sheath surrounding a biased Langmuir probe tip. This method holds significant potential for studying sheath structures in low-temperature plasmas.</description>

      <title>Sparsity-Driven Entanglement Detection in High-Dimensional Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The characterization of high-dimensional quantum entanglement is crucial for advanced quantum computing and quantum information algorithms. Traditional methods require extensive data acquisition and suffer from limited visibility due to experimental noise. Here, we introduce a sparsity-driven framework to enhance the detection and certification of high-dimensional entanglement in spatially entangled photon pairs. By applying $\ell_1$-regularized reconstruction to sample covariance matrices obtained from measurements on photons produced via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) measurements, we enhance the visibility of the correlation signal while suppressing noise. We demonstrate, using a position-momentum Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entanglement criterion, that this approach enables certification of an entanglement dimensionality that cannot be achieved without regularization. Our method is scalable, simple to use and compatible with existing quantum-optics platforms, thus paves the way for efficient, real-time analysis of high-dimensional quantum states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum cryptography remains a topic of enduring scientific and educational interest. Here, we present a clear and accessible framework for exploring the six-state quantum key distribution protocol, an enhanced three-basis extension of the BB84 scheme that combines optical experiments with computational analysis. Designed for testing quantum communication protocols through emulation, this approach provides a robust and cost-effective platform that highlights the fundamental principles of multi-basis encoding and demonstrates how experimental measurements connect directly to theoretical expectations in a controlled tabletop setting.</description>

      <title>Machine learning inspired photon number resolution in superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon-number resolved detection with superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) attracts increasing interest, but lacks a systematic framework for interpreting and benchmarking this capability. In this work, we combine principal component analysis (PCA) with a new readout technique to explore the photon-number resolving capabilities of SNSPDs and find that the information of the photon number is contained in a single principal component which approximates the time derivative of the average response trace. We introduce a new confidence metric based on the Bhattacharyya coefficient to quantify the photon-number-resolving capabilities of a detector system and show that this metric can be used to compare different systems. Our analysis and interpretation of the principal components imply that photon-number resolution in SNSPDs can be achieved with moderate hardware requirements in terms of both sample rate (5 GSample/sec) and analog bandwidth (3 GHz) and could be implemented in an FPGA, giving a highly scalable solution for real-time photon counting.</description>

      <title>Smoothed-Cubic Spin-Glass Model of Random Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13508v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the equilibrium glassy behavior of a multimode random laser model with nonlinear four-body quenched disordered interactions and a global smoothed-cubic constraint on mode intensities. This constraint, which provides a more realistic representation of gain saturation than the commonly used spherical constraint, prevents intensity condensation while preserving the dense, long-range interaction structure characteristic of many multistate random lasers. The model effective Hamiltonian is a function of mode amplitudes with random frequencies and is defined on a complete mode-locked graph. Using large-scale GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo simulations with the Parallel Tempering algorithm, we analyze systems of varying sizes to probe their thermodynamic-limit behavior. Finite-size scaling of the specific heat, of the Parisi overlap distributions, and of the inverse participation ratio's reveals a spin-glass transition, with critical exponents matching the mean-field Random Energy Model universality class. The smoothed-cubic constraint produces broad, non-condensed intensity distributions, avoiding the pseudo-condensation seen in spherical models on the same interaction graph. Our results show that more realistic gain-saturation constraints preserve spin-glass characteristics while enabling simulations of larger, more dilute systems, providing a robust framework for studying glassy random lasers with self-starting mode-locking.</description>

      <title>Long-range entanglement and quantum correlations in a multi-frequency comb system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency combs are multimode photonic systems that underlie countless precision sensing and metrology applications. Since their invention over two decades ago, numerous efforts have pushed frequency combs to broader bandwidths and more stable operation. More recently, quantum squeezing and entanglement have been explored in single frequency comb systems for quantum advantages in sensing and signal multiplexing. However, the production of quantum light across multiple frequency combs remains unexplored. In this work, we theoretically explore a mechanism that generates a series of nonlinearly coupled frequency combs through cascaded three-wave upconversion and downconversion processes mediated by a single idler comb. We show how this system generates inter- and intracomb two-mode squeezing and entanglement spanning a very large spectral range, from ultraviolet to mid-IR frequencies. Finally, we show how this system can be engineered to produce on-demand multimode quantum light through covariance matrix optimization. Our findings could enable tunable broadband ghost spectroscopy protocols, squeezing-enhanced pump-probe measurements, and broadband entanglement between spectrally-multiplexed quanta of information.</description>

      <title>Modeling Quantum Noise in Nanolasers using Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The random nature of spontaneous emission leads to unavoidable fluctuations in a laser's output. This is often included through random Langevin forces in laser rate equations, but this approach falls short for nanolasers. In this paper, we show that the laser quantum noise can be quantitatively computed for a very broad class of lasers by starting from simple and intuitive rate equations and merely assuming that the number of photons and excited electrons only takes discrete values. The success of the model is explained by showing that it constitutes a Markov chain, which can be derived from the full master equations. We show that in the many-photon limit, the model simplifies to Langevin equations. We perform an extensive comparison of different approaches for computing quantum noise in lasers, identifying the best approach for different system sizes, ranging from nanolasers to macroscopic lasers, and different levels of excitation, i.e., cavity photon number. In particular, we find that the numerical solution to the Langevin equations is inaccurate below the laser threshold, while the laser Markov chain model, on the other hand, is accurate for all pump values and laser sizes when collective emitter effects are excluded.</description>

      <title>Absorption and scattering properties of nanoparticles in an absorbing medium: modeling with experimental validation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Absorption and scattering properties of nanoparticles immersed in an absorbing medium are essential in understanding the overall properties of composites and in designing materials with expected functionalities. In this paper, we establish a model based on both Kubelka-Munk theory and Mie theory that links the absorption and scattering properties of individual particles with the reflectance and transmittance spectra of its thin-film composite, supported by detailed experiments. Thin films consisting of TiO$_2$ nanoparticles embedded in PMMA are fabricated on glass substrates using spin-coating and then peeled off to form standalone samples for spectroscopy measurements. By using the Kubelka-Munk theory in combination with the Saunderson correction, the absorption $K$ and scattering $S$ coefficients of multiple nanoparticles are extracted from the measured transmittance and reflectance. On the other hand, the absorption $K$ and scattering $S$ coefficients are the sum of absorption and scattering cross-sections of individual particles, which are calculated from the Mie theory specified for particles in an absorbing medium, with the scattering $S$ coefficient further modulated by the anisotropy factor $g$. The effect of the particulate medium is incorporated through an effective refractive index. The overall model is validated by matching well between the $K-S$ coefficients extracted from experimental data and theoretical calculations. This agreement provides deep insight into the significant attenuating effect of absorption and scattering on each particle due to the surrounding medium. The validated model of nanoparticles immersed in an absorbing medium can be used to obtain preliminary results for materials designed in a number of applications, such as radiative cooling.</description>

Abstract: Optics is foundational to research in many areas of science and engineering, including nanophotonics, quantum information, materials science, biomedical imaging, and metrology. However, the design, assembly, and alignment of optical experiments remain predominantly manual, limiting throughput and reproducibility. Automating such experiments is challenging due to the strict, non-negotiable precision requirements and the diversity of optical configurations found in typical laboratories. Here, we introduce a platform that integrates generative artificial intelligence, computer vision, and robotics to automate free-space optical experiments. The platform translates user-defined goals into valid optical configurations, assembles them using a robotic arm, and performs micrometer-scale fine alignment using a robot-deployable tool. It then executes a range of automated measurements, including beam characterization, polarization mapping, and spectroscopy, with consistency surpassing that of human operators. This work demonstrates the first flexible, AI-driven automation platform for optics, offering a path towards remote operation, cloud labs, and high-throughput discovery in the optical sciences.</description>

      <title>Resonance fluorescence and indistinguishable photons from a coherently driven B centre in hBN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optically active defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have become amongst the most attractive single-photon emitters in the solid state, owing to their high-quality photophysical properties, combined with the unlimited possibilities of integration offered by the host two-dimensional material. In particular, the B centres, with their narrow linewidth, low wavelength spread and controllable positioning, have raised a particular interest for integrated quantum photonics. However, to date, either their excitation or their detection has been performed non-resonantly due to the difficulty of rejecting the backreflected laser light at the same wavelength, thereby preventing to take full benefit from their high coherence in quantum protocols. Here, we make use of a narrow-linewidth emitter integrated in a hybrid metal-dielectric structure to implement crossed-polarisation laser rejection. This allows us to observe resonantly scattered photons, with associated experimental signatures of optical coherence in both continuous-wave (cw) and pulsed regimes, respectively the Mollow triplet and Hong-Ou-Mandel interference from zero-phonon-line emission. The measured two-photon interference visibility of 0.93 +/- 0.21 and 0.92 +/- 0.26 we measured for two emitters demonstrate the potential of B centres in hBN for applications to integrated quantum information.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen-Vacancy Emission from Nanodiamond: Size, Depth, and Surroundings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a leading solid-state quantum emitter, offering spin-photon interfaces over a wide temperature range with applications from electromagnetic sensing to bioimaging. While NV centers in bulk diamond are well understood, embedding them in nanodiamond (ND) introduces complexities from size, NV location, and NV polarizations. NVs in ND show altered fluorescence properties including longer lifetimes, lower quantum efficiency, and higher sensitivity to dielectric surroundings, which arise from radiative suppression, surface-induced non-radiative decay, and escape inefficiency at the diamond-background interface. Prior models typically addressed isolated aspects, such as dielectric contrast or surface quenching, without integrating full quantum-optical NV behavior with classical electrodynamics. We present a hybrid framework coupling rigorous electromagnetic simulations with a quantum-optical NV model including phonon sideband dynamics. NV emission is found to depend strongly on ND size, NV position, and surrounding refractive index. Our results explain observations such as shallow NVs in water-coated ND appearing brighter than deeper ones in air. This integrated model provide a unified framework for realistic NV in ND emission scenarios and informs the design of efficient NV-based sensors and quantum devices, advancing understanding of quantum emitter photophysics in nanoscale crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) is a versatile technique in nanooptics, enabling local probing of optical responses beyond the diffraction limit from vis to THz frequencies. Its theoretical modeling based on tip-sample interactions typically relies on computationally intensive numerical methods or phenomenological models with empiric fitting parameters, complicating spectral analysis and interpretation. Developing a rigorous quantitative analytical model remains a significant challenge in near-field microscopy. Here, we introduce an accurate analytical solution for the prolate spheroid model of s-SNOM in the quasi-electrostatic limit. We validate our solution through comparisons with numerical simulations and experimental spectra. Due to its higher computational efficiency compared to numerical simulation and higher accuracy compared to phenomenological solutions, our solution for spheroid model facilitates spectrum prediction and interpretation for homogeneous bulk samples, enables systematic exploration of parameter effects, and supports data generation for machine learning applications. Furthermore, the generality of our approach allows straightforward extension to more complex nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Riemann-Silberstein geometric phase in 4D polarization space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometric phase is a far-reaching concept in quantum and classical physics. The first discovered geometric phase, the Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phase, has profoundly shaped nanophotonics through metasurfaces. However, the PB phase arises from SU(2) polarization evolution and is constrained to a 2D polarization space, failing to capture the full polarization degrees of freedom. We generalize geometric phase to the 4D Riemann-Silberstein (RS) space that simultaneously describes electric, magnetic, and hybrid electric-magnetic polarizations. We show that SU(4) polarization evolution can generate a new geometric phase, the RS phase, alongside the PB phase. Unlike the PB phase that typically manifests in circularly polarized light, the RS phase can emerge in arbitrarily polarized light. Together, they enable a high-dimensional geometric framework for light propagation across general interfaces. We reveal that the phase shifts governed by Fresnel equations are direct manifestations of the RS-space geometric phases, integrating a century-old wave theory into this paradigm. We experimentally validate the framework using metasurfaces and achieve high-dimensional wavefront manipulation. Our work offers fundamental insights into the geometric nature of light-matter interactions, with implications for topological and non-Abelian physics in classical wave systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors built on photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) have recently become a promising category of optical sensing platforms. This is primarily due to their high sensitivity, compact structural design and ability to work with a wide variety of analytes. The overall sensing performance can significantly be enhanced by carefully tailoring the fiber geometry to strengthen the coupling between the guided core mode and the plasmon mode. This study designs and thoroughly investigates a polarization-dependent SPR-based PCF sensor that delivers strong mode coupling, wide detection range and high refractive-index (RI) sensitivity using finite element method (FEM). In the proposed configuration, air holes with different diameters and a rectangular core slot are used to create birefringence along with four outer microchannels coated with a 30 nm gold film create distinct plasmonic regions that support multiple resonances. The simulated results yield maximum wavelength sensitivities of 77500 $nmRIU^-{1}$ and 92500 $nmRIU^-{1}$, along with amplitude sensitivities of 3930 $RIU^-{1}$ and 3139 $RIU^-{1}$ and figures of merit of 517 $RIU^-{1}$ and 356 $RIU^-{1}$ for the x- and y-polarizations respectively, over an analyte RI range of 1.32-1.42. The parametric study verifies that the design is highly tolerant to fabrication deviations and the coupling behavior is primarily sensitive to the smallest air holes and the height of the core slot. Since the sensing region is external, analytes can be reused conveniently. Consequently, the proposed sensor provides a compact, highly sensitive and practically realizable platform for biochemical and chemical sensing applications.</description>

Abstract: Optomechanical sensors enable exquisitely sensitive force measurements, with emerging applications across quantum technologies, standards, fundamental science, and engineering. Magnetometry is among the most promising applications, where chip-scale optomechanical sensors offer high sensitivity without the cryogenics or magnetic shielding required by competing technologies. However, lack of compatibility with integrated photonics and electronics has posed a major barrier. Here we introduce silicon-on-insulator optomechanical magnetometers to address this barrier. A new post-release lithography process enables high-quality metallisation of released mechanical structures, overcoming the incompatibility between silicon-on-insulator fabrication and functional magnetic films. This allows us to employ photonic-crystal cavities that enhance motion-to-optical signal transduction by over an order of magnitude. The resulting devices achieve magnetic field sensitivity of 800 pT Hz^-1/2, three orders of magnitude beyond previous waveguide-integrated designs. The advances we report provide a path towards high-performance, room temperature and chip-integrated magnetometers for applications ranging from biomedical imaging and navigation to resource exploration.</description>

      <title>Systematic validation of time-resolved diffuse optical simulators via non-contact SPAD-based measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Time-domain diffuse optical imaging (DOI) requires accurate forward models for photon propagation in scattering media. However, existing simulators lack comprehensive experimental validation, especially for non-contact configurations with oblique illumination. This study rigorously evaluates three widely used open-source simulators, including MMC, NIRFASTer, and Toast++, using time-resolved experimental data. Approach: All simulations employed a unified mesh and point-source illumination. Virtual source correction was applied to FEM solvers for oblique incidence. A time-resolved DOI system with a 32 $\times$ 32 single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array acquired transmission-mode data from 16 standardized phantoms with varying absorption coefficient $\mu_a$ and reduced scattering coefficient $\mu_s'$. The simulation results were quantified across five metrics: spatial-domain (SD) precision, time-domain (TD) precision, oblique beam accuracy, computational speed, and mesh-density independence. Results: Among three simulators, MMC achieves superior accuracy in SD and TD metrics, and shows robustness across all optical properties. NIRFASTer and Toast++ demonstrate comparable overall performance. In general, MMC is optimal for accuracy-critical TD-DOI applications, while NIRFASTer and Toast++ suit scenarios prioritizing speed with sufficiently large $\mu_s'$. Besides, virtual source correction is essential for non-contact FEM modeling, which reduced average errors by &gt; 34% in large-angle scenarios. Significance: This work provides benchmarked guidelines for simulator selection during the development phase of next-generation TD-DOI systems. Our work represents the first study to systematically validate TD simulators against SPAD array-based data under clinically relevant non-contact conditions, bridging a critical gap in biomedical optical simulation standards.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Gradient Imaging Using a Nonlocal Metasurface System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum phase imaging enables the analysis of transparent samples with thickness and refractive index variations in scenarios requiring precise measurements under low-light conditions. Recent advances in nonlinear metasurfaces offer compact solutions for quantum light generation and manipulation. Here, we present a compact quantum phase imaging system integrating a lithium niobate (LiNbO3) metasurface for generating spatially entangled photon pairs and a silicon (Si) metasurface for phase gradient extraction. The LiNbO3 metasurface enables efficient spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with angularly dispersed, tunable emission, while the Si metasurface employs a nearly linear optical transfer function (OTF) to differentiate phase and extract phase gradients via spatial quantum correlations. This dual-metasurface enabled combined ghost imaging and all-optical scanning protocols with quantum light achieves phase gradient reconstruction without mechanical tuning. Experimental results demonstrate the system's ability to resolve phase gradients up to 25 rad/mm with 88% fidelity using a 6x3-pixel proof-of-concept setup. In addition, theoretically, it is confirmed that the resolution of the system is primarily limited by the quality factor of the compact design, leveraging nonlocal resonances and quantum correlations, establishes a new paradigm for portable quantum phase-gradient imaging, with potential applications in sensing, microscopy, and LiDAR. This work highlights the application of metasurface in both generating and detecting quantum states.</description>

      <title>Temporal dynamics in the Bragg reflection of light by cold atoms: flash effect and superradiant decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the temporal dynamics of light interacting with a one-dimensional lattice of cold atoms. In such a system, a photonic band gap opens up, yielding an efficient Bragg reflection for an incident field incoming with the right angle and detuning. Here, we report two new effects appearing in the Bragg reflection. First, for some detunings, there is a ``flash'', i.e., a transient increase of the reflected intensity when the incident field is switched off. Second, the subsequent extinction of the reflected field is clearly superradiant, with decay rates up to height times the natural decay rate of the atomic excited state. Numerical simulations are in qualitative agreement with the observations, which can be explained by a classical photonic model. Our results are a step towards exploiting this photonic band gap in atomic systems for quantum-optical applications.</description>

      <title>Approximate direct and inverse scattering for the AKNS system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the direct and inverse scattering problems for the AKNS (Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur) system. New representations for the Jost solutions are obtained in the form of the power series in terms of a transformed spectral parameter. In terms of that parameter, the Jost solutions are convergent power series in corresponding unit disks. For the coefficients of the series simple recurrent integration procedures are devised. Solution of the direct scattering problem reduces to computing the coefficients and locating zeros of corresponding analytic functions in the interior of the unit disk. Solution of the inverse scattering problem reduces to the solution of two systems of linear algebraic equations for the power series coefficients, while the potentials are recovered from the first coefficients. The overall approach leads to a simple and efficient method for the numerical solution of both direct and inverse scattering problems, which is illustrated by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum noise reduction in a Raman amplifier via quantum correlation between atom and light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any amplifier requires coupling to its internal degrees of freedom for energy gain. This coupling introduces extra quantum noise to the output. On the other hand, if the internal degree of the amplifier can be accessed and manipulated, we can manage and even reduce the quantum noise of the amplifier's output. In this paper, we present an experiment to reduce the quantum noise of a Raman amplifier by preparing the atomic medium in a correlated state with the Stokes light field. We report an observation of quantum noise reduction of more than 3.5 dB in the atomic Raman amplification process. From another perspective, the Raman amplifier at high gain in turn serves as a measurement tool for the quantum correlation between the atom and light. Furthermore, such a scheme, when viewed as a whole, also forms a quantum-entangled atom-light hybrid interferometer that can lead to quantum-enhanced sensors.</description>

      <title>Transport-Induced Decoherence of the Entangled Triplet Exciton Pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoherence effects for entangled triplet pairs in organic molecular crystals are analyzed for the case when excitons can hop between inequivalent lattice sites. The fluorescence quantum beats caused by quantum interference upon triplet-triplet recombination into an emissive singlet state are predicted as a function of hopping time and magnetic field based on a Monte Carlo analysis. Depending on exciton hopping rates, it is possible to have complete global decoherence and suppression of fluorescence quantum beats in the limit of zero magnetic field, and to have quantum beats that decay at different rates depending on magnetic field strength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By measuring a small circularly polarized component in the scattered light, we report the first observation of Rayleigh optical activity (RayOA) for isotropic samples of chiral molecules, namely the two enantiomers of $\alpha$-pinene in neat liquid form. Our work validates fundamental theoretical predictions made over fifty years ago and expands the chiroptical toolkit.</description>
