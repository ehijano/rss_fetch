      <title>Quantifying Flat-Band Voltage in Si Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Structures: An Evaluation via Terahertz Emission Spectroscopy (TES)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-induced Terahertz (THz) Emission Spectroscopy (TES) has demonstrated its potential utility in the realm of Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) devices as an expedient and noncontact estimation methodology. Owing to its discerning response to the interface electric field, the amplitude of the THz emission peak in time-domain spectroscopy encapsulates rich information regarding MOS properties, notably the flat-band voltage. This paper concentrates on the precise quantitative estimation of the flat-band voltage within the Si MOS structure, elucidating the intricacies of the estimation process through the THz emission model.</description>

      <title>Integration of a Synthetic Molecular Motor Into a Rotary DNA Nanostructure: A Framework for Single-Molecule Actuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic molecular motors are an appealing means to control motion at the nanoscale, but understanding their behaviour as single-molecule actuators and integrating them into larger, functional systems remain technical challenges. Translating molecular actuation into coordinated device-level behaviour requires precise placement and orientation of the motors: DNA origami provides a powerful platform for positioning molecules with nanometre precision. Here, we demonstrate integration of a light-driven, rotary molecular motor into a DNA-based nanoscale actuator through site-specific, four-point conjugation. The motor is labelled with four distinct oligonucleotides, two on each side, using DNA-templated chemistry. This modular approach enables stable, oriented incorporation of the motor into a DNA assembly through DNA hybridization. Upon photoactivation with UV light, the motor transduces photon energy into rotary motion. By coupling the motor to a fluorescently labelled DNA rotor arm we amplify its movement and enable real-time observation using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. A subset of assembled devices exhibits light-induced conformational transitions and directional motion consistent with the expected photochemical mechanism. These results establish a programmable framework for integration of light-driven molecular motors into synthetic nanomachines and tools for the study of their behaviour.</description>

      <title>Effective interface forces to model boundary effects in a finite-size metamaterial through the reduced relaxed micromorphic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the reduced relaxed micromorphic model (RRMM) to capture the effective "bulk" dynamical response of finite size metamaterial specimens made out of a Labyrinthine unit cell. We show that for small finite-size specimens, boundary effects can play a major role, so that the RRMM needs an enrichment to capture the metamaterial's bulk response, as well as the boundary effects. A benchmark test is introduced to show that different metamaterial/ homogeneous material interfaces can drive completely different responses even if the bulk metamaterial remains the same. We show with no remaining doubts that the concept of "interface forces" must necessarily be introduced if one wants to model finite-size metamaterials in a homogenized framework.</description>

      <title>Fast and Robust Speckle Pattern Authentication by Scale Invariant Feature Transform algorithm in Physical Unclonable Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, due to the growing phenomenon of forgery in many fields, the interest in developing new anti-counterfeiting device and cryptography keys, based on the Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) paradigm, is widely increased. PUFs are physical hardware with an intrinsic, irreproducible disorder that allows for on-demand cryptographic key extraction. Among them, optical PUF are characterized by a large number of degrees of freedom resulting in higher security and higher sensitivity to environmental conditions. While these promising features led to the growth of advanced fabrication strategies and materials for new PUF devices, their combination with robust recognition algorithm remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present a metric-independent authentication approach that leverages the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm to extract unique and invariant features from the speckle patterns generated by optical Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). The application of SIFT to the challenge response pairs (CRPs) protocol allows us to correctly authenticate a client while denying any other fraudulent access. In this way, the authentication process is highly reliable even in presence of response rotation, zooming, and cropping that may occur in consecutive PUF interrogations and to which other postprocessing algorithm are highly sensitive. This characteristics together with the speed of the method (tens of microseconds for each operation) broaden the applicability and reliability of PUF to practical high-security authentication or merchandise anti-counterfeiting.</description>

      <title>Design, analysis, and experimental validation of a stepped plate parametric array loudspeaker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the design and analysis of a stepped plate parametric array loudspeaker (SPPAL) as an alternative to conventional array-based parametric loudspeakers. The SPPAL utilizes a single Langevin-type ultrasonic transducer coupled with a flexural stepped plate to generate narrow-beam audible sound via nonlinear acoustic interaction. To evaluate and optimize the performance of the SPPAL, an integrated modeling framework is developed, consisting of an approximate analytical 3D model for transducer dynamics, an equivalence ratio formulation to relate stepped plate and rigid piston behavior, and a spherical wave expansion method for nonlinear sound field simulation. The dual-resonance behavior of the transducer is optimized through multi-objective analysis to enhance low-frequency audio performance. Experimental validation includes frequency response and modal analysis of the transducer, as well as sound field measurements. The analytical methods are further verified through comparison with experimental data. Furthermore, combination resonance--an unintended structural excitation resulting from intermodulation--is identified as an inherent phenomenon in SPPAL operation. The findings offer practical guidance for the development of efficient, compact, and manufacturable parametric array loudspeakers employing plate-based flexural vibration.</description>

      <title>Monolayer C$_{60}$ networks: A first-principles perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolayer fullerene (C$_{60}$) networks combine molecular-level rigidity with crystalline connectivity, offering a promising platform for numerous applications. In this Feature article, we review the physical and chemical properties of fullerene monolayers, focusing on first-principles studies. We first explore the structural stability of monolayer phases and investigate their thermal expansion behaviours. We then outline criteria for photocatalytic water splitting and introduce theoretical predictions which are supported by recent experimental verification. Finally, we show how interlayer stacking, molecular size, and dimensional tuning (from 2D monolayers into 3D crystals, 1D chains, or nanoribbons) offer versatile approaches to modulate their chemical functionality. Together, these insights establish fullerene networks as a novel class of carbon-based materials with tailored properties for catalysis, photovoltaics, and flexible electronics.</description>

      <title>Optimizing carrier balance in CsPbBr3 nanocrystal LEDs: The role of alkyl ligands and polar electron transport layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of lead halide perovskite nanocrystal based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) has advanced significantly, with notable improvements in stability and optical properties. However, optimizing charge carrier injection and transport remains a challenge. Efficient electroluminescence requires a balanced transport of both holes and electrons within the emitting material. Here, we investigate cubic CsPbBr\textsubscript{3} nanocrystals passivated with oleylamine and oleic acid, comparing them to ligand-exchanged nanocrystals with didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDABr). Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy confirm successful ligand exchange, revealing reduced ligand coverage in DDABr-treated nanocrystals. Photoelectron spectroscopy, spectroelectrochemistry, and single-carrier devices indicate improved hole injection in DDABr-capped nanocrystals. Density functional theory calculations further reveal the influence of ligand type and coverage on energy levels, with oleic acid introducing localized states in native nanocrystals. Additionally, incorporation of a polar electron transport layer (ETL) enhances LED performance by over an order of magnitude in DDABr-capped nanocrystals, driven by improved charge balance arising from the spontaneous orientation polarization (SOP) of the ETL. These findings highlight the critical role of ligand selection, passivation degree, and charge transport control by the adjacent organic transport layers in optimizing LED efficiency.</description>

      <title>Particle, kinetic and hydrodynamic models for sea ice floes. Part I: non-rotating floes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive modeling framework for the dynamics of sea ice floes using particle, kinetic, and hydrodynamic approaches. Building upon the foundational work of Ha and Tadmor on the Cucker-Smale model for flocking, we derive a Vlasov-type kinetic formulation and a corresponding hydrodynamic description. The particle model incorporates essential physical properties of sea ice floes, including size, position, velocity, and interactions governed by Newtonian mechanics. By extending these principles, the kinetic model captures large-scale features through the phase-space distribution, and we also present a hydrodynamic model using the velocity moments and a suitable closure condition. In this paper, as an idea-introductory step, we assume that ice floes are non-rotating and focus on the linear velocity dynamics. Our approach highlights the role of contact forces, ocean drag effects, and conservation laws in the multiscale description of sea ice dynamics, offering a pathway for the improved understanding and prediction of sea ice behaviors in changing climatic conditions.</description>

      <title>Benefits of Mutual Coupling in Dynamic Metasurface Antennas for Optimizing Wireless Communications -- Theory and Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are a promising embodiment of next-generation reconfigurable antenna technology to realize base stations and access points with reduced cost and power consumption. A DMA is a thin structure patterned on its front with reconfigurable radiating metamaterial elements (meta-atoms) that are excited by waveguides or cavities. Mutual coupling between the meta-atoms can result in a strongly non-linear dependence of the DMA's radiation pattern on the configuration of its meta-atoms. However, besides the obvious algorithmic challenges of working with physics-compliant DMA models, it remains unclear how mutual coupling in DMAs influences the ability to achieve a desired wireless functionality. In this paper, we provide theoretical, numerical and experimental evidence that strong mutual coupling in DMAs increases the radiation pattern sensitivity to the DMA configuration and thereby boosts the available control over the radiation pattern, improving the ability to tailor the radiation pattern to the requirements of a desired wireless functionality. Counterintuitively, we hence encourage next-generation DMA implementations to enhance (rather than suppress) mutual coupling, in combination with suitable physics-compliant modeling and optimization. We expect the unveiled mechanism by which mutual coupling boosts the radiation pattern control to also apply to other reconfigurable antenna systems based on tunable lumped elements.</description>

      <title>Lithium Tantalate Bulk Acoustic Resonator For Piezoelectric Power Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first lithium tantalate (LT) thickness-extensional (TE) mode bulk acoustic resonators designed for piezoelectric power conversion, showcasing a low temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) of -13.56 ppm/K. These resonators also exhibit high quality factors (Q) of 1698, and electromechanical coupling coefficients ($k^2$) of 8.8%, making them suitable for efficient power conversion applications. A grounded ring structure is leveraged for spurious mode-free response and figure of merit (FoM=$k^2 \times Q$) enhancement near the series resonance. The temperature dependency of Q and $k^2$ is experimentally tested over a wide temperature range, from $25^{\circ}\text{C}$ to $130^{\circ}\text{C}$, demonstrating the resonators thermal stability and consistent performance under varying conditions. This work highlights the potential of LT resonators in the future development of thermally stable power electronic systems, enabling more reliable and efficient piezoelectric power converters.</description>

Abstract: This work describes sputtered scandium aluminum nitride (ScAlN) thin-film bulk acoustic resonators (FBAR) at 12.5 GHz with high electromechanical coupling (k2) of 9.5% and quality factor (Q) of 208, resulting in a figure of merit (FoM, Qk2) of 19.8. ScAlN resonators employ a stack of 90 nm thick 20% Sc doping ScAlN piezoelectric film on the floating bottom 38 nm thick platinum (Pt) electrode to achieve low losses and high coupling toward centimeter wave (cmWave) frequency band operation. Three fabricated and FBARs are reported, show promising prospects of ScAlN-Pt stack towards cmWave front-end filters.</description>

      <title>Thermal Resilience of Suspended Thin-Film Lithium Niobate Acoustic Resonators up to 550 {\deg}C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reports a suspended thin-film lithium niobate (LN) piezoelectric resonator platform surviving high annealing temperatures of 550 {\deg}C, among the highest temperature at which the thermal resilience of suspended LN resonators is studied. Acoustic resonators are built on 600 nm thick transferred stoichiometric LN on silicon wafers with 40 nm thick platinum (Pt) electrodes, selected for high temperature operation. The fabricated resonators are first annealed at 250 {\deg}C, and the anneal temperature is incrementally increased to 550 {\deg}C after 7 rounds of annealing. The annealing is shown to upshift resonant frequencies and can increase the quality factor (Q), within a temperature range, before it gradually damages the device performance. This work presents promising results for using the suspended thin-film LN platform for resonators, sensors, and transducers in harsh thermal environments.</description>

      <title>Enhancing light emission with electric fields in polar nitride semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23591v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Significant effort has been devoted to mitigating polarization fields in nitride LEDs, as these fields are traditionally viewed as detrimental to light emission, particularly for red emission. Contrary to this prevailing notion, we demonstrate that strong polarization fields can enhance the optical-transition strength of AlInGaN quantum wells emitting in the red, which has been historically challenging to achieve. By leveraging machine-learning surrogate models trained on multi-scale quantum-mechanical simulations, we globally explore the heterostructure design space and uncover that larger fields correlate with higher electron-hole overlap. This relation arises from the quantum-confined Stark effect, which enables thinner wells without requiring higher indium compositions, thus overcoming a key limitation in nitride epitaxy. Structural and compositional engineering of internal fields offers a unique dimension for designing polychromatic nitride LEDs, crucial for miniaturizing LED pixels to the micron scale for extended-reality and biomedical applications. Broadly, our work demonstrates how machine learning can uncover unexpected paradigms for semiconductor design.</description>

      <title>A Density Functional Theory Study of Magnetic Transition in MnO2 adsorbed Vanadium Carbide (V$_2$C) MXene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The work reports nonmagnetic behavior (0.04 $\mu$B) in two-dimensional (2D) V2C-OF MXene and ferromagnetism in MnO$_2$ adsorbed V2C-OF MXene. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to study the magnetic moments of V$_2$C-OF and MnO$_2$@V$_2$C-OF MXene. The MXene, which is derived from the exfoliation of its parent V$_2$AlC MAX phase, shows a good potential to be a ferromagnetic when MnO$_2$ is adsorbed on it. The V$_2$C MXene and MnO$_2$ adsorbed V$_2$C MXene were successfully synthesized, as characterized using X-ray diffraction, showing an increased c-lattice parameter from 22.6{\AA} to 27.2{\AA} after MnO$_2$ adsorption. The DFT study confirmed that MnO$_2$ adsorbed V$_2$C MXene changed from nonmagnetic (in V$_2$C MXene) to a strong ferromagnetic with a magnetic moment of 4.48$\mu$B for Mn adsorbed V$_2$C-OF MXene. The current work is a step-forward towards understanding of magnetism in two-dimensional materials for future 2D spintronics.</description>

Abstract: Bipartite networks provide a major insight into the organisation of many real-world systems. One of the most relevant issues encountered when modelling a bipartite network is that of facing the information shortage concerning intra-layer linkages. In the present contribution, we propose an unsupervised algorithm to obtain statistically validated projections of bipartite signed networks, according to which any two nodes sharing a statistically significant number of concordant (discordant) relationships are connected by a positive (negative) edge. Our algorithm outputs a matrix of link-specific $p-$values, from which a validated projection can be obtained upon running a multiple-hypothesis testing procedure. After testing our method on synthetic configurations output by a fully controllable generative model, we apply it to several real-world configurations: in all cases, non-trivial mesoscopic structures, induced by relationships that cannot be traced back to the constraints defining the employed benchmarks, hence revealing genuine traces of self-organisation, are detected.</description>

      <title>Broadband and Ultra-Compact Adiabatic Coupler Based on Linearly Tapered Silicon Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 2x2 couplers are crucial in many photonics applications but are often wavelength-sensitive. Alternative designs could be large, complex, or lossy. We present a broadband ultra-compact adiabatic coupler with minimal coupling variation and the least silicon taper length of 1.44 um, to our best knowledge.</description>
