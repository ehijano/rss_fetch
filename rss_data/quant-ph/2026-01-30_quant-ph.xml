      <title>End-to-End Fidelity Analysis of Quantum Circuit Optimization: From Gate-Level Transformations to Pulse-Level Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of quantum circuit fidelity across the full compilation stack, from high-level gate optimization through pulse-level control. Using a modular integration framework connecting a C++ circuit optimizer with Lindblad-based pulse simulation, we systematically evaluate the fidelity impact of four optimization passes: gate cancellation, commutation, rotation merging, and identity elimination, on IQM Garnet hardware parameters. Our simulation campaign spanning 371 circuit runs reveals that gate cancellation provides the most significant improvement (68\% of circuits improved, 14,024 gates eliminated), while pulse duration exhibits the strongest negative correlation with process fidelity ($r = -0.74$, $R^2 = 0.55$). We validate these findings through hardware execution on the IQM Resonance Garnet 20-qubit processor, demonstrating 70\% gate reduction on QFT circuits with 100\% job success rate (8 executions). Our open-source framework enables reproducible benchmarking of quantum compilation pipelines.</description>

      <title>An Ontological Interpretation of Photon Wave-Particle Duality via Complex-Space Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave particle duality remains a central interpretational challenge in quantum theory. In this work, we develop a trajectory-based description of photon dynamics formulated in an extended complex space within the relativistic quantum Hamilton Jacobi framework. In this approach, photon motion is represented by complex trajectories whose real projections describe propagation, while imaginary components encode oscillatory structure. We show that momentum eigenstates correspond to straight line trajectories with uniform propagation at the speed of light, whereas superposition states lead to nontrivial quantum potentials and oscillatory motion in the complex plane. Extending the analysis to complex two dimensional space reveals richer dynamical behavior, including propagating wave like trajectories and standing wave like patterns in real projections. Energy momentum consistency is verified through an internal coherence analysis based on projected standing wave wavelengths. Rather than introducing new dynamical laws or additional physical dimensions, the complex space is employed as an interpretational framework that renders wave like and particle like aspects as complementary projections of a single underlying motion. The results suggest a unified geometric perspective on wave particle duality, while remaining fully compatible with standard quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Novel method for evaluating the eigenvalues of the Heun differential equation with an application to the Breit equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eigenvalues of the Breit equation, in which only the static Coulomb potential is considered, have been found. Over the past decades several authors have analyzed the Breit equation to obtain numerically or by approximation an estimation of the energy levels. Various approaches have been used and no determination of the energy levels currently exists that is directly based on the second order Heun differential equation derived.
  The aim of this work is to provide a method of calculation that can be used to numerically calculate the energy levels for various spin states to high accuracy.
  From the Breit equation, we derive the corresponding second-order Heun differential equation and continued fraction from which the eigenvalues can be determined very accurately. Next, we present a novel method based on the Green function method, which leads to a semi-infinite determinant from which we are able to obtain the numerical values of the eigenvalues by direct calculation.
  Using suitable numerical methods for the direct calculation of the continued fraction and the semi-infinite determinant, we show that both methods are consistent within 25 digits of accuracy. We show that the correct energy levels for the Dirac equation follow from our results by a suitable mapping of the variables.
  The results are in total agreement with earlier calculations found in the literature and extend this by several digits of additional accuracy. The condition on the determinant giving the energy levels provides a rich structure that is promising in extending the results of this work.</description>

      <title>Micro-mobility dispatch optimization via quantum annealing incorporating historical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel dispatch formulation for micro-mobility vehicles using a Quantum Annealer (QA). In recent years, QA has gained increasing attention as a high-performance solver for combinatorial optimization problems. Meanwhile, micro-mobility services have been rapidly developed as a promising means of realizing efficient and sustainable urban transportation. In this study, the dispatch problem for such micro-mobility services is formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, enabling efficient solving through QA. Furthermore, the proposed formulation incorporates historical usage data to enhance operational efficiency. Specifically, customer arrival frequencies and destination distributions are modeled into the QUBO formulation through a Bayesian approach, which guides the allocation of vacant vehicles to designated stations for waiting and charging. Simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, with comparisons to conventional formulations such as the vehicle routing problem. Additionally, the performance of QA is compared with that of classical solvers to reveal its potential advantages for the proposed dispatch formulation. The effect of reverse annealing on improving solution quality is also investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana stars, the $2S$ spin coherent states that are orthogonal to a spin-$S$ state, offer an elegant method to visualize quantum states. This representation offers deep insights into the structure, symmetries, and entanglement properties of quantum states, bridging abstract algebraic formulations with intuitive geometrical intuition. In this paper, we briefly survey the development and applications of the Majorana constellation, exploring its relevance in modern areas of quantum information.</description>

      <title>Double-Bracket Master Equations: Phase-Space Representation and Classical Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the classical limit of quantum master equations featuring double-bracket dissipators. Specifically, we consider dissipators defined by double commutators, which describe dephasing dynamics, as well as dissipators involving double anticommutators, associated with fluctuating anti-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The classical limit is obtained by formulating the open quantum dynamics in phase space using the Wigner function and Moyal products, followed by a systematic $\hbar$-expansion. We begin with the well-known model of energy dephasing, associated with energy diffusion. We then turn to master equations containing a double anticommutator with the system Hamiltonian, recently derived in the context of noisy non-Hermitian systems. For both classes of double-bracket equations, we provide a gradient-flow representation of the dynamics. We analyze the classical limit of the resulting evolutions for harmonic and driven anharmonic quantum oscillators, considering both classical and nonclassical initial states. The dynamics is characterized through the evolution of several observables as well as the Wigner logarithmic negativity. We conclude by extending our analysis to generalized master equations involving higher-order nested brackets, which provide a time-continuous description of spectral filtering techniques commonly used in the numerical analysis of quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Entangling logical qubits without physical operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant logical entangling gates are essential for scalable quantum computing, but are limited by the error rates and overheads of physical two-qubit gates and measurements. To address this limitation, we introduce phantom codes-quantum error-correcting codes that realize entangling gates between all logical qubits in a code block purely through relabelling of physical qubits during compilation, yielding perfect fidelity with no spatial or temporal overhead. We present a systematic study of such codes. First, we identify phantom codes using complementary numerical and analytical approaches. We exhaustively enumerate all $2.71 \times 10^{10}$ inequivalent CSS codes up to $n=14$ and identify additional instances up to $n=21$ via SAT-based methods. We then construct higher-distance phantom-code families using quantum Reed-Muller codes and the binarization of qudit codes. Across all identified codes, we characterize other supported fault-tolerant logical Clifford and non-Clifford operations. Second, through end-to-end noisy simulations with state preparation, full QEC cycles, and realistic physical error rates, we demonstrate scalable advantages of phantom codes over the surface code across multiple tasks. We observe a one-to-two order-of-magnitude reduction in logical infidelity at comparable qubit overhead for GHZ-state preparation and Trotterized many-body simulation tasks, given a modest preselection acceptance rate. Our work establishes phantom codes as a viable architectural route to fault-tolerant quantum computation with scalable benefits for workloads with dense local entangling structure, and introduces general tools for systematically exploring the broader landscape of quantum error-correcting codes.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Phase Transition in a Boundary-Driven Dissipative Fermionic Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a boundary-localized periodic (Floquet) drive can induce nontrivial long-range correlations in a non-interacting fermionic chain which is additionally subject to boundary dissipation. Surprisingly, we find that this phenomenon occurs even when the corresponding isolated bulk is in a trivial gapped phase with exponentially decaying correlations. We argue that this boundary-drive induced non-equilibrium transition (as witnessed through the correlation matrix) is driven by a resonance mechanism whereby the drive frequency bridges bulk energy gaps, allowing boundary-injected particles and holes to propagate and mediate long-range correlations into the bulk. We also numerically establish that when the drive bridges a particle-hole gap, the induced long-range order scales as a power law with the bulk pairing potential ($\chi \sim \gamma^2$). Our results highlight the potential of localized coherent driving for generating macroscopic order in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Spatial superposition for a two-dimensional matter-wave interferometer in an inverted harmonic potential with gyroscopic rotational stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a mathematical model of the spatial and rotational motion of a nanodiamond in an inverted harmonic potential to create a macroscopic quantum spatial superposition. The model is based on the Stern-Gerlach Interferometer (SGI) scheme, which utilises linear and quadratic magnetic fields to generate a harmonic potential (linear magnetic field) and a non-linear potential (non-linear/quadratic magnetic field). By incorporating two-dimensional dynamics into the model, we provide a more realistic and accurate depiction of nanoparticle dynamics in linear and inverted harmonic potentials and explore the interaction between motion in a two-dimensional plane. Importantly, we derive the equations of motion for the rotational degrees of freedom, i.e. libration, precession, and rotation. The results show that adding a magnetic-field bias term to the magnetic-field profile in the linear stage affects the classical equations of motion but does not affect the width of the wave packet. Moreover, the libration mode always forms a harmonic potential at each stage because the applied initial angular velocity is dominated by the nanoparticle's defect axis, making it more stable in the presence of the trap frequency in the orthogonal direction along the axis that enables the creation of a macroscopic quantum superposition.</description>

      <title>Parametric Quantum State Tomography with HyperRBMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is essential for validating quantum devices but suffers from exponential scaling in system size. Neural-network quantum states, such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), can efficiently parameterize individual many-body quantum states and have been successfully used for QST. However, existing approaches are point-wise and require retraining at every parameter value in a phase diagram. We introduce a parametric QST framework based on a hypernetwork that conditions an RBM on Hamiltonian control parameters, enabling a single model to represent an entire family of quantum ground states. Applied to the transverse-field Ising model, our HyperRBM achieves high-fidelity reconstructions from local Pauli measurements on 1D and 2D lattices across both phases and through the critical region. Crucially, the model accurately reproduces the fidelity susceptibility and identifies the quantum phase transition without prior knowledge of the critical point. These results demonstrate that hypernetwork-modulated neural quantum states provide an efficient and scalable route to tomographic reconstruction across full phase diagrams.</description>

      <title>Quantum metrology enhanced by effective time reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum metrology involves the application of quantum resources to enhance measurements. Several communities have developed quantum-metrology strategies that leverage effective time reversals. These strategies, we posit, form four classes. First, echo metrology begins with a preparatory unitary and ends with that unitary's time-reverse. The protocol amplifies the visibility of a small parameter to be sensed. Similarly, weak-value amplification enhances a weak coupling's detectability. The technique exhibits counterintuitive properties captured by a retrocausal model. Using the third strategy, one simulates closed timelike curves, worldlines that loop back on themselves in time. The fourth strategy involves indefinite causal order, which characterises channels applied in a superposition of orderings. We review these four strategies, which we unify under the heading of time-reverse metrology. We also outline opportunities for this toolkit in quantum metrology; quantum information science; quantum foundations; atomic, molecular, and optical physics; and solid-state physics.</description>

      <title>Universal Topological Gates from Braiding and Fusing Anyons on Quantum Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological quantum computation encodes quantum information in the internal fusion space of non-Abelian anyonic quasiparticles, whose braiding implements logical gates. This goes beyond Abelian topological order (TO) such as the toric code, as its anyons lack internal structure. However, the simplest non-Abelian generalizations of the toric code do not support universality via braiding alone. Here we demonstrate that such minimally non-Abelian TOs can be made universal by treating anyon fusion as a computational primitive. We prepare a 54-qubit TO wavefunction associated with the smallest non-Abelian group, $S_3$, on Quantinuum's H2 quantum processor. This phase of matter exhibits cyclic anyon fusion rules, known to underpin universality, which we evidence by trapping a single non-Abelian anyon on the torus. We encode logical qutrits in the nonlocal fusion space of non-Abelian fluxes and, by combining an entangling braiding operation with anyon charge measurements, realize a universal topological gate set and read-out, which we further demonstrate by topologically preparing a magic state. This work establishes $S_3$ TO as simple enough to be prepared efficiently, yet rich enough to enable universal topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Active polarization stabilization of fields in an optical fiber for protective measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed Zeno protective measurements of quantum polarization states by coupling the polarization to a temporal pointer (arrival time) in a birefringent optical fiber. It is necessary to actively stabilize the polarization, and we do this by using the signal photon counts themselves as the error signal in a feedback loop. We compare these measurements to a stabilization scheme using a classical reference beam as the error signal. The method using photon counts has higher signal levels and significantly reduced background. These improvements allow us to increase the number of Zeno stages in our measurements from 9 to 13, with a corresponding decrease in the measurement uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Polaron-Polaritons in Subwavelength Arrays of Trapped Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subwavelength arrays of atoms trapped in optical lattices or tweezers are inherently susceptible to deformations: Optomechanical forces produce lattice distortions, which, in turn, modify the optical response of the array. We show that this coupling hybridizes collective atomic excitations (polaritons) with phonons, forming polaron-polaritons -- the fundamental quasiparticles governing light-matter interactions in arrays of trapped atoms. Using analytical polaron theory and numerical simulations, we show that: (1) phonons can strongly enhance the decay of subradiant states, but also enable their efficient excitation; (2) transport of dark excitations remains remarkably robust even at low trap frequencies, except when a polariton can resonantly scatter phonons; and (3) motion reduces the reflectivity of a two-dimensional atomic mirror, however, we identify mechanisms that mitigate this degradation and restore reflectivity above 99% in some cases. Our findings lay the foundation for analyzing motional effects in key applications and suggest new ways to harness them in state-of-the-art experiments.</description>

      <title>Building Holographic Entanglement by Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for preparing quantum states with a holographic entanglement structure, in the sense that the entanglement entropies are governed by minimal surfaces in a chosen bulk geometry. We refer to such entropies as holographic because they obey a relation between entropies and bulk minimal surfaces, known as the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, that is a key feature of holographic models of quantum gravity. Typically in such models, the bulk geometry is determined by solving Einstein's equations. Here, we simply choose a bulk geometry, then discretize the geometry into a coupling graph comprising bulk and boundary nodes. Evolving under this graph of interactions and measuring the bulk nodes leaves behind the desired pure state on the boundary. We numerically demonstrate that the resulting entanglement properties approximately reproduce the predictions of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula in the chosen bulk geometry. We consider graphs associated with hyperbolic disk and wormhole geometries, but the approach is general. The minimal ingredients in our proposal involve only Gaussian operations and measurements and are readily implementable in photonic and cold-atom platforms.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Casimir effect under the action of gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several nontrivial phenomena emerge when a quantum field is subjected to dynamical perturbations, with prominent examples including the Hawking and Unruh effects, as well as the dynamical Casimir effect. In this work, we compute the number of particles produced via the dynamical Casimir effect in an ideal cavity, where one of the mirrors is allowed to move under the influence of a gravitational wave. Assuming an oscillatory mirror motion and a plane gravitational wave, we identify the resonance conditions that lead to an exponential increase in the number of created particles through parametric amplification.</description>

      <title>A levitated nano-accelerometer sensitized by quantum quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We realize a nanoscale accelerometer exploiting the nonequilibrium dynamics of a nanoparticle near the quantum ground state. We explore the dynamics after quenching the trapping potential and find that rapid quenching provides an instance at which the sensitivity is enhanced due to the minimized uncertainty in the position. With rapid quenching, the observed sensitivity is in good agreement with a numerical simulation based on the quantum Langevin equation and approaches to the limit given by the quantum Fisher information. Our results open up a pathway to quantum inertial sensing sensitized by exploiting quench dynamics.</description>

      <title>Hidden-Field Coordination Reveals Payoff-Free Quantum Correlation Structure in Decentralized Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study decentralized multi-agent coordination where agents must correlate actions against an unobserved field and cannot communicate. To isolate correlation geometry from payoff optimization, we introduce the Hidden-Field Coordination (HFC) model, which enforces identical information access and no-signaling constraints across strategies. Using information-theoretic diagnostics, we compare classical shared-randomness baselines with an entanglement-mediated strategy based on multipartite W states and a strictly local Spontaneous Leader Election rule. Within the restricted symmetric shared-latent baseline studied here, increasing total correlation is achieved primarily by driving actions toward alignment (copying), which also increases pairwise coincidence (collisions). By contrast, the quantum strategy realizes a collision-suppressing coordination regime: it preserves global dependence while reducing pairwise coincidence below the independent (product) baseline induced by the common marginal distribution. This produces a geometric separation in the joint-action distribution. Classical baselines concentrate probability near the diagonal of action equality, whereas the entanglement-mediated mapping occupies an offset-diagonal region associated with relational roles. Accordingly, the entanglement signature in this setting is not higher correlation magnitude; total-correlation differentials can be negative relative to the classical copying optimum. Instead, it reflects a change in dependence geometry that supports robust anti-coordination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish efficient algorithms for weakly-interacting quantum spin systems at arbitrary temperature. In particular, we obtain a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the partition function and an efficient approximate sampling scheme for the thermal distribution over a classical spin space. Our approach is based on the cluster expansion method and a standard reduction from approximate sampling to approximate counting.</description>

      <title>Community detection in network using Szegedy quantum walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a network, the vertices with similar characteristics construct communities. The vertices in a community are well-connected. Detecting the communities in a network is a challenging and important problem in the theory of complex networks. One approach to solve this problem uses the classical random walks on the graphs. In quantum computing, quantum walks are the quantum mechanical counterparts of classical random walks. In this article, we employ a variant of Szegedy's quantum walk to develop a procedure for discovering the communities in networks. The limiting probability distribution of quantum walks assists us in determining the inclusion of a vertex in a community. We apply our procedure of community detection on a number of graphs and social networks, such as the relaxed caveman graph, $l$-partition graph, Karate club graph, dolphin's social network, etc.</description>

      <title>Reflecting boundary induced modulation of tripartite coherence harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the extraction of quantum coherence by three static Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors that interact locally with a massless scalar vacuum field in the vicinity of an infinite perfectly reflecting boundary. Depending on the setup, the detectors are positioned either parallel or orthogonal to the boundary, with their energy gaps chosen to satisfy the hierarchy $\Omega_C\geq \Omega_B\geq \Omega_A$. Our analysis reveals that decreasing the detector-boundary separation leads to a monotonic degradation of quantum coherence, whereas the same boundary effect can simultaneously preserve and even amplify the harvested quantum entanglement. Moreover, when the detectors possess distinct energy gaps, coherence extraction is further inhibited; strikingly, such non-identical configurations substantially enhance the efficiency of entanglement harvesting and markedly extend the range of detector separations over which non-negligible entanglement can be generated. Nevertheless, the harvesting of nonlocal quantum coherence is achievable over a significantly broader range of detector separations than that of quantum entanglement. Despite exhibiting similar overall behavior, orthogonal detector configurations outperform parallel ones in coherence harvesting, highlighting the quantitative influence of detector geometry. Overall, our study reveals a hierarchical distinction between quantum coherence and entanglement as operational resources in structured vacuum fields: quantum coherence is not only more readily accessible across space but also more robust than entanglement, whereas entanglement exhibits richer features and can be selectively activated and enhanced through boundary effects and detector non-uniformity.</description>

      <title>3D imaging of the biphoton spatiotemporal wave packet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photons are among the most important carriers of quantum information owing to their rich degrees of freedom (DoFs), including various spatiotemporal structures. The ability to characterize these DoFs, as well as the hidden correlations among them, directly determines whether they can be exploited for quantum tasks. While various methods have been developed for measuring the spatiotemporal structure of classical light fields, owing to the technical challenges posed by weak photon flux, there have so far been no reports of observing such structures in their quantum counterparts, except for a few studies limited to correlations within individual DoFs. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a self-referenced, high-efficiency, and all-optical method, termed 3D imaging of photonic wave packets, for comprehensive characterization of the spatiotemporal structure of a quantum light field, i.e., the biphoton spatiotemporal wave packet. Benefiting from this developed method, we successfully observe the spatial-spatial, spectral-spectral, and spatiotemporal correlations of biphotons generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion, revealing rich local and nonlocal spatiotemporal structure in quantum light fields. This method will further advance the understanding of the dynamics in nonlinear quantum optics and expand the potential of photons for applications in quantum communication and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Sampling methods to describe superradiance in large ensembles of quantum emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superradiance is a quantum phenomenon in which coherence between emitters results in enhanced and directional radiative emission. Many quantum optical phenomena can be characterized by the two-time quantum correlation function $g^{(2)}(t,\tau)$, which describes the photon statistics of emitted radiation. However, the critical task of determining $g^{(2)}(t,\tau)$ becomes intractable for large emitter ensembles due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the number of emitters. Here, we analyse and benchmark two approximate numerical sampling methods applicable to emitter arrays embedded within electromagnetic environments, which generally provide upper and lower bounds for $g^{(2)}(t,0)$. We also introduce corrections to these methods (termed offset corrections) that significantly improve the quality of the predictions. The optimal choice of method depends on the total number of emitters, such that taken together, the two approaches provide accurate descriptions across a broad range of important regimes. This work therefore provides new theoretical tools for studying the well-known yet complex phenomenon of superradiance in large ensembles of quantum emitters.</description>

      <title>Localization and scattering of a photon in quasiperiodic qubit arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the localization and scattering of a single photon in a waveguide coupled to qubit arrays with quasiperiodic spacings. As the quasiperiodic strength increases, localized subradiant states with extremely long lifetime appear around the resonant frequency and form a continuum band. In stark contrast to the fully disordered waveguide QED where all states are localized, we analytically find that the fraction of localized states is up to $(3-\sqrt{5})/2$ when the modulation frequency is $(1+\sqrt{5})/2$. The localized and delocalized states can be related to excitation in flat and curved inverse energy bands under the approximation of large-period modulation. When the quasiperiodic strength is weak, an extended subradiant state can support the transmission of a photon. However, as the quasiperiodic strength increases, localized subradiant states can completely block the transmission of a single photon in resonance with the subradiant states, and enhance the overall reflection. At a fixed quasiperiodic strength, we also find mobility edge in transmission spectrum, below and above which the transmission is either turned on and off as system size increases. Our work give new insights into the localization in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

Abstract: We develop an information-theoretic analysis of Quantum-Memory-Free (QMF) Quantum Secure Direct Communication (QSDC) under collective attacks as an alternative to the conventional Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol with one-time pads. Our main contributions are: 1) a QMF-QSDC protocol that only relies on universal hashing of coded sequences without wiretap coding; 2) a set of privacy amplification theorems for extracting secrecy from coded classical sequences against quantum side-information. These tools open the way to the design of robust QMF-QSDC protocols.</description>

      <title>QCL-IDS: Quantum Continual Learning for Intrusion Detection with Fidelity-Anchored Stability and Generative Replay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual intrusion detection must absorb newly emerging attack stages while retaining legacy detection capability under strict operational constraints, including bounded compute and qubit budgets and privacy rules that preclude long-term storage of raw telemetry. We propose QCL-IDS, a quantum-centric continual-learning framework that co-designs stability and privacy-governed rehearsal for NISQ-era pipelines. Its core component, Q-FISH (Quantum Fisher Anchors), enforces retention using a compact anchor coreset through (i) sensitivity-weighted parameter constraints and (ii) a fidelity-based functional anchoring term that directly limits decision drift on representative historical traffic. To regain plasticity without retaining sensitive flows, QCL-IDS further introduces privacy-preserved quantum generative replay (QGR) via frozen, task-conditioned generator snapshots that synthesize bounded rehearsal samples. Across a three-stage attack stream on UNSW-NB15 and CICIDS2017, QCL-IDS consistently attains the best retention-adaptation trade-off: the gradient-anchor configuration achieves mean Attack-F1 = 0.941 with forgetting = 0.005 on UNSW-NB15 and mean Attack-F1 = 0.944 with forgetting = 0.004 on CICIDS2017, versus 0.800/0.138 and 0.803/0.128 for sequential fine-tuning, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover the global topological phase diagram of one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks driven by Fibonacci-modulated coin parameters. Utilizing the mean chiral displacement (MCD) as dynamical probe, we identify robust topological phases defined by a strictly quantized winding number $\nu=-1$ and exponentially localized edge states. Crucially, we discover that these topological edge modes emerges not only at zero energy but also at the quasienergy zone boundary $E=\pi$, exhibiting identical localization robustness despite the fractal nature of the bulk spectrum. These results demonstrate that Floquet topological protection remains intact amidst quasiperiodic disorder, offering a concrete route to observing exotic non-equilibrium phases in photonic experiments.</description>

      <title>A general framework for interactions between electron beams and quantum optical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a theoretical framework to describe the dynamics of a free-electron beam interacting with quantized bound systems in arbitrary electromagnetic environments. This expands the quantum optics toolbox to incorporate free-electron beams for applications in highly tunable quantum control, imaging, and spectroscopy at the nanoscale. The framework recovers previously studied results and shows that electromagnetic environments can amplify the intrinsically weak coupling between a free-electron and a bound electron to reach previously inaccessible interaction regimes. We leverage this enhanced coupling for experimentally feasible protocols in coherent qubit control and towards the nondestructive readout and projective control of the electron beam's quantum-number statistics. Our framework is broadly applicable to microwave-frequency qubits, optical nanophotonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics, and emerging platforms at the interface of electron microscopy and quantum information.</description>

      <title>Quantum steering probes energy transfer in quantum batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the role of EPR steering in characterizing the energy dynamics of quantum batteries (QBs) within \textcolor{black}{a charging system that features shared reservoirs. After optimizing parameter configurations to achieve high-energy systems, we observe across a variety of charging scenarios with low-dissipation regimes that steering serves as a vital resource: it is initially stored until the system reaches energy equilibrium, and then subsequently utilized to sustain the enhancement of energy storage. Furthermore, steering acts as a witness to battery population balance and a consumable that enhances extractable work. Additionally, we discuss the contribution of the steering potential to energy upon high-dissipation charging in details. These findings establish a novel indicator for monitoring QB energy variations, which will be beneficial to achieve the high-performance quantum batteries.</description>

Abstract: We propose an optimized adiabatic-impulse (OAI) protocol that achieves much shorter evolution time while preserving the Kibble-Zurek scaling. Near the critical regime, the control field is linearly ramped across the quantum critical point at a rate characterized by a quench time $\tau_Q$. Away from the critical regime, the evolution is designed to follow the threshold of adiabatic breakdown, which we characterize by an adiabatic coefficient $\zeta\propto\tau_Q^\alpha$. As a consequence, the total evolution time exhibits a sublinear power-law dependence on $\tau_Q$, and the conventional linear quench protocol is recovered in the limit $\alpha\rightarrow\infty$. We apply the OAI protocol to the transverse Ising chain and numerically determine the minimum value of $\zeta$. We further investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics in the presence of a noisy field that can induce anti-Kibble-Zurek behavior, leading to more defects for slower ramps. Within the OAI protocol, the optimal quench time that minimizes defects obeys an altered universal power-law scaling with the noise strength. Finally, we generalize the OAI protocol to incorporate nonlinear Kibble-Zurek scaling.</description>

      <title>In-situ benchmarking of fault-tolerant quantum circuits. I. Clifford circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarking physical devices and verifying logical algorithms are important tasks for scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing. Numerous protocols exist for benchmarking devices before running actual algorithms. In this work, we show that both physical and logical errors of fault-tolerant circuits can even be characterized in-situ using syndrome data. To achieve this, we map general fault-tolerant Clifford circuits to subsystem codes using the spacetime code formalism and develop a scheme for estimating Pauli noise in Clifford circuits using syndrome data. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the learnability of physical and logical noise from given syndrome data, and show that we can accurately predict logical fidelities from the same data. Importantly, our approach requires only a polynomial sample size, even when the logical error rate is exponentially suppressed by the code distance, and thus gives an exponential advantage against methods that use only logical data such as direct fidelity estimation. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our methods in various scenarios using synthetic data as well as the experimental data from a recent demonstration of fault-tolerant circuits by Bluvstein et al. [Nature 626, 7997 (2024)]. Our methods provide an efficient, in-situ way of characterizing a fault-tolerant quantum computer to help gate calibration, improve decoding accuracy, and verify logical circuits.</description>

      <title>RF-free driving of nuclear spins with color centers in silicon carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color centers that enable nuclear-spin control without RF fields offer a powerful route towards simplified and scalable quantum devices. Such capabilities are especially valuable for quantum sensing and computing platforms that already find applications in biology, materials science, and geophysics. A key challenge is the coherent manipulation of nearby nuclear spins, which serve as quantum memories and auxiliary qubits but conventionally require additional high-power RF fields which increase the experimental complexity and overall power consumption. Finding systems where both electron and nuclear spins can be controlled using a single MW source is therefore highly desirable. Here, using a modified divacancy center in silicon carbide, we show that coherent control of a coupled nuclear spin is possible without any RF fields. Instead, MW pulses driving the electron spin also manipulate the nuclear spin through hyperfineenhanced effects, activated by a precisely tilted external magnetic field. We demonstrate high-fidelity nuclear-spin control, achieving 89% two-qubit tomography fidelity and nearly T1-limited nuclear coherence times. This approach offers a simplified and scalable route for future quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation with Fluxonium Qutrit Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluxonium superconducting circuits were originally proposed to realize highly coherent qubits. In this work, we explore how these circuits can be used to implement and harness qutrits, by tuning their energy levels and matrix elements via an external flux bias. In particular, we investigate the distinctive features of arrays of fluxonium qutrits, and their potential for the quantum simulation of exotic quantum matter. We identify four different operational regimes, classified according to the plasmon-like versus fluxon-like nature of the qutrit excitations. Highly tunable on-site interactions are complemented by correlated single-particle hopping, pair hopping and non-local interactions, which naturally emerge and have different weights in the four regimes. Dispersive corrections and decoherence are also analyzed. We investigate the rich ground-state phase diagram of qutrit arrays and propose practical dynamical experiments to probe the different regimes. Altogether, fluxonium qutrit arrays emerge as a versatile and experimentally accessible platform to explore strongly correlated bosonic matter beyond the Bose-Hubbard paradigm, and with a potential toward simulating lattice gauge theories and non-Abelian topological states.</description>

      <title>High-Coherence and High-frequency Quantum Computing: The Design of a High-Frequency, High-Coherence and Scalable Quantum Computing Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-coherence, fault-tolerant and scalable quantum computing architectures with unprecedented long coherence times, faster gates, low losses and low bit-flip errors may be one of the only ways forward to achieve the true quantum advantage. In this context, high-frequency high-coherence (HCQC) qubits with new high-performance topologies could be a significant step towards efficient and high-fidelity quantum computing by facilitating compact size, higher scalability and higher than conventional operating temperatures. Although transmon type qubits are designed and manufactured routinely in the range of a few Giga-Hertz, normally from 4 to 6 GHz (and, at times, up to around 10GHz), achieving higher-frequency operation has challenges and entails special design and manufacturing considerations. This report presents the proposal and preliminary design of an 8-qubit transmon (with possible upgrade to up to 72 qubits on a chip) architecture working beyond an operation frequency of 10GHz, as well as presents a new connection topology. The current design spans a range of around 11 to 13.5 GHz (with a possible full range of 9-12GHz at the moment), with a central optimal operating frequency of 12.0 GHz, with the aim to possibly achieve a stable, compact and low-charge-noise operation, as lowest as possible as per the existing fabrication techniques. The aim is to achieve average relaxation times of up to 1.9ms with average quality factors of up to 2.75 x 10^7 after trials, while exploiting the new advances in superconducting junction manufacturing using tantalum and niobium/aluminum/aluminum oxide tri-layer structures on high-resistivity silicon substrates (carried out elsewhere by other groups and referred in this report).</description>

      <title>Cooperative Emission from Quantum Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective light emission from many-body quantum systems is a cornerstone of quantum optics, yet its implementation in solid-state platforms operating under ambient conditions remains highly challenging. Large-bandgap van der Waals materials such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) host stable room-temperature single-photon emitters with narrow linewidths across a broad spectral range. However, cooperative radiative effects in this system have not been previously explored. Here we demonstrate collective emission from quantum-emitter ensembles in hBN layers when the emitters are nearly indistinguishable and positioned within a sub-wavelength proximity. Using confocal microscopy and a Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) configuration, we identify both isolated emitters and ensembles activated by localized electron-beam irradiation. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal a superlinear intensity enhancement and a pronounced acceleration of the radiative decay in tightly confined ensembles, with lifetimes approaching the temporal resolution of our experimental system (about 500 ps), compared to approximately 1.85 ns for single emitters or large, spatially extended ensembles. Complementary second-order photon-correlation measurements exhibit sub-Poissonian antidip consistent with emission from a few indistinguishable emitters. The simultaneous observation of lifetime shortening and enhanced emission provides direct evidence of cooperative emission at room temperature, achieved without optical cavities or cryogenic cooling. These results establish optically active defect ensembles in hBN as a scalable solid-state platform for engineered collective quantum optics in two-dimensional materials, opening avenues toward ultrabright superradiant light sources and nonclassical photonic states for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of quantum systems via a classical mediator in hybrid van Hove theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a matter of ongoing discussion whether quantum states can become entangled while only interacting via a classical mediator. This lively debate is deeply interwoven with the question of whether entanglement studies can prove the quantum nature of gravity. However, the answer to this fundamental question depends crucially on which hybrid quantum-classical theory is used. In this letter, we demonstrate that entanglement by a classical mediator is possible within the framework of hybrid van Hove theory, showing that existing no-go theorems on that matter do not universally apply to hybrid theories in general. After briefly recapitulating the key features of the hybrid van Hove theory, we show this using the example of two quantum spins coupled by a classical harmonic oscillator. By deriving the spin density matrix for this scenario and comparing it to its equivalent for a pure quantum system, we show that entanglement between the two spins is generated in both cases. Conclusively, this is illustrated by presenting the purity and concurrence of the spin-spin system as a decisive measure for entanglement. Our results further imply that quantum entanglement studies cannot rule out consistent quantum theories featuring classical gravity.</description>

      <title>A biased-erasure cavity qubit with hardware-efficient quantum error detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erasure qubits are beneficial for quantum error correction due to their relaxed threshold requirements. While dual-rail erasure qubits have been demonstrated with a strong error hierarchy in circuit quantum electrodynamics, biased-erasure qubits -- where erasures originate predominantly from one logical basis state -- offer further advantages. Here, we realize a hardware-efficient biased-erasure qubit encoded in the vacuum and two-photon Fock states of a single microwave cavity. The qubit exhibits an erasure bias ratio of over 265. By using a transmon ancilla for logical measurements and mid-circuit erasure detections, we achieve logical state assignment errors below 1% and convert over 99.3% leakage errors into detected erasures. After postselection against erasures, we achieve effective logical relaxation and dephasing rates of $(6.2~\mathrm{ms})^{-1}$ and $(3.1~\mathrm{ms})^{-1}$, respectively, which exceed the erasure error rate by factors of 31 and 15, establishing a strong error hierarchy within the logical subspace. These postselected error rates indicate a coherence gain of about 6.0 beyond the break-even point set by the best physical qubit encoded in the two lowest Fock states in the cavity. Moreover, randomized benchmarking with interleaved erasure detections reveals a residual logical gate error of 0.29%. This work establishes a compact and hardware-efficient platform for biased-erasure qubits, promising concatenations into outer-level stabilizer codes toward fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Composition of Quantum Circuit Optimisation Passes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many quantum software development kits provide a suite of circuit optimisation passes. These passes have been highly optimised and tested in isolation. However, the order in which they are applied is left to the user, or else defined in general-purpose default pass sequences. While general-purpose sequences miss opportunities for optimisation which are particular to individual circuits, designing pass sequences bespoke to particular circuits requires exceptional knowledge about quantum circuit design and optimisation. Here we propose and demonstrate training a reinforcement learning agent to compose optimisation-pass sequences. In particular the agent's action space consists of passes for two-qubit gate count reduction used in default PyTKET pass sequences. For the circuits in our diverse test set, the (mean, median) fraction of two-qubit gates removed by the agent is $(57.7\%, \ 56.7 \%)$, compared to $(41.8 \%, \ 50.0 \%)$ for the next best default pass sequence.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical quantum decoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoders are a critical component of fault-tolerant quantum computing. They must identify errors based on syndrome measurements to correct quantum states. While finding the optimal correction is NP-hard and thus extremely difficult, approximate decoders with faster runtime often rely on uncontrolled heuristics. In this work, we propose a family of hierarchical quantum decoders with a tunable trade-off between speed and accuracy while retaining guarantees of optimality. We use the Lasserre Sum-of-Squares (SOS) hierarchy from optimization theory to relax the decoding problem. This approach creates a sequence of Semidefinite Programs (SDPs). Lower levels of the hierarchy are faster but approximate, while higher levels are slower but more accurate. We demonstrate that even low levels of this hierarchy significantly outperform standard Linear Programming relaxations. Our results on rotated surface codes and honeycomb color codes show that the SOS decoder approaches the performance of exact decoding. We find that Levels 2 and 3 of our hierarchy perform nearly as well as the exact solver. We analyze the convergence using rank-loop criteria and compare the method against other relaxation schemes. This work bridges the gap between fast heuristics and rigorous optimal decoding.</description>

      <title>Quantum Random Features: A Spectral Framework for Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) models often require deep, parameterized circuits to capture complex frequency components, limiting their scalability and near-term implementation. We introduce \textit{Quantum Random Features} (QRF) and \textit{Quantum Dynamical Random Features} (QDRF), lightweight quantum reservoir models inspired by classical random Fourier features (RFF) that generate high-dimensional spectral representations without variational optimization. Using $Z$-rotation encoding combined with random permutations or Hamiltonian dynamics, these models achieve $N_f$-dimensional feature maps at preprocessing cost $O(\log(N_f))$. Spectral analysis shows that QRF and QDRF reproduce the behavior of RFF, while simulations on Fashion-MNIST reach up to 89.3\% accuracy-matching or surpassing classical baselines with scalable qubit requirements. By linking spectral theory with experimentally feasible quantum dynamics, this work provides a compact and hardware-compatible route to scalable quantum learning.</description>

      <title>A geometric criterion for optimal measurements in multiparameter quantum metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining when the multiparameter quantum Cram\'er--Rao bound (QCRB) is saturable with experimentally relevant single-copy measurements is a central open problem in quantum metrology. Here we establish an equivalence between QCRB saturation and the simultaneous hollowization of a set of traceless operators associated with the estimation model, i.e., the existence of complete (generally nonorthogonal) bases in which all corresponding diagonal matrix elements vanish. This formulation yields a geometric characterization: optimal rank-one measurement vectors are confined to a subspace orthogonal to a state-determined Hermitian span. This provides a direct criterion to construct optimal Positive Operator-Valued Measures(POVMs). We then identify conditions under which the partial commutativity condition proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 100, 032104(2019)] becomes necessary and sufficient for the saturation of the QCRB, demonstrate that this condition is not always sufficient, and prove the counter-intuitive uselessness of informationally-complete POVMs.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a principle, implicitly contained in Schroedinger's paper (Schr35), which allows a proof of the non-existence of the EPR-locality paradox in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. The paradox is shown to be well-posed already in the simplest example of an entangled state of two spins one-half, independently of the (well-taken) objections by Araki and Yanase that the measurement of spin is not a local measurement. We assume that any measurement results in the collapse of the wave-packet.</description>

      <title>Error-detectable Universal Control for High-Gain Bosonic Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protecting quantum information through quantum error correction (QEC) is a cornerstone of future fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, current QEC-protected logical qubits have only achieved coherence times about twice those of their best physical constituents. Here, we show that the primary barrier to higher QEC gains is ancilla-induced operational errors rather than intrinsic cavity coherence. To overcome this bottleneck, we introduce error-detectable universal control of bosonic modes, wherein ancilla relaxation events are detected and the corresponding trajectories discarded, thereby suppressing operational errors on logical qubits. For binomial codes, we demonstrate universal gates with fidelities exceeding $99.6\%$ and QEC gains of $8.33\times$ beyond break-even. Our results establish that gains beyond $10\times$ are achievable with state-of-the-art devices, establishing a path toward fault-tolerant bosonic quantum computing.</description>

      <title>A Bravyi-K\"onig theorem for Floquet codes generated by locally conjugate instantaneous stabiliser groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bravyi-K\"onig (BK) theorem is an important no-go theorem for the dynamics of topological stabiliser quantum error correcting codes. It states that any logical operation on a $D$-dimensional topological stabiliser code that can be implemented by a short-depth circuit acts on the codespace as an element of the $D$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy. In recent years, a new type of quantum error correcting codes based on Pauli stabilisers, dubbed Floquet codes, has been introduced. In Floquet codes, syndrome measurements are arranged such that they dynamically generate a codespace at each time step. Here, we show that the BK theorem holds for a definition of Floquet codes based on locally conjugate stabiliser groups. Moreover, we introduce and define a class of generalised unitaries in Floquet codes that need not preserve the codespace at each time step, but that combined with the measurements constitute a valid logical operation. We derive a canonical form of these generalised unitaries and show that the BK theorem holds for them too.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of covert communication over the entanglement-assisted (EA) bosonic multiple access channel (MAC). We derive a closed-form achievable rate region for the general EA bosonic MAC using high-order phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the low-photon regime the capacity region collapses into a rectangle, asymptotically matching the point-to-point capacity as multi-user interference vanishes. We also characterize an achievable covert throughput region, showing that entanglement assistance enables an aggregate throughput scaling of \(O(\sqrt{n} \log n)\) covert bits with the block length $n$ for both senders, surpassing the square-root law as in the point-to-point case. Our analysis reveals that the joint covertness constraint imposes a linear trade-off between the senders throughput.</description>

      <title>Rapid high-temperature initialisation and readout of spins in silicon with 10 THz photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Each cycle of a quantum computation requires a quantum state initialisation. For semiconductor-based quantum platforms, initialisation is typically performed via slow microwave processes and usually requires cooling to temperatures where only the lowest quantum level is occupied. In silicon, boron atoms are the most common impurities. They bind holes in orbitals including an effective spin-3/2 ground state as well as excited states analogous to the Rydberg series for hydrogen. Here we show that initialisation temperature demands may be relaxed and speeds increased over a thousand-fold by importing, from atomic physics, the procedure of optical pumping via excited orbital states to preferentially occupy a target ground state spin. Spin relaxation within the orbital ground state of unstrained silicon is too fast to measure for conventional pulsed microwave technology, except at temperatures below 2 K, implying a need not only for fast state preparation but also fast state readout. Circularly polarised ~10 THz photon pulses from a free electron laser meet both needs at temperatures above 3 K: a 9 ps pulse enhances the population of one spin eigenstate for the "1s"-like ground state orbital, and the second interrogates this imbalance in spin population. Using parameters given by our data, we calculate that it should be possible to initialise 99% of spins for boron in strained silicon within 250 ps at 3 K. The speedup of both state preparation and measurement gained for THz rather than microwave photons should be explored for the many other solid state quantum systems hosting THz excitations potentially useful as intermediate states.</description>

      <title>A scalable quantum-enhanced greedy algorithm for maximum independent set problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem on regular graphs, combining the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) with a minimal degree classical greedy algorithm. The method leverages pre-computed QAOA angles, derived from depth-$p$ QAOA circuits on regular trees, to compute local expectation values and inform sequential greedy decisions that progressively build an independent set. This hybrid approach maintains shallow quantum circuit and avoids instance-specific parameter training, making it well-suited for implementation on current quantum hardware: we have implemented the algorithm on a 20 qubit IQM superconducting device to find independent sets in graphs with thousands of nodes. We perform tensor network simulations to evaluate the performance of the algorithm beyond the reach of current quantum hardware and compare to established classical heuristics. Our results show that even at low depth ($p=4$), the quantum-enhanced greedy method significantly outperforms purely classical greedy baselines as well as more sophisticated approximation algorithms. The modular structure of the algorithm and relatively low quantum resource requirements make it a compelling candidate for scalable, hybrid optimization in the NISQ era and beyond.</description>

      <title>Entropy production versus memory effects in two-level open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare several definitions of entropy production rate introduced in the literature from a large variety of situations and motivations, and then analyze their relations with memory effects. Considering a relevant experimental example of a qubit interacting with a single bosonic mode playing the role of a finite bath, we show that all definitions of entropy production coincide at weak coupling. In the strong coupling regime, significant discrepancies emerge between the different entropy production rates, although some similarities in the overall behaviour remain. However, surprisingly, two of these definitions -- one based on local quantities of the system and the other on non-local quantities -- coincide exactly, even in the case of strong coupling. Finally, a high degree of correspondence is observed when memory effects characterized by P-divisibility are compared with the sign of all entropy production rates in the case of weak coupling. Such correspondence degrades at strong coupling, leading us to extend the concept of entropy production to the dynamical map. We show a perfect equivalence between the sign of this enlarged concept of entropy production and P-divisibility, both numerically and analytically, in the case of phase-covariant master equations.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of discriminative power and complexity in learning quantum ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distance metrics are central to machine learning, yet distances between ensembles of quantum states remain poorly understood due to fundamental quantum measurement constraints. We introduce a hierarchy of integral probability metrics, termed MMD-$k$, which generalizes the maximum mean discrepancy to quantum ensembles and exhibit a strict trade-off between discriminative power and statistical efficiency as the moment order $k$ increases. For pure-state ensembles of size $N$, estimating MMD-$k$ using experimentally feasible SWAP-test-based estimators requires $\Theta(N^{2-2/k})$ samples for constant $k$, and $\Theta(N^3)$ samples to achieve full discriminative power at $k = N$. In contrast, the quantum Wasserstein distance attains full discriminative power with $\Theta(N^2 \log N)$ samples. These results provide principled guidance for the design of loss functions in quantum machine learning, which we illustrate in the training quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic models.</description>

      <title>Machine learning with minimal use of quantum computers: Provable advantages in Learning Under Quantum Privileged Information (LUQPI)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is often listed as a promising candidate for useful applications of quantum computers, in part due to numerous proofs of possible quantum advantages. A central question is how small a role quantum computers can play while still enabling provable learning advantages over classical methods. We study an especially restricted setting in which a quantum computer is used only as a feature extractor: it acts independently on individual data points, without access to labels or global dataset information, is available only to augment the training set, and is not available at deployment. Training and deployment are therefore carried out by fully classical learners on a dataset augmented with quantum-generated features. We formalize this model by adapting the classical framework of Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI) to the quantum case, which we call Learning Under Quantum Privileged Information (LUQPI). Within this framework, we show that even such minimally involved quantum feature extraction, available only during training, can yield exponential quantum-classical separations for suitable concept classes and data distributions under reasonable computational assumptions. We further situate LUQPI within a taxonomy of related quantum and classical learning settings and show how standard classical machinery, most notably the SVM+ algorithm, can exploit quantum-augmented data. Finally, we present numerical experiments in a physically motivated many-body setting, where privileged quantum features are expectation values of observables on ground states, and observe consistent performance gains for LUQPI-style models over strong classical baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing variety of optically accessible spin qubits have emerged in recent years as key components for quantum sensors, qubits, and quantum memories. However, the scalability of conventional spin-based quantum architectures remains limited by direct microwave delivery, which introduces thermal noise, electromagnetic cross-talk, and design constraints for cryogenic, high-field, and distributed systems. In this work, we present a unified framework for RF-over-fiber (RFoF) control of optically accessible spins through RFoF optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectroscopy of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. The RFoF platform relies on an electro-optically modulated telecom-band laser that transmits microwave signals over fiber and a high-speed photodiode that recovers the RF waveform to drive NV center spin transitions. We obtain an RFoF efficiency of 1.81\% at 2.90~GHz, corresponding to $P_{\mathrm{RF,out}}=-0.7$~dBm. The RFoF architecture provides a path toward low-noise, thermally isolated, and cryo-compatible ODMR systems bridging conventional spin-based quantum sensing protocols with emerging distributed quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open quantum systems interact with their environment, leading to nonunitary dynamics. We investigate the thermodynamics of linear Open Quantum Walks (OQWs), a class of quantum walks whose dynamics is entirely driven by the environment. We define an equilibrium temperature, identify a population inversion near a finite critical value of a control parameter, analyze the thermalization process, and develop the statistical mechanics needed to describe the thermodynamical properties of linear OQWs. We also study nonequilibrium thermodynamics by analyzing the time evolution of entropy, energy, and temperature, while providing analytical tools to understand the system's evolution as it converges to the thermalized state. We examine the validity of the second and third laws of thermodynamics in this setting. Finally, we employ these developments to shed light on dissipative quantum computation within the OQW framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interacting spin systems in solids underpin a wide range of quantum technologies, from quantum sensors and single-photon sources to spin-defect-based quantum registers and processors. We develop a quantum-computer-aided framework for simulating such devices using a general electron spin resonance Hamiltonian incorporating zero-field splitting, the Zeeman effect, hyperfine interactions, dipole-dipole spin-spin terms, and electron-phonon decoherence. Within this model, we combine Gray-encoded qudit-to-qubit mappings, qubit-wise commuting aggregation, and a multi-reference selected quantum Krylov fast-forwarding (sQKFF) hybrid algorithm to access long-time dynamics while remaining compatible with NISQ and early fault-tolerant hardware constraints. Numerical simulations demonstrate the computation of autocorrelation functions up to $\sim100$ ns, together with microwave absorption spectra and the $\ell_1$-norm of coherence, achieving 18-30$\%$ reductions in gate counts and circuit depth for Trotterized time-evolution circuits compared to unoptimized implementations. Using the nitrogen vacancy center in diamond as a testbed, we benchmark the framework against classical simulations and identify the reference-state selection in sQKFF as the primary factor governing accuracy at fixed hardware cost. This methodology provides a flexible blueprint for using quantum computers to design, compare, and optimize solid-state spin-qubit technologies under experimentally realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Resource-Theoretic Quantifiers of Weak and Strong Symmetry Breaking: Strong Entanglement Asymmetry and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying how much a quantum state breaks a symmetry is essential for characterizing phases, nonequilibrium dynamics, and open-system behavior. Quantum resource theory provides a rigorous operational framework to define and characterize such quantifiers of symmetry-breaking. As a starter, we exemplify the usefulness of resource theory by noting that second-R\'enyi entanglement asymmetry can increase under symmetric operations, and hence is not a resource monotone, and should not solely be used to capture Quantum Mpemba effect. More importantly, motivated by mixed-state physics where weak and strong symmetries are inequivalent, we formulate a new resource theory tailored to strong symmetry, identifying free states and strong-covariant operations. This framework systematically identifies quantifiers of strong symmetry breaking for a broad class of symmetry groups, including a strong entanglement asymmetry. A particularly transparent structure emerges for U(1) symmetry, where the resource theory for the strong symmetry breaking has a completely parallel structure to the entanglement theory: the variance of the conserved quantity fully characterizes the asymptotic manipulation of strong symmetry breaking. By connecting this result to the knowledge of the geometry of quantum state space, we obtain a quantitative framework to track how weak symmetry breaking is irreversibly converted into strong symmetry breaking in open quantum systems. We further propose extensions to generalized symmetries and illustrate the qualitative impact of strong symmetry breaking in analytically tractable QFT examples and applications.</description>

      <title>Quench spectroscopy of amplitude modes in a one-dimensional critical phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of an amplitude (Higgs-like) mode in the gapless phase of the $(1+1)$D XXZ spin chain. Unlike conventional settings where amplitude modes arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking, here, we identify a symmetry-preserving underdamped excitation on top of a Luttinger-liquid ground state. Using nonequilibrium quench spectroscopy, we demonstrate that this mode manifests as oscillations of U(1)-symmetric observables following a sudden quench. By combining numerical simulations with Bethe-ansatz analyses, we trace its microscopic origin to specific families of string excitations. We further discuss experimental pathways to detect this mode in easy-plane quantum magnets and programmable quantum simulators. Our results showcase the utility of quantum quenches as a powerful tool to probe collective excitations, beyond the scope of linear response.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that certain three-dimensional topological phases can act as acoustic diodes realizing nonlinear odd acoustoelastic effects. Beyond uncovering topologically-induced anomalous acoustic second-harmonic generation and rectification, we demonstrate how such nonlinear responses are uniquely captured by the momentum-space nonmetricity tensor in the quantum state Hilbert-space geometry. In addition to completing the classification of quantum geometric observables in the quadratic response regime, our findings reveal unexplored avenues for experimental realizations of acoustic diodes using effective $\theta$ vacua of axion insulators adaptable for topological engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Spectral Form Factor of Gapped Random Matrix Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the spectral form factor of random matrix models which exhibit a large number of degenerate ground states accompanied by a macroscopic gap in the spectrum. The central aim of this work is to understand how the standard narrative about the behavior of the spectral form factor is modified in the presence of these parametrically large number of ground states. We show that, at sufficiently low temperatures, the spectral form factor is dominated by the disconnected contribution, even at arbitrarily late times. Moreover, we demonstrate that the connected form factor only depends on the eigenvalues of the non-degenerate sector. Using the Christoffel-Darboux kernel, we analyze a number of examples including the Bessel model and $\mathcal{N}=2$ Jackiw-Teitelboim supergravity. In these examples, we find damped oscillations in the disconnected form factor, with a period set by the inverse size of the gap. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the slope of the ramp in the connected form factor arises from a universal sine-kernel, which emerges from a truncation of the full non-perturbative kernel in the $\hbar \to 0$ limit, and find agreement with the leading double trumpet result. Finally, we present predictions for how the ramp will transition to a plateau in the connected form factor and demonstrate how the transition depends on the details of the leading spectral density of states.</description>

      <title>Continuum mechanics of entanglement in noisy interacting fermion chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an effective continuum description for information scrambling in a chain of randomly interacting Majorana fermions. The approach is based on the semiclassical treatment of the path integral for an effective spin chain that describes "two-replica" observables such as the entanglement purity and the OTOC. This formalism gives exact results for the entanglement membrane and for operator spreading in the limit of weak interactions. In this limit there is a large crossover lengthscale between free and interacting behavior, and this large lengthscale allows for a continuum limit and a controlled saddle-point calculation. The formalism is also somewhat different from that known from random unitary circuits. The entanglement membrane emerges as a kind of bound state of two travelling waves, and shows an interesting unbinding phenomenon as the velocity of the entanglement membrane approaches the butterfly velocity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise and flexible manipulation of the motional state of ultracold atoms is a fundamental enabling technology for diverse applications such as quantum sensing and quantum computation. In this paper we propose a general, simple and highly efficient method to engineer the motional state of a Bose-Einstein condensate with time-dependent optical fields, which can be realized experimentally with existing light sculpting techniques. We demonstrate numerically how to engineer superpositions of persistent currents in a toroidal trap, achieving very high fidelity. We also study in detail the stability of the state over time, and we present an analytical two-state model that approximates well the evolution of the state in presence of self-interactions.</description>

      <title>On the quantum nature of strong gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Belenchia et al. [Phys. Rev. D 98, 126009 (2018)] have analyzed a gedankenexperiment where two observers, Alice and Bob, attempt to communicate via superluminal signals using a superposition of massive particles dressed by Newtonian fields and a test particle as field detector. Quantum fluctuations in the particle motion and in the field prevent signaling or violations of quantum mechanics in this setup. We reformulate this thought experiment by considering gravitational waves emitted by an extended quadrupolar object as a detector for Newtonian tidal fields. We find that quantum fluctuations in the gravitational waves prevent signaling. In the Newtonian limit, rotating black holes behave as extended quadrupolar objects, as consequence of the strong equivalence principle. It follows that consistency of the Newtonian limit of general relativity with quantum mechanics requires the quantization of gravitational radiation, even when the waves originate in strong gravity sources.</description>

      <title>A Deterministic Framework for Neural Network Quantum States in Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic optimization of Neural Network Quantum States (NQS) in discrete Fock spaces is limited by sampling variance and slow mixing. We present a deterministic framework that optimizes a neural backflow ansatz within dynamically adaptive configuration subspaces, corrected by second-order perturbation theory. This approach eliminates Monte Carlo noise and, through a hybrid CPU-GPU implementation, exhibits sub-linear scaling with respect to subspace size. Benchmarks on bond dissociation in H2O and N2, and the strongly correlated chromium dimer Cr2, validate the method's accuracy and stability in large Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Belief Propagation with Quantum Messages for Symmetric Q-ary Pure-State Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Belief propagation with quantum messages (BPQM) provides a low-complexity alternative to collective measurements for communication over classical--quantum channels. Prior BPQM constructions and density-evolution (DE) analyses have focused on binary alphabets. Here, we generalize BPQM to symmetric q-ary pure-state channels (PSCs) whose output Gram matrix is circulant. For this class, we show that bit-node and check-node combining can be tracked efficiently via closed-form recursions on the Gram-matrix eigenvalues, independent of the particular physical realization of the output states. These recursions yield explicit BPQM unitaries and analytic bounds on the fidelities of the combined channels in terms of the input-channel fidelities. This provides a DE framework for symmetric q-ary PSCs that allows one to estimate BPQM decoding thresholds for LDPC codes and to construct polar codes on these channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the problem of computing the set of diagonal transversal gates fixing a CSS code. We determine the logical actions of the gates as well as the groups of transversal gates that induce non-trivial logical gates and logical identities. We explicitly declare the set of equations defining the groups, a key advantage and differentiator of our approach. We compute the complete set of transversal stabilizers and transversal gates for any CSS code arising from monomial codes, a family that includes decreasing monomial codes and polar codes. As a consequence, we recover and extend some results in the literature on CSS-T codes, triorthogonal codes, and divisible codes.</description>

Abstract: We study the thermodynamic performance of a periodic quantum Otto cycle operating on the single-impurity Anderson model. Using a decomposition of the time-evolution generator based on the principle of minimal dissipation, combined with the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method, we analyze the operating regimes of the quantum thermal machine and investigate effects of Coulomb interactions, strong system-reservoir coupling, and energy level alignments. Our results show that Coulomb interaction can change the operating regimes and may lead to an enhancement of the efficiency.</description>

      <title>Strassen's support functionals coincide with the quantum functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strassen's asymptotic spectrum offers a framework for analyzing the complexity of tensors. It has found applications in diverse areas, from computer science to additive combinatorics and quantum information. A long-standing open problem, dating back to 1991, asks whether Strassen's support functionals are universal spectral points, that is, points in the asymptotic spectrum of tensors.
  In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative by proving that the support functionals coincide with the quantum functionals - universal spectral points that are defined via entropy optimization on entanglement polytopes. We obtain this result as a special case of a general minimax formula for convex optimization on entanglement polytopes (and other moment polytopes) that has further applications to other tensor parameters, including the asymptotic slice rank. Our proof is based on a recent Fenchel-type duality theorem on Hadamard manifolds due to Hirai.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major issue in exploiting plasmonic cavities as key components in nanotechnology is the effect of radiative and absorption losses on their electrodynamic behavior. Treating them as open-systems, we derive a time-local, completely positive master equation that retains non-secular interference between decay pathways and reduces to the standard secular description when the environment resolves polariton splitting. When it does not, the theory predicts order-one deviations from secular leakage dynamics, including bath-induced coherences and stabilization of dark polaritons, and provides a simple design criterion based on the ratio of polariton splitting to reservoir linewidth. A time-resolved leakage measurement, such as transmission, reflectivity, or photoluminescence, can be used to observe these effects.</description>

      <title>Holographic Entanglement Propagation Through Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how energy and quantum entanglement are transferred when two identical CFTs are entangled locally. This is probed by considering a local operator insertion in one of the CFTs. When the CFTs have holographic duals via the AdS/CFT correspondence, the transfer happens through an AdS wormhole that allows signal propagation even beyond the horizon from one AdS boundary to the other; we demonstrate this in explicit CFT calculations. We argue that this transmission is possible because the insertion of a local operator is not a unitary process but a regularized version of projection measurement, and that this is interpreted as quantum teleportation. We also find that this leads to a phenomenon opposite to scrambling, where mutual information, instead of being suppressed, gets enhanced by the insertion of a local operator excitation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry provides powerful non-perturbative constraints in quantum many-body systems. A prominent example is the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomaly -- a mixed 't Hooft anomaly between internal and translational symmetries that forbids a trivial symmetric gapped phase. In this work, we investigate lattice translation operators in systems with an LSM anomaly. We construct explicit lattice models in two and three spatial dimensions and show that, after gauging the full internal symmetry, translation becomes non-invertible and fuses into defects of the internal symmetry. The result is supported by the anomaly-inflow in view of topological field theory. Our work extends earlier one-dimensional observations to a unified higher-dimensional framework and clarifies their origin in mixed anomalies and higher-group structures, highlighting a coherent interplay between internal and crystalline symmetries.</description>

      <title>Quantum LEGO Learning: A Modular Design Principle for Hybrid Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical learning models increasingly integrate neural networks with variational quantum circuits (VQCs) to exploit complementary inductive biases. However, many existing approaches rely on tightly coupled architectures or task-specific encoders, limiting conceptual clarity, generality, and transferability across learning settings. In this work, we introduce Quantum LEGO Learning, a modular and architecture-agnostic learning framework that treats classical and quantum components as reusable, composable learning blocks with well-defined roles. Within this framework, a pre-trained classical neural network serves as a frozen feature block, while a VQC acts as a trainable adaptive module that operates on structured representations rather than raw inputs. This separation enables efficient learning under constrained quantum resources and provides a principled abstraction for analyzing hybrid models. We develop a block-wise generalization theory that decomposes learning error into approximation and estimation components, explicitly characterizing how the complexity and training status of each block influence overall performance. Our analysis generalizes prior tensor-network-specific results and identifies conditions under which quantum modules provide representational advantages over comparably sized classical heads. Empirically, we validate the framework through systematic block-swap experiments across frozen feature extractors and both quantum and classical adaptive heads. Experiments on quantum dot classification demonstrate stable optimization, reduced sensitivity to qubit count, and robustness to realistic noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential geometries derived from tensor decompositions have been extensively studied and provided the foundations for a variety of efficient numerical methods. Despite the practical success of the tensor ring (TR) decomposition, its intrinsic geometry remains less understood, primarily due to the underlying ring structure and the resulting nontrivial gauge invariance. We establish the quotient geometry of TR decomposition by imposing full-rank conditions on all unfolding matrices of the core tensors and capturing the gauge invariance. Additionally, the results can be extended to the uniform TR decomposition, where all core tensors are identical. Numerical experiments validate the developed geometries via tensor ring completion tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of \textit{defect relative entropy} as a measure of distinguishability within the space of defects. We compute the defect relative entropy for conformal/topological defects, deriving a universal formula in conformal field theories (CFTs) on a circle. This formula reduces to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Furthermore, we provide a detailed expression of the defect relative entropy for diagonal CFTs with specific topological defect choices, utilizing the theory's modular $\mathcal{S}$ matrix. We also present a general formula for the \textit{ defect sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy} and the \textit{defect fidelity}. Through explicit calculations in specific models, including the Ising model, the tricritical Ising model, and the $\widehat{su}(2)_{k}$ WZW model, we have made an intriguing finding: zero defect relative entropy between reduced density matrices associated with certain topological defect. Notably, we introduce the concept of the \textit{defect relative sector}, representing the set of topological defects with zero defect relative entropy.</description>

      <title>Bound-state-free F\"orster resonant shielding of strongly dipolar ultracold molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to suppress collisional loss in strongly dipolar, rotationally excited ultracold molecules using a combination of static (dc) and microwave (ac) electric fields. By tuning two excited pair molecular rotational states into a F\"orster resonance with a dc field, simultaneously driving excited rotational transitions with an ac field removes all long-range bound states, allowing near complete suppression of all two- and three-body collisional loss channels. While permitting tunable dipolar and anti-dipolar interactions, this bound-state-free ac/dc scheme is not subject to photon-changing collisions that are the primary source of two-body loss in shielding with two microwave fields, used to achieve the first molecular Bose-Einstein condensate [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. Using NaCs as a representative example for strongly dipolar molecules, close-coupling calculations are performed to show that bound-state-free shielding can achieve ratios of elastic-to-loss rates $\gtrsim 10^{6}$ at 100 nK, with currently accessible ac and dc field generation technologies. This work opens new opportunities for realizing large, long-lived samples of strongly interacting degenerate molecular gases with tunable long-range interactions.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting resonators and qubits are limited by dielectric losses from surface oxides. Surface oxides are mitigated through various strategies such as the addition of a metal capping layer, surface passivation, and acid processing. In this study, we demonstrate the use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as a rapid characterization tool to study the effectiveness cap layers for niobium for further device fabrication. We non-destructively evaluate 17 capping layers to characterize their ability to prevent oxygen diffusion, and the effects of standard fabrication processes -- annealing, resist stripping, and acid cleaning. We downselect for resilient capping layers and test their microwave resonator performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a quantum Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) effective field theory for the diffusive hydrodynamics of a conserved scalar field. Quantum corrections within the SK framework are guided by fluctuation-dissipation relations, enforced via a dynamical Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) symmetry. We find that the KMS symmetry necessarily generates fluctuation contributions in the SK effective action at all orders in the noise field, thereby giving rise to intrinsically non-Gaussian noise. We use our results to compute one-loop quantum corrections to the two-point density-density retarded correlation function, leading to a quantum generalization of hydrodynamic long-time tails. Our results apply at arbitrarily high orders in $\hbar$. The one-loop results for retarded correlation functions have been expressed in terms of a family of polynomials. We also provide a closed-form expression for the one-loop results at leading order in the wavevector expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a crucial feature of quantum mechanics that not all measurements are compatible with each other. However, if measurements suffer from noise they may lose their incompatibility. Here, we consider the effect of white noise and determine the critical visibility such that all qubit measurements, i.e. all positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), become compatible, i.e. jointly measurable. In addition, we apply our methods to quantum steering and Bell nonlocality. We obtain a tight local hidden state model for two-qubit Werner states of visibility $1/2$. This determines the exact steering bound for two-qubit Werner states and also provides a local hidden variable model that improves on previously known models. Interestingly, this proves that POVMs are not more powerful than projective measurements to demonstrate quantum steering for these states.</description>

Abstract: Characterizing entanglement of systems composed of multiple particles is a very complex problem that is attracting increasing attention across different disciplines related to quantum physics. The task becomes even more complex when the particles have many accessible levels, i.e., they are of high dimension, which leads to a potentially high-dimensional multipartite entangled state. These are important resources for an ever-increasing number of tasks, especially when a network of parties needs to share highly entangled states, e.g., for communicating more efficiently and securely. For these applications, as well as for purely theoretical arguments, it is important to be able to certify both the high-dimensional and the genuine multipartite nature of entangled states, possibly based on simple measurements. Here we derive a novel method that achieves this and improves over typical entanglement witnesses like the fidelity with respect to states of a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) form, without needing more complex measurements. We test our condition on paradigmatic classes of high-dimensional multipartite entangled states like imperfect GHZ states with random noise, as well as on purely randomly chosen ones and find that, in comparison with other available criteria our method provides a significant advantage and is often also simpler to evaluate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07653v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel theory that generalizes the concept of anyon statistics to Abelian topological excitations of any dimension. We axiomatize excitations as a selected collection of states and operators satisfying the configuration axiom and the locality axiom, purely based on many-body quantum mechanics. Upon these axioms, we define a rigorous and self-contained theory of statistics using only basic algebra and can be implemented on a computer. While our theory is developed independently, the results align with existing physical theories.</description>

      <title>A 3D lattice defect and efficient computations in topological MBQC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe an efficient, fully fault-tolerant implementation of Measurement-Based Quantum Computation (MBQC) in the 3D cluster state. The two key novelties are (i) the introduction of a lattice defect in the underlying cluster state and (ii) the use of the Rudolph-Grover rebit encoding. Concretely, (i) allows for a topological implementation of the Hadamard gate, while (ii) does the same for the phase gate. Furthermore, we develop general ideas towards circuit compaction and algorithmic circuit verification, which we implement for the Reed-Muller code used for magic state distillation. Our performance analysis highlights the overall improvements provided by the new methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for estimating the number of shots required to achieve a desired variance in the results of a quantum circuit. First, we establish a baseline for single-qubit characterisation of individual noise sources. We then move on to multi-qubit circuits, focusing on expectation-value circuits. We decompose the variance of the estimator into a sum of a statistical term and a bias floor. These are independently estimated with one additional run of the circuit. We test our method on a Variational Quantum Eigensolver for $H_2$ and show that we can predict the variance to within known error bounds. We go on to show that for IBM Pittsburgh's noise characteristics, at that instant, 7000 shots for the given circuit would have achieved a $\sigma^2 \approx 0.01$</description>

      <title>Resilience of Quantum Teleportation Fidelity for Bipartite Mixed States near Schwarzschild and Dilaton Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the robustness of quantum teleportation in the presence of strong gravitational fields by analysing bipartite mixed states derived from tripartite GHZ and W-class states near black hole event horizons. Considering a scenario where two observers approach the horizon of either a Schwarzschild or a Garfinkle Horowitz Strominger (GHS) Dilaton black hole while a third remains in flat space, we quantify the teleportation fidelity of the resulting bipartite channels after tracing out one party. Through the quantization of Dirac fields and Bogoliubov transformations, we compute the teleportation fidelity under the influence of Hawking radiation and spacetime curvature. Our results show that while entanglement degrades, teleportation fidelity remains above the classical threshold of $f&gt;\frac{2}{3}$ for channels derived from W-class states, but not for GHZ-derived states. This indicates that quantum teleportation can remain feasible near black holes provided the initial entangled state retains useful bipartite entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate numerically the joint distribution of magic ($M$) and entanglement ($S$) in $N$-qubit Haar-random quantum states. The distribution $P_N(M,S)$ as well as the marginals become exponentially localized, and centered around the values $\tilde{M_2} \to N-2$ and $\tilde{S} \to N/2$ as $N\to\infty$. Magic and entanglement fluctuations are, however, found to become exponentially uncorrelated. Although exponentially many states with magic $M_2=0$ and entropy $S\approx S_\text{Haar}$ exist, they represent an exponentially small fraction compared to typical quantum states, which are characterized by large magic and entanglement entropy, and uncorrelated magic and entanglement fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Geometric quantum drives and topological dynamical responses: hyperbolically-driven quantum systems and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a geometrical framework to construct a large class of time-dependent quantum systems, in which the position of a classical particle moving autonomously on a smooth connected manifold is used to steer a quantum Hamiltonian over time. This results in quantum drives with structured temporal profiles and properties dependent on the local and global nature of the underlying choice of manifold. We show that our construction recovers the well-known classes of periodically-driven and quasiperiodically-driven quantum systems, but also unveils fundamentally new classes of quantum dynamics: by utilizing a compact 2d hyperbolic Bolza surface and a nonorientable Klein-bottle surface, we demonstrate examples of a hyperbolically-driven quantum system and a nonorientably-driven quantum system respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these driven systems exhibit unusual quantized dynamical responses reflecting their different underlying topologies, under the condition of being fully gapped and in the adiabatic limit, and which have interpretations as quantized crystalline electromagnetic responses in certain exotic effective tight-binding lattice models. We envision geometric quantum driving as a general framework to chart the landscape of time-dependent quantum systems and investigate the universal phase structures they exhibit, as well as a useful tool to enhance the capabilities of modern day quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Timelike Quantum Energy Teleportation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a novel quantum protocol called Timelike Quantum Energy Teleportation (TQET) between two separated parties $A$ and $B$, designed for transporting quantum energy across spacetime. The amount of energy gained through TQET is always greater than or equal to that obtained via natural time evolution for any spin chain where $A$ and $B$ are distinguishable. This protocol uses temporal and spatial quantum correlations between agents separated by space and time. The energy supplier injects energy into the system by measuring the ground state of a many-body system that evolves over time, while the distant recipient performs a conditional operation using feedback from the supplier. When Bob acts immediately after receiving Alice's outcome, the protocol reduces to conventional QET. We present a proof-of-concept demonstration in the Ising model using quantum simulations. TQET increases energy efficiency from approximately 3\% to around 40\%, representing over a 13-fold improvement compared to QET. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between entanglement in time and TQET, validating the role of temporal correlations in energy activation between agents across spacetime.</description>

      <title>On the Efficient Extraction of Entangled Resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10186v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Quantum Internet, multipartite entanglement enables a rich and dynamic overlay topology, referred to as artificial topology, upon the physical one, that can be exploited for communication purposes. In fact, the ability to extract $n$-qubits GHZ states and EPR pairs from the original multipartite entangled state constitutes the resource primitives for end-to-end and on-demand quantum communications. Thus, in this paper, we theoretically determine upper and lower bounds for the number of extractable $n$-qubits GHZ states and EPR pairs involving nodes remote in the artificial topology, as well as the achievable size $n$ of remote GHZ states. The theoretical analysis is then complemented by the proposal of a novel algorithm, which provides in polynomial-time a heuristic solution to the above problem. This is remarkable, since the theoretical problem is NP-complete. The performance analysis demonstrates the proposed algorithm is able to effectively manipulate the original and arbitrary graph state for extracting entanglement resources across remote nodes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Time Crystal Clock and its Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding different aspects of time is at the core of many areas in theoretical physics. Minimal models of continuous stochastic and quantum clocks have been proposed to explore fundamental limitations on the performance of timekeeping devices. Owing to the level of complexity in the clock structure and its energy consumption, such devices show trade-offs whose characterization remains an open challenge. Indeed, even conceptual designs for thermodynamically efficient quantum clocks are not yet well understood. In condensed matter theory, time-crystals were found as an exciting new phase of matter, featuring oscillations in (pseudo)-equilibrium with first experimental observations appearing recently. This naturally prompts the question: can time crystals be used as quantum clocks and what is their performance from a thermodynamic perspective? We answer this question and find that quantum time crystals are indeed genuine quantum clocks with a performance enhanced by the spontaneous breaking of time-translation symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06700v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing accessible information for an ensemble of quantum states is a basic problem in quantum information theory. We show that the recently obtained optimality criterion (A.S. Holevo, Lobachevskii J. Math., \textbf{43}:7 (2022), 1646-1650), when applied to specific ensembles of states leads to nontrivial tight entropy inequalities that are discrete relatives of the famous log-Sobolev inequality. In this light, the hypothesis of globally information-optimal measurement for an ensemble of equiangular equiprobable states (quantum pyramids) (B.-G. Englert and J. \v{R}eh\'{a}\v{c}ek, J. Mod. Optics \textbf{57 }N3 (2010) 218-226) is reconsidered and the corresponding entropy inequalities are proposed. Via the optimality criterion, this suggests also an approach to the proof of the conjectures concerning globally information-optimal observables for quantum pyramids.</description>

      <title>Finite Gaussian assistance protocols and a conic metric for extremizing spacelike vacuum entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a pure Gaussian tripartition, a range of entanglement between two parties ($AB$) can be purified through classical communication of Gaussian measurements performed within the third ($C$). To begin, this work introduces a direct method to calculate a hierarchic series of projective $C$ measurements for the removal of any $AB$ Gaussian noise, circumventing divergences in prior protocols. Next, a multimode conic framework is developed for pursuing the maximum (Gaussian entanglement of assistance, GEOA) or minimum (Gaussian entanglement of formation, GEOF) pure entanglement that may be revealed or required between $AB$. Within this framework, a geometric necessary and sufficient entanglement condition emerges as a doubly-enclosed conic volume, defining a novel distance metric for conic optimization. Extremizing this distance for spacelike vacuum entanglement in the massless and massive free scalar fields yields (1) the highest known lower bound to GEOA, the first that decays slower than the two-point correlation functions and (2) the lowest known upper bound to GEOF, the first that decays exponentially mirroring the mixed $AB$ negativity. Furthermore, combination of the above with a generalization of previous partially-transposed noise filtering techniques allows calculation of a single $C$ measurement that maximizes the purified $AB$ entanglement. Beyond expectation that these behaviors of spacelike GEOA and GEOF persist in interacting theories, the present measurement and optimization techniques are applicable to physical many-body Gaussian states beyond quantum fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the behavior of quadrature coherence under the measurement of the same field quadrature. This is carried out with the help of a beam splitter, which implies the contribution of an auxiliary field state impinging at the other input port. To this end we consider the linear input-output transformation of a lossless beam splitter to relate input and output coherences, measured in terms of the $l_1$-norm. After obtaining a general input-output relation between coherences we apply the result to Gaussian and number states. For Gaussian states we obtain that coherence does not depend on the measurement outcome, and that the average coherence always equals the coherence of the reduced state, showing no average effect on coherence of the measurement. On the other hand, for number states the output coherence depends on the measurement, decreasing the relative coherence with increasing photon number. Finally, we consider relative-entropy as a measure of coherence to show that for number states and coherence measures other than the $l_1$-norm the average coherence no longer equals the coherence of the output reduced state.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic rf-to-microwave transducer based on a dc-Biased electromechanical system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a two-stage, heterodyne rf-to-microwave transducer that combines a tunable electrostatic pre-amplifier with a superconducting electromechanical cavity. A metalized Si$_3$N$_4$ membrane (3 MHz frequency) forms the movable plate of a vacuum-gap capacitor in a microwave LC resonator. A dc bias across the gap converts any small rf signal into a resonant electrostatic force proportional to the bias, providing a voltage-controlled gain that multiplies the cavity's intrinsic electromechanical gain. In a flip-chip device with a 1.5 $\mathrm{\mu}$m gap operated at 10 mK we observe dc-tunable anti-spring shifts, and rf-to-microwave transduction at 49 V bias, achieving a charge sensitivity of 87 $\mathrm{\mu}$e/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ (0.9 nV/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$). Extrapolation to sub-micron gaps and state-of-the-art $Q&gt;10^8$ membrane resonators predicts sub-200 fV/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ sensitivity, establishing dc-biased electromechanics as a practical route towards quantum-grade rf electrometers and low-noise modular heterodyne links for superconducting microwave circuits and charge or voltage sensing.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot Decoding and Fault-tolerant Gates with Trivariate Tricycle Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC) codes are a low-overhead means of quantum information storage, it is valuable for quantum codes to possess fault-tolerant features beyond this resource efficiency. In this work, we introduce trivariate tricycle (TT) codes, qLDPC codes that combine several desirable features: high thresholds under a circuit-level noise model, partial single-shot decodability for low-time-overhead decoding, a large set of transversal Clifford gates and automorphisms within and between code blocks, and (for several sub-constructions) constant-depth implementations of a (non-Clifford) $CCZ$ gate. TT codes are CSS codes based on a length-3 chain complex, and are defined from three trivariate polynomials, with the 3D toric code (3DTC) belonging to this construction. We numerically search for TT codes and find several candidates with improved parameters relative to the 3DTC, using up to 48$\times$ fewer data qubits as equivalent 3DTC encodings. We construct syndrome-extraction circuits for these codes and numerically demonstrate single-shot decoding in the X error channel in both phenomenological and circuit-level noise models. Under circuit-level noise, TT codes have a threshold of $0.3\%$ in the Z error channel and $1\%$ in the X error channel (with single-shot decoding). All TT codes possess several transversal $CZ$ gates that can partially address logical qubits between two code blocks. Additionally, the codes possess a large set of automorphisms that can perform Clifford gates within a code block. Finally, we establish several TT code polynomial constructions that allows for a constant-depth implementation of logical $CCZ$ gates. We find examples of error-correcting and error-detecting codes using these constructions whose parameters out-perform those of the 3DTC, using up to $4\times$ fewer data qubits for equivalent-distance 3DTC encodings.</description>

Abstract: Existing quantum routing implicitly mimics classical routing principles, with finding the ``best'' path (aka pathfinding), according to a selected routing metric, as a core mechanism for establishing end-to-end entanglement. However, optimal pathfinding is computationally intensive, particularly in complex topologies. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to quantum routing, which avoids the inherent overhead of conventional quantum pathfinding, by establishing directly entanglement between remote nodes. Our approach exploits graph complement strategies. It allows to improve the flexibility and efficiency of quantum networks, by paving the way for more practical quantum communication infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-time Extraction of Entanglement Resources</title>

Abstract: The extraction of EPR pairs and n-qubits GHZ states among remote nodes in quantum networks constitutes the resource primitives for end-to-end and on-demand communications. However, the Bell-VM problem, which determines whether a given graph state can be transformed into a set of Bell pairs on specific vertices (not necessarily remote), is known to be NP-complete. In this paper, we extend this problem, not only by focusing on nodes remote within generic graph states, but also by determining the number of extractable n-qubit remote GHZ states -- beside the number of remote EPR pairs. The rationale for tackling the extraction of GHZ states among remote nodes, rather than solely remote EPR pairs, is that a GHZ state enables the dynamic extraction of an EPR pair between any pair of nodes sharing the state. This, in turn, implies the ability of accommodating the traffic requests on-the-fly. Specially, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for solving the aforementioned NP-complete problem. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to effectively adapt to generic graph states for extracting entanglement resources across remote nodes.</description>

Abstract: For a machine learning paradigm to be generally applicable, it should have the property of universal approximation, that is, it should be able to approximate any target function to any desired degree of accuracy. In variational quantum machine learning, the class of functions that can be learned depend on both the data encoding scheme as well as the architecture of the optimizable part of the model. Here, we show that the property of universal approximation is constructively and efficiently realized by the recently proposed bit-bit data encoding scheme. Further, we show that this construction allows us to calculate the number of qubits required to solve a learning problem on a dataset to a target accuracy, giving rise to the first resource estimation framework for variational quantum machine learning. We apply bit-bit encoding to a number of medium-sized classical benchmark datasets and find that they require only 27 qubits on average for encoding. We extend the basic bit-bit encoding scheme to a variant that efficiently supports batched processing of large datasets. As a demonstration, we apply this new scheme to subsets of a giga-scale transcriptomic dataset. This work establishes bit-bit encoding not only as a universally expressive quantum data representation, but also as a practical foundation for resource estimation and benchmarking in quantum machine learning.</description>

Abstract: Anyons, unique to two spatial dimensions, underlie extraordinary phenomena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect, but their generalization to higher dimensions has remained elusive. The topology of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces constrains the loop statistics to be only bosonic or fermionic in any dimension. In this work, we introduce the novel anyonic statistics for membrane excitations in four dimensions. Analogous to the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-particle exhibiting $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(2,N)}$ anyonic statistics in two dimensions, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-membrane possesses $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(3,N)}$ anyonic statistics in four dimensions. Given unitary volume operators that create membrane excitations on the boundary, we propose an explicit 56-step unitary sequence that detects the membrane statistics. We further analyze the boundary theory of $(5{+}1)$D 1-form $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry-protected topological phases and demonstrate that their domain walls realize all possible anyonic membrane statistics. We then show that the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ subgroup persists in all higher dimensions. In addition to the standard fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ membrane statistics arising from Stiefel-Whitney classes, membranes also exhibit $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics associated with Pontryagin classes. We explicitly verify that the 56-step process detects the nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics in 5, 6, and 7 spatial dimensions. Moreover, in 7 and higher dimensions, the statistics of membrane excitations stabilize to $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$, with the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ sector consistently captured by this process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose cascaded spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in microring resonators as a scalable and efficient approach for directly generating non-Gaussian states of light. Focusing on the well-understood "low-gain" regime, we demonstrate that triplet generation through cascaded SFWM can be achieved with high efficiency and favorable spectral characteristics using realistic microring sources in AlGaAs. The ability to achieve the generation of light in a single set of supermodes -- and the predicted accessibility of the "high-gain" regime at realistic pump powers -- makes this source a promising candidate as a direct and deterministic source of non-Gaussian light for photonic quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Near-limit quantum control beyond analytic tractability in many-body spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As quantum control approaches hardware-imposed performance limits, weak effects omitted by reduced models become consequential. Assumptions required for analytic tractability then cease to guide control design and instead constrain further improvement. Here, we relax such assumptions and use simulation-guided stochastic tree search to navigate combinatorially large, discrete pulse-sequence spaces for robust many-body spin control. Experimentally, in a solid-state spin ensemble, the resulting computationally discovered pulse sequences substantially outperform analytically optimized baselines, despite being excluded by construction from analytic design criteria. Importantly, these unconventional sequences expose predictive structural features that enable rapid neural network--based performance evaluation. This efficiency gain makes the combinatorial scaling tractable and expands the control alphabet from 8 symmetry-restricted pulses to over 26,000 hardware-resolved options. The resulting fine-grained design freedom provides the control resolution required to reliably address weak, performance-limiting effects, unlocking qualitatively different spin-control capabilities beyond decades of traditional sequence design. Together, these results show that near performance limits, simplifying assumptions can become a primary constraint on quantum control in realistic hardware, and must be repurposed to guide computational discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08687v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum readout error mitigation is essential for noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices to achieve reliable data. The conventional approaches, conflating initialization errors with measurement errors, not only suppress the influence of measurement errors, but also strengthen that of initialization errors, which is a systematic bias grows exponentially with the qubit number. Here, we have proved that this effect causes severe fidelity overestimation for all stabilizer states and might lead to false positives in large-scale entangled state characterization. Similarly, the results from algorithms like the variational quantum eigensolver and time evolution also deviate negatively, and cover up other errors in the quantum circuit. These findings highlight the critical need for rigorous benchmarking and careful management of initialization errors. Consequently, we establish an upper bound for the tolerable initialization error rate to ensure effective error mitigation at a given system scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate single spin spectroscopy of a fluorescent tumbling defect in silicon called the G center, behaving as a pseudo-molecule randomly reorienting itself in the crystalline matrix. Using high-resolution spin spectroscopy, we reveal a fine magnetic structure resulting from the spin principal axes jumping between discrete orientations in the crystal. Modeling the atomic reorientation of the defect shows that spin tumbling induces variations in the coupling to the microwave magnetic field, enabling position-dependent Rabi frequencies to be detected in coherent spin control experiments. By virtue of its pseudo-molecule configuration, the G center in silicon is a unique quantum system to investigate the mutual interaction between optical, spin and rotation properties in a highly versatile material.</description>

      <title>Zero-field identification and control of hydrogen-related electron-nuclear spin registers in diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin defects in diamond serve as powerful building blocks for quantum technologies, especially for applications in quantum sensing and quantum networking. Electron-nuclear defects formed in the environment of optically active spins, such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center, can be harnessed as qubits to construct larger hybrid quantum registers. However, many of these defects have yet to be characterized, limiting their integration into scalable devices. Here, we apply two hybrid electron-nuclear spin control schemes to self-consistently characterize unknown spin defects at the single-spin level. We perform double electron-electron resonance at zero field (ZF-DEER) to extract hyperfine components and introduce a nuclear-electron-electron triple resonance (NEETR) protocol to control and identify the nuclear spin through the stronger electronic spin interaction. These results provide a guide to resolving the defect structures using ab initio calculations, leading to the identification of a new hydrogen-related defect structure as well as an accurate match to a previously identified nitrogen-related defect. We further apply our NEETR protocol to demonstrate initialization, unitary control, and long-lived coherence of the nuclear spin qubit of the hydrogen defect with $T_2 = 1.0(3)\,\mathrm{ms}$. Our characterization and control tools establish a framework to expand the accessible defect landscape for electron-nuclear registers with hydrogen-related defects and enable applications in quantum sensing, networks, and atomic-scale magnetic resonance imaging at room temperature.</description>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) offers a promising avenue for automating the design of variational quantum circuits, but existing methods typically decouple discrete structure search from continuous parameter optimization, resulting in inefficient or brittle solutions. We propose HyRLQAS (Hybrid-Action Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Architecture Search), a unified reinforcement learning framework that jointly learns gate placement and parameter initialization within a hybrid discrete-continuous action space, while enabling dynamic refinement of previously placed gates. Trained in a variational quantum eigensolver setting, the agent constructs circuits that directly optimize molecular ground-state energies. Across multiple molecular benchmarks, HyRLQAS demonstrates strong and competitive performance against state-of-the-art QAS methods, achieving lower energy errors with fewer gates. Notably, HyRLQAS reaches chemical-accuracy-level convergence down to 1e-8 energy error after classical optimization, and policy-guided initialization reduces the iteration count of downstream classical optimizers. These results demonstrate that hybrid-action reinforcement learning provides a principled and effective mechanism for coupling circuit topology design with optimization-aware parameterization.</description>

      <title>Formal Verification of Noisy Quantum Reinforcement Learning Policies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) aims to use quantum effects to create sequential decision-making policies that achieve tasks more effectively than their classical counterparts. However, QRL policies face uncertainty from quantum measurements and hardware noise, such as bit-flip, phase-flip, and depolarizing errors, which can lead to unsafe behavior. Existing work offers no systematic way to verify whether trained QRL policies meet safety requirements under specific noise conditions. We introduce QVerifier, a formal verification method that applies probabilistic model checking to analyze trained QRL policies with and without modeled quantum noise. QVerifier builds a complete model of the policy-environment interaction, incorporates quantum uncertainty directly into the transition probabilities, and then checks safety properties using the Storm model checker. Experiments across multiple QRL environments show that QVerifier precisely measures how different noise models influence safety, revealing both performance degradation and cases where noise can help. By enabling rigorous safety verification before deployment, QVerifier addresses a critical need: because access to quantum hardware is expensive, pre-deployment verification is essential for any safety-critical use of QRL. QVerifier targets a potential sweet spot between classical and quantum computation, where trained QRL policies could still be modeled classically for probabilistic model checking. When the policy was trained under matching noise conditions, this formal model is exact; when trained on physical hardware, it constitutes an idealized approximation, as unknown hardware noise prevents exact policy modeling.</description>

Abstract: We extend quantum circuit cutting to heterogeneous registers comprising mixed-dimensional qudits. By decomposing non-local interactions into tensor products of local generalised Gell-Mann matrices, we enable the simulation and execution of high-dimensional circuits on disconnected hardware fragments. We validate this framework on qubit--qutrit ($2$--$3$) interfaces, achieving exact state reconstruction with a Total Variation Distance of 0 within single-precision floating-point tolerance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the memory advantage in an 8-particle, dimension-8 system, reducing memory usage from 128 MB to 64 KB per circuit.</description>

      <title>On the robustness of Quantum Phase Estimation to compute ground properties of many-electron systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an analysis of the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm applied to electronic systems by investigating its free parameters such as the time step, number of phase qubits, initial state preparation, number of measurement shots, and parameters related to the unitary operators implementation. A deep understanding of these parameters is crucial to pave the way towards more automation of QPE applied to predictive computational chemistry and material science. To our knowledge, aspects remain to be investigated and a holistic method to coherently set these parameters to be clearly stated. After reviewing key QPE features, we propose a constructive method to set the QPE free parameters for ground energy estimation and ground state projection. We gather and refine, among other things, explicit conditions for achieving chemical accuracy in ground energy estimation. We also demonstrate that, using our conditions, the complexity of the Trotterized version of QPE tends to depend mostly on physical system properties and weakly on the number of phase qubits. Numerical simulations on the H2 molecule provide a first validation of our approach.</description>

      <title>From Superradiance to Superabsorption: An Exact Treatment of Non-Markovian Cooperative Radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of cooperative radiation phenomena in ensembles of two-level atoms coupled to a lossy resonant cavity beyond the Markovian and mean-field approximations. By deriving a complete analytical solution for the two-emitter case and employing a numerically exact method for larger ensembles, we characterize the full transition from Markovian to non-Markovian collective dynamics for systems of up to $10^3$ emitters. Our results reveal three distinct regimes: a Markovian phase exhibiting the standard superradiant burst, a non-Markovian phase featuring spontaneous superabsorption of the emitted field, and a critical regime marked by pulsed collective emission. We show that the critical spectral width separating these behaviors increases monotonically with the number of emitters, demonstrating that environmental memory effects can be enhanced by cooperativity. Finally, we find that the superradiant scaling of the peak intensity progressively degrades with increasing system size, approaching a subquadratic law in the limit of a perfect cavity. In this regime, spontaneous superabsorption emerges as a distinct manifestation of non-Markovian cooperativity.</description>

      <title>Implementation of Leaking Quantum Walks on a Photonic Processor</title>

Abstract: Quantum walks (QWs) represent pillars of quantum dynamics and information processing. They provide a powerful framework for simulating quantum transport, designing search algorithms, and enabling universal quantum computation. Several physical platforms have been employed for their implementation, such as trapped atoms and ions, nuclear magnetic resonance systems, and photonic quantum architectures either in bulk optics or waveguide structures and fiber-loop networks. Here we focus on the most promising and versatile approach, that is photonic integrated circuits. In this work, we review how the employment of this versatile experimental platform has allowed to explore several phenomena related to QW-based protocols as, for instance, the evolution in presence of different kinds of noise. In this landscape, to the best of our knowledge, few examples report on the introduction of absorbing centers and their effects on the coherence of the dynamics. Here we present and discuss the results related to absorbing boundaries in QWs obtained through theoretical simulations and experiments conducted with the universal photonic quantum processors realized by Quix Quantum. We analyze how localized absorption along one lattice edge affects the walker dynamics depending on both the leakage probability and the initial injection site. Our results show that the presence of controlled losses modifies interference patterns and coherence, without fully destroying quantum features and providing an effective resource for engineering on-chip QWs and simulating open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Exact Thermal Stabilizer Eigenstates at Infinite Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how microscopic few-body interactions give rise to thermal behavior in isolated quantum many-body systems remains a central challenge in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. While individual energy eigenstates are expected to reproduce thermal equilibrium values, analytic access to highly entangled thermal eigenstates of nonintegrable Hamiltonians remains scarce. In this Letter, we construct exact infinite-temperature eigenstates of generically nonintegrable two-body Hamiltonians using stabilizer states. These states can fully reproduce thermal expectation values for all spatially local observables, extending previously known Bell-pair-based constructions to a broader class. At the same time, we prove a sharp no-go theorem: stabilizer eigenstates of two-body Hamiltonians cannot satisfy microscopic thermal equilibrium for all four-body observables. This bound is tight, as we explicitly construct a translationally invariant Hamiltonian whose stabilizer eigenstate is thermal for all two-body and three-body observables as well as all spatially local observables. Our results suggest that reproducing higher-order thermal correlations requires nonstabilizer degrees of freedom, providing analytic insight into the interplay between interaction locality, microscopic thermal equilibrium, and quantum computational complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prompted by the longstanding interpretational controversy in quantum mechanics, quantum tunneling is heuristically addressed within the Everettian quantum multiverse. In this framework, the universal wavefunction splits into decohered reflected and transmitted branches under the environmetal effect after encountring a potential barrier. The observed tunneling is then experienced by the observer located in a tunneled world. The tunneling probability and the tunneling time are investigated in terms of the tunneled world relative weights and the branching duration, respectively. The macroscopic quantum tunneling, recently honored, is also discussed and the corresponding macroscopic tunneling time is approached based on the obtained results and known data.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Purification Controller for Quantum Networks: Dynamic Protocol Selection and Multipartite Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18351v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient entanglement distribution is a cornerstone of the Quantum Internet. However, physical link parameters such as photon loss, memory coherence time, and gate error rates fluctuate dynamically, rendering static purification strategies suboptimal. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Purification Controller (APC) that automatically optimizes the entanglement distillation sequence to maximize the goodput, i.e., the rate of delivered pairs meeting a strict fidelity threshold. By treating protocol selection as a resource allocation problem, the APC dynamically switches between purification depths and protocols (BBPSSW vs. DEJMPS) to navigate the trade-off between generation rate and state quality. Using a dynamic programming planner with Pareto pruning, simulation results show that our approach mitigates the "fidelity cliffs" inherent in static protocols and reduces resource wastage in high-noise regimes. Furthermore, we extend the controller to heterogeneous scenarios, and evaluate it for both multipartite GHZ state generation and continuous-variable systems using effective noiseless linear amplification models. We benchmark its computational overhead, showing decision latencies in the millisecond range per link in our implementation.</description>

      <title>Remote magnon-phonon entanglement in the waveguide-magnomechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating long-distance quantum entanglement is crucial for advancing quantum information processing. In this work, we propose a protocol for generating remote magnon-phonon entanglement in a hybrid waveguide-magnomechanical system, where multiple spatially separated magnon modes couple to a common waveguide while interacting with their respective phonon modes. By applying tailored pulsed drives and engineering the magnomechanical interactions, our scheme enables the creation of diverse long-distance and dynamically stable entanglement. Beyond basic magnon-phonon two-mode entanglement, it supports genuine multimode entanglement between a single phonon and multiple magnons, bipartite entanglement between a single magnon and multiple phonons, as well as genuine four-mode entanglement involving two magnons and two phonons. Moreover, we show that dissipative magnon-magnon interactions mediated by traveling photons can generate substantially stronger remote entanglement than coherent couplings. Our work provides an experimentally feasible scheme for the remote generation of magnon-phonon entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03924v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive exact, universal, closed-form quantum Monte Carlo estimators for finite-temperature energy susceptibility and fidelity susceptibility, applicable to essentially arbitrary Hamiltonians. Combined with recent advancements in Monte Carlo, our approach enables a black-box framework for studying quantum phase transitions--without requiring prior knowledge of an order parameter or the manual design of model-specific ergodic quantum Monte Carlo update rules. We demonstrate the utility of our method by applying a single implementation to the transverse-field Ising model, the XXZ model, and an ensemble of models related by random unitaries.</description>

      <title>Observation of dislocation bound states and skin effects in non-Hermitian Chern insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The confluence of non-Hermitian (NH) topology and crystal defects has culminated significant interest, yet its experimental exploration has been limited due to the challenges involved in design and measurements. Here, we showcase experimental observation of NH dislocation bound states (NHDS) and the dislocation-induced NH skin effect in two-dimensional acoustic NH Chern lattices. By embedding an edge dislocations-antidislocation pair in such acoustic lattices and implementing precision-controlled hopping and onsite gain/loss via active meta-atoms, we reveal robust defect-bound states localized at dislocation cores within the line gap of the complex energy spectrum. We experimentally identify the emergence of bulk exceptional points (EPs) via spectral coalescence and phase rigidity analysis. We demonstrate that the NHDS survive against moderate NH perturbations but gradually delocalize and merge with the bulk (skin) states driven by these EPs under periodic (open) boundary conditions. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that the dislocation core can feature weak NH skin effects when its direction is perpendicular to the Burgers vector in periodic systems. Our findings, therefore, pave an experimental pathway for probing NH topology via lattice defects and open new avenues for defect-engineered topological devices.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Oscillations as a Probe of Macrorealism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The correlations between successive measurements of a quantum system can violate a family of Leggett-Garg Inequalities (LGIs) that are analogous to the violation of Bell's inequalities of measurements performed on spatially separated quantum systems. These LGIs follow from a macrorealistic point of view, imposing that a classical system is at all times in a definite state and that a measurement can, at least in principle, leave this state undisturbed. Violations of LGIs can be probed by neutrino flavour oscillations if the correlators of consecutive flavour measurements are approximately stationary. We discuss here several improvements of the methodology used in previous analyses based on accelerator and reactor neutrino data. We argue that the strong claims of LGI violations made in previous studies are based on an unsuitable modelling of macrorealistic systems in statistical hypothesis tests. We illustrate our improved methodology via the example of the MINOS muon-neutrino survival data, where we find revised statistical evidence for violations of LGIs at the $(2-3)\sigma$ level, depending on macrorealistic background models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a typical finite temperature quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation, estimators for simple static observables such as specific heat and magnetization are known. With a great deal of system-specific manual labor, one can sometimes also derive more complicated non-local or even dynamic observable estimators. Within the permutation matrix representation (PMR) flavor of QMC, however, we show that one can derive formal estimators for arbitrary static observables. We also derive exact, explicit estimators for general imaginary-time correlation functions and non-trivial integrated susceptibilities thereof. We demonstrate the practical versatility of our method by estimating various non-local, random observables for the transverse-field Ising model on a square lattice.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Harvesting from Quantum Field: Insights via the Partner Formula</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the condition necessary for extracting entanglement from a quantum field through the use of two local modes A and B (detector modes). We show that Simon's entanglement criterion for the bipartite Gaussian state can be reformulated in terms of commutators between the canonical operators of the detector mode B and the partner mode P of the detector mode A. Using the profile representation of detector modes, we identify that harvesting is prohibited under certain specific conditions. According to analyses based on moving mirror models, Hawking radiation originates from the Milne modes at past null infinity, that reflect off at the mirror and ultimately transform into real particle modes. Drawing parallels between the Unruh effect and Hawking radiation, our findings indicate an absence of quantum correlations between ``real particles" emitted as Hawking radiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09857v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces the High-Order Hermite Optimization (HOHO) method, an open-loop discrete adjoint method for quantum optimal control. Our method is the first of its kind to efficiently compute exact (discrete) gradients when using continuous, parameterized control pulses while solving the forward equations (e.g. Schrodinger's equation or the Linblad master equation) with an arbitrarily high-order Hermite Runge-Kutta method. The HOHO method is implemented in QuantumGateDesign$.$jl (https://github.com/leespen1/QuantumGateDesign.jl), an open-source software package for the Julia programming language, which we use to perform numerical experiments comparing the method to Juqbox$.$jl (https://github.com/LLNL/Juqbox.jl). For realistic model problems we observe speedups up to 775x.</description>

      <title>Redefining Neural Operators in $d+1$ Dimensions for Embedding Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11766v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Operators (NOs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning mappings between function spaces. Among them, the kernel integral operator has been widely used in universally approximating architectures. Following the original formulation, most advancements focus on designing better parameterizations for the kernel over the original physical domain (with $d$ spatial dimensions, $d\in{1,2,3,\ldots}$). In contrast, embedding evolution remains largely unexplored, which often drives models toward brute-force embedding lengthening to improve approximation, but at the cost of substantially increased computation.
  In this paper, we introduce an auxiliary dimension that explicitly models embedding evolution in operator form, thereby redefining the NO framework in $d+1$ dimensions (the original $d$ dimensions plus one auxiliary dimension). Under this formulation, we develop a Schr\"odingerised Kernel Neural Operator (SKNO), which leverages Fourier-based operators to model the $d+1$ dimensional evolution. Across more than ten increasingly challenging benchmarks, ranging from the 1D heat equation to the highly nonlinear 3D Rayleigh-Taylor instability, SKNO consistently outperforms other baselines. We further validate its resolution invariance under mixed-resolution training and super-resolution inference, and evaluate zero-shot generalization to unseen temporal regimes. In addition, we present a broader set of design choices for the lifting and recovery operators, demonstrating their impact on SKNO's predictive performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Information Science (QIS) is a vast, diverse, and abstract field. In consequence, learners face many challenges. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education research has found that visualizations are valuable to aid learners in complex matters. The conditions under which visualizations pose benefits are largely unexplored in QIS education. In this eye-tracking study, we examine the conditions under which the visualization of multi-qubit systems with the Dimensional Circle Notation (DCN) in addition to the mathematical symbolic Dirac Notation (DN) is associated with a benefit for solving problems on the ubiquitously used Hadamard gate operation in terms of performance, Extraneous Cognitive Load (ECL) and Intrinsic Cognitive Load (ICL). We find that DCN increases performance and reduces cognitive load for participants with little experience in quantum physics. In addition, representational competence is able to predict reductions in ECL with DCN, but not performance or ICL. Analysis of the eye-tracking results indicates that task solvers with more transitions between DN and DCN benefit less from the visualization. We discuss the generalizability of the results and practical implications.</description>

Abstract: We study the symmetry-resolved genuine multi-entropy, a measure that captures genuine multi-partite entanglement, in Haar random states and random graph states in the presence of a conserved quantity. For Haar random states, we derive explicit formulae for the genuine multi-entropy under a global $U(1)$ symmetry in the thermodynamic limit, and find that its dependence on subsystem sizes closely resembles that of fully Haar random states without a conserved charge. We also perform numerical analyses, focusing on spin systems for both Haar random and graph states. For random graph states, our numerical analyses reveal distinctive features of their multi-partite entanglement structure and we contrast them with the Haar random case.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with classical optimization techniques like AdamW to improve convergence and generalization. However, the mechanisms by which quantum-inspired methods enhance classical training remain underexplored. We introduce Superpositional Gradient Descent (SGD), a novel optimizer linking gradient updates with quantum superposition by injecting quantum circuit perturbations. We present a mathematical framework and implement hybrid quantum-classical circuits in PyTorch and Qiskit. On synthetic sequence classification and large-scale LLM fine-tuning, SGD converges faster and yields lower final loss than AdamW. Despite promising results, scalability and hardware constraints limit adoption. Overall, this work provides new insights into the intersection of quantum computing and deep learning, suggesting practical pathways for leveraging quantum principles to control and enhance model behavior.</description>

      <title>Quantum quenches across continuous and first-order quantum transitions in one-dimensional quantum Ising models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics generated by quantum quenches (QQs) of the Hamiltonian parameters in many-body systems, focusing on protocols that cross first-order and continuous quantum transitions, both in finite-size systems and in the thermodynamic limit. As a paradigmatic example, we consider the quantum Ising chain in the presence of homogeneous transverse ($g$) and longitudinal ($h$) magnetic fields. This model exhibits a continuous quantum transition (CQT) at $g=g_c$ and $h=0$, and first-order quantum transitions (FOQTs) driven by $h$ along the line $h=0$ ($g&lt;g_c$). In the integrable limit $h=0$, the system can be mapped onto a quadratic fermionic theory; however, any nonvanishing longitudinal field breaks integrability and the spectrum of the resulting Hamiltonian is generally expected to enter a chaotic regime. We analyze QQs in which the longitudinal field is suddenly changed from a negative value $h_i &lt; 0$ to a positive value $h_f&gt;0$. We focus on values of $h_f$ such that the spectrum of the post-QQ Hamiltonian $H(g,h_f)$ lies in the chaotic regime, where thermalization may emerge at asymptotically long times. We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics for different values of $g$, finding qualitatively distinct behaviors for $g &gt; g_c$ (where the chain is in the disordered phase), for $g = g_c$ (QQ across the CQT), and for $g&lt;g_c$ (QQ across the FOQT line).</description>

      <title>Run-and-Tumble Dynamics and Zeno--Anti-Zeno Transition in Biased Quantum Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify the transition from the oscillatory Rabi regime to the localized Zeno/Anti-Zeno regime in continuous measurement and feedback of a qubit as a quantum analogue of Motility-Induced Phase Separation (MIPS). A mapping between a biased monitored qubit and a classical ``Run-and-Tumble" active particle is studied. We demonstrate that the competition between coherent Rabi driving (analogous to active motility) and measurement-induced feedback bias (analogous to persistence) mimics the behavior of biological swimmers. This framework provides a picture of measurement-induced phase transitions using the language of active matter and offering a novel pathway for designing dissipative noisy quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Trainability-Oriented Hybrid Quantum Regression via Geometric Preconditioning and Curriculum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) have attracted growing interest for scientific machine learning, yet in regression settings they often suffer from limited trainability under noisy gradients and ill-conditioned optimization. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical regression framework designed to mitigate these bottlenecks. Our model prepends a lightweight classical embedding that acts as a learnable geometric preconditioner, reshaping the input representation to better condition a downstream variational quantum circuit. Building on this architecture, we introduce a curriculum optimization protocol that progressively increases circuit depth and transitions from SPSA-based stochastic exploration to Adam-based gradient fine-tuning. We evaluate the approach on PDE-informed regression benchmarks and standard regression datasets under a fixed training budget in a simulator setting. Empirically, the proposed framework consistently improves over pure QNN baselines and yields more stable convergence in data-limited regimes. We further observe reduced structured errors that are visually correlated with oscillatory components on several scientific benchmarks, suggesting that geometric preconditioning combined with curriculum training is a practical approach for stabilizing quantum regression.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Geometry for Spin-Adapted Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and numerically analyze an algebraic-geometric framework for spin-adapted coupled-cluster (CC) theory. Since the electronic Hamiltonian is SU(2)-invariant, physically relevant quantum states lie in the spin singlet sector. We give an explicit description of the SU(2)-invariant (spin singlet) many-body space by identifying it with an Artinian commutative ring, called the excitation ring, whose dimension is governed by a Narayana number. We define spin-adapted truncation varieties via embeddings of graded subspaces of this ring, and we identify the CCS truncation variety with the Veronese square of the Grassmannian. Compared to the spin-generalized formulation, this approach yields a substantial reduction in dimension and degree, with direct computational consequences. In particular, the CC degree of the truncation variety -- governing the number of homotopy paths required to compute all CC solutions -- is reduced by orders of magnitude. We present scaling studies demonstrating asymptotic improvements and we exploit this reduction to compute the full solution landscape of spin-adapted CC equations for water and lithium hydride.</description>

      <title>When Does Adaptation Win? Scaling Laws for Meta-Learning in Quantum Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum hardware suffers from intrinsic device heterogeneity and environmental drift, forcing practitioners to choose between suboptimal non-adaptive controllers or costly per-device recalibration. We derive a scaling law lower bound for meta-learning showing that the adaptation gain (expected fidelity improvement from task-specific gradient steps) saturates exponentially with gradient steps and scales linearly with task variance, providing a quantitative criterion for when adaptation justifies its overhead. Validation on quantum gate calibration shows negligible benefits for low-variance tasks but $&gt;40\%$ fidelity gains on two-qubit gates under extreme out-of-distribution conditions (10$\times$ the training noise), with implications for reducing per-device calibration time on cloud quantum processors. Further validation on classical linear-quadratic control confirms these laws emerge from general optimization geometry rather than quantum-specific physics. Together, these results offer a transferable framework for decision-making in adaptive control.</description>
