      <title>Persistent Laplacian Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vectorization methods for \emph{Persistent Homology} (PH), such as the \emph{Persistence Image} (PI), encode persistence diagrams into finite dimensional vector spaces while preserving stability. In parallel, the \emph{Persistent Laplacian} (PL) has been proposed, whose spectra contain the information of PH as well as richer geometric and combinatorial features. In this work, we develop an analogous vectorization for PL. We introduce \emph{signatures} that map PL to real values and assemble these into a \emph{Persistent Laplacian Diagram} (PLD) and a \emph{Persistent Laplacian Image} (PLI). We prove the stability of PLI under the noise on PD. Furthermore, we illustrate the resulting framework on explicit graph examples that are indistinguishable by both PH and a signature of the combinatorial Laplacian but are separated by the signature of PL.</description>

      <title>Cohomology Theories of Partial Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of cohomology theories for partial groups, algebraic structures introduced by Chermak that generalize groups by allowing only partially defined products. Inspired by classical group cohomology, we develop two parallel approaches - an algebraic theory based on Chermak's framework and a simplicial-set-based theory using local coefficient systems - and show that they coincide. As an application, we illustrate how the extension theory of partial groups, as developed by Broto and Gonzalez, can be interpreted and computed using our cohomology theory, including explicit examples such as extensions of free partial groups, and compare these results with classical group extensions.</description>

      <title>A decomposition theorem for topological branched coverings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of complex algebraic varieties, the decomposition theorem for semi-small maps provides a decomposition of the direct image of the constant sheaf. In this work, we develop a decomposition theorem for branched coverings of topological spaces. To achieve this, we start by constructing a decomposition theorem for unramified covering maps using transition functions. For a given branched covering of closed topological manifolds, we use the previous result to establish a decomposition of the direct image of the constant sheaf on the covering space. In the next step, we generalize our discussion to the case where the target space is not necessarily a topological manifold.</description>

      <title>Cornered skein lasagna theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the skein lasagna theory of Morrison-Walker-Wedrich to 4-manifolds with corners and formulate gluing formulas for 4-manifolds with boundary and, more generally, with corners. As an application, we develop a categorical framework for a presentation of the skein lasagna module of trisected closed 4-manifolds. Further, we extend the theory to dimension two by introducing bicategories for closed oriented surfaces and proving a gluing formula for the categories associated with 3-manifolds with boundary.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal calculations in fundamental groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20264v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Hopf invariants, defined by evaluation in Harrison cohomology of the commutative cochains of a space, calculate the logarithm map from a fundamental group to its Malcev Lie algebra. They thus present the zeroth Harrison cohomology as a universal dual object to the Malcev Lie algebra. This structural theorem supports explicit calculations in algebraic topology, geometric topology, and combinatorial group theory. In particular, we give the first algorithm to determine whether a power of a word is a k-fold nested commutator while encoding commutator structure in any group presented by generators and relations.</description>

      <title>On hyperbolic links associated to Eulerian cycles on ideal right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Eulerian cycles without transversal selfintersections in $4$-valent planar graphs. We prove that any cycle of this type in the graph of an ideal right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytope corresponds to a hyperbolic link such that its complement consists of $4$-copies of this polytope glued according to its checkerboard coloring. Moreover, this link consists of trivially embedded circles bijectively corresponding to the vertices of the polytope. For such cycles we prove that the $3$-antiprism $A(3)$ (octahedron) has exactly $2$ combinatorially different cycles, the $4$-antiprism $A(4)$ has exactly $7$ combinatorially different cycles, and these cycles correspond to $7$ cycles (perhaps combinatorially equivalent) on any polytope different from antiprisms, and any antiprism $A(k)$ has at least $2$ combinatorially different cycles. The $2$-fold branched covering space corresponding to our link is a small cover over some simple $3$-polytope. This small cover is defined by a Hamiltonian cycle on it. We show that any Hamiltonian cycle on a compact right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytope arises in this way, while for a Hamiltonian cycle on a right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytope of finite volume the necessary and sufficient condition is that at each ideal vertex it does not go straight. We introduce a transformation of a Eulerian cycle along conjugated vertices allowing to build new cycles from a given one.</description>
