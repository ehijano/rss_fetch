      <title>The Cordiality Game and the Game Cordiality Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cordiality game is played on a graph $G$ by two players, Admirable (A) and Impish (I), who take turns selecting \track{unlabeled} vertices of $G$. Admirable labels the selected vertices by $0$ and Impish by $1$, and the resulting label on any edge is the sum modulo $2$ of the labels of the vertices incident to that edge. The two players have opposite goals: Admirable attempts to minimize the number of edges with different labels as much as possible while Impish attempts to maximize this number. When both Admirable and Impish play their optimal games, we define the \emph{game cordiality number}, $c_g(G)$, as the absolute difference between the number of edges labeled zero and one. Let $P_n$ be the path on $n$ vertices. We show $c_g(P_n)\le \frac{n-3}{3}$ when $n \equiv 0 \pmod 3$, $c_g(P_n)\le \frac{n-1}{3}$ when $n \equiv 1 \pmod 3$, and $c_g(P_n)\le \frac{n+1}{3}$ when $n \equiv 2\pmod 3$. Furthermore, we show a similar bound, $c_g(T) \leq \frac{|T|}{2}$ holds for any tree $T$.</description>

      <title>Arc-transitive maps with coprime Euler characteristic and edge number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is one of a series of papers which aim towards a classification of edge-transitive maps of which the Euler characteristic and the edge number are coprime. This one carries out the classification work for arc-transitive maps with nonsolvable automorphism groups, which illustrates how the edge number impacts on the Euler characteristic for maps. The classification is involved with the construction of some new and interesting arc-regular maps.</description>

      <title>Small planar hypohamiltonian graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is hypohamiltonian if it is non-Hamiltonian, but the deletion of every single vertex gives a Hamiltonian graph. Until now, the smallest known planar hypohamiltonian graph had 40 vertices, a result due to Jooyandeh, McKay, \"Osterg{\aa}rd, Pettersson, and Zamfirescu. That result is here improved upon by two planar hypohamiltonian graphs on 34 vertices. We exploited a special subgraph contained in two graphs of Jooyandeh et al., and modified it to construct the two 34-vertex graphs and six planar hypohamiltonian graphs on 37 vertices. Each of the 34-vertex graphs has 26 cubic vertices, improving upon the result of Jooyandeh et al. that planar hypohamiltonian graphs have 30 cubic vertices. We use the 34-vertex graphs to construct hypohamiltonian graphs of order 34 with crossing number 1, improving the best-known bound of 36 due to Wiener. Whether there exists a planar hypohamiltonian graph on 41 vertices was an open question. We settled this question by applying an operation introduced by Thomassen to the 37-vertex graphs to obtain several planar hypohamiltonian graphs on 41 vertices. The 25 planar hypohamiltonian graphs on 40 vertices of Jooyandeh et al. have no nontrivial automorphisms. The result is here improved upon by six planar hypohamiltonian graphs on 40 vertices with nontrivial automorphisms. The smallest known cubic planar hypohamiltonian graph has 70 vertices, a graph due to Araya and Wiener. We present another cubic planar hypohamiltonian graph on 70 vertices.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning for graph theory, I. Reimplementation of Wagner's approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reimplement here the recent approach of Adam Zsolt Wagner [arXiv:2104.14516], which applies reinforcement learning to construct (counter)examples in graph theory, in order to make it more readable, more stable and much faster. The presented concepts are illustrated by constructing counterexamples for a number of published conjectured bounds for the Laplacian spectral radius of graphs.</description>

      <title>On the $A_\alpha$-index of graphs with given order and dissociation number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G,$ a subset of vertices is called a maximum dissociation set of $G$ if it induces a subgraph with vertex degree at most 1, and the subset has maximum cardinality. The cardinality of a maximum dissociation set is called the dissociation number of $G$. The adjacency matrix and the degree diagonal matrix of $G$ are denoted by $A(G)$ and $D(G),$ respectively. In 2017, Nikiforov proposed the $A_\alpha$-matrix: $A_\alpha(G)=\alpha D(G)+(1-\alpha)A(G),$ where $\alpha\in[0,1].$ The largest eigenvalue of this novel matrix is called the $A_\alpha$-index of $G.$ In this paper, we firstly determine the connected graph (resp. bipartite graph, tree) having the largest $A_\alpha$-index over all connected graphs (resp. bipartite graphs, trees) with fixed order and dissociation number. Secondly, we describe the structure of all the $n$-vertex graphs having the minimum $A_\alpha$-index with dissociation number $\tau$, where $\tau\geqslant\lceil\frac{2}{3}n\rceil.$ Finally, we identify all the connected $n$-vertex graphs with dissociation number $\tau\in\{2,\lceil\frac{2}{3}n\rceil,n-1,n-2\}$ having the minimum $A_\alpha$-index.</description>

      <title>Creating spanning trees in Waiter-Client games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a positive integer $n$ and a tree $T_n$ on $n$ vertices, we consider an unbiased Waiter-Client game $\textrm{WC}(n,T_n)$ played on the complete graph~$K_n$, in which Waiter's goal is to force Client to build a copy of $T_n$. We prove that for every constant $c&lt;1/3$, if $\Delta(T_n)\le cn$ and $n$ is sufficiently large, then Waiter has a winning strategy in $\textrm{WC}(n,T_n)$. On the other hand, we show that there exist a positive constant $c'&lt;1/2$ and a family of trees $T_{n}$ with $\Delta(T_n)\le c'n$ such that Client has a winning strategy in the $\textrm{WC}(n,T_n)$ game for every $n$ sufficiently large. We also consider the corresponding problem in the Client-Waiter version of the game.</description>

      <title>A Proof of the Box Conjecture for Commuting Pairs of Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the Box Conjecture for pairs of commuting nilpotent matrices, as formulated by Iarrobino et al \cite{IKvSZ}. This describes the Jordan type of the dense orbit in the nilpotent commutator of a given nilpotent matrix. Our main tool is the Burge correspondence between the set of all partitions and a set of binary words \cite{Bur-1, Bur-2}. For connection with the algebraic and geometric setup of matrices and orbits we employ some of Shayman's results on invariant subspaces of a nilpotent matrix \cite{Sha-1,Sha-2}. Our proof is valid over an arbitrary field.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a prime $p$ we construct a subset of $\mathbb{F}_p^{(k^2-k)/2}$ of size $p^{(k^2-k)/2-1}$ that does not contain progressions of length $k$. More generally, we show that for any prime power $q$ there is a subset of $\mathbb{F}_q^{(k^2-k)/2}$ of size $q^{(k^2-k)/2-1}$ that does not contain $k$ points on a line. This yields the first asympotic lower bounds $c^n$ for the size of $p$-progression-free sets in $\mathbb{F}_p^{n}$ with $c=p-o(1)$, as $p$ tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>On the scaling of random Tamari intervals and Schnyder woods of random triangulations (with an asymptotic D-finite trick)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Tamari interval of size $n$ (i.e., a pair of Dyck paths which are comparable for the Tamari relation) chosen uniformly at random. We show that the height of a uniformly chosen vertex on the upper or lower path scales as $n^{3/4}$, and has an explicit limit law. By the Bernardi-Bonichon bijection, this result also describes the height of points in the canonical Schnyder trees of a uniform random plane triangulation of size $n$.
  The exact solution of the model is based on polynomial equations with one and two catalytic variables. To prove the convergence from the exact solution, we use a version of moment pumping based on D-finiteness, which is essentially automatic and should apply to many other models. We are not sure to have seen this simple trick used before.
  It would be interesting to study the universality of this convergence for decomposition trees associated to positive Bousquet-M\'elou--Jehanne equations.</description>

      <title>On two algebras of token graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $k$-token graph $F_k(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the graph whose vertices are the $k$-subsets of vertices from $G$, two of which being adjacent whenever their symmetric difference is a pair of adjacent vertices in $G$.
  In this article, we describe some properties of the Laplacian matrix $\L_k$ of $F_k(G)$ and the Laplacian matrix $\overline{\L}_k$ of the $k$-token graph $F_k(\overline{G})$ of its complement $\overline{G}$.
  In this context, a result about the commutativity of the matrices $\L_k$ and $\overline{\L}_k$ was given in [C. Dalf\'o, F. Duque, R. Fabila-Monroy, M. A. Fiol, C. Huemer, A. L. Trujillo-Negrete, and F. J. Zaragoza Mart\'{\i}nez,
  On the Laplacian spectra of token graphs,
  {\em Linear Algebra Appl.} {\bf 625} (2021) 322--348], but the proof was incomplete, and there were some typos. Here, we give the correct proof.
  Based on this result, and fixed the pair $(n,k)$ and the graph $G$, we first introduce a `local' algebra ${\cal L}(G)$, generated by the pair $(\L_k, \overline{\L}_k)$, showing its closed relationship with the Bose-Mesner algebra of the Johnson graphs $J(n,k)$.
  Finally, fixed only $(n,k)$, we present a `global' algebra ${\cal A}(n,k)$ that contains ${\cal L}(G)$ together with the Laplacian and adjacency matrices of the $k$-token graph of any graph $G$ on $n$ vertices.</description>

      <title>Antimagic Labeling of Graphs Using Prime Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph labeling is a technique that assigns unique labels or weights to the vertices or edges of a graph, often used to analyze and solve various graph-related problems. There are few methods with certain limitations conducted by researchers previously on this topic. This research paper focuses on antimagic labeling of different types of graphs and trees. It entails the assignment of distinct prime values to edges in a manner that ensures the cumulative sum of edge labels at each vertex remains unique. This research proposes a conjecture on antimagic labeling of any graphs and proves two theories. Firstly, we tried to give weights to the edges randomly, as some exceptions are faced in particular phases in this way, we followed a whole new way to mitigate this problem. This research paper demonstrates computational and mathematical verification to prove that antimagic labeling of any perfect binary tree and complete graph is possible.</description>

      <title>Randomisation in the Josephus Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Josephus problem is a well--studied elimination problem consisting in determining the position of the survivor after repeated applications of a deterministic rule removing one person at a time from a given group.
  A natural probabilistic variant of this process is introduced in this paper. More precisely, in this variant, the survivor is determined after performing a succession of Bernouilli trials with parameter $p$ designating each time the person to remove. When the number of participants tends to infinity, the main result characterises the limit distribution of the position of the survivor with an increasing degree of precision as the parameter approaches the unbiaised case $p=1/2$. Then, the convergence rate to the position of the survivor is obtained in the form of a Central-Limit Theorem.
  A number of other variants of the suggested probabilistic elimination process are also considered. They each admit a specific limit behavior which, in most cases, is stated in the form of an open problem.</description>

      <title>The 2D Toda lattice hierarchy for multiplicative functionals of Schur measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove Fredholm determinants build out from generalizations of Schur measures, or equivalently, arbitrary multiplicative functionals of the original Schur measures are tau-functions of the 2D Toda lattice hierarchy. Our result apply to finite temperature Schur measures, and extends both the result of Okounkov in \cite{okounkovschurmeasures} and of Cafasso-Ruzza in \cite{cafassoruzza} concerning the finite-temperature Plancherel measure. Our proof lies on the semi-infinite wedge formalism and the Boson-Fermion correspondance.</description>

      <title>Forbidden complexes for the 3-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simplicial complex is said to be {\em critical} (or {\em forbidden}) for the 3-sphere $S^3$ if it cannot be embedded in $S^3$ but after removing any one point, it can be embedded.
  We show that if a multibranched surface cannot be embedded in $S^3$, it contains a critical complex which is a union of a multibranched surface and a (possibly empty) graph. We exhibit all critical complexes for $S^3$ which are contained in $K_5 \times S^1$ and $K_{3,3} \times S^1$ families. We also classify all critical complexes for $S^3$ which can be decomposed into $G\times S^1$ and $H$, where $G$ and $H$ are graphs.
  In spite of the above property, there exist complexes which cannot be embedded in $S^3$, but they do not contain any critical complexes. From the property of those examples, we define an equivalence relation on all simplicial complexes $\mathcal{C}$ and a partially ordered set of complexes $(\mathcal{C}/\mathord\sim; \subseteqq)$, and refine the definition of critical. According to the refined definition of critical, we show that if a complex $X$ cannot be embedded in $S^3$, then there exists $[X']\subseteqq [X]$ such that $[X']$ is critical for $[S^3]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general homological approach to presentations of connected graded associative algebras, and apply it to loop homology of moment-angle complexes $Z_K$ that correspond to flag simplicial complexes $K$. For arbitrary coefficient ring, we describe generators of the Pontryagin algebra $H_*(\Omega Z_K)$ and defining relations between them. We prove that such moment-angle complexes are coformal over $\mathbb{Q},$ give a necessary condition for rational formality, and compute their homotopy groups in terms of homotopy groups of spheres.</description>

      <title>Rainbow Hamiltonicity in uniformly coloured perturbed digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of a rainbow Hamilton cycle in a uniformly edge-coloured randomly perturbed digraph. We show that for every $\delta \in (0,1)$ there exists $C = C(\delta) &gt; 0$ such that the following holds. Let $D_0$ be an $n$-vertex digraph with minimum semidegree at least $\delta n$ and suppose that each edge of the union of $D_0$ with the random digraph $D(n, p)$ on the same vertex set gets a colour in $[n]$ independently and uniformly at random. Then, with high probability, $D_0 \cup D(n, p)$ has a rainbow directed Hamilton cycle.
  This improves a result of Aigner-Horev and Hefetz (2021) who proved the same in the undirected setting when the edges are coloured uniformly in a set of $(1 + \varepsilon)n$ colours.</description>

      <title>Indicated domination game</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the success of domination games and by a variation of the coloring game called the indicated coloring game, we introduce a version of domination games called the indicated domination game. It is played on an arbitrary graph $G$ by two players, Dominator and Staller, where Dominator wants to finish the game in as few rounds as possible while Staller wants just the opposite. In each round, Dominator indicates a vertex $u$ of $G$ that has not been dominated by previous selections of Staller, which, by the rules of the game, forces Staller to select a vertex in the closed neighborhood of $u$. The game is finished when all vertices of $G$ become dominated by the vertices selected by Staller. Assuming that both players are playing optimally according to their goals, the number of selected vertices during the game is the indicated domination number, $\gamma_i(G)$, of $G$.
  We prove several bounds on the indicated domination number expressed in terms of other graph invariants. In particular, we find a place of the new graph invariant in the well-known domination chain, by showing that $\gamma_i(G)\ge \Gamma(G)$ for all graphs $G$, and by showing that the indicated domination number is incomparable with the game domination number and also with the upper irredundance number. In connection with the trivial upper bound $\gamma_i(G)\le n(G)-\delta(G)$, we characterize the class of graphs $G$ attaining the bound provided that $n(G)\ge 2\delta(G)+2$. We prove that in trees, split graphs and grids the indicated domination number equals the independence number. We also find a formula for the indicated domination number of powers of paths, from which we derive that there exist graphs in which the indicated domination number is arbitrarily larger than the upper irredundance number.</description>

      <title>Flip-Breakability: A Combinatorial Dichotomy for Monadically Dependent Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A conjecture in algorithmic model theory predicts that the model-checking problem for first-order logic is fixed-parameter tractable on a hereditary graph class if and only if the class is monadically dependent. Originating in model theory, this notion is defined in terms of logic, and encompasses nowhere dense classes, monadically stable classes, and classes of bounded twin-width. Working towards this conjecture, we provide the first two combinatorial characterizations of monadically dependent graph classes. This yields the following dichotomy.
  On the structure side, we characterize monadic dependence by a Ramsey-theoretic property called flip-breakability. This notion generalizes the notions of uniform quasi-wideness, flip-flatness, and bounded grid rank, which characterize nowhere denseness, monadic stability, and bounded twin-width, respectively, and played a key role in their respective model checking algorithms. Natural restrictions of flip-breakability additionally characterize bounded treewidth and cliquewidth and bounded treedepth and shrubdepth.
  On the non-structure side, we characterize monadic dependence by explicitly listing few families of forbidden induced subgraphs. This result is analogous to the characterization of nowhere denseness via forbidden subdivided cliques, and allows us to resolve one half of the motivating conjecture: First-order model checking is AW[$*$]-hard on every hereditary graph class that is monadically independent. The result moreover implies that hereditary graph classes which are small, have almost bounded twin-width, or have almost bounded flip-width, are monadically dependent.
  Lastly, we lift our result to also obtain a combinatorial dichotomy in the more general setting of monadically dependent classes of binary structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any graph $G = (V,E)$ and positive integer $d$, the exact distance-$d$ graph $G_{=d}$ is the graph with vertex set $V$, where two vertices are adjacent if and only if the distance between them in $G$ is $d$. We study the exact distance-$d$ Kneser graphs. For these graphs, we characterize the adjacency of vertices in terms of the cardinality of the intersection between them. We present formulas describing the distance between any pair of vertices and we compute the diameter of these graphs.</description>

      <title>Boundary current fluctuations for the half space ASEP and six vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16335v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study fluctuations of the current at the boundary for the half space asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) and the height function of the half space six vertex model at the boundary at large times. We establish a phase transition depending on the asymptotic density of particles at the boundary, with GSE and GOE limits as well as the Baik--Rains crossover distribution near the critical point. This was previously known for half space last passage percolation, and recently established for the half space log-gamma polymer and KPZ equation in the groundbreaking work of Imamura, Mucciconi, and Sasamoto.
  The proof uses the underlying algebraic structure of these models in a crucial way to obtain exact formulas. In particular, we show a relationship between the half space six vertex model and a half space Hall--Littlewood measure with two boundary parameters, which is then matched to a free boundary Schur process via a new identity of symmetric functions. Fredholm Pfaffian formulas are established for the half space ASEP and six vertex model, indicating a hidden free fermionic structure.</description>

      <title>Noise Sensitivity of the Minimum Spanning Tree of the Complete Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07357v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the noise sensitivity of the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the $n$-vertex complete graph when edges are assigned independent random weights. It is known that when the graph distance is rescaled by $n^{1/3}$ and vertices are given a uniform measure, the MST converges in distribution in the Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov (GHP) topology. We prove that if the weight of each edge is resampled independently with probability $\varepsilon\gg n^{-1/3}$, then the pair of rescaled minimum spanning trees -- before and after the noise -- converges in distribution to independent random spaces. Conversely, if $\varepsilon\ll n^{-1/3}$, the GHP distance between the rescaled trees goes to $0$ in probability. This implies the noise sensitivity and stability for every property of the MST that corresponds to a continuity set of the random limit. The noise threshold of $n^{-1/3}$ coincides with the critical window of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs. In fact, these results follow from an analog theorem we prove regarding the minimum spanning forest of critical random graphs.</description>

      <title>Classical values of Zeta, as simple as possible but not simpler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This short note for non-experts means to demystify the tasks of evaluating the Riemann Zeta Function at non-positive integers and at even natural numbers, both initially performed by Leonhard Euler. Treading in the footsteps of G. H. Hardy and others, I re-examine Euler's work on the functional equation for the Zeta function, and explain how both the functional equation and all `classical' integer values can be obtained in one sweep using only Euler's favorite method of generating functions. As a counter-point, I also present an even simpler argument essentially due to Bernhard Riemann, which however requires Cauchy's residue theorem, a result not yet available to Euler. As a final point, I endeavor to clarify how these two methods are organically linked and can be taught as an intuitive gateway into the world of Zeta functionology.</description>

      <title>Matching powers of monomial ideals and edge ideals of weighted oriented graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of matching powers of monomial ideals. Let $I$ be a monomial ideal of $S=K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$, with $K$ a field. The $k$th matching power of $I$ is the monomial ideal $I^{[k]}$ generated by the products $u_1\cdots u_k$ where $u_1,\dots,u_k$ is a monomial regular sequence contained in $I$. This concept naturally generalizes that of squarefree powers of squarefree monomial ideals. We study depth and regularity functions of matching powers of monomial ideals and edge ideals of weighted oriented graphs. We show that the last nonvanishing power of a quadratic monomial ideal is always polymatroidal and thus has a linear resolution. When $I$ is a non-quadratic edge ideal of a weighted oriented forest, we characterize when $I^{[k]}$ has a linear resolution.</description>

      <title>The Origin of Calabi-Yau Crystals in BPS States Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the counting problem of BPS D-branes wrapping holomorphic cycles of a general toric Calabi-Yau manifold. We evaluate the Jeffrey-Kirwan residues for the flavoured Witten index for the supersymmetric quiver quantum mechanics on the worldvolume of the D-branes, and find that BPS degeneracies are described by a statistical mechanical model of crystal melting. For Calabi-Yau threefolds, we reproduce the crystal melting models long known in the literature. For Calabi-Yau fourfolds, however, we find that the crystal does not contain the full information for the BPS degeneracy and we need to explicitly evaluate non-trivial weights assigned to the crystal configurations. Our discussions treat Calabi-Yau threefolds and fourfolds on equal footing, and include discussions on elliptic and rational generalizations of the BPS states counting, connections to the mathematical definition of generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants, examples of wall crossings, and of trialities in quiver gauge theories.</description>
