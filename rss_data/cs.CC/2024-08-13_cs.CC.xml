      <title>Stabilizer bootstrapping: A recipe for efficient agnostic tomography and magic estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the task of agnostic tomography: given copies of an unknown $n$-qubit state $\rho$ which has fidelity $\tau$ with some state in a given class $C$, find a state which has fidelity $\ge \tau - \epsilon$ with $\rho$. We give a new framework, stabilizer bootstrapping, for designing computationally efficient protocols for this task, and use this to get new agnostic tomography protocols for the following classes:
  Stabilizer states: We give a protocol that runs in time $\mathrm{poly}(n,1/\epsilon)\cdot (1/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\tau))}$, answering an open question posed by Grewal, Iyer, Kretschmer, Liang [40] and Anshu and Arunachalam [6]. Previous protocols ran in time $\mathrm{exp}(\Theta(n))$ or required $\tau&gt;\cos^2(\pi/8)$.
  States with stabilizer dimension $n - t$: We give a protocol that runs in time $n^3\cdot(2^t/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\epsilon))}$, extending recent work on learning quantum states prepared by circuits with few non-Clifford gates, which only applied in the realizable setting where $\tau = 1$ [30, 37, 46, 61].
  Discrete product states: If $C = K^{\otimes n}$ for some $\mu$-separated discrete set $K$ of single-qubit states, we give a protocol that runs in time $(n/\mu)^{O((1 + \log (1/\tau))/\mu)}/\epsilon^2$. This strictly generalizes a prior guarantee which applied to stabilizer product states [39]. For stabilizer product states, we give a further improved protocol that runs in time $(n^2/\epsilon^2)\cdot (1/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\tau))}$.
  As a corollary, we give the first protocol for estimating stabilizer fidelity, a standard measure of magic for quantum states, to error $\epsilon$ in $n^3 \mathrm{quasipoly}(1/\epsilon)$ time.</description>

      <title>Computational Lower Bounds for Graphon Estimation via Low-degree Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15728v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphon estimation has been one of the most fundamental problems in network analysis and has received considerable attention in the past decade. From the statistical perspective, the minimax error rate of graphon estimation has been established by Gao et al (2015) for both stochastic block model and nonparametric graphon estimation. The statistical optimal estimators are based on constrained least squares and have computational complexity exponential in the dimension. From the computational perspective, the best-known polynomial-time estimator is based universal singular value thresholding, but it can only achieve a much slower estimation error rate than the minimax one. The computational optimality of the USVT or the existence of a computational barrier in graphon estimation has been a long-standing open problem. In this work, we provide rigorous evidence for the computational barrier in graphon estimation via low-degree polynomials. Specifically, in SBM graphon estimation, we show that for low-degree polynomial estimators, their estimation error rates cannot be significantly better than that of the USVT under a wide range of parameter regimes and in nonparametric graphon estimation, we show low-degree polynomial estimators achieve estimation error rates strictly slower than the minimax rate. Our results are proved based on the recent development of low-degree polynomials by Schramm and Wein (2022), while we overcome a few key challenges in applying it to the general graphon estimation problem. By leveraging our main results, we also provide a computational lower bound on the clustering error for community detection in SBM with a growing number of communities and this yields a new piece of evidence for the conjectured Kesten-Stigum threshold for efficient community recovery. Finally, we extend our computational lower bounds to sparse graphon estimation and biclustering.</description>

      <title>The Upper Clique Transversal Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A clique transversal in a graph is a set of vertices intersecting all maximal cliques. The problem of determining the minimum size of a clique transversal has received considerable attention in the literature. In this paper, we initiate the study of the ''upper'' variant of this parameter, the upper clique transversal number, defined as the maximum size of a minimal clique transversal. We investigate this parameter from the algorithmic and complexity points of view, with a focus on various graph classes. We show that the corresponding decision problem is NP-complete in the classes of chordal graphs, chordal bipartite graphs, cubic planar bipartite graphs, and line graphs of bipartite graphs, but solvable in linear time in the classes of split graphs, proper interval graphs, and cographs, and in polynomial time for graphs of bounded cliquewidth. We conclude the paper with a number of open questions.</description>

      <title>Token Jumping in Planar Graphs has Linear Sized Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a planar graph and $I_s$ and $I_t$ be two independent sets in $G$, each of size $k$. We begin with a "token" on each vertex of $I_s$ and seek to move all tokens to $I_t$, by repeated "token jumping", removing a single token from one vertex and placing it on another vertex. We require that each intermediate arrangement of tokens again specifies an independent set of size $k$. Given $G$, $I_s$, and $I_t$, we ask whether there exists a sequence of token jumps that transforms $I_s$ to $I_t$. When $k$ is part of the input, this problem is known to be PSPACE-complete. However, it was shown by Ito, Kami\'nski, and Ono to be fixed-parameter tractable. That is, when $k$ is fixed, the problem can be solved in time polynomial in the order of $G$. Here we strengthen the upper bound on the running time in terms of $k$ by showing that the problem has a kernel of size linear in $k$. More precisely, we transform an arbitrary input problem on a planar graph into an equivalent problem on a (planar) graph with order $O(k)$.</description>
