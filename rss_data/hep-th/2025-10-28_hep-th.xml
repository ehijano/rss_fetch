      <title>On the relativistic description of charges fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for describing charged relativistic Fermi fields is proposed, in which particles of opposite charges are treated equally and states with negative energy are excluded. The concept of charge quantum number is introduced. Fields of particles and antiparticles with different charge quantum numbers are associated with wave functions for which the Born interpretation as probability amplitudes is valid.</description>

      <title>Aspects of the bulk flat space limit in AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flat space limit of scalar bulk fields in AdS is discussed within a Lorentzian canonical quantization setup tailored to describe AdS state preparation and to extract the flat S-matrix dynamics. We discuss how the algebraic \`{I}n\"on\"u-Wigner contraction captures the local physics of the equivalence principle in quantum field theory in a fixed background description. We develop the embedding formalism to describe the bulk AdS scalar primary wave functions as holomorphic functions. Flat space massive particle states are built out of the AdS primary together with AdS boosted wave functions. We compute their inner products and show that these become orthogonal in the flat limit, resulting in the correct continuous spectrum for a standard unitary representation of the Lorentz group. In this same limit the original AdS descendants become null states. We also argue how the flat space S-matrix emerges from standard perturbation theory in the interaction picture. To obtain flat space massless particles requires to consider a double scaled limit in which the boost rapidity is scaled to infinity keeping the average particle energy in the flat space limit fixed. We comment on how this limit generates interesting massless state wave functions with non-trivial shape profiles that remember the dimension of the AdS operator. We discuss some of the puzzles attached to these.</description>

      <title>Towards the Non-Perturbative Completion of 4d N=1 Effective Theories of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that four-dimensional $\mathcal N=1$ effective theories of gravity obtained from string compactifications require a non-perturbative completion, as additional light states of non-perturbative origin must be incorporated in the small volume regime to obtain a consistent low-energy description. This completion becomes concrete in subsectors that locally exhibit enhanced supersymmetry, where the enhancement predicts the existence of additional light degrees of freedom absent in the perturbative description. Motivated by analogous setups in six-dimensional $\mathcal N=(1,0)$ theories, we focus on the K\"ahler moduli space of F-theory compactifications on Calabi--Yau fourfolds to four dimensions, where shrinkable curves not intersected by 7-planes realize such supersymmetry-enhanced subsectors. Guided by the enhanced supersymmetry, we use F-theory to identify the degrees of freedom missing in the small volume regime of the perturbative Type IIB description. A consistent embedding of these local subsectors into a four-dimensional $\mathcal N=1$ theory of gravity requires an appropriate inclusion of complex structure moduli and spacetime-filling D3-branes. We also discuss supersymmetry enhancement in the complex structure sector and study how a heterotic dual description gives a unifying picture of the different F-theory sectors with enhanced supersymmetry. Finally, we comment on cases without local supersymmetry enhancement.</description>

      <title>Novel black saddles for 5d gravitational indices and the index enigma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a series of novel Euclidean multi-black-hole, black ring, black Saturn, and black lens solutions to $5d$ supergravity that contribute as saddle-points to the $5d$ gravitational supersymmetric index, either in asymptotically flat space or in asymptotically AdS$_3\times S^2$. All these solutions are supersymmetric, have finite temperature, and an appropriate angular velocity turned on that makes fermionic fields periodic around the thermal circle. They contribute either to the helicity supertrace of supergravity in $5d$ flat space or to the elliptic genus of a supergravity theory in AdS$_3 \times S^2$. Their on-shell actions are independent of temperature, as consistent with the computation of a protected index, and equal to the entropy of the corresponding extremal black object. Our construction relies on uplifting saddles that can be singular in $4d$, but which are desingularized in $5d$. The resulting saddles exhibit a novel ``index enigma'', not encountered in previous Lorentzian solutions. One example of this enigma is that, in the computation of the index in asymptotically flat space, less symmetric black ring saddles dominate over the contributions from $5d$ black holes.</description>

      <title>Higher Curvature Inflation and the Species Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scalar potentials that arise from higher curvature corrections in general $f(R)$ theories of gravity and their connection to a dynamical species scale. Starting from general considerations in arbitrary dimensions, we show that at large field values, the scalar potential generated by an infinite series of curvature terms and the field dependent species scale arising from circle compactification both decay exponentially, in complementary ways. We identify conditions under which these two effects precisely balance out, giving rise to exponentially flat, plateau-like potentials. We additionally find a precise embedding of Starobinsky inflation consistent with the Swampland program, and we discuss possible implications the mechanism proposed could have for M and string theory.</description>

      <title>Generalized Instanton Symmetry Induced by Monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that there exists a generalization of instanton symmmetry in the Coulomb phase of 5d nonabelian gauge theories which is capable of measuring a wider class of topological charges of monopole strings. The symmetry is invertible on compact spacetimes, but non-invertible on spacetimes with boundary. In the case of maximal supersymmetry, we show that this symmetry has a natural origin coming from the 6d $\mathcal N=(2,0)$ superconformal field theory under dimensional reduction. By generalizing this construction to any ADE gauge group, this allows us to propose a broad new class of homotopy invariants provided by the boundary non-invertible symmetry defects.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Quantum Geometry of Torus-fibered Calabi-Yau Threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: About ten years ago, Katz, Klemm and Huang conjectured that topological string amplitudes on compact, elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds at fixed base degree could be expressed in terms of meromorphic Jacobi forms for $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$, giving access to Gromov-Witten invariants at arbitrary genus. This was later generalized to torus-fibered CY threefolds with $N$-sections, where topological string amplitudes are conjecturally governed by meromorphic Jacobi forms under the congruence subgroup $\Gamma_1(N)$. In this work, we show that these modularity properties follow from (and are equivalent to) the wave-function property of the topological string partition function $Z_{\rm top}$ under a relative conifold monodromy, implementing a particular Fourier-Mukai transformation on the derived category of coherent sheaves. In particular, we introduce a variant of $Z_{\rm top}$ which is both holomorphic and modular covariant. Under the same relative conifold monodromy, the generating series of genus 0 Gopakumar-Vafa invariants at fixed base degree is mapped to the generating series of rank 0 Donaldson-Thomas indices counting D4-D2-D0-brane bound states wrapped on the torus fiber. We show that the quasimodularity of the generating series of GV invariants matches the expected mock-modular behavior of the generating series of D4-D2-D0 indices, despite having different multi-cover contributions. We analyze and tabulate a large number of CY threefolds fibered over del Pezzo surfaces, with an $N$-section for $N\leq 5$, including several new examples beyond the realm of toric geometry.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking of $\mathrm{SO}(2N)$ in Gross--Neveu theory from $2+\epsilon$ expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently established that the paradigmatic Gross--Neveu model with $N$ copies of two-dimensional Dirac fermions features an $\mathrm{SO}(2N)$ symmetry if certain interactions are suppressed. This becomes evident when the theory is rewritten in terms of $2N$ copies of two-dimensional Majorana fermions. Mean-field theory for the $\mathrm{SO}(2N)$ model predicts, besides the chiral Ising transition at $g_{c1}$, a second critical point $g_{c2}$ where $\mathrm{SO}(2N)$ is broken down to $\mathrm{SO}(N)\times\mathrm{SO}(N)$. A subsequent Wilsonian renormalization group analysis directly in $d=3$ supports its existence in a generalized theory, where $N_f$ copies of the $4N$-component Majorana fermions are introduced. This allows to track the evolution of a (i) quantum anomalous Hall Gross--Neveu--Ising, (ii) symmetric-tensor, and (iii) adjoint-nematic fixed point separately. However, it turns out that (ii) and (iii) lose their criticality when approaching $N_f = 1$, suggesting that the transition is first order. In this work, we approach the problem from the lower-critical dimension of two. We construct a Fierz-complete renormalizable Lagrangian, compute the leading order $\beta$ functions, fermion anomalous dimension, as well as the order parameter anomalous dimensions, and resolve the three universality classes corresponding to (i)--(iii). Before becoming equal to the Gaussian fixed point at $N_f = 1$, (ii) remains critical for all values of $N_f &gt; N_{f,c}^{\mathrm{ST}}(N) \approx 0.56 + 1.48 N +\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$, which compares well with the estimate of previous studies. We further find that (iii) becomes equal to (i) when approaching $N_f = 1$. An instability is, however, only present in the susceptibility corresponding to the Gross--Neveu--Ising order parameter.</description>

      <title>Bulk-to-bulk photon propagator in AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the photon bulk-to-bulk propagator in AdS in various gauges, including axial, Coulomb, and the standard covariant gauge. We compute the propagator using both momentum and position space techniques. We ensure the propagators obtained obey the right subsidiary conditions arising from gauge invariance. In particular, BRST invariance implies a relation between the longitudinal components of the gauge field propagator and the ghost bulk-to-bulk propagator. Our method relies on decomposing the components of the propagator in terms of independent tensor structures and solving for the form factors. We recover some previously existing results and obtain new expressions for the propagator in other gauges. The propagator in axial and Coulomb gauge is simpler in momentum space, as momentum space makes manisfest the translational invariance in the boundary directions, while the position space expression is the simplest in the covariant Fried-Yennie gauge. In this gauge the propagator has an improved IR behavior, somewhat analogous to the UV improved behavior associated with the Landau gauge in flat space. The results readily extend to Yang-Mills fields.</description>

      <title>A Cardy-like expression for charged rotating solitons and black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to propose a Cardy-like formula characterized by the mass, charge, and angular components of the black hole, along with their corresponding solitonic configuration, obtained through a double Wick rotation. The expression also incorporates the dynamical exponent and effective spatial dimensionality as key elements. To validate the proposal, we first present a new concrete example in which recovering the semiclassical entropy requires the soliton to possess thermodynamic quantities beyond its mass. Additionally, we show more examples derived from static black hole solutions, employing a Lorentz boost to calculate their thermodynamic parameters. Finally, we include a case of a rotating configuration where the Lorentz boost is not required.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The different forms of the tetrahedron equation appear when all possible ways to label the scattering process of infinitely long straight lines are considered in three dimensional spacetime. This is expected to lead to three dimensional integrability, analogous to the Yang-Baxter equation. Among the three possibilities, we consider two of them and their variants. We show that Clifford algebras solve both the constant and the spectral parameter dependent versions of all of them. We also present a scheme for canonically solving higher simplex equations using tetrahedron solutions.</description>

      <title>Islands in Kerr-Newman Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the information paradox in the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman black hole by employing the recently proposed island paradigm. We first consider the quantum filed in the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman spacetime. By employing the near-horizon limit, we demonstrate that the field can be effectively described by a reduced two-dimensional field. Consequently, the formula of entanglement entropy in CFT$_2$ can be naturally adapted to this reduced two-dimensional theory. Under the framework of this reduced two-dimensional theory, we show that the entanglement entropy of radiation for the non-extremal case satisfies the unitarity in the later stage of the appearance of the entanglement islands. We further examine the impact of angular momentum and charges on the Page time and the scrambling time. Both quantities increases as the angular momentum increases, while decreases as the charge increases. At last, we consider the near extremal case. Resort to the Kerr/CFT correspondence, the near-horizon geometry of near extremal Kerr-Newman black holes can be taken account for a warped AdS geometry. In this scenario, the low-energy effective degrees of freedom are dominated by the Schwarzian zero mode, resulting in a one-loop correction to the partition function. The entanglement entropy is subsequently recalculated under the thermodynamic with corrections. Through explicit calculations, we finally find that the Page time and the scrambling time exhibits quantum delays. This strongly suggests that the near extremal geometry is governed by the Schwarzschild dynamics, in which quantum fluctuations result in a reduced rate of information leakage. Our findings further substantiate the conservation of information and extend the applicability of the island paradigm to the most general stationary spacetime background.</description>

      <title>Violation of S-duality in classical $Q$-cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cohomology of a chiral supercharge $Q$ in the $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory at tree level. The cohomology classes correspond one-to-one to the $\frac1{16}$ Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) states at one-loop. We argue that monotone classes on the Coulomb branch respect the S-duality between the theories with $\mathrm{SO}(2N+1)$ and $\mathrm{USp}(2N)$ gauge groups, but find an explicit example of a pair of cohomology classes that "violate" the S-duality in the sense that the tree-level $Q$-cohomologies are not isomorphic between the neighborhoods near the two free points. Within this pair, one is a fortuitous class and the other is a monotone chiral ring element. Assuming the non-perturbative validity of S-duality, our results disprove a long-standing conjecture on the one-loop exactness of the $\frac1{16}$-BPS spectrum (including the $\frac1{8}$-BPS chiral ring spectrum) in the $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. Mathematically, this shows that, the relative Lie algebra cohomology $H^\bullet(\mathfrak{g}[A],\mathfrak{g})$ is generally not graded-isomorphic to $H^\bullet({}^L\mathfrak{g}[A],{}^L\mathfrak{g})$, where $\mathfrak{g}$ and ${}^L\mathfrak{g}$ are a pair of Langlands dual Lie algebras and $A=\mathbb{C}[z^+,z^-]\otimes\Lambda(\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3)$.</description>

      <title>Bounds on CFT correlations from the thermal partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss upper bounds on the mutual information for disjoint spherical regions of the CFT vacuum. To prove our bounds, we utilize the modular nuclearity condition, which is in turn related to finiteness of the thermal partition function of the CFT. Our bounds are satisfied by the conjectured geometric duals of these correlation measures in AdS/CFT, where they link the Hawking-Page phase transition with the entanglement wedge phase transition. We use these results to conjecture a new boundary theory quantity that computes the minimal distance between two general entanglement wedges.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Characters for three-character Rational Conformal Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit (3,0) and (3,3) admissible solutions obtained using the MLDE method. We show that all $(3,0)$ solutions can be written in terms of a universal formula involving the ${}_3F_2$ hypergeometric function that takes into account the monodromy at the elliptic points. We construct $(3,3)$ admissible solutions from (3,0) CFTs using a duality due to Bantay and Gannon. This enables us to compute their modular properties such as the S-matrix and the fusion rules. We find that only 7 of the 15 known (3,3) admissible solutions have proper fusion rules.
  Using the theory of matrix MLDE, starting with a known (3,0) and (3,3) solutions, we construct two other solutions, that are typically quasi-characters that share the same multiplier as the original solution. We then construct linear combinations that lead to new admissible solutions. We observe that admissible solutions arise as integer points that lie on a polytope. We construct all possible (3,6) and (3,9) admissible solutions that arise in this fashion. In some cases, we identify RCFT that arise from our (3,6) admissible solutions. In addition, we obtain a large family of admissible solutions with higher Wronskian index.</description>

      <title>Penrose limits and TsT for fibered $I$-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze a generalized "single-trace $T\bar T$" deformation, defined by a TsT transformation, of the fibered $I$-brane solution from \cite{Nunez2023}. We use the Penrose limit to understand it, and we consider both the TsT followed by the Penrose limit, as well as the Penrose limit followed by TsT. We describe the spin chains obtained in field theory. In the first case we find that, indeed, the TsT transformation preserves solvability in a simple way, as in the standard $T\bar T$ case. In the second case, we have several options, but none is simple enough to be conclusive, however, one case gives us an asymptotically free and IR nontrivial field theory sector, and another a new parallelizable pp wave.</description>

      <title>Quantum Relative Entropy implies the Semiclassical Einstein Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the semiclassical Einstein equations emerge directly from quantum information theory. Using modular theory, we establish that the relative entropy between the vacuum state and coherent excitations of a scalar quantum field on a bifurcate Killing horizon is given by the energy flux across the horizon. Under the assumption of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area formula, this energy flux is proportional to a variation in the surface area of the horizon cross section. The semiclassical Einstein equations follow automatically from this identification. Our approach provides a rigorous quantum field theoretic generalization of Jacobson's thermodynamic derivation of Einstein's equations, replacing classical thermodynamic entropy with the well-defined quantum relative (Araki-Uhlmann) entropy. This suggests that quantum information plays a fundamental role in what is seen as a zeroth order approximation of a theory of quantum gravity, namely quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>AI for Pattern Hunter: Application in Wilson Loop of 2D Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the Transformer to learn patterns in two-dimensional lattice Yang-Mills theory. Specifically, we represent both Wilson loops and their expectation values as tokenized sequences. Taking the shape of Wilson loops as input, the model successfully predicts expectation values with high accuracy, indicating a meaningful connection between loop geometry and physical results. Our study differs from prior machine learning applications in lattice QCD by emphasizing analytical structures rather than numerical computations. We explore model performance under varying hyperparameters, training data sizes, and sequence lengths. This work serves as a first step toward extending such methods to higher dimensions and inspiring rigorous analytical derivations.</description>

      <title>Surprising one-loop finiteness of 6D half-maximal supergravities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In four dimensions, it has long been established that gravity coupled to matter exhibits ultraviolet divergences at one loop, irrespective of supersymmetry. Notably, the four-matter one-loop amplitudes of half-maximal supergravity coupled to Maxwell multiplets were shown in the 1970s to be divergent. Surprisingly, we demonstrate in this work that half-maximal theories can nevertheless become one-loop finite when uplifted to higher dimensions, contrary to naive expectations. Specifically, we study the ultraviolet properties of the four-matter and two-matter two-graviton amplitudes in six-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ and $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ supergravities, coupled to $n_T$ tensor and $n_V$ vector multiplets, respectively. We find that the one-loop amplitudes are finite for $n_T=21$ and $n_V=20$. This finiteness is unexpected, as symmetry-preserving counterterms do exist. Interestingly, both values exactly correspond to low-energy limits of type II string theories compactified on K3, which hints at possible origins to the surprising cancellations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent work, Herderschee and Wall (HW) proved a bound on scalar field excursions in spatially flat FRW cosmologies. In this note, we give an alternate proof of their bound using the Friedmann equations, and we prove that it can be saturated only in universes with vanishing acceleration, $\ddot a =0$. We argue that in a realistic (eternal) inflation scenario, the bound is robust against quantum corrections and spacetime curvature, and it can be violated by higher-derivative corrections only at the expense of a superluminal speed of sound. We further speculate on possible connections between the swampland program and the vacuum estimates given in the work of HW.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Oscillatory Unruh Effect with Superposed Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Unruh effect predicts an astonishing phenomenon that an accelerated detector would detect counts despite being in a quantum field vacuum in the rest frame. Since the required detector acceleration for its direct observation is prohibitively large, recent analog studies on quantum simulation platforms help to reveal various properties of the Unruh effect and explore the not-yet-understood physics of quantum gravity. To further reveal the quantum aspect of the Unruh effect, analogous experimental exploration of the correlation between the detector and the field, and the consequences for coherent quantum trajectories of the detector without classical counterparts, are essential steps but are currently missing. Here, we utilize a laser-controlled trapped ion to experimentally simulate an oscillating detector coupled with a cavity field. We observe joint excitation of both the detector and the field in the detector's frame, coincide with the coordinated dynamics predicted by the Unruh effect. Particularly, we simulate the detector moving in single and superposed quantum trajectories, where the latter case shows coherent interference of excitation. Our demonstration reveals properties of quantum coherent superposition of accelerating trajectories associated with quantum gravity theories that have no classical counterparts, and may offer a new avenue to investigate phenomena in quantum field theory and quantum gravity. We also show how a generalization of the method and results in this work may be beneficial for direct observation of the Unruh effect.</description>

      <title>Onsiteability of Higher-Form Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An internal symmetry in a lattice model is said to be onsiteable if it can be disentangled into an onsite action by introducing ancillas and conjugating with a finite-depth circuit. A standard lore holds that onsiteability is equivalent to being anomaly-free, which is indeed valid for finite 0-form symmetries in (1+1)D. However, for higher-form symmetries, these notions become inequivalent: a symmetry may be onsite while still anomalous. In this work, we clarify the conditions for onsiteability of higher-form symmetries by proposing an equivalence between onsiteability and the possibility of $higher$ gauging. For a finite 1-form symmetry in (2+1)D, we show that the symmetry is onsiteable if and only if its 't Hooft anomaly satisfies a specific algebraic condition that ensures the symmetry can be 1-gauged. We further demonstrate that onsiteable 1-form symmetry in (2+1)D can always be brought into transversal Pauli operators by ancillas and circuit conjugation. In generic dimensions, we derive necessary conditions for onsiteability using lattice 't Hooft anomaly of higher-form symmetry, and conjecture a general equivalence between onsiteability and possibility of higher gauging on lattices.</description>

      <title>Gravothermal collapse of self-interacting dark-matter halos with anisotropic velocity distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-gravitating galactic halos composed of self-interacting dark matter exhibit the formation of a highly dense core at the galactic center--a gravothermal collapse. Analytic models to describe this evolution have been developed and calibrated to numerical simulations initialized with isotropic particle velocity distributions, an assumption not necessarily warranted by the theory of halo formation. Here we study the dependence of the timescale for gravothermal collapse on the velocity distribution. To do so, we consider self-consistent initial conditions for halos with the same density distribution but with different velocity distributions. We consider models with constant anisotropy and with an anisotropy that increases with radius. The velocity distributions that we explore have collapse times that differ from that assuming isotropic distributions by more than a factor of two. We argue that these variations may depend on the global changes in velocity-dispersion profiles in these anisotropic models and not just on the degree of anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Conundrum of regular black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for regular black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields has sprouted numerous candidates, each exhibiting certain virtues but often accompanied by significant drawbacks. We demonstrate that Komar mass, electric charge and magnetic charge are mutually dependent in regular black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields, defined by Lagrangian which is a function of both electromagnetic invariants, $F_{ab} F^{ab}$ and $F_{ab}{\star F}^{ab}$, regardless of the specific weak field limit of the theory. Also, we generalize one of the key no-go theorems by showing that static, spherically symmetric, electrically charged black holes in a theory respecting the relaxed Maxwellian weak field limit do not admit a bounded Kretschmann scalar. Finally, we address one of the long-standing niche questions, whether regular black hole solutions can exist when both electric and magnetic charges are present, by constructing an exotic family of regular dyonic black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields in theories respecting the Maxwellian weak field limit. Mounting evidence suggests that regularizing black holes through simplistic nonlinear extensions of Maxwell's electromagnetism entails a high cost in the form of unorthodox theoretical assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study one dimensional quantum spin chains whose nearest neighbor interactions are random matrices that square to one. By employing free probability theory, we establish a mapping from the many-body quantum dynamics of energy density in the original chain to a single-particle hopping dynamics when the local Hilbert space dimension is large. The hopping occurs on the Cayley graph of an infinite Coxeter reflection group. Adjacency matrices on large finite clusters of this Cayley graph can be constructed numerically by leveraging the automatic structure of the group. The density of states and two-point functions of the local energy density are approximately computed and consistent with the physics of a generic local Hamiltonian: Gaussian density of states and thermalization of energy density. We then ask what happens to the physics if we modify the group on which the hopping dynamics occurs, and conjecture that adding braid relations into the group leads to integrability. Our results put into contact ideas in free probability theory, quantum mechanics of hyperbolic lattices, and the physics of both generic and integrable Hamiltonian dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an operator generalization of the Li-Haldane conjecture regarding the entanglement Hamiltonian of a disk in a 2+1D chiral gapped groundstate. The logic applies to regions with sharp corners, from which we derive several universal properties regarding corner entanglement. These universal properties follow from a set of locally-checkable conditions on the wavefunction. We also define a quantity $(\mathfrak{c}_{\text{tot}})_{\text{min}}$ that reflects the robustness of corner entanglement contributions, and show that it provides an obstruction to a gapped boundary. One reward from our analysis is that we can construct a local gapped Hamiltonian within the same chiral gapped phase from a given wavefunction; we conjecture that it is closer to the low-energy renormalization group fixed point than the original parent Hamiltonian. Our analysis of corner entanglement reveals the emergence of a universal conformal geometry encoded in the entanglement structure of bulk regions of chiral gapped states that is not visible in topological field theory.</description>

      <title>Shadow structure of generalized $k-n$ black-bounce metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of black hole shadows is one of the most interesting effects of the strong field regime of general relativity (GR). Recent observations by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) have provided high-resolution images of the vicinity of supermassive black holes, ushering in a new era for testing gravitation on astrophysical scales. In this work, we continue the investigation initiated by \cite{furtado2025gravitational}, focusing on shadows associated with generalized $k-n$ \emph{black-bounce} type spacetimes, which smoothly interpolate between regular black holes and wormholes. We consider a generalization of the metric with free parameters $(a,k,n)$ that modify the mass function and enrich the possible phenomenology. We develop a semi-analytical study of photon orbits, obtaining the critical impact parameter and the shadow radius for different parameter combinations. Subsequently, we perform numerical ray-tracing simulations using the \textsc{GYOTO} code, incorporating optically thick accretion disks and varying the observation angle. Our results reveal characteristic signatures, including the formation of double-ring structures and deformations of the shadow radius, which can serve as observational discriminators between classical black holes and \emph{black-bounce} solutions.</description>

      <title>The symplectic geometry of the black hole photon shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unstably bound, critical null geodesics of the Kerr spacetime form a distinguished class of orbits whose properties govern observables such as the photon ring and the high-frequency component of black-hole ringdown. This set of orbits defines a codimension-two submanifold of the null-geodesic phase space known as the photon shell. In this work we investigate the photon shell's intrinsic symplectic geometry. Using the induced symplectic form, we construct the canonical volume form on the shell and compute the differential phase-space volume it encloses as a function of radius -- equivalently, the radial density of states. In the near-extremal limit the photon shell bifurcates into near-horizon and far-region components; we find that approximately $3\%$ of the shell's phase-space volume resides in the near-horizon component. We also analyze a thickening of the photon shell that includes near-critical orbits, and compute its differential phase-space volume. Beyond their intrinsic theoretical interest, these results may inform the interpretation of high-resolution observations of spinning black holes.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory treatment of oscillations of Dirac neutrinos in external fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study neutrino oscillations in external fields using the approach based on the quantum field theory (QFT). Neutrinos are virtual particles in this formalism. Neutrino mass eigenstates are supposed to be Dirac fermions. We consider two cases of external fields: the neutrino electroweak interaction with background matter and the interaction with an external magnetic field owing to the presence of the transition magnetic moment. The formalism used involves the dressed propagators of mass eigenstates in external fields. In the matter case, finding of these propagators for Dirac neutrinos has certain difficulties compared to the Majorana particles considered previously. These difficulties are overcome by regularizing the effective potential of the neutrino interaction with matter. The QFT formalism application to the spin-flavor precession also encounters certain peculiarities in the Dirac case compared to the Majorana one. They are related to the observability of right polarized Dirac neutrinos. We derive the matrix elements and the probabilities for Dirac neutrinos interacting with both types of external fields. In case of the spin-flavor precession, we obtain the small QFT contribution to the probabilities in addition to the prediction of the quantum mechanical approach.</description>

      <title>WIMP Shadows: Phenomenology of Secluded Dark Matter in Three Minimal BSM Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of secluded dark matter (DM) $\chi$, where the relic abundance is set by annihilations into lighter dark mediators $\phi$ that couple only feebly to the Standard Model (SM). In contrast to canonical WIMPs, which are now strongly constrained by direct and indirect searches, secluded models still achieve the observed relic abundance via thermal freeze-out into hidden-sector mediators, while predicting highly suppressed present-day signals. We analyze three minimal models: (i) a $U(1)_X$ gauge boson ($A'$) with kinetic mixing; (ii) a scalar DM candidate $S$ with a scalar mediator $K$ that has a trilinear vertex; and (iii) a Dirac fermion $\chi$ whose mass arises from a Higgs-mixed singlet $H_p$. For each model we derive annihilation and scattering rates in both WIMP-like and secluded regimes, and solve the Boltzmann equations: a single-species equation for the WIMP case and a coupled $\chi$-$\phi$ system for the secluded case to account for possible early departure of the mediator from thermal equilibrium with the SM bath. In this regard, we provide explicit lower limits on the portal coupling $\epsilon$ required to keep the mediator in thermal equilibrium with the SM bath and to ensure mediator decay before BBN. We show that for portal couplings $\epsilon \ll 10^{-3}$ the relic density is dominantly controlled by DM annihilation into mediator pairs, while spin-independent scattering lies well below current limits and remains viable even for future experiments approaching the irreducible neutrino background floor. Indirect constraints are typically weak due to $p$-wave suppression, off-resonance $s$-channels, and cascade spectra controlled by $\epsilon^2$. Finally, we highlight the most promising collider tests, which remain sensitive despite tiny portal couplings.</description>

      <title>Towards theory constraints on ultralight dark matter from quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight scalar dark matter may couple to the Standard Model through dimension-five operators that contain the field-strength tensors of the gauge interactions. Recent progress in nuclear clocks is projected to increase the sensitivity to such couplings by several orders of magnitude. Future experimental constraints may even have Planck-scale sensitivity, calling for a study of such couplings in a framework that includes quantum gravity. We take a first step towards providing the theoretical constraints on such couplings that arise in asymptotically safe gravity. We find evidence that such couplings vanish in asymptotically safe gravity and are also not generated in a perturbative quantum-gravity regime that describes quantum gravity as an effective field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ab initio predictions of two-loop electroweak contributions to observables are increasingly essential for precision collider experiments, yet their evaluation remains very challenging. We connect recurrence techniques and dispersive method in order to evaluate complex multi-loop Feynman diagrams. By expressing multi-point Passarino-Veltman functions in a two-point basis and using shifted space-time dimensions with recurrence relations, we minimize the number of required dispersive integrals. This approach reduces computation time and enables a precise and efficient analysis of one- and two-loop diagrams.</description>

      <title>Imperfect dark matter with higher derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a higher-derivative action for dark matter whose energy-momentum tensor describes an imperfect fluid with nonzero pressure, energy flux, and anisotropic stress. In the limit where the higher-derivative couplings are switched off, the energy-momentum tensor reduces to pressureless dust. A systematic derivation follows from extending the singular conformal transformation used in the mimetic dark matter scenario to include higher-derivative terms while the resulting action is general and does not rely on the mimetic framework. On a homogeneous cosmological background, the dynamics coincides with that of pressureless dust, while in the presence of inhomogeneities the higher-derivative terms generate nonzero acceleration and vorticity, making it possible to avoid the formation of caustic singularities even if the strong energy condition satisfies. In particular, within the mimetic realization these terms resolve the usual caustic pathology of mimetic dark matter.</description>

      <title>Two Shades of Quark Color: Parallel Canons across the Cold War Divide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of the color quantum number is conventionally narrated as a linear progression from the quark-model statistics paradox to quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This paper challenges that teleology by arguing that "color" emerged as two conceptually distinct constructs during the Cold War. The first, originating with Han and Nambu and culminating in QCD, conceived of color as a local gauge charge, the source of a fundamental force mediated by gluons. The second, developed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, treated color as a hidden, three-valued label--a statistical and structural property within a composite, S-matrix-inflected hadron model. We trace these parallel narratives, linking the Dubna approach to a holist epistemology that prioritizes observable amplitudes and global constraints, and the QCD approach to a reductionist program grounded in micro-dynamics. A case study of Fermilab's E-36 experimental chain (1970--78) shows how an observables-first design-tuned to S-matrix and Regge constraints on forward elastic scattering--performed robustly within its natural domain but was ultimately discontinued amid declining theoretical interest and involvement. The subsequent hegemony of QCD retroactively projected its gauge-theoretic conception of color onto history, erasing this epistemic diversity. We conclude that the marginalization of Dubna's structural color was not merely a political outcome of the Cold War but a result of deep ontological and philosophical divergences, advocating for a domain-sensitive pluralism in the historiography of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Thermal nature of confining strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum statistical properties of the confining string connecting a static fermion-antifermion pair in the massive Schwinger model. By analyzing the reduced density matrix of the subsystem located in between the fermion and antifermion, we demonstrate that as the interfermion separation approaches the string-breaking distance, the overlap between the microscopic density matrix and an effective thermal density matrix exhibits a pronounced, narrow peak, approaching unity at the onset of string breaking. This behavior reveals that the confining flux tube evolves toward a genuinely thermal state as the separation between the charges grows, even in the absence of an external heat bath. In other words, one cannot tell whether a reduced state of the subsystem arises from a surrounding heat bath or from entanglement with the rest of the system. The entanglement spectrum near the critical string-breaking distance exhibits a rapid transition from the dominance of a single state describing the confining electric string towards a strongly entangled state containing virtual fermion-antifermion pairs. Our findings establish a quantitative link between confinement, entanglement, and emergent thermality, and suggest that string breaking corresponds to a microscopic thermalization transition within the flux tube.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of the Timelike Unruh Effect with a Trapped-Ion System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Unruh effect predicts that an accelerated observer perceives the Minkowski vacuum as a thermal bath, but its direct observation requires extreme accelerations beyond current experimental reach. Foundational theory [Olson &amp; Ralph, Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 110404 (2011)] shows that an equivalent thermal response, known as the timelike Unruh effect, can occur for detectors following specific timelike trajectories without acceleration, enabling laboratory tests with stationary yet time-dependent detectors. Here, we report a proof-of-principle demonstration of the timelike Unruh effect in a quantum system of trapped ion, where a two-level spin serves as the detector and is temporally coupled to the ambient field encoded in the ion's vibrational motion. Specifically, we study both excitation and emission dynamics of the detector moving along a spacetime trajectory in the future/past light cone, and demonstrate the thermal response of the detector to the Minkowski vacuum that resembles the Unruh effect. This work establishes a controllable tabletop platform for exploring relativistic quantum physics under accessible laboratory conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the isolated horizon formalism to include rotating black holes arising in five dimensional Einstein- Gauss- Bonnet (EGB) theory of gravity, and derive the laws of black hole mechanics. This result allows us to show that the first law of black hole mechanics is modified, due to the Gauss- Bonnet term, so as to include corrections to (i) the area of horizon cross- sections and, to (ii) the expression of horizon angular momentum. Once these modifications are included, the Hamiltonian generates an evolution on the space of solutions of the EGB theory admitting isolated horizon as an internal boundary, the consequence of which is the first law of black hole mechanics. These boundary conditions may help in the search for exact solutions describing rotating black holes in this theory.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic topology of black holes and an invariant of spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We represent a new approach to exploring the thermodynamic topology of black holes, without introducing the nonphysical variable $\Theta\in[0,\pi]$ considered in previous studies, where black holes can exchange both energy and matter with the environment, leading to a thermal and chemical equilibrium. We construct a conserved topological tensor based on the gradient flow of the off-shell grand free energy corresponding to a two-dimensional or higher-dimensional vector field whose zeros are black hole solutions. We obtain a topological charge that is the sum of the index of all zeros. We find that black holes that share the same background geometry would have the same topological charge, hence they belong to the same kind of solutions. This point implies that the topological charge characterizing the black hole thermodynamics is also an invariant of spacetime, leading to valuable insight into the observed cosmological constant and the AdS distance conjecture.</description>

      <title>Quarkiton: a one-quark state near a boundary of confinement phase of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a one-quark state in the confinement phase near a reflective chromometallic boundary both at finite and zero temperature. Using numerical simulations of lattice Yang-Mills theory, we show that the test quark is confined to the neutral mirror by an attractive potential of the Cornell type, suggesting the existence of a mirror-bound one-quark state, a "quarkiton". Surprisingly, the tension of the string spanned between the quark and the mirror is lower than the fundamental string tension. The quarkiton state exhibits a partial confinement: while the quark is localized in the vicinity of the mirror, it can still travel freely along it. Such quarkiton states share similarity with the surface excitons in metals and semiconductors that are bound to their negatively charged images at a boundary. The quarkitons can exist at the hadronic side of the phase interfaces in QCD that arise, for example, in the thermodynamic equilibrium of vortical quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Modified Gravity with Nonminimal Curvature-Matter Couplings: A Framework for Gravitationally Induced Particle Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modified gravity theories with a nonminimal coupling between curvature and matter offer a compelling alternative to dark energy and dark matter by introducing an explicit interaction between matter and curvature invariants. Two of the main consequences of such an interaction are the emergence of an additional force and the non-conservation of the energy--momentum tensor, which can be interpreted as an energy exchange between matter and geometry. By adopting this interpretation, one can then take advantage of many different approaches in order to investigate the phenomenon of gravitationally induced particle creation. One of these approaches relies on the so-called irreversible thermodynamics of open systems formalism. By considering the scalar--tensor formulation of one of these theories, we derive the corresponding particle creation rate, creation pressure, and entropy production, demonstrating that irreversible particle creation can drive a late-time de Sitter acceleration through a negative creation pressure, providing a natural alternative to the cosmological constant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the generalized second law of thermodynamics holds: the total entropy, from both the apparent horizon and enclosed matter, increases monotonically and saturates in the de Sitter phase, imposing constraints on the allowed particle production dynamics. Furthermore, we present brief reviews of other theoretical descriptions of matter creation processes. Specifically, we consider approaches based on the Boltzmann equation and quantum-based aspects and discuss the generalization of the Klein--Gordon equation, as well as the problem of its quantization in time-varying gravitational fields.</description>

      <title>Dirac spectrum in the chirally symmetric phase of a gauge theory. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I study the consequences of chiral symmetry restoration for the Dirac spectrum in finite-temperature gauge theories in the two-flavor chiral limit, using Ginsparg--Wilson fermions on the lattice. I prove that chiral symmetry is restored at the level of the susceptibilities of scalar and pseudoscalar bilinears if and only if all these susceptibilities do not diverge in the chiral limit $m\to 0$, with $m$ the common mass of the light fermions. This implies in turn that they are infinitely differentiable functions of $m^2$ at $m=0$, or $m$ times such a function, depending on whether they contain an even or odd number of isosinglet bilinears. Expressing scalar and pseudoscalar susceptibilities in terms of the Dirac spectrum, I use their finiteness in the symmetric phase to derive constraints on the spectrum, and discuss the resulting implications for the fate of the anomalous $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry in the chiral limit. I also discuss the differentiability properties of spectral quantities with respect to $m^2$, and show from first principles that the topological properties of the theory in the chiral limit are characterized by an instanton gas-like behavior if $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ remains effectively broken.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I discuss the consequences of the constraints imposed on the Dirac spectrum by the restoration of chiral symmetry in the chiral limit of gauge theories with two light fermion flavors, with particular attention to the fate of the anomalous $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry. Under general, physically motivated assumptions on the spectral density and on the two-point eigenvalue correlation function, I show that effective $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ breaking in the symmetric phase requires specific spectral features, including a spectral density effectively behaving as $m^2\delta(\lambda)$ in the chiral limit, a two-point function singular at zero, and delocalized near-zero modes, besides an instanton gas-like behavior of the topological charge distribution. I then discuss a $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$-breaking scenario characterized by a power-law divergent spectral peak tending to $O(m^4)/|\lambda|$ in the chiral limit and by a near-zero mobility edge, and argue that the mixing of the approximate zero modes associated with a dilute gas of topological objects provides a concrete physical mechanism producing the required spectral features, and so a viable mechanism for effective $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ breaking in the symmetric phase of a gauge theory.</description>

Abstract: Aoki, Fukaya, and Taniguchi claim that both the spectral density of the Dirac operator at the origin and the topological susceptibility must vanish identically for sufficiently small but nonzero mass $m$ in the chirally symmetric phase of QCD with two light quark flavors, under certain technical assumptions on the spectrum and on the dependence of observables on $m$. Independently of these assumptions, I argue that a crucial step of their proof is not justified, and the validity of these conclusions should be reassessed.</description>

Abstract: An interaction between ferromagnetic and superconducting order, to be realized in a 2d ferromagnetic superconductor, is proposed obeying necessary symmetry principles. This interaction allow us to formulate a duality, similar to the Boson-vortex duality in 2+1 dimensional superfluid. In the dual theory Skyrmion and vortex excitations interact with each other via an emergent gauge field. The static interaction potential is attractive for a Skyrmion and a vortex with opposite topological charges. This interaction can lead to formation of bound pairs of the mentioned topological excitations.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal stress-energy tensor in time-dependent gravitational backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) of a massless quantum scalar field in time-dependent gravitational backgrounds. Starting from its formal expression obtained within the covariant perturbative expansion to lowest order in the curvature, we evaluate the RSET in an arbitrary number of dimensions in terms of coordinate-space distributions. For time-dependent spherically symmetric spacetimes, we derive a multipole expansion and determine its asymptotic behavior. We find that the RSET is locally nonvanishing at null infinity and depends on the detailed dynamics of the collapsing body. However, the total emitted energy vanishes at this order, meaning that the leading contribution does not account for the energy density of the created particles. Nevertheless, by enforcing stress-tensor conservation up to second order in the curvature, we show that the total radiated energy can be extracted from the first-order RSET. Finally, we compute the induced quantum corrections to the metric at large distances, which display several unexpected features.</description>

      <title>Association Rules Machine Learning complete intersection Calabi-Yau 5-Folds and 6-Folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Association rule machine learning is applied to the dataset of complete intersection Calabi--Yau 5-folds and 6-folds in order to uncover hidden patterns among their Hodge numbers. These Hodge numbers -- six for the 5-folds and nine for the 6-folds -- serve as the items in our analysis. For the 5-folds, we discover 60 significant association rules. For example, within the dataset, if $h_{1,3} = 0$ and $h_{2,2} = 5$, then $h_{1,1} = 3$ with 99.43\% confidence. Similarly, if $h_{2,1} = 0$, $h_{1,3} = 0$, and $h_{2,2} = 5$, then $h_{1,1} = 3$ with 99.42\% confidence. For the 6-folds, we identify 160 association rules across a dataset of 1,482,022 examples. A particularly striking observation is that $h_{1,2} = h_{1,3} = h_{1,4} = h_{2,3} = 0$ for all entries in this dataset. These types of association rules are especially valuable because the Hodge numbers of complete intersection Calabi--Yau 5-folds have only been computed for approximately 53 percent of the dataset, while those of 6-folds remain largely undetermined. The discovered patterns provide predictive insights that can guide future computations and theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>Higgs Inflation: Particle Factory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study cosmological gravitational particle production (CGPP) in Higgs inflation, wherein the inflaton is a scalar field with quartic self-coupling $\lambda$ and a nonminimal coupling to gravity $\xi$, and which may, but need not be, the Higgs boson of the Standard Model (SM). We find an explosive particle production peaked on a characteristic comoving wavenumber $k\sim \xi^{2/3} a H$ with a peak occupation number that scales with $\xi$. This new peak in production can easily dominate over the conventional (minimally coupled inflation) CGPP even for modest values of $\xi$. The results apply for a wide range of $\xi$, e.g., as low as $\xi=10$, which can be realized for the Standard Model Higgs given suitable RG flow of the quartic coupling. We discuss implications for late time relics such as dark matter.</description>

Abstract: Exploiting the symmetry topological field theory/topological order correspondence (SymTFT/TO), together with the higher-categorical structure of 6D N =(2,0) SCFTs, we prove that the total quantum dimension of the relative gaugeable algebra leading to intrinsic non-invertible symmetries between class S theories is greater with respect to the non-intrinsic case. From a higher-categorical perspective, this supports the idea that multiplicity is allowed to exceed unity in some superselection sectors.</description>

      <title>Complex crystallographic reflection groups and Seiberg-Witten integrable systems: rank 1 case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider generalisations of the elliptic Calogero--Moser systems associated to complex crystallographic groups in accordance to [1]. In our previous work [2], we proposed these systems as candidates for Seiberg--Witten integrable systems of certain SCFTs. Here we examine that proposal for complex crystallographic groups of rank one. Geometrically, this means considering elliptic curves $T^2$ with $\mathbb{Z}_m$-symmetries, $m=2,3,4,6$, and Poisson deformations of the orbifolds $(T^2\times\mathbb{C})/\mathbb{Z}_m$. The $m=2$ case was studied in [2], while $m=3,4,6$ correspond to Seiberg--Witten integrable systems for the rank 1 Minahan--Nemeshansky SCFTs of type $E_{6,7,8}$. This allows us to describe the corresponding elliptic fibrations and the Seiberg--Witten differential in a compact elegant form. This approach also produces quantum spectral curves for these SCFTs, which are given by Fuchsian ODEs with special properties.</description>

Abstract: With the aim of investigating the existence of an integrable elliptic deformation of strings on $\mathsf{AdS}_3 \times \mathsf{S}^3 \times \mathsf{T}^4$, we compute the tree-level worldsheet S-matrix of the elliptically-deformed bosonic sigma model on $\mathsf{AdS}_3 \times \mathsf{S}^3$ in uniform light-cone gauge. The resulting tree-level S-matrix is compatible with the integrability of the model and has interesting features, including a hidden $\mathsf{U}(1)$ symmetry not manifest in the Lagrangian. We find that it cannot be embedded in the known exact integrable R-matrices describing deformations of the undeformed $\mathsf{AdS}_3 \times \mathsf{S}^3 \times \mathsf{T}^4$ light-cone gauge S-matrix including fermions. Therefore, we construct embeddings of the deformed 6-d metric in type II supergravity with constant dilaton and homogeneous fluxes. The simplicity of these solutions suggests they are promising candidates to lead to an integrable string sigma model including fermions.</description>

      <title>The DNA of Calabi-Yau Hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement Genetic Algorithms for triangulations of four-dimensional reflexive polytopes which induce Calabi-Yau threefold hypersurfaces via Batyrev's construction. We demonstrate that such algorithms efficiently optimize physical observables such as axion decay constants or axion-photon couplings in string theory compactifications. For our implementation, we choose a parameterization of triangulations that yields homotopy inequivalent Calabi-Yau threefolds by extending fine, regular triangulations of two-faces, thereby eliminating exponentially large redundancy factors in the map from polytope triangulations to Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces. In particular, we discuss how this encoding renders the entire Kreuzer-Skarke list amenable to a variety of optimization strategies, including but not limited to Genetic Algorithms. To achieve optimal performance, we tune the hyperparameters of our Genetic Algorithm using Bayesian optimization. We find that our implementation vastly outperforms other sampling and optimization strategies like Markov Chain Monte Carlo or Simulated Annealing. Finally, we showcase that our Genetic Algorithm efficiently performs optimization even for the maximal polytope with Hodge numbers $h^{1,1} = 491$, where we use it to maximize axion-photon couplings.</description>

Abstract: We compute analytically greybody factors for asymptotically flat spherically symmetric black holes with stringy higher derivative corrections in d dimensions in the high frequency limit. Our calculations include both the eikonal limit - where the real part of the frequency of the scattered wave is much larger than the imaginary part - and the highly damped case - where the imaginary part of the frequency is much larger than the real part -, addressing the emission of gravitons and test scalar fields, and yielding full transmission and reflection scattering coefficients.</description>

      <title>Quantum Field Measurements in the Fewster-Verch Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fewster-Verch (FV) framework provides a local and covariant approach for defining measurements in quantum field theory (QFT). Within this framework, a probe QFT represents the measurement device, which, after interacting with the target QFT, undergoes an arbitrary local measurement. Remarkably, the FV framework is free from Sorkin-like causal paradoxes and robust enough to enable quantum state tomography. However, two open issues remain.
  First, it is unclear if the FV framework allows conducting arbitrary local measurements. Second, if the probe field is interpreted as physical and the FV framework as fundamental, then one must demand the probe measurement to be itself implementable within the framework. That would involve a new probe, which should also be subject to an FV measurement, and so on. It is unknown if there exist non-trivial FV measurements for which such an ``FV-Heisenberg cut" can be moved arbitrarily far away. In this work, we advance the first problem by proving that Gaussian-modulated measurements of locally smeared fields fit within the FV framework. We solve the second problem by showing that any such measurement admits a movable FV-Heisenberg cut.
  As a technical byproduct, we establish that state transformations induced by finite-rank perturbations of the classical phase space underlying a linear scalar field preserve the Hadamard property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present generic expressions for the integrands of canonical bases under maximal cut in elliptic Feynman integral families with multiple kinematic scales. Such integrals frequently arise in phenomenologically relevant scattering processes. The derivation of our results starts from the Legendre normal form of elliptic curves, where the geometric properties of the curves are simple and explicit, and further kinematic singularities are presented as marked points. The simplicity of the normal form allows a straightforward construction of canonical bases with an arbitrary number of marked points. They can then be mapped into any univariate elliptic integral families via an appropriate M\"obius transformation, leading to universal expressions for the integrands. As a demonstration, we discuss the application of our method to several concrete examples, including two new integral families whose canonical bases were not available in the literature. In several examples, we derive canonical bases for the full integral families without any cuts, demonstrating the simplicity of the sub-sector dependence of our canonical bases.</description>

      <title>The Manakov-Zakharov-Ward model as an integrable decoupling limit of the membrane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel decoupling limit of the membrane is proposed, leading to the $(1+2)$-dimensional classically integrable model originally introduced by Manakov, Zakharov, and Ward. This limit is the large-wrapping regime of a membrane propagating toy background of the form $\mathbb{R}_t \times T^2 \times G$ subject to scaling limit, where $G$ is a Lie group and the geometry is supported by a four-form flux. Such toy backgrounds can arise from consistent eleven-dimensional supergravity solutions, exemplified by the uplift of the pure NSNS AdS$_3 \times$ S$^3 \times$ T$^4$ background. The scaling limit can be interpreted as similtaneous small tension and non- or hyper-relativistic limit.</description>

      <title>Inflation Model Based on Virasoro Squeezing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism for realizing slow-roll inflation that is fully consistent with observational data, based on conformal transformations acting exclusively on a complex scalar field -- without coupling to the gravitational sector. These transformations generically produce a plateau in the inflaton potential, as guaranteed by the maximum modulus theorem, thereby naturally satisfying the slow-roll conditions.
  Our framework utilizes squeezing operations generated by the Virasoro algebra without central extension, as developed in our earlier work. The resulting inflationary potentials depend on the Virasoro mode $n$, the power $m$ of the original potential, and the squeezing parameter $\theta$.
  We present approximate analytical expressions at leading order for the special case $n=-2$, and perform numerical analyses for both $n=-2$ and other values of $n$. These reveal parameter regimes in which the predicted cosmological observables $(n_{s},r)$ align remarkably well with current CMB measurements.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative aspects of entanglement structures in $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turning on the $T\bar{T}$-deformation in a two-dimensional CFT provides a unique window to study explicitly how non-local features arise in the UV as a result of the deformation. A sharp signature is the dynamical emergence of an effective length-scale $\propto \sqrt{\mu}$ that separates the local and non-local regimes of the deformed theory, effectively serving as a UV cut-off for computing observables in the local regime. In this paper, we study this phenomenon through the entanglement structures of the deformed theory. We focus on computing the Renyi entropies of single-interval sub-regions in the deformed vacuum states. We pay particular attention to the interplay between the bare entanglement cut-off inherited from the CFT computation and the effects from the $T\bar{T}$ deformations. Applying the general replica trick to the string theory formulation of $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFTs, we derive an explicit representation of the deformed replica partition function as a weighted integral of the CFT results evaluated at a dynamical cut-off, which is integrated over. We computed in detail the kernel functions of the integral representation, and performed the saddle-point analysis in the semi-classical limit of small $\mu$. We found that in addition to the perturbative saddle-point which identifies the dynamical cut-off with the bare entanglement cut-off, there exists another non-perturbative saddle-point that identifies the dynamical cut-off with the $T\bar{T}$ length-scale $\propto \sqrt{\mu}$, but whose contribution is exponentially small. We discuss how these non-perturbative effects can shed lights on the mechanism through which the $T\bar{T}$ length-scale may eventually replace the bare counter-part and become the effective entanglement cut-off.</description>

Abstract: We construct a 1-parameter family of Ramond-Ramond fluxes supporting the elliptic $\mathrm{AdS}_3 \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathrm{T}^4$ metric with constant dilaton and preserving 8 of the 16 supercharges of the undeformed background. On the supersymmetric locus, we compute the tree-level worldsheet S-matrix in uniform light-cone gauge up to quadratic order in fermions and find that it non-trivially satisfies the classical Yang-Baxter equation. Moreover, imposing classical integrability and symmetries, we conjecture compatible processes quartic in fermions. We also investigate different limits of interest, including trigonometric deformations and the limit to the $\mathrm{AdS}_2 \times \mathrm{S}^2 \times \mathrm{T}^6$ superstring. Our results provide strong evidence for a supersymmetric and integrable elliptic deformation of the $\mathrm{AdS}_3 \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathrm{T}^4$ superstring supported by Ramond-Ramond flux and a constant dilaton.</description>

      <title>Krylov exponents and power spectra for maximal quantum chaos: an EFT approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the effective field theory (EFT) of maximal chaos through the lens of Krylov complexity and the Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis. We test the relationship between two measures of quantum chaos: out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) and Krylov complexity. In the EFT, a shift symmetry of the hydrodynamic modes enforces the maximal Lyapunov exponent in OTOCs, $\lambda_L = 2\pi T$, while simultaneously constraining thermal two-point autocorrelators. We solve these constraints on the autocorrelator, and calculate the Lanczos coefficients and Krylov exponents for several examples, finding both $\lambda_K = \lambda_L$ and $\lambda_K = \lambda_L/2$. This demonstrates that, within the EFT, the shift symmetry alone is insufficient to enforce maximal Krylov exponents even when the Lyapunov exponent is maximal. In particular, this result suggests a tension with the conjectured bound $\lambda_L \leq \lambda_K \leq 2\pi T$. Finally, we identify autocorrelator solutions whose power spectra closely resemble the so-called thermal product formula seen in holographic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ, for the first time, the holographic gravity approach to investigate the dynamical stability of solitons in spherical superfluids. Transverse perturbations are applied to the background of spherical soliton configurations, and the collective excitation modes of the solitons are examined within the framework of linear analysis. Our study reveals the existence of two distinct unstable modes in the soliton configurations. Through fully nonlinear evolution schemes, the dynamical evolution and final states of the solitons are elucidated. The results demonstrate that the solitons exhibit both self-acceleration instability and snake instability at different temperatures, respectively. And we explore the corresponding temperature-dependent dynamical phase transitions. It is noteworthy that the dynamical behavior of spherical solitons is distinct from the planar case due to the presence of spherical curvature.</description>

      <title>Transition between critical antiferromagnetic phases in the $J_1$-$J_2$ spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $J_1$-$J_2$ spin chain is one of the canonical models of quantum magnetism, and has long been known to host a critical antiferromagnetic phase with power-law decay of spin correlations. We show in this Letter that there are, in fact, \textit{two} distinct critical antiferromagnetic phases, where the roles of the local dimer field and its dual field are interchanged: the `Affleck-Haldane' phase near the Heisenberg point $J_2 = 0$, where the dimer field that parametrises local singlet order is gapless and part of a joint $O(4)$ N\'eel-singlet order parameter; and the `Zirnbauer' phase which appears at sufficiently large ferromagnetic $J_2$, where the dimer field is gapped out and its \textit{dual} field -- the instanton density of the $O(3)$ N\'eel field -- is critical instead. The phases are so-named because each realises one of the competing pictures for how the $O(3)$ non-linear sigma model with a topological theta term renormalises to the $\mathfrak{\hat{su}}(2)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model. We support these predictions with density matrix renormalisation group calculations.</description>

      <title>The quantum Newton's bucket: Active and passive rotations in quantum theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated both by classical physics problems associated with ``Newton's bucket'' and recent developments related to QCD in rotating frames of reference relevant to heavy ion collisions, we discuss the difference between ``active'' and ``passive'' rotations in quantum systems. We examine some relevant potentials and give general symmetry arguments to give criteria where such rotations give the same results. We close with a discussion of how this can be translated to quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Apparent $w&lt;-1$ and a Lower $S_8$ from Dark Axion and Dark Baryons Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a simple coupling between dark energy and dark matter can simultaneously address two distinct hints at new physics coming from cosmological observations. The first is the recent evidence from the DESI project and supernovae observations that the dark energy equation of state~$w$ is evolving over cosmic time from an earlier value that is~$&lt;-1$ to a present-day value~$&gt;-1$. The second observation is the so-called~$S_8$ tension, describing the suppression of the growth of matter overdensities compared to that expected in the~$\Lambda$CDM model. We propose a stable, technically natural particle physics implementation of this idea, in which dark matter consists of dark baryons in a strongly-coupled hidden sector, and the dark energy field is the associated dark axion. The time-variation of the dark matter mass results in an effective dark energy equation of state that exhibits a phantom crossing behavior consistent with recent results. It also results in a slight delay in matter-radiation equality, which suppresses the overall growth of density perturbations.</description>

      <title>Addressing $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions within $f(Q)$ cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the viability of $f(Q)$ gravity as an alternative framework to address the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions in cosmology. Focusing on three representative $f(Q)$ models, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis using a combination of cosmological observations, including cosmic chronometers, Type Ia supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, baryon acoustic oscillations, and CMB distance priors. Our results demonstrate that most of these models can yield higher values of $H_0$ than those predicted by $\Lambda$CDM, offering a partial alleviation of the tension. In addition, one model satisfies the condition $G_{\mathrm{eff}} &lt; G$, making it a promising candidate for addressing the $S_8$ tension. However, these improvements are accompanied by mild internal inconsistencies between different subsets of data, which limit the overall statistical preference relative to $\Lambda$CDM. Despite this, $f(Q)$ gravity remains a promising and flexible framework for late-time cosmology, and our results motivate further exploration of extended or hybrid models that may reconcile all observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial quantization of 4d 2-Chern-Simons theory II: Quantum invariants of higher ribbons in $D^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a continuation of the first paper (arXiv:2501.06486) of this series, where the framework for the combinatorial quantization of the 4d 2-Chern-Simons theory with an underlying compact structure Lie 2-group $\mathbb{G}$ was laid out. In this paper, we continue our quest and characterize additive module *-functors $\omega:\mathfrak{C}_q(\mathbb{G}^{\Gamma^2})\rightarrow\mathsf{Hilb}$, which serve as a categorification of linear *-functionals (ie. a state) on a $C^*$-algebra. These allow us to construct non-Abelian Wilson surface correlations $\widehat{\mathfrak{C}}_q(\mathbb{G}^{P})$ on the discrete 2d simple polyhedra $P$ partitioning 3-manifolds. By proving its stable equivalence under 3d handlebody moves, these Wilson surface states extend to decorated 3-dimensional marked bordisms in a 4-disc $D^4$. This provides invariants of framed oriented 2-ribbonsin $D^4$ from the data of the given compact Lie 2-group $\mathbb{G}$. We find that these 2-Chern-Simons-type 2-ribbon invariants are given by bigraded $\mathbb{Z}$-modules, similar to the lasagna skein modules of Manolescu-Walker-Wedrich.</description>

      <title>Bouncing Bianchi Models with Deformed Commutation Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the anisotropic Bianchi I and Bianchi II models in vacuum in the framework of deformed commutation relations (DCRs). Working in a parametrisation of the spatial metric by a volume and two anisotropy variables, we propose modified Poisson brackets that for the volume alone reproduce the bounce dynamics of effective loop quantum cosmology (LQC), with additional modifications for anisotropy degrees of freedom. We derive effective Friedmann equations and observe cosmological bounces both in Bianchi I and Bianchi II. For Bianchi II, we find that the cosmological bounce now interacts with the usual reflection seen in the Kasner indices in various interesting ways, in close similarity again with what had been seen in LQC. This suggests that the DCR framework could model more general quantum-gravity inspired bounce scenarios in a relatively straightforward way.</description>

      <title>Braneworld Dark Energy in light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observational results from the DESI collaboration reveal tensions with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and favour a scenario in which dark energy (DE) decays over time. The DESI DR2 data also suggest that the DE equation of state (EoS) may have been phantom-like ($w &lt; - 1$) in the past, evolving to $w &gt; - 1$ at present, implying a recent crossing of the phantom divide at $w = - 1$. Scalar field models of DE naturally emerge in ultraviolet-complete theories such as string theory, which is typically formulated in higher dimensions. In this work, we investigate a broad class of $thawing~scalar~field~models$, including the simple quadratic, quartic, exponential, symmetry-breaking and axion potentials, propagating on a (4+1)-dimensional ghost-free phantom braneworld, and demonstrate that their effective EoS exhibits a phantom-divide crossing. Alongside the Hubble parameter and EoS of DE, we also analyse the evolution of the $Om$ diagnostic, and demonstrate that the time dependence of these quantities is in excellent agreement with the DESI DR2 observations. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, and find that the $\chi^2$ values for all our models are remarkably close to that of the widely used CPL parametrisation, indicating that our models fit the data very well.</description>

      <title>Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics: Axiomatic Formulation and Foundation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for non-equilibrium thermodynamics, termed Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics (NNET), which unifies reversible dynamics described by the Nambu bracket and irreversible processes driven by entropy gradients. The formulation provides a covariant description of systems far from equilibrium, where entropy may transiently decrease as a result of reversible circulations or exchanges with the surroundings, extending the applicability of conventional thermodynamic formalisms.
  As an illustrative example, a triangular chemical reaction system is analyzed. It is shown that, without assuming detailed balance or linearity, two geometric structures that behave as conserved quantities in the reversible limit naturally emerge: one associated with cyclic symmetry in the reaction space, and another that vanishes under symmetric reaction rates. These results demonstrate that NNET provides a unified and covariant formulation for describing both cyclic dynamics and dissipative processes within a single theoretical structure.</description>

      <title>Precision Measurements of the Electroweak Mixing Angle in the Region of the Z pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the current status and techniques used in precision measurements of the effective leptonic weak mixing angle $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ (a fundamental parameter of the Standard Model (SM)) in the region of the Z pole with emphasis on hadron colliders. We also build on these techniques to extract the most precise single measurement to date of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ from a new analysis of the published forward-backward asymmetry ($A_{\rm FB}$) in Drell-Yan dielpton production in proton-proton collisions at a center of mass energy of 13 TeV measured by the CMS collaboration at the large hadron collider. The uncertainty in $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ published by CMS is dominated by uncertainties in Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs), which are reduced by PDF profiling using the dilepton mass dependence of $A_{\rm FB}$. Our new extraction of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ from the CMS values of $A_{\rm FB}$ includes profiling with additional new CMS measurements of the $W$-boson decay lepton asymmetry, and W/Z cross section ratio at 13 TeV. We obtain the most precise single measurement of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ to date of 0.23156$\pm$0.00024, which is in excellent agreement with the SM prediction of 0.23161$\pm$0.00004. We also discuss outlook for future measurements at the LHC including more precise measurements of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$, a measurement of $\sin^2\theta^\ell_{\rm eff}$ for b-quarks in the initial state, and a measurement of the running of $\sin^2\theta^{\overline{\rm MS}}(\mu)$ up to 3 TeV.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics of monitored non-interacting fermions on Graphic-Processing-Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The description of the entanglement dynamics of monitored non-interacting fermions, including the existence of measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT), is a challenging problem with conflicting results in the literature. The mapping of the problem onto a non-linear sigma model (NLSM) indicates that relatively large lattice sizes are required to determine the nature of the entanglement entropy (EE) in the thermodynamics limit. Here we address this problem numerically for monitored non-interacting fermions with $U(1)$ symmetry. The use of Graphic-Processing-Unit (GPU) techniques, even with outdated hardware, makes possible to reach much larger lattice sizes ($L = 16384$ and $160\times160$ in one (1d) and two (2d) dimensions respectively) than in previous studies which enables us to characterize quantitatively the entanglement dynamics. In 1d, we show that in order to confirm the absence of a MIPT, for both projective and homodyne measurements, predicted by the NLSM it is necessary to reach $L \sim 10000$. In 2d, also as predicted by the NLSM, we observe for both protocols a MIPT at finite monitoring rate characterized by a scale invariant mutual information. The critical monitoring strength depends on the protocol while the critical exponent $\nu \approx 1.3$ governing the approach to the MIPT is similar in both cases. These features are not correctly predicted by the NLSM. Our results paves the way for a fully quantitative description of the entanglement dynamics of monitoring quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Far-from-equilibrium thermodynamic systems dominated by strong nonlinearity are reformulated within a dynamical framework based on the Nambu bracket formalism. It is demonstrated that general complex nonlinear non-equilibrium systems can be locally reduced to a simple form of Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics (NNET). Furthermore, mathematical and dynamical obstacles encountered in extending this reduction globally are discussed, and a generalized formulation that incorporates nonlinear effects through mixed higher-order tensors is proposed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently proposed that predictions of Lorentz-breaking space-time foam models from string theory may be compatible with the suggestion of light-speed variation from gamma-ray burst studies. Our analysis of foam-modified kinematics shows that despite the subluminal photon velocities explaining photon time delays one may, and in certain circumstances does, keep intact the electromagnetic showers essential for the detection and identification of cosmic photons. In contrast to other~(mostly phenomenological) approaches to Lorentz violations with modified dispersions leading to drastic changes on the formation length for the cascade development in the atmosphere and in detectors, there is the possibility that the dispersion effect in the present string foam model avoids such modifications and the theory naturally escapes the shower formation constraints from recent observations.</description>

Abstract: The tidal deformation of compact objects, characterised by their Love numbers, provides insights into the internal structure of neutron stars and black holes. While bosonic tidal Love numbers vanish for black holes in general relativity, it has been recently revealed that fermionic tidal perturbations can induce non-zero Love numbers for Kerr black holes. In this paper, we investigate the response of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole to the fermionic Weyl field. As a result, we find that the corresponding fermionic tidal Love numbers are also non-vanishing for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes except for the extremal ones, which highlights the universal distinct behavior of the fermionic tidal Love numbers compared to the bosonic counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that space-time modulation of electromagnetic potentials enables Klein tunneling far below the static threshold. The derived kinematics reveal oblique transitions that can connect opposite-energy continua without requiring their overlap, yielding a velocity-tunable Klein gap where transmission vanishes within a finite velocity window and reemerges beyond. The associated reduction in energy thresholds -- by up to four orders of magnitude -- suggests the potential for experimental realization using flying-focus fronts and relativistic electron beams.</description>

Abstract: Using ray-tracing techniques, this paper investigates the optical and polarization images of rotating black holes in Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity illuminated by thick accretion disks. We examine two accretion disk models: the phenomenological radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model and the analytical ballistic approximation accretion flow (BAAF) model. The RIAF model incorporates both isotropic and anisotropic radiation. In all models, the external bright rings corresponding to the high-order image and the internal dark region associated with the event horizon are observed. At high observational inclinations, the inner shadows are obscured by the radiation from the equatorial plane, which is significantly different from the thin accretion disk model. The primary distinction between isotropic and anisotropic radiation is that the latter causes distortion of the high-order image in the vertical direction, resulting in an elliptical structure. For the BAAF model, due to certain regions are geometrically thinner under the conical approximation, the high-order images are narrower compared to the RIAF model. Furthermore, we find that an increase in the rotational parameter $a$ leads to an asymmetry in the intensity distribution of the high-order image, while an increase in the spontaneous Lorentz violating parameters, $\varsigma$ and $\varpi$, results in a decrease in the size of the high-order image. In the polarization image, the linear polarization is found to be significantly influenced by the intensity, while it is relatively less affected by the parameters $\varsigma$ and $\varpi$. The electric vector position angle is mainly affected by the parameters $\varsigma$ and $\varpi$.</description>
