      <title>Low-temperature Spark Plasma Sintering of fine refractory composite powders core-shell: A case of the powders W@Ni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanisms of fast low-temperature Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) of W + 10% wt. Ni powders were investigated. The powder compositions were obtained in two methods: (i) by mixing W and Ni powders in a specified ratio (hereinafter referred to as W + Ni); (ii) by Ni deposition on the surface of submicron W particles allowing the formation of particles with a core W - shell Ni structure (hereinafter referred to as W@Ni). To reduce the concentrations of oxygen and oxides, the powders were annealed in hydrogen. The solid-phase sintering was performed at various temperatures (1000-1150{\deg}C), pressures (40-80 MPa), heating rates (50-500{\deg}C/min), and isothermal holding times (0-20 min). The sintering temperatures corresponded to the onset of intense dissolution of W in Ni. The samples had high relative density and small grain sizes. The activation energy of SPS of the mixed powders was close to the one of the grain boundary diffusion. The key mechanism for the compaction of W@Ni particles in the SPS process is Coble creep. The increasing of the sintering temperature was shown to lead to an increase in the solubility of W in Ni and, consequently, to an increase in the number of secondary Ni4W particles formed during cooling down. The grain growth has a minor effect on the mechanical properties of the W alloy compared to the changes in its phase composition.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Analysis of Plasma-Modified Silk Fibroin and Chitosan Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological interactions with material surfaces span a wide range of length scales, yet conventional surface measurements often fail to account for scale, limiting the insights they provide for surface engineering. Here, we investigate how multiscale surface descriptors of plasma-modified silk fibroin and chitosan surfaces modify bacterial and immune cell response. Surface chemistry and topography were characterized using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), followed by sliding bandpass filtration and multiscale curvature tensor-based methods to measure scale-dependent topographic features. Macrophage response and biofilm growth were assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Correlation strength showed scale-dependence with respect to surface features and biological structure: individual bacteria and small colonies correlated more strongly with fine-scale topographic features, whereas macrophage morphology correlated more strongly with larger-scale surface features. Notably, measured surface chemical descriptors generally did not correlate strongly with biofilm formation; nonetheless, chitosan and silk fibroin showed distinct trends in bacterial support, suggesting that material identity was not captured by the measured surface properties and that prevention of biofilms likely benefits from combinatorial approaches as opposed to physical surface modification alone. These results show that different biological structures interact with material surfaces at distinct length scales, as well as demonstrate the utility of multiscale analysis in identifying scales of interest in biological interactions with surfaces. Moreover, the data suggests that tailoring topographic feature size to the characteristic scale of the targeted biological entity is a potential strategy for antibacterial wound-healing materials without incurring cytotoxicity.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-aware Conditional Generation of Crystal Structures Using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of generative models in crystal structure prediction (CSP) has gained significant attention. Conditional generation--particularly the generation of crystal structures with specified stability or other physical properties has been actively researched for material discovery purposes. Meanwhile, the generative models capable of symmetry-aware generation are also under active development, because space group symmetry has a strong relationship with the physical properties of materials. In this study, we demonstrate that the symmetry control in the previous conditional crystal generation model may not be sufficiently effective when space group constraints are applied as a condition. To address this problem, we propose the WyckoffDiff-Adaptor, which embeds conditional generation within a WyckoffDiff architecture that effectively diffuses Wyckoff positions to achieve precise symmetry control. We successfully generated formation energy phase diagrams while specifying stable structures of particular combination of elements, such as Li--O and Ti--O systems, while simultaneously preserving the symmetry of the input conditions. The proposed method with symmetry-aware conditional generation demonstrates promising results as an effective approach to achieving the discovery of novel materials with targeted physical properties.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric torque in polar magnetic bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-efficient fast switching of spin orientations or textures is a core issue of spintronics, which is highly demanded but remains challenging. Different from the mainstream routes based on spin-transfer torque or spin-orbit torque, here we propose another mechanism coined as magnetoelectric torque to switch the magnetization in polar magnetic bilayers via pure electric field. In some magnetic van der Waals bilayers, when the electrostatic energy of polarization can compensate the interlayer magnetic coupling, a magnetoelectric torque is generated to fastly flip spins within a few picoseconds, which is demonstrated by combining the first-principles calculations, analytic model, as well as atomistic simulations. Such a magnetoelectric torque doesn't rely on the spin-orbit coupling and is generally active in polar magnetic homostructures and heterostructures. Our work provides an alternative route to switch magnetization in nanoscale, which may benefit the energy-saving and fast-response spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Materials Exploration by Integrating Automated Phase Identification and AI-Assisted Human Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous experimentation holds the potential to accelerate materials development by combining artificial intelligence (AI) with modular robotic platforms to explore extensive combinatorial chemical and processing spaces. Such self-driving laboratories can not only increase the throughput of repetitive experiments, but also incorporate human domain expertise to drive the search towards user-defined objectives, including improved materials performance metrics. We present an autonomous materials synthesis extension to SARA, the Scientific Autonomous Reasoning Agent, utilizing phase information provided by an automated probabilistic phase labeling algorithm to expedite the search for targeted phase regions. By incorporating human input into an expanded SARA-H (SARA with human-in-the-loop) framework, we enhance the efficiency of the underlying reasoning process. Using synthetic benchmarks, we demonstrate the efficiency of our AI implementation and show that the human input can contribute to significant improvement in sampling efficiency. We conduct experimental active learning campaigns using robotic processing of thin-film samples of several oxide material systems, including Bi$_2$O$_3$, SnO$_x$, and Bi-Ti-O, using lateral-gradient laser spike annealing to synthesize and kinetically trap metastable phases. We showcase the utility of human-in-the-loop autonomous experimentation for the Bi-Ti-O system, where we identify extensive processing domains that stabilize $\delta$-Bi$_2$O$_3$ and Bi$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, explore dwell-dependent ternary oxide phase behavior, and provide evidence confirming predictions that cationic substitutional doping of TiO$_2$ with Bi inhibits the unfavorable transformation of the metastable anatase to the ground-state rutile phase. The autonomous methods we have developed enable the discovery of new materials and new understanding of materials synthesis and properties.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Induced Martensitic Phase Transformation and Microstructure Evolution in nanograined $\text{Fe}\text{-}7\%\text{Mn}$ Alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fe-Mn-based alloys are receiving immense attention due to their applications in the third generation of advanced high-strength steels, owing to their high strength and ductility. A detailed in situ high-pressure structural phase transformation and microstructural evolution in nanograined $\text{Fe}\text{-}7\%\text{Mn}$ alloy has been performed using the axial synchrotron X-ray diffraction technique. The ambient BCC phase of $\text{Fe}\text{-}7\%\text{Mn}$ undergoes pressure-driven structural PT to the HCP phase at 11.4 GPa. Both BCC and HCP phases coexist up to 15.9 GPa; thereafter, they transform into a pure HCP phase, which remains stable up to the maximum pressure of 30.3 GPa. The XRD study reveals that the $(110)_{\mathrm{b}}$ dense crystallographic plane of the BCC lattice transforms into a densely packed $(002)_{\mathrm{h}}$ peak of the HCP lattice following the orientational relationship $(110)_{\mathrm{b}} \parallel (0001)_{\mathrm{h}}$ via diffusionless $ \mathrm{Burger's} $ martensitic crystallographic PT pathway. The evolution of crystallite size and microstrain with pressure shows a distinct change during the structural PT. The microstrain exhibits a sharp anomaly at around 10 GPa, suggesting that the microstructural changes precede the structural PT.</description>

      <title>Influence of Local Icosahedral Short-Range Order on the Magnetization Dynamics of Amorphous Cobalt-Iron Nanodisks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microscopic origin of soft magnetic properties in amorphous alloys is fundamentally linked to the interplay between local topological disorder and magnetic exchange interactions. In this work, we employ a multiscale Spin-Lattice Dynamics (SLD) approach to investigate the magnetostructural correlations in amorphous Co$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$ nanodisks ($x=35, 50, 65$). By integrating classical molecular dynamics with a generalized magnetic Hamiltonian, we capture the dynamic feedback loop between lattice vibrations and spin precession. Topological analysis via Voronoi tessellation reveals a persistent species-dependent structural heterogeneity: Cobalt atoms preferentially adopt "solid-like" icosahedral packing, forming a rigid structural backbone, whereas Iron atoms exhibit a higher propensity for "liquid-like" disordered environments. We demonstrate that this topological disparity dictates the macroscopic magnetic response. The Cobalt-driven structural stiffness preserves a robust exchange network that maximizes saturation magnetization, while the local disorder inherent to Iron-rich regions introduces exchange fluctuations that act as an intrinsic damping mechanism, delaying magnetic relaxation. These findings provide an atomistic explanation for the stability of ferromagnetic order in Co-Fe metallic glasses and offer a pathway for tuning damping parameters in amorphous spintronic devices through stoichiometric control.</description>

      <title>Giant Hole-doping in 2H-WSe2 via Ta Substitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The family of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) has been regarded as promising candidates for future electronics, valleytronics, spintronics, and optoelectronics. While most of TMDCs are intrinsic n-type semiconductors due to electron donation from chalcogen vacancies, realizing intrinsic p-type TMDCs and achieving precise control over their electronic properties remain challenging. In this work, we introduce a powerful approach to obtain intrinsic hole doping by substituting Ta atom into 2H-WSe2. A combining study of molecular beam epitaxy growth and in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy characterization clearly reveals that Ta substitution induces a significant hole doping and provides a possible way of a semiconductor-to-metal transition in 2H-WSe2.</description>

      <title>Effect of Interatomic Potential Choice on Fracture Modes of Graphene with Parallel Cracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defect engineering via parallel cracks has been proposed as a route to tailor the fracture response of graphene. However, atomistic fracture predictions can be strongly sensitive to the interatomic potential. Here, we quantify the effect of potential choice by revisiting H-passivated graphene containing two parallel cracks separated by a gap $W_{\text{gap}}$ loaded in tension along the armchair (AC) and zigzag (ZZ) directions. Molecular dynamics simulations using the AIREBO potential under the same geometry and loading protocol previously studied with ReaxFF, are employed, so enabling a direct comparison. Stress-strain responses, Young's modulus, an effective mode-I stress intensity factor, and energy absorption are evaluated as functions of $W_{\text{gap}}$. Compared with ReaxFF, AIREBO predicts lower peak stresses and earlier catastrophic softening, leading to reduced post-peak deformation capacity and energy absorption. Ductility and energy absorption are shown to be highly potential-dependent, underscoring the need for careful potential selection in defect-engineered graphene fracture simulations.</description>

      <title>Fractional-Monolayer 2D-GaN/AlN Structures: Growth Kinetics and UVC-emitter Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper reports on fundamental properties of the GaN/AlN quantum wells (QWs) with nominal subcritical thicknesses of 0.75-2 monolayers (MLs). They are grown by plasma-activated molecular beam epitaxy, varying either the nominal thickness or the gallium-to-nitrogen flux ratio. In situ monitoring reveals difference in 2D nucleation and step-flow growth modes of the QWs. The emission charactestics of QWs with integer thicknesses of 1 and 2 MLs depend weakly on the growth mechanism. In contrast, the intensity and spectral position luminescence of QWs with fractional-ML thicknesses are determined by the growth mechanism. Using ab initio calculations, a phenomenological model is proposed that describes fractional-ML QWs either as arrays of 2D quantum disks or as arrays of 2D quantum ribbons, in cases where 2D nucleation or step-flow growth mechanisms predominate, respectively. This model is generally consistent with experimental data on photo- and cathodoluminescence of heterostructures with multiple (250) GaN/AlN QWs. These heterostructures, when pumped by electrom beam at an energy 12.5 keV with a maximum pulse current of 2 A, exhibit linear current dependences of optical peak powers up to 1 and 37 W for wavelengths of 228 and 256 nm, respectively, making them promising for use as powerfull ultraviolet-C emitters.</description>

      <title>Cyclic- and helical-symmetry-adapted phonon formalism within density functional perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first-principles framework for the calculation of phonons in nanostructures with cyclic and/or helical symmetry. In particular, we derive a cyclic- and helical-symmetry-adapted representation of the dynamical matrix at arbitrary phonon wavevectors within a variationally formulated, symmetry-adapted density functional perturbation theory framework. In so doing, we also derive the acoustic sum rules for cylindrical geometries, which include a rigid-body rotational mode in addition to the three translational modes. We implement the cyclic- and helical-symmetry-adapted formalism within a high-order finite-difference discretization. Using carbon nanotubes as representative systems, we demonstrate the accuracy of the framework through excellent agreement with periodic plane-wave results. We further apply the framework to compute the Young's and shear moduli of carbon nanotubes, as well as the scaling laws governing the dependence of ring and radial breathing mode phonon frequencies on nanotube diameter. The elastic moduli are found to be in agreement with previous density functional theory and experimental results, while the phonon scaling laws show qualitative agreement with previous atomistic simulations.</description>

      <title>Achieving Ultrahigh Resolution with High Efficiency: Optical Design of the 2D-RIXS Spectrometer at NanoTerasu BL02U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A state-of-the-art Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) facility, composed of a dedicated beamline and a 2D-RIXS spectrometer, has been constructed and commissioned at BL02U in NanoTerasu, Japan. This paper reports the optical design and optimization of this spectrometer, aiming for an ultrahigh energy resolution of &lt;10 meV in the soft X-ray range. Conventional RIXS spectrometers using monochromatic incident X-rays suffer from a severe trade-off between energy resolution and measurement efficiency, which makes achieving resolutions of &lt;10 meV practically unfeasible. To overcome this limitation, we adopted the $h\nu^2$ concept using dispersive incident X-rays, based on a comparative study. This approach decouples the energy resolution from the incident bandwidth. We estimate that our 2D-RIXS spectrometer improves efficiency by more than a factor of 10 compared to conventional spectrometers. The 2D-RIXS spectrometer has been successfully commissioned, demonstrating that sub-10 meV resolution measurement is achievable with practical throughput. While development continues towards the ultimate design resolution, the successful implementation validates the design strategy and offers a pathway for future high-performance RIXS instrumentation.</description>

      <title>DataScribe: An AI-Native, Policy-Aligned Web Platform for Multi-Objective Materials Design and Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The acceleration of materials discovery requires digital platforms that go beyond data repositories to embed learning, optimization, and decision-making directly into research workflows. We introduce DataScribe, an AI-native, cloud-based materials discovery platform that unifies heterogeneous experimental and computational data through ontology-backed ingestion and machine-actionable knowledge graphs. The platform integrates FAIR-compliant metadata capture, schema and unit harmonization, uncertainty-aware surrogate modeling, and native multi-objective multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization, enabling closed-loop propose-measure-learn workflows across experimental and computational pipelines.

      <title>Excitonic Landscape of Monolayer Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides: Experimental Discrepancies, Theoretical Advances, and Strain Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitons in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have garnered significant attention because of their large binding energies due to weakly screened Coulomb interaction, and direct bandgap at the K/K$^\prime$ point in the hexagonal Brillouin zone featuring spin-polarised bands due to spin-orbit coupling and lack of inversion symmetry. This makes them prospective for next-generation optoelectronic and quantum devices. However, despite the intense research activity, the reported values for exciton binding energies, quasiparticle gaps, and spectral features exhibit substantial variation across both experimental and theoretical studies. In this article, we present a comprehensive and critical assessment of the current understanding of excitonic properties in single-layer TMDs, integrating results from the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), photoluminescence (PL) measurements, and other experimental techniques with first-principles theoretical insights. Special emphasis is placed on the comparison and reconciliation of discrepancies observed across different experimental setups and sample qualities. Furthermore, we highlight our state-of-the-art GW-BSE calculations, which include both equilibrium and laterally strained systems, to systematically analyse the behaviour of direct and indirect excitons. By evaluating the effect of strain as a tunable control variable, we demonstrate its potential to engineer excitonic properties, supported by cross-validation against prior theoretical predictions and experimental findings. In doing so, we clarify the sources of discrepancies in the literature and offer a unified perspective on excited-state engineering strategies in two-dimensional TMDs.</description>

      <title>Dynamical stability by spin transfer in nearly isotropic magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin transfer torques (STTs) control magnetisation by electric currents, enabling a range of nano-scale spintronic applications. They can destabilise the equilibrium magnetisation state by counteracting magnetic relaxation. Here, we maximise the STT effect through a dedicated growth-annealing protocol for CoFeB thin films, such that magnetic anisotropies originating from the interface and shape almost cancel each other. The nearly isotropic magnets enable low-current dynamical stabilisation of the magnetisation in the direction opposite to an applied magnetic field, thereby realising a spintronic analogue of the Kapitza pendulum. In an intermediate current regime, the STT drives large magnetisation vector fluctuations that cover the entire Bloch sphere. The continuous variable associated with the stochastic magnetisation direction may serve as a resource for probabilistic computing and neuromorphic hardware. Our results establish isotropic magnets as a platform to study as-yet-uncharted, far-from-equilibrium spin dynamics including anti-magnonics, with promising implications for unconventional computing paradigms.</description>

      <title>Forbidden second harmonics in centrosymmetric bilayer crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical spectroscopy based on second-order nonlinearity is a critical technique for characterizing two-dimensional (2D) crystals as well as bioimaging and quantum optics. It is generally believed that second-harmonic generation (SHG) in centrosymmetric crystals, such as graphene and other bilayer 2D crystals, is negligible without externally breaking the inversion symmetry. Here, we show that with a new homodyne detection technique, we can apparently circumvent this symmetry-imposed constraint and observe robust SHG in pristine centrosymmetric crystals, without any symmetry-breaking field. With its exceptional sensitivity, we resolve polarization-resolved SHG in bilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), bilayer 2H-WSe$_2$, and remarkably, Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene, allowing us to unambiguously identify the crystallographic orientation in these crystals via SHG for the first time. We also demonstrate that the new technique can be used to non-invasively detect uniaxial strain and optical geometric phase in these crystals. The observed SHG in our experiments is attributed to second-order nonlinearity in the quadrupole channel, which is controlled by the presence of the $C_2$ symmetry instead of the inversion symmetry. Our new technique expands the capability of nonlinear optical spectroscopy to encompass a large class of centrosymmetric materials that could never be measured before, and can be used for quantum sensing of moir\'e materials and twisted epitaxial films.</description>

      <title>Multimode Objective Lens for Momentum Microscopy and XPEEM: Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10084v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new type of objective lens has recently been proposed for use in X-ray photoemission electron microscopes (XPEEMs) and momentum microscopes. Adding a ring electrode concentric with the extractor allows the field in the gap between the sample and the extractor to be shaped. Forming a lens field in this gap reduces the field strength at the sample by up to an order of magnitude. This mitigates the risk of field emission, particularly for cleaved samples with sharp edges. A retarding field can redirect all slow electrons, thus eliminating the primary contribution to the space-charge interaction. Here we present the first experimental investigation of the new lens, examining its performance at photon energies ranging from the extreme ultraviolet produced by a high-harmonic generation (HHG)-based source to soft and hard X-rays at two synchrotron facilities. The gap lens in a region without electrodes enables large working distances up to 23 mm. Reduced aberrations allow for larger fields of view in both k-space and real-space imaging, with resolutions comparable to those of conventional cathode lenses. However, field strengths are an order of magnitude smaller. The zero-field mode enables the study of 3D structured objects and is therefore beneficial for small cleaved samples as well as for operando devices involving top electrodes. The repeller mode reduces space-charge effects, but results in a smaller k-field diameter. This reduction ranges from 10% at hard X-ray energies to 50% in the XUV range. The usable energy interval is also reduced by a factor of two. In time-of-flight XPEEM mode the raw data show a resolution of 250 nm, which can be improved to better than 100 nm through data processing.</description>

      <title>Time-domain extreme ultraviolet diffuse scattering spectroscopy of nanoscale surface phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the observation of dynamic fringe patterns in the diffuse scattering of extreme ultraviolet light from surfaces, following femtosecond optical excitation. At each point on the detector, the diffuse scattering intensity exhibits oscillations at well-defined frequencies that correspond to surface phonons with wave vectors determined by the scattering geometry, indicating that the optical excitation generates coherent surface phonons propagating in all directions and spanning a wavelength range from 60 to 300 nm. This phenomenon is observed on a variety of samples, including single-layer and multilayer metal films, as well as bulk semiconductors. The measured surface phonon dispersions show good agreement with theoretical calculations. By comparing signal amplitudes from samples with different surface morphologies, we find that the excitation mechanism is linked to the natural surface roughness of the samples. However, the signal is still detectable on extremely smooth surfaces with sub-nanometer roughness. Our findings demonstrate a simple and effective method for optically exciting coherent surface phonons with nanoscale wavelengths on a wide range of solid samples and establish a foundation for surface phonon spectroscopy in a wave vector range well beyond the limit of conventional surface Brillouin scattering.</description>

      <title>Highly Hydrogenated Monolayer Graphene with Wide Band Gap Opening</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A thorough spectroscopic characterisation of highly hydrogenated monolayer graphene transferred on nickel grids is herein reported. The hydrogen bonding was found to be favoured for a more distorted graphene lattice. With X ray photoemission spectroscopy on the C 1s core-level, a 100$\%$ $sp^3$ distortion was observed after the hydrogenation of a more $sp^3$-like defected graphene, while a flatter, more $sp^2$-arranged, graphene reached a 62$\%$ $sp^3$ saturation. Electron energy loss spectroscopy showed the $\pi$-plasmon excitation quenching for the 100$\%$ $sp^3$ sample and a significant reduction for the other one. The high loading levels of hydrogenation led to the opening of a wide optical band gap (6.3 and 6.2 eV). The C-H stretching vibrational mode was also observed, as a direct footprint of graphene hydrogenation. Finally, valence band measurements of the 62$\%$ saturated sample suggest the coexistence of one-side and two-side hydrogenation morphologies.</description>

      <title>Ultrathin bismuth-yttrium iron garnet films with tunable magnetic anisotropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the epitaxial growth of nm-thick films of bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet (BiYIG) by high-temperature off-axis radio-frequency magnetron sputtering. We demonstrate accurate control of the magnetic properties by tuning of the sputtering parameters and epitaxial strain on various (111)-oriented garnet substrates. BiYIG films with up to -0.80\% lattice mismatch with the substrate remain fully strained up to 60~nm-thick, maintaining a high crystalline quality. Transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirm coherent epitaxial growth, the absence of defects, and limited interdiffusion at the BiYIG/substrate interface. Varying the tensile or compressive strain between -0.80\% and +0.56\% in BiYIG allows for accurate compensation of the total magnetic anisotropy through magneto-elastic coupling. The effective magnetic anisotropy of sputtered BiYIG films can be further tuned via the off-axis deposition angle and the oxygen flow during growth, which determine the cation stoichiometry. Under optimized growth conditions, a ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth of 1~mT at 10~GHz is reliably obtained even for thicknesses as low as 10~nm. We also report small FMR linewidths in ultrathin (2-5~nm) BiYIG films grown on diamagnetic substrate yttrium scandium gallium garnet. These findings highlight the promise of low-damping, strain-engineered nm-thick BiYIG films for implementing advanced functionalities in spin-orbitronic and magnonic devices. Specifically, the magnetic-anisotropy compensation and low damping enable large cone-angle magnetization dynamics immune to magnon-magnon nonlinear scattering.</description>

      <title>Control of Extraordinary Optical Transmission in Resonant Terahertz Gratings via Lateral Depletion in an AlGaN-GaN Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic metallic gratings on substrates can support a range of electromagnetic modes, such as leaky waveguide, guided-resonant, and Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity modes, which can strongly modulate optical transmission under resonant excitation. Here, we investigate how this coupling can be dynamically manipulated through charge-density control in a laterally patterned AlGaN/GaN heterostructure. The structure comprises metallic stripes separated by regions containing a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), forming a periodically modulated interface whose electromagnetic response is governed by the charge density between the stripes. In the unbiased state, the conductive 2DEG screens the incident terahertz field and suppresses excitation of guided modes. When the 2DEG is depleted, the change in boundary conditions allows efficient coupling into substrate resonances, producing a strong modulation at particular frequencies where extraordinary optical transmission (EOT) through the structure takes place. The results highlight the sensitive dependence of guided-mode-resonance (GMR) mediated EOT on inter-stripe charge distribution and demonstrate a direct interplay between carrier dynamics and resonant electromagnetic phenomena in the terahertz regime.</description>

Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics provides a powerful tool to manipulate material properties, yet it remains a matter of debate whether and how quantized fields affect the periodicity of crystals. Here, we extend Bloch's theorem to crystals under strong light-matter coupling, revealing that polariton quasiparticles preserve lattice periodicity. We introduce a general framework to incorporate multimode cavity fields in a simple and tractable way, showing that additional modes contribute small energy corrections noticeable only at low frequencies. Within the single-photon approximation, these contributions reduce to a spatially uniform effective field in the crystal plane, providing a formal justification for the single-mode and long-wavelength approximations commonly used in molecular polaritonics. Together, these results establish a rigorous framework for describing polaritonic states in crystalline solids.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Flux Equations for Ion Exchange in Silicate Glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03207v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ion exchange kinetic flux equations have been extensively investigated since the mid-twentieth century and continue to provide a fundamental framework for describing mass transport phenomena in solid materials. Despite the maturity of this field, inconsistencies remain in the literature concerning the definition, dimensional consistency, and physical interpretation of the parameters involved. A rigorous and unified treatment of these equations is therefore essential to ensure the reproducibility and comparability of theoretical and experimental studies. The present study aims to establish a coherent and systematic development of ion exchange kinetic flux equations, with particular emphasis on the consistent definition and dimensional formulation of the relevant physical quantities. Beyond refining the theoretical foundations, this study extends the classical formulation by incorporating the influence of mechanical stress on ion transport and considering cross-term interactions within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics. This study investigates ion-exchange kinetics within silicate glasses, operating under the Nernst-Planck binary interdiffusion regime. These developments provide a more comprehensive description of ion exchange kinetics, particularly as applied to silicate glasses, where coupling between chemical and mechanical effects plays a crucial role in determining transport behavior and performance.</description>

Abstract: Tantalum dioxide (TaO2) is a metastable tantalum compound. Here, we report the epitaxial stabilization of TaO2 on Al2O3 (1-102) (r-plane sapphire) substrates using suboxide molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) and thermal laser epitaxy (TLE), demonstrating single-oriented, monodomain growth of anisotropically strained thin films. Microstructural investigation is performed using synchrotron X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy. The tetravalent oxidation state of tantalum is confirmed using X-ray absorption and photoemission spectroscopy as well as electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Optical properties are investigated via spectroscopic ellipsometry and reveal a 0.3 eV Mott gap of the tantalum 5d electrons. Density-functional theory and group theoretical arguments are used to evaluate the limited stability of the rutile phase and reveal the potential to unlock a hidden metal-insulator transition concomitant with a structural phase transition to a distorted rutile phase, akin to NbO2. Our work expands the understanding of tantalum oxides and paves the way for their integration into next-generation electronic and photonic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02491v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming that, with some care, dislocations could be meaningfully described by torsion, we propose here a scenario based on a previously unexplored role of time in the low-energy Dirac field theory description of two-space-dimensional Dirac materials. Our approach is based on the realization of an exotic time-loop that could be realized by oscillating particle-hole pairs, overcoming the well-known geometrical obstructions due to the lack of a third spatial dimension. General symmetry considerations allow concluding that the effects we are looking for can only be seen if we move to the nonlinear response regime.</description>

Abstract: As an advanced imaging system, the magneto-optical-electric joint-measurement scanning imaging system (MOEJSI) brings spectroscopic techniques with unmatched spatial resolution to very low temperature, high magnetic field and high electric field measurements. It was developed for investigating the magnetic and ferroelectric properties and their mutual control through magneto-optical-electric joint-measurements, besides Raman and photoluminescence features. In particular, the reflective magnetic circular dichroism (RMCD) loops and imaging, linear dichroism (LD) imaging and polarization-electric field hysteresis loop can be achieved when simultaneously applied high magnetic field (7 T) and electric field (100 V) at low temperature of 10 K.</description>

      <title>Chiral superconductivity from parent Chern band and its non-Abelian generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05384v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a minimal model starting from a parent Chern band with quartic dispersion that can describe the spin-valley polarized electrons in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene. The interplay between repulsive and attractive interactions on top of that parent Chern band is studied. We conduct standard self-consistent mean-field calculations, and find a rich phase diagram that consists of metal, quantum anomalous Hall crystal, chiral topological superconductor, as well as trivial gapped Bose--Einstein condensate. In particular, there exists a topological phase transition from the chiral superconductor to the Bose--Einstein condensate at zero temperature. Motivated by the recent experimental and theoretical studies of composite Fermi liquid in rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene, we further generalize the physical electron model to its composite fermion counterpart based on a field theory analysis. The chiral superconductor phase of the composite fermion becomes the nonabelian Moore--Read quantum Hall phase. We argue that a chiral (pseudo-)spin liquid phase can emerge in the vicinity of this Moore--Read quantum Hall phase. Our work suggests rhombohedral multilayer graphene as a potential platform for rich correlated topological phases.</description>

      <title>Revealing Superconducting Chiral Edge Modes via Resistance Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inducing superconducting correlations in quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states offers a promising route to realize topological superconductivity with chiral Majorana edge modes. However, the definitive identification of these modes is challenging. Here we propose detecting superconducting chiral edge modes via the probability distribution of the resistance, or equivalently the charge transmission of QAH-superconductor heterojunctions. Remarkably, the distribution for coherent edge exhibits distinct characteristics for different topological superconducting phases in sufficiently long junctions, and this difference remains robust against weak decoherence. These findings provide insights into transport phenomena beyond the clean limit and highlight the resistance distribution as a compelling signature for distinguishing topological superconducting phases.</description>

      <title>Magnetic ground state of a Jeff = 1/2 based frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnet</title>

Abstract: The subtle interplay between competing degrees of freedom, crystal electric fields, and spin correlations can lead to exotic quantum states in 4f ion-based frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnets. We present the crystal structure, thermodynamic and muon spin relaxation ({\mu}SR) studies of the 4f ion-based frustrated magnet Ba4YbReWO12, wherein Yb3+ ions constitute a triangular lattice. The magnetic susceptibility does not show any signature of spin freezing down to 1.9 K or long-range magnetic ordering down to 0.4 K. The low-temperature Curie-Weiss fit to the inverse magnetic susceptibility data reveals a weak antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, which is corroborated by the fit of magnetic specific heat data following the J1-J2 model with the nearest neighbor exchange interaction of J1 = -0.197 K between the Jeff = 1/2 states of the Yb3+ moments in the lowest Kramers doublet. The lowest Kramers ground state doublet is well separated from the first excited state with a gap of 278 K, as evidenced by our {\mu}SR experiments that support the realization of Jeff = 1/2 at low temperatures. The specific heat experiments do not detect a phase transition down to 56 mK. The magnetic specific heat shows a broad maximum 90 mK suggesting a disordered ground state with short range spin correlations. The associated magnetic entropy release at low temperatures is consistent with that expected for the Jeff = 1/2 state. The zero-field {\mu}SR measurements show neither the signature of spin freezing nor a phase transition, at least down to 43 mK. Our results suggest a dynamic, disordered ground state in this Jeff = 1/2 frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnet. Ba4RReWO12 (R=rare earth) offers a viable platform to realize intriguing quantum states borne out of spin-orbit coupling and frustration</description>

      <title>Modeling phononic band gap in microstructured solids using the Riemann-Cartan geometric framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the modeling of acoustic wave fields in microstructured elastic solids within the framework of Riemann-Cartan geometry. We consider a scenario in which microstructural deformations occur significantly faster than those of the bulk material. This time-scale separation creates apparent geometric incompatibilities at the macroscopic level, even in the absence of permanent inelastic deformation or damage. We formalize this phenomenon by using a non-holonomic frame field to represent macroscopic elastic deformations and an associated torsion field to characterize the resulting geometric incompatibilities. The spatial components of the torsion tensor quantify the instantaneous geometric incompatibility of the macroscopic deformations, while its temporal components capture the inertial effects arising from the reversible energy exchange between the micro- and macro-scales. A key finding is that the model's dispersion relation predicts a complete frequency band gap. Furthermore, the governing equations exhibit a mathematical analogy to Maxwell's equations, potentially bridging the modeling of phononic and photonic metamaterials.</description>
