      <title>Coupled Map Lattice for Astronomical Object Formation: A Scenario for Evolution from Star to Disk, Arms, and Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new dynamic formation model of a star, a disk, arms, and companions using a coupled map lattice (CML), a complex systems approach. This CML simulates the viscoelastic and chaotic dynamics and evolution of gas clumps containing a little dust with a minimal set of one Eulerian procedure for the flow formation of gas clumps due to gravitational interaction, and one Lagrangian procedure for the collision and mixture of gas clumps due to viscoelastic advection. Despite its simplicity, this CML successfully obtains four typical astronomical objects consistent with protoplanetary disk observations: a central star, Keplerian disk, spiral arms, and even stellar, substellar, and planetary companions. All these formation processes are truly dynamic, with the central star "starring" in them, and they are not based on the conventional disk gravitational instability but on the central star gravitational instability with high-dimensional chaotic gas ejection, namely the chaotic itinerancy. Of particular note is the process in which diverse companions are formed due to the rapid density increase caused by the intersection of spiral arms. This suggests a novel companion formation scenario that should be called "arm-crossing companion formation" with a view to planet formation, which may overcome the radial drift barrier and angular momentum problem.</description>

      <title>On the efficiency of pairwise Hamiltonian control to desynchronize the higher-order Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization of coupled oscillators is observed in many natural and engineered systems and emerges due to the interactions within the system. It can be both beneficial, e.g., in power grids, and harmful, e.g., in epileptic seizures. In the latter case, efficient control methods to desynchronize the systems are crucial. Recent studies have shown that interactions are not always pairwise, but higher-order, i.e., many-body, and this greatly affects the dynamics. For instance, higher-order interactions increase the linear stability of synchronized states but simultaneously shrink their attraction basin, with potentially opposite effects on control methods. Here, we use a minimally invasive pairwise control based on Hamiltonian control theory, and investigate its efficiency on phase oscillators with higher-order interactions. We show that, if the initial phases are close to the synchronized state, higher-order interactions make desynchronization more difficult to achieve. Otherwise, a non-monotonic effect appears: intermediate strengths of higher-order interactions impede desynchronization while larger ones facilitate it. In all cases, the control can desynchronize the system with a sufficient number of controlled nodes and intensity.</description>

      <title>New sector morphologies emerge from anisotropic colony growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Competition during range expansions is of great interest from both practical and theoretical view points. Experimentally, range expansions are often studied in homogeneous Petri dishes, which lack spatial anisotropy that might be present in realistic populations. Here, we analyze a model of anisotropic growth, based on coupled Kardar-Parisi-Zhang and Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov equations that describe surface growth and lateral competition. Compared to a previous study of isotropic growth, anisotropy relaxes a constraint between parameters of the model. We completely characterize spatial patterns and invasion velocities in this generalized model. In particular, we find that strong anisotropy results in a distinct morphology of spatial invasion with a kink in the displaced strain ahead of the boundary between the strains. This morphology of the out-competed strain is similar to a shock wave and serves as a signature of anisotropic growth.</description>
