      <title>Phononic enhancement and detection of hidden spin-nematicity and dynamics in quantum magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin nematic phase, characterized by long-range order of spin quadrupole moments in the absence of dipolar magnetism, presents a significant challenge for conventional experimental detection. We propose a novel method to detect this elusive order in quantum magnets with an illustration in the spin-1 triangular lattice Mott insulator. By integrating out the phonon degrees of freedom, we obtain a phase diagram with substantially enlarged regions for the spin-nematic and spin-nematic-supersolid phases. We then demonstrate that through the spin-lattice coupling, the emergence of spin nematic order imprints a distinctive signature onto the phonon spectra, providing a clear spectroscopic signature for the quadrupolar order accessible via Raman or inelastic X-ray scattering. Our formalism offers a direct and powerful method to uncover the hidden spin nematicity, opening a new pathway for diagnosing multipolar orders in quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Quantum Control of Single Spin Defects in a Two-Dimensional Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individual spin defects in solids are promising building blocks for quantum technologies, but their deterministic creation, individual addressability, and operation near surfaces remain major challenges. Two-dimensional materials provide an attractive alternative, as their single-layer thickness enables direct atomic-scale access to defect states. Here, we demonstrate single-spin control of solid-state defects in a two-dimensional semiconductor by a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy and electron spin resonance. We create and manipulate individual sulfur vacancies and carbon substitution defects in monolayer molybdenum disulfide and characterize their spin dynamics, including coherent control, at the single-defect level. Using atomic manipulation, we further engineer and probe spin-spin interactions between defect pairs. Our results demonstrate deterministic creation, addressability, coherent manipulation, and controlled coupling of individual spin defects within a single experimental platform. This establishes atomically engineered spin defects in two-dimensional semiconductors as a versatile class of controllable solid-state quantum systems and opens a route towards tailored quantum sensing experiments.</description>

      <title>The Anyon Zeno Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two anyons encircling each other acquire a quantized braiding phase that is independent of their spatial separation. We show that detecting this phase in a fractional quantum Hall interference experiment results in a quantum Zeno effect: a localized anyon is trapped by constant observation from a stream of anyons supplied by the measurement current. Interferometers with an embedded antidot are ideal for accessing the Zeno regime, where the bare tunneling rate of localized anyons is much lower than the measurement rate. The Zeno-suppressed tunneling rate of the trapped anyon depends on the braiding phase and the transmission of the quantum point contacts. Our primary prediction is that the autocorrelation time of the conductance through the interferometer increases with the bias current. This effect may be used to experimentally control the anyon dynamics, in particular to increase the lifetime of localized anyons.</description>

      <title>Resonant Zener Interferometry in van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the presence of quantum interference effects in van der Waals heterostructures subject to in-plane electric fields. The in-plane field $F$ accelerates carriers through a hybridized band edge, and interlayer Zener tunneling occurs by distinct pathways, resulting in a solid-state quantum interferometer with imprints in transport observables. For parabolic-band bilayers, we identify two characteristic signatures which are observable in lateral conductance: Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg oscillations in the band-overlap regime periodic in $1/F$ at small fields, resembling electric-field induced quantum oscillations, and a pronounced resonance at $F\propto T_0^{3/2}$ set by the interlayer tunneling $T_0$. These features provide a directly accessible probe of coherent interferometric dynamics in van der Waals heterostructures, and could be harnessed for more precise engineering and characterization.</description>

      <title>First-principles and tight-binding analysis of thermoelectricity in irradiated WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic and thermoelectric transport in zigzag monolayer WSe$_2$ nanoribbons are studied under monochromatic irradiation. The electronic structure is described within a six-orbital tight-binding framework constructed from the relevant tungsten and selenium orbitals, with atomic spin-orbit coupling included explicitly. Periodic driving is incorporated via the Peierls substitution, and in the high-frequency limit the system is mapped onto an effective static Floquet Hamiltonian with polarization-dependent renormalized hoppings. Coherent transport is evaluated using wave-function matching within the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formalism. The lattice thermal conductivity is obtained independently from density functional perturbation theory combined with an iterative solution of the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. Light-induced hopping renormalization reshapes the band dispersion and transmission spectrum near the Fermi level, modifying the Landauer transport integrals that determine electrical and thermal conductances and the Seebeck coefficient. Together with spin-orbit-driven band splitting and reduced lattice thermal conductivity from enhanced anharmonic scattering, this leads to a thermoelectric figure of merit $ZT$ exceeding unity over a broad temperature range.</description>

      <title>Coupling-energy driven pumping through quantum dots: the role of coherences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of off-resonant tunneling and coherences on the electron pumping through quantum dots. Thereby, we focus on two electron-pump setups where lowest-order tunneling processes are suppressed and the pump is exclusively driven by modulations of the coupling energy. The first setup is driven by switching on and off the couplings between the quantum dot and the leads, while the second setup employs measurements of the dot occupation. We derive exact solutions for arbitrarily strong tunnel couplings in the absence of Coulomb interaction, identify parameter regimes with optimal pumping currents or optimal energy efficiency, and discuss similarities between both pumping mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Dimensional and doping stability of Peierls charge density waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Peierls instability, the spontaneous dimerization of a one-dimensional metallic chain at half filling, is a paradigmatic mechanism for charge-density-wave (CDW) formation. Here we test its robustness under finite doping and interchain hybridization in finite-thickness arrays of identical chains. We find that the stacking geometry plays a decisive role in stabilizing CDW order away from half filling. In particular, parallel-coupled chains exhibit a bistable regime where the normal and dimerized states coexist as local minima of the total energy, while skew-coupled chains display reentrant CDW order upon doping. Our results demonstrate that even minimal models of coupled atomic chains host rich phase diagrams controlled by doping, lattice rigidity, and interchain coupling geometry.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic Spin Splitter Currents in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets exhibit momentum-dependent spin splitting despite having zero net magnetization. This enables a spin-splitter effect in which an external electric field generates transverse spin currents by separating oppositely polarized carriers. Here, we develop a unified semiclassical theory of linear extrinsic spin-splitter currents, incorporating impurity-induced side-jump and skew-scattering contributions, and apply it to the $d$-wave altermagnet \ch{FeSb2}. We demonstrate that asymmetric impurity scattering provides a dominant channel for spin-splitter currents. Remarkably, the resulting extrinsic spin conductivity is time-reversal even, in contrast to previously studied spin-splitter responses arising from symmetric scattering.</description>

      <title>Electromechanical Switching and Momentum-Selective Transport in Geometry-Defined Blue Phosphorus Homojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing intrinsic homojunctions without chemical heterogeneity remains a key challenge in future two - dimensional devices. Here, we report a geometry - defined metal--semiconductor--metal homojunction in bilayer blue phosphorus (BlueP) created by a localized bubble corrugation, without chemical doping or foreign - material interfaces. First - principles calculations show that enlarging the interlayer separation in the metallic A\(_1\)B\(_1\) - stacked BlueP bilayer opens a band gap, enabling a semiconducting barrier embedded between metallic segments. First - principles quantum - transport simulations reveal a crossover from ballistic to tunneling transport upon bubble formation. In the tunneling regime, transmission decreases exponentially with bubble width while remaining weakly sensitive to bubble height and bulging direction. The junction acts as an orientation - dependent \(k\) - space filter, producing transport anisotropy and momentum selectivity. Orbital - resolved scattering analysis shows that intralayer - bonding channels persist under deformation whereas interlayer - hybridized channels are quenched, and that \sigma - type bonding yields higher conductance than \pi - type bonding. These insights motivate two electromechanical device concepts: a mechanically switchable memory element with ON/OFF ratios up to 30 and a nanoscale sliding rheostat with reproducible exponential resistance tuning for \AA - scale displacement sensing.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous superconductivity in (001), (110) and (111) KTaO$_3$ two-dimensional electronic gas: $T_c$ driven from electronic confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate superconductivity in KTaO$_3$ (KTO)-based two-dimensional electron gases for the (001), (110), and (111) crystallographic orientations within a unified microscopic framework. Using a self-consistent tight-binding slab model, we determine the confinement potential, electronic structure, and orbital composition for each orientation, explicitly including inversion-symmetry-induced orbital Rashba couplings. Using a local spin-singlet s-wave pairing interaction, we find that the pronounced orientation dependence of the superconducting critical temperature primarily originates from differences in the spatial extent of the two-dimensional electron gas and the associated redistribution of the density of states at the Fermi level, rather than from changes in the pairing interaction. Our results provide a microscopic explanation for the experimentally observed orientation dependence of superconductivity at KTO-based interfaces.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-protected control of Liouvillian topological phases via Hamiltonian band topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a symmetry-protected correspondence between band topology of coherent Hamiltonians and Liouvillian spectral winding in Lindblad descriptions of open quantum systems. This allows the Hamiltonian topology to act as a knob for controlling Liouvillian topology and corresponding non-equilibrium dynamics, rather than being passively manipulated by system-environment exchanges. In particular, by exactly solving the Liouvillian spectrum in a class of one-dimensional dissipative lattices, we find that the Hamiltonian band topology constrains the Liouvillian spectral winding and determines the Liouvillian skin effect, provided the Hamiltonian and quantum jump operators respect the same chiral symmetry. We further demonstrate that lattice parity controls the associated bulk-boundary correspondence and the coherence properties of the steady state. Our results unveil a symmetry-enforced topological control of spectral and spatial organization in open quantum systems, providing a unified perspective on topology in Hamiltonian and dissipative dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Macroscopic quantum electrodynamics (MQED) provides a unified framework to describe quantum electromagnetic fields in the presence of arbitrary macroscopic environments. Central to this theory is the field correlation, which governs both radiative (e.g., Lamb shifts and the Purcell effect) and mechanical phenomena, such as van der Waals and Casimir forces. In this tutorial, we provide an overview of MQED and its extension to active media, highlighting fluctuation-induced forces as manifestations of gain-modified field correlations.</description>

      <title>Many-Body effects beyond excitons in second-harmonic generation of monolayer MoS$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantitative study of many-body effects including the three-particle level on second-harmonic generation in monolayer MoS$_{2}$. Our approach combines many-body perturbation theory with time-dependent current-density-functional theory within an \textit{ab initio} framework in the optical limit. Inclusion of two-particle excitonic effects \textit{via} a dynamical long-range linear exchange-correlation kernel reproduces the qualitative features of the second-harmonic response, but underestimates the experimentally reported magnitudes by nearly a factor of two. By incorporating three-particle (trionic) correlations through a static long-range quadratic exchange-correlation kernel, we achieve significantly improved quantitative agreement with experiment. These findings highlight the role of many-body interactions beyond the excitonic level in accurately describing second-order optical responses in two-dimensional semiconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum geometry quantifies how the single-particle Bloch wavefunction changes in phase and amplitude across the Brillouin Zone. In multi-orbital systems where bands have strongly mixed orbital composition, quantum geometry plays a vital role in determining the ground state and low-energy properties of interacting electronic systems. In this work, we show that Mott metal-insulator transitions, as well as transitions between different magnetic orders within the Mott insulating phase, can be driven by the quantum geometry of the underlying Bloch band, thereby providing a mechanism complementary to conventional bandwidth-tuned Mott transitions. By studying the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model using exact diagonalization, we demonstrate that in in half-filled and topologically-trivial bands, quantum geometric properties of the Bloch states alone can act as a tuning knob for Mott metal-to-insulator and affect the competition between ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. We show that both transitions may be heuristically understood via non-local Coulomb scattering in a basis of exponentially localized Wannier functions. These results highlight the role of quantum geometry beyond topological settings as a governing principle for conventional Mott and magnetic physics in multi-orbital and moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-enforced agreement of Kohn--Sham and many-body Berry phases in the SSH--Hubbard chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study when a density-matching Kohn--Sham (KS) description can reproduce a many-body Berry phase in a correlated insulator, despite the fact that geometric phases are functionals of the wave function. Focusing on the one-dimensional SSH--Hubbard chain on a ring as a controlled interacting topological model, we introduce a $U(1)$ twist $\theta$ (flux insertion). The many-body ground state along the full twist cycle is computed by the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), while the onsite interaction $U$ is tuned from the noninteracting to the strong-coupling regime. At half filling in the inversion-symmetric gapped regime, our DMRG calculations show that the density remains constant within numerical accuracy over the entire $(\theta,U)$ range studied. Thus, the density has no dependence on either the flux $\theta$ or the interaction strength $U$. Accordingly, the symmetry-preserving density constraint collapses the KS reference to an SSH-type quadratic representative with $U$-independent geometric diagnostics. Nevertheless, the many-body wave function exhibits a nontrivial geometric response: the quantum metric associated with the $\theta$-parametrized ground-state manifold depends on $\theta$ at intermediate $U$ and is strongly suppressed at large $U$, consistent with the charge fluctuation freezing. Intriguingly, the KS and many-body Berry phases coincide throughout the gapped regime as $U$ is tuned from weak to strong coupling. We show that this agreement is best understood as symmetry-enforced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ sector matching, rather than as evidence that the density encodes the many-body Berry connection.</description>

Abstract: Fluctuations are intrinsic to microscopic systems and impose fundamental limits on nonequilibrium precision, as captured by the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR), which links current fluctuations to entropy production. While feedback control is expected to further suppress fluctuations, its role within the TUR framework has remained unclear, particularly in quantum systems where control is inherently information-driven. In this Letter, we consider open quantum systems weakly coupled to a thermal environment, in which quantum jumps are continuously monitored, and Markovian feedback is applied. Using quantum mutual information to quantify the information contribution induced by feedback, we derive a finite-time TUR for arbitrary time-integrated currents in terms of entropy production and mutual information. Our results uncover how feedback control suppresses fluctuations together with thermodynamic cost and establishes a fundamental precision bound imposed by information-based control. As an application, we analyze a quantum clock model and demonstrate that the clock precision can be enhanced by feedback control in the presence of a single thermal reservoir.</description>

      <title>Interaction and disorder effects on Cooper instability in two-dimensional fractional Dirac semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing a renormalization group analysis that allows for an unbiased treatment of competing physical ingredients, we systematically trace how the interplay between Cooper pairing and disorder scatterings governs the emergence or suppression of Cooper instability in the low-energy regime of fractional Dirac semimetals.In the clean limit, we find that the emergence of Cooper instability requires surpassing a finite interaction threshold $|\lambda_c|$, and depends sensitively on both the fractional exponent $\alpha$ and the transfer momentum $\mathbf{Q}=(Q,\phi)$. Specifically, bigger values of $\alpha$ enhance the tendency toward BCS instability. For $\alpha\in(0.001,0.61)$, the $(Q,\phi)$ parameter space separates into two distinct regions: Zone-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1}, where Cooper instability is suppressed, and Zone-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}, where it is allowed. In the presence of disorders, we demonstrate that they can either promote or suppress Cooper instability. Disorder of type $\Delta_1$ or $\Delta_2$ enhances superconductivity by reducing the critical interaction threshold $|\lambda_c|$ and expanding the superconducting phase space (Zone-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}). In sharp contrast, either $\Delta_0$ or $\Delta_3$ suppresses Cooper pairing by increasing $|\lambda_c|$ and shrinking the available phase space (Zone-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1}). Although Cooper instability can be enhanced when promotive disorders ($\Delta_1$, $\Delta_2$) coexist with a single suppressive disorder ($\Delta_0$ or $\Delta_3$), the suppressive influence of $\Delta_{0,3}$ generally dominates the promotive effects of $\Delta_{1,2}$ in the presence of all sorts of disorders. These results would be helpful for further studies of fractional Dirac semimetals and alike materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetoresistance Oscillations in Few-Layer NbSe2 in Superconducting Fluctuation Regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum interference phenomena in superconductors, such as Josephson interference and Little-Parks oscillations, serve as powerful probes of phase coherence, symmetry breaking and vortex dynamics. However, they are typically observed in well-defined mesoscopic structures, and their behavior in the two-dimensional limit remains largely unexplored. Here, we report periodic magnetoresistance oscillations, superconducting interference patterns, and interfering diode effect in unpatterned few-layer NbSe2. These phenomena emerge exclusively within the superconducting fluctuation regime of thin samples, consistent with the enhanced anomalous metallic behavior of atomically thin NbSe2. The non-monotonic temperature dependence of both the oscillation amplitude and the diode efficiency can be captured by a model in which thermally activated vortices traverse intrinsic supercurrent loops. Our results reveal that the observed interference phenomena originate from the lost of global phase coherence, providing a new route to accessing interference effects in unpatterned superconductors.</description>

      <title>Surface-localized topological superconductivity in nodal-loop materials: BdG analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study surface superconductivity in a nodal-line semimetal by combining a minimal tight-binding model with a layer-resolved Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach. In the normal state, the model realizes a bulk nodal loop and an associated drumhead surface band in a slab geometry with open boundaries in the $z$ direction: the central layers reproduce the bulk-like density of states, whereas the surface layer exhibits a sharp zero-energy peak originating from the drumhead states. On top of this band structure we introduce chiral $p$-wave and $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconducting channels and determine the layer-dependent gap amplitudes self-consistently. The chiral $p$-wave order parameter is strongly enhanced at the outermost layers and decays within only a few layers towards the interior, while the $d$-wave order parameter is more than an order of magnitude smaller on all layers. The quasiparticle dispersion and surface local density of states in the chiral $p$-wave state show that the drumhead band is efficiently gapped out and that the zero-energy peak in the normal surface spectrum is split into two coherence peaks, directly reflecting the induced superconducting gap. These results demonstrate that superconductivity driven by drumhead surface states is naturally biased toward a surface-localized chiral $p$-wave pairing symmetry and may offer qualitative guidance for interpreting surface-sensitive experiments on Pd-doped CaAgP.</description>

      <title>Influence of Hydrogen on Dislocation Relaxation in BCC Iron: Atomistic Mechanisms and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, the influence of pure dislocation and hydrogen-dislocation interactions on anelastic response or internal friction relaxation peaks in bcc-iron was investigated. These relaxations are primarily governed by thermally activated kink nucleation and kink migration events. An atomistic multiscale framework, coupling molecular dynamics (MD) and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, was developed to investigate the underlying atomistic mechanisms behind dislocation-relaxation peaks. MD simulations revealed that the presence of hydrogen atoms near the dislocation core facilitates the kink nucleation process by reducing the nucleation barrier while enhancing the barrier for dislocation migration. The KMC model captured Snoek-Koster peaks arising from the Cottrell atmosphere formed by hydrogen atoms and clusters around the dislocation core, providing insights into the atomistic mechanisms controlling these relaxations. Furthermore, the proposed computational scheme elucidated a unique linear relationship between hydrogen content and the internal friction loss factor, offering a methodology for hydrogen detection and quantification.</description>

Abstract: 2D materials exhibiting in-plane anisotropy enable novel functionality in electronic, optoelectronic, and photonic devices, yet their availability is generally limited to naturally-occurring low-symmetry van der Waals compounds. Here, we demonstrate an approach to structural engineering in a family of blue-emitting 2D silver phenylchalcogenide semiconductors based on steric interactions among surface-bound organic molecular ligands. By strategically halogenating specific sites of phenyl ligands, we demonstrate dramatic changes to the inorganic AgSe plane in mithrene (silver phenylselenolate, AgSePh). Density functional theory revealed pronounced in-plane electronic anisotropy for direct-gap fluorinated derivatives, while a chlorinated variant exhibited a direct-to-indirect bandgap transition. Furthermore, some fluorinated variants displayed strongly polarized absorption and luminescence, accompanied by a 10x enhancement in photoluminescence quantum yield. This work establishes a versatile approach for tailoring optoelectronic properties in hybrid semiconductors that is difficult or impossible to achieve in all-inorganic materials alone, offering new opportunities in advanced material design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grain boundaries (GBs) strongly influence thermal transport in crystalline solids by disrupting lattice periodicity and scattering phonons. Due to the atomic-level disorder and structural complexity, a fundamental understanding of how specific GB geometries regulate nanoscale phonon behavior and macroscopic thermal conductivity has remained elusive. Here, using emerging atomic-resolution vibrational spectroscopy, we directly correlate GB structure, defect-specific vibrational states, and thermal transport in bicrystal strontium titanate with controlled tilt and twist angles. The phonon characterizations and thermal conductivity data reveal two distinct regimes, where low-angle tilt GBs (2deg, 6deg, 10deg) substantially modulate phonon populations and mode frequencies, resulting in pronounced changes in thermal conductivity, whereas high-angle tilt GBs (22deg, 36deg) exhibit weak conductivity variation due to saturated structural disorder and scattering. In contrast, twist GBs introduce periodic defect motifs that only locally tailor phonon transport. Our results suggest tilt and twist angles as complementary knobs for coarse and fine control of phonon propagation and cross-GB thermal transport, providing a predictive framework for thermal engineering in materials.</description>

      <title>Light-enhanced dipolar interactions between exciton polaritons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the scenario of excitons in a semiconductor bilayer that are strongly coupled to cavity photons, leading to the formation of dipolar exciton polaritons (dipolaritons). Using a realistic pseudopotential for the dipolar interactions, we exactly determine the scattering between dipolaritons, accounting for the hybridization between interlayer and intralayer excitons. Similar to conventional non-dipolar polaritons, we find that the light-matter coupling enhances the interactions between dipolaritons by forcing excitons to scatter at energies that would otherwise be forbidden in ordinary exciton-exciton collisions. However, we show that this light enhancement is larger for long-range dipolar interactions than for short-range intralayer interactions, and is sensitive to the (non-uniform) dielectric environment of the bilayer. Crucially, we find that the largest dipolariton interactions are achieved for transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers in vacuum. Our results thus reveal the optimal dipolariton setup for realizing strong photon correlations.</description>

      <title>Giant and robust Josephson diode effect in multiband topological nanowires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05772v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically predict the giant and robust Josephson diode effect in quasi-one-dimensional topological Majorana nanowires in the regime with multiple subbands, which is expected to be relevant for the real experiment. In the multiband regime, the Majorana bound states and conventional Andreev bound states can naturally coexist, and respectively contribute to the fractional and conventional parts in the Josephson effect, with the former/latter having 4$\pi$/2$\pi$-periodicity. We show that the interplay between the two types of bound modes can produce a robust and giant diode effect in the deep topological phase regime. Notably, we unveil a novel spin parity exchange mechanism, occurring only in the multiband regime, which leads to a robust high efficiency plateau of the giant diode effect. This effect is a nontrivial consequence of the balanced Fermi moment shifts of the multiple subbands in tuning the external magnetic field. Our finding highlights the subband engineering as a powerful tool to optimize the Josephson diode effect realistically and provides a new feasible signature to identify topological phase regime in superconducting nanowires.</description>

Abstract: Thermodynamics coupled with quantum features on electron and hole dynamics in Dirac materials is quite interesting and crucial for real device applications. The correlation between the formation of electron-hole puddles in nearer to the charge neutrality point (CNP), and the role of disorder is fundamentally important for Dirac transport in graphene systems. Numerous studies on graphene further urge the necessity to find a better descriptor for disorder-charge puddles relation, which directly influences electrical conductivity. In principle, the external bias-driven energy level shift and its relevant density of states (DOS) provide information about the effect of total interactive potential on linear energy dispersion in terms of wavevector, but yet to be well-explored. With this ground, here we map the energy quantization for Dirac materials through the empirical relation of voltage-driven charge density in monolayer graphene, using the differential entropy (h)-ruled wavevector (k) mechanics. For this work, we propose the four postulates which are the key observable descriptions of earlier research reports, to study the precise electronic transport via an entropy-guided wavevector propagation approach, along with the Klein paradox, which pertains to the ultrafast dynamics in the Dirac or quasi-Dirac systems. The introduced h-ruled k and h-ruled N relations generalize the electron dynamics in both the unbounded and potentially bounded Dirac systems. Through the quantization mapping procedure under different voltage-driven potential (U=eV) boundary conditions, the observed energy shift from lower to excited quantum state obeys the relation of N(k)=N(U)^3; here, N(U) is the voltage-driven potential energy contribution factor for the quantum state existence. This study reveals information about the interaction potential-DOS relationship in the Dirac materials.</description>

Abstract: High-fidelity quantum gates are crucial for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing; however, decoherence significantly reduces gate fidelities during long operation times. Although optimal control techniques can theoretically minimize these operation times, they often neglect realistic uncertainties in system parameters. In this work, we demonstrate that by using robust optimal control strategies, the cross-resonance gate in superconducting systems can be operated within 64 ns, achieving fidelities of F &gt; 0.99 while maintaining robustness against up to 10% uncertainty in a single parameter. Alternatively, by extending the control time to 71 ns, we achieve fidelities of F &gt; 0.999 with robustness against up to 3% uncertainty. Our results identify the minimal control times attainable with experimentally feasible pulses and system parameters, as well as the maximum allowable static parameter error for high-fidelity operations. Furthermore, we demonstrate simultaneous robustness against both static and time-dependent errors by generating 100 ns control pulses (F &gt; 0.99) that maintain robustness against 10% static parameter error and time-dependent parameter fluctuations two orders of magnitude stronger than typical experimental noise. These findings demonstrate a viable open-loop strategy for implementing fast, high-fidelity quantum gates in the presence of realistic system uncertainties that would otherwise degrade conventional control pulses.</description>

Abstract: The chiral anomaly is one of the robust quantum effects in relativistic field theories with a chiral symmetry where charges in chiral sectors appear to be separately conserved. The chiral anomaly, which is often associated with a renormalization-invariant topological term, is a violation of this conservation law due to quantum effects. Such anomalies manifest in Weyl materials as an electromagnetic field-induced transfer of charge between Fermi pockets. However, the emergent nature of the conservation of chiral charge leads to manifestations of the chiral anomaly response that depend on the details of the system such as the strength of interactions. In this paper, we apply an approach where the chiral symmetry in solid materials is replaced by the combination of charge $U(1)$ gauge and spatial translation symmetry. The chiral anomaly in this case is replaced by a mixed anomaly between the two symmetries and the chiral charge can be defined as being proportional to the total momentum. We show that the chiral anomaly associated with this chiral charge is unrenormalized by interactions in contrast to other chiral charges in $(1+1)D$ whose renormalization is regularization dependent. In $(3+1)$D Weyl systems, this chiral anomaly is equivalent to the charge transferred between Fermi surfaces which can be measured through changes in Fermi-surface-enclosed volume. We propose a pump-probe technique to measure this.</description>

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) with deterministic single photon sources has been demonstrated over intercity fiber and free-space channels. The previous implementations relied mainly on polarization encoding schemes, which are susceptible to birefringence, polarization-mode dispersion and polarization-dependent loss in practical fiber networks. In contrast, time-bin encoding offers inherent robustness and has been widely adopted in mature QKD systems using weak coherent laser pulses. However, its feasibility in conjunction with a deterministic single-photon source has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. In this work, we construct a time-bin encoded QKD system employing a high-brightness quantum dot (QD) single-photon source operating at telecom wavelength. Our proof-of-concept experiment successfully demonstrates the possibility of secure key distribution over fiber link of 120 km, while maintaining extraordinary long-term stability over 6 hours of continuous operation. This work provides the first experimental validation of integrating a quantum dot single-photon source with time-bin encoding in a telecom-band QKD system. In addition, it demonstrates the highest secure key rate among the time-bin QKDs based on single-photon sources. This development signifies a substantial advancement in the establishment of a robust and scalable QKD network based on solid-state single-photon technology</description>

Abstract: Floquet engineering provides a powerful and flexible method for modifying the band structures of quantum materials. While circularly polarized light has been shown to convert curved nodal lines in three-dimensional semimetals into Weyl points, such a transformation is forbidden for an isolated straight nodal line. In this work, we uncover a dramatic shift in this paradigm when multiple straight nodal lines intersect. We observe that circularly polarized light not only gaps them into Weyl points but also induces unprecedented surface-state Fermi arcs that extend across the entire surface Brillouin zone and form a linked topological structure. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of light-driven transitions in topological semimetals and unveil a unique Weyl semimetal phase defined by linked Fermi arcs. We discuss potential exotic phenomena arising from this phase, applications of our predictions to spin-splitting antiferromagnets, and the extension of this Weyl semimetal phase to classical systems.</description>

      <title>Breaking conservation law enables steady-state entanglement out of equilibrium</title>

Abstract: We show how entangled steady states can be prepared by purely dissipative dynamics in a system coupled to a thermal environment. While entanglement is hindered by thermalization when the system and environment exchange a conserved quantity, we demonstrate that breaking this conservation law through the system-environment interaction drives the system to a nonequilibrium steady state. Such an interaction will generate multiple competing equilibration channels, effectively mimicking baths at distinct chemical potentials. When the environment also supports long-range correlations, these channels mediate nonlocal dissipation capable of generating entanglement. We illustrate the scheme in a model of two nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers weakly coupled to a spin-pumped magnet, where tuneable magnon excitations enable steady-state entanglement over finite distances. Our results identifies a general mechanism for dissipative entanglement generation, rooted in the conservation structure and environmental correlations rather than fine-tuned coherent control or active driving.</description>

      <title>Light-induced odd-parity altermagnets on dimerized lattices</title>

Abstract: Altermagnets are an emerging class of collinear magnets with momentum-dependent spin splitting and zero net magnetization. These materials can be broadly classified into two categories based on the behavior of spin splitting at time-reversal-related momenta: even-parity and odd-parity altermagnets. While even-parity altermagnets have been thoroughly investigated both theoretically and experimentally, the systems capable of hosting odd-parity altermagnetism remain largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that circularly polarized light dynamically converts collinear PT-symmetric antiferromagnets on dimerized lattices into odd parity p-wave altermagnets. Because of the underlying Dirac band structure of the dimerized lattice, we find that the resulting p-wave altermagnets can realize Chern insulators (2D) and Weyl semimetals (3D) under appropriate drive conditions. Our findings demonstrate that collinear antiferromagnets on dimerized lattices provide ideal platforms to investigate the dynamical generation of odd-parity altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Free and Interacting Fermionic Conformal Field Theories on the Fuzzy Sphere</title>

Abstract: The fuzzy-sphere regularisation is a powerful tool to study conformal field theories (CFT) in three spacetime dimensions. In this paper, we extend its scope to CFTs with local fermionic operators. We realise the free-Majorana-fermion CFT on a set-up with one flavour of bosons and one flavour of fermions on the lowest Landau level with a $1/2$ angular momentum mismatch and allow conversion between two bosons and two fermions, and use a relative chemical potential as the tuning parameter. On the phase diagram, we observe two continuous transitions described respectively by a free Majorana fermion and a gauged Ising CFT. We numerically confirm the emergent conformal symmetry through the operator spectrum and the two-point correlation function of the local Majorana fermion. We further establish a correspondence between the fuzzy-sphere models and the field-theory Lagrangians, and extend it to an interacting fermionic CFT -- the super-Ising theory with emergent super-conformal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Stress-Induced Ferroelectricity in Hafnium Oxide Core-Shell Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09262</link>

Abstract: In contrast to hafnia (HfO2) thin films, where the appearance of switchable ferroelectric polarization can be induced by strain or defect engineering, reliable methods for controlling ferroelectricity are absent in HfO2 nanoparticles. Direct experimental observations of ferroelectric hysteresis and ferroelectric domains in these nanoparticles are also absent. To the best of our knowledge, stress-induced ferroelectric states in the HfO2 nanoparticles have not been explored. In this work, we study the influence of chemical stress on phase diagrams, dielectric and polar properties of spherical HfO2 core-shell nanoparticles using a Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire free energy functional that includes trilinear and biquadratic couplings involving polar, antipolar, and nonpolar order parameters. The ferroelectric phase exhibits reentrant behavior as a function of nanoparticle size, such that the spontaneous polarization exists only within a limited range of core radii R_c, namely R_cr^min&lt;R_c&lt;R_cr^max. The minimal critical radius R_cr^min is primarily determined by the size dependence of the depolarization field and correlation effects; the maximal critical radius R_cr^max is primarily determined by the size dependence of chemical stresses induced by the elastic defects in the shell. Thus, this work identifies a stress-driven mechanism for reentrant ferroelectricity stabilization in nanoscale HfO2 systems, arising from the competition between depolarization field-induced suppression of ferroelectricity and its stabilization by shell-induced chemical stress. We revealed that relatively large compressive chemical strains are necessary to induce the ferroelectric phase in the HfO2 nanoparticles. Successful chemical strain engineering opens the way for significant enhancement of nanoscale HfO2 polar properties for applications in advanced memory cells and logic devices.</description>
