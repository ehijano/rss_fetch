      <title>Isolated one-phonon mixed-symmetry 2+ state of the radioactive neutron-rich nuclide 132Te</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $M1$ transition strengths between excited $2^+$ states of the neutron-rich, radioactive nuclide $^{132}$Te have been studied through direct lifetime measurements using the Doppler-shift attenuation method in a two-neutron transfer reaction on a $^{130}$Te target. An unambiguous identification of the lowest-lying mixed-symmetry $2^+$ state has been achieved on the basis of the large $B(M1;2^+_2\rightarrow2^+_1$)=0.18(2) $\mu_\mathrm{N}^2$ transition strength, in agreement with shell-model calculations. Results are compared to the shell model, and the analysis of both, data and calculations, unambiguously identifies the second-excited $2^+$ state of $^{132}$Te as the one-quadrupole phonon mixed-symmetry state of this isotope. A lowering of the energy and $B(M1;2^+_\mathrm{ms}\rightarrow 2^+_1)$ strength within the $N$=80 isotones toward the $Z$=50 shell closure is observed, which goes alongside with the lowering of the $E2$ collectivity approaching the magic proton shell.</description>

      <title>Studying the Strangeness $D$-Term in Hall C via Exclusive $\phi$ Electroproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a measurement of exclusive electroproduction of $\phi$ mesons near threshold in Hall C. The $|t|$-dependence of the exclusive $\phi$ cross section, $d\sigma/d|t|$, has recently been proposed as an observable sensitive to the strangeness $D$-term. The contribution of strangeness to the total quark $D$-term is presently unknown, with different arguments favoring $D_s$ being large, small, or even having opposite sign from the total quark $D$-term. In addition, this dataset will allow us to perform measurements of other exclusive meson final states, including the first measurement of $\eta'$ electroproduction.</description>

      <title>Forward dijet and vector meson production at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We first describe the predictions concerning jet production in the very forward region, especially in the FOCAL kinematic region of the ALICE collaboration at CERN as a test of saturation. We also compare vector meson production cross sections at the LHC in Pb Pb and p Pb collisions with the Balitsky Fadin Kuraev Lipatov and the Balitsky Kovchegov evolution equations and data favor the observation of saturation at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Interplay of shell evolution and configuration mixing in the single-hole-like states of $^{99-131}$In</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale shell-model calculations are performed for the $9/2^+_{\rm g.s.}$, $1/2^-_1$, $3/2^-_1$, and $5/2^-_1$ states in the odd-$A$ indium isotopes with $N=50-82$. The calculated energy levels, electromagnetic moments, and spectroscopic factors exhibit remarkable agreement with the experimental data due to significant configuration mixing for the neutron numbers away from the closed shells. While the $1/2^-_1$ energy levels well follow those of the effective single-particle energies that are formulated for fractional occupancies of the neutron orbitals, the configuration mixing with the proton $p_{3/2}$ and $f_{5/2}$ orbitals plays a crucial role in locating the $1/2^-_1$ levels at the right position in the actual shell-model calculations.</description>

      <title>Systematics of the low-energy electric dipole strength in the Sn isotopic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the mass dependence of the low-energy electric dipole strength (LEDS) in Sn isotopes in the range $ A = 111 - 124$ based on data obtained with the Oslo method and with relativistic Coulomb excitation in forward-angle ($p,p^\prime$) scattering. The combined data cover an energy range of $2 - 20$ MeV which permits, with minimal assumptions, a decomposition of the total strength into the contribution from the low-energy tail of the isovector giant dipole resonance (IVGDR) and possible resonance-like structures on top of it. In all cases, a resonance peaked at about 8.3 MeV is observed, exhausting an approximately constant fraction of the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn (TRK) sum rule with a local maximum at $^{120}$Sn which might be related to shell structure effects. For heavier isotopes ($A \geq 118$) a consistent description of the data requires the inclusion of a second resonance centered at 6.5 MeV, representing the isovector response of the pygmy dipole resonance (PDR). Its strength corresponds to a small fraction of the total LEDS only and shows an approximately linear dependence on mass number. The experimental results are also compared to ab initio-based microscopic calculations to investigate the importance of an inclusion of quasiparticle vibration coupling (qPVC) for a realistic description of the LEDS. A possible interpretation of the experimentally observed two-bump structure is given.</description>

      <title>The Intrinsic Energy Resolution of LaBr$_3$(Ce) Crystal for GECAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study aims to provide an accurate estimation of the intrinsic resolution of LaBr$_3$(Ce) crystal through a combination of experimental and simulation methods. We re-analyzed the data from previous Wide-Angle Compton Coincidence (WACC) and Hard X-ray Calibration Facility (HXCF) experiments, conducted PMT Single-Photoelectron Calibration (SPEC) and radial non-uniformity (also called Spot Scanning, SS) experiments to acquire new data, and combined these results with Geant4 simulations to isolate the contribution of each physical process to the total energy resolution, thereby allowing for a precise estimation of the scintillator's intrinsic resolution. For 100 keV X-rays, the total energy resolution of LaBr$_3$(Ce) crystal is 3.99% $\pm$ 0.04% (expressed as 1-$\sigma$), with statistical fluctuations and intrinsic resolution as the main components, contributing 2.47% $\pm$ 0.00% and 3.06% $\pm$ 0.06%, respectively. We identify two main sources of intrinsic resolution: one primarily due to non-proportional scintillation, contributing 2.28% $\pm$ 0.00%, and the other due to fluctuations in the energy transfer process, contributing 2.04% $\pm$ 0.08%. We quantified six components of the total energy resolution and reconstructed the photon response using Geant4. The consistency between the reconstructed relative light yield and the experimental measurements validated the mass model of the LaBr$_3$(Ce) detector used in the simulations.</description>
