      <title>Classical and Quantum Beam Dynamics Simulation of the RF Photoinjector Test Bench at JINR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present simulation of the classical and quantum beam dynamics of an RF photoinjector test bench under development at Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. A 0.63 pC electron bunch is driven from a copper photocathode by a 262 nm ultraviolet laser and accelerated to energies of a few MeV in a 2856 MHz, 1.5-cell RF gun. Using realistic electromagnetic field maps and the ASTRA particle-tracking code, we optimize a Carlsten-style emittance-compensation solenoid to achieve a normalized transverse emittance of 3.2 pi mm mrad downstream of the gun. We also simulate the dynamic of a single-electron Laguerre-Gaussian wave packet carrying l = hbar orbital angular momentum projection in the same RF fields: continuous acceleration reduces its de Broglie wavelength and suppresses transverse spreading by a factor of six compared to free-space propagation over 30 cm. These results confirm the injector design, demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed emittance-compensation scheme, and pave the way to the first experimental demonstration of relativistic vortex electron generation in the few MeV energy range.</description>

      <title>An Innovative Photon-Driven Subcritical Reactor Concept Powered by Synchrotron Radiation Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the conceptual design of a Photon Driven Reactor (PDR), an innovative subcritical reactor designed for energy generation driven by a synchrotron radiation. The PDR concept overcomes key technological challenges of conventional accelerator-driven systems, particularly the target's structural durability and its thermal management, by employing synchrotron photons directly interacting with fissile material to induce photonuclear reactions. Computational analyses involved criticality and fixed-source simulation using MCNPx and SERPENT Monte Carlo codes, providing robust evaluation of the neutron production, moderation, and multiplication mechanisms. The main focus of this study was to evaluate the system's capability to achieve a positive net energy gain, specifically assessing the thermal power output agains the electrical power absorbed from the grid. Furthermore, the adoption of spent nuclear fuel for the subcritical reactor core loading has been investigated, highlighting the sustainability and environmental benefits of the proposed PDR design. The proposed system is able to exploit a modularity feature. For each large synchrotron, up to fifty beam lines may be operated simultaneously, each delivering photons to an independent subcritical reactor core. With a photon flux on the order of $8.8 \times 10^{17}$ photons per second in each beamline, the results indicate that each individual reactor can achieve a thermal output up to 8 MW, while requiring about 435-660 kW of electrical input from the grid, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of energy amplification in the PDR.</description>

      <title>Generic Rolling Access to Synchrotron Radiation Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generic model for rolling access to synchrotron radiation experiments is presented, which has the capacity to replace call-based access models. Proposal submission, evaluation and scheduling are all executed in a rolling fashion. This significantly reduces the waiting times between proposal submission and experiment execution than that of the call-based access model. The generic rolling access model is in principle applicable to any beamlines, regardless of the number of experimental methods or setups it provides to users. This access model is flexible and could provide faster access compared to call-based access model as well as accommodate experiments and projects requiring extended preparation times.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a tandem lens for producing shaped laser-ionized plasmas for plasma wakefield acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a tandem lens optical setup, comprising two diffractive optics, that focuses a high-power ultrafast laser with a shaped on-axis intensity profile, producing a meter-long Bessel focus. The intended use of the optical setup is to produce a laser-ionized plasma source for plasma wakefield acceleration. By controlling the on-axis intensity, the density profile of the plasma ramps at the entrance and exit of the plasma can be tailored to optimize matching of the electron beam into the plasma. In addition to demonstrating the optical system, we describe the algorithm used to calculate the lens phases and present detailed calculations of the lenses' expected performance.</description>

      <title>Application Of Large Language Models For The Extraction Of Information From Particle Accelerator Technical Documentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large set of technical documentation of legacy accelerator systems, coupled with the retirement of experienced personnel, underscores the urgent need for efficient methods to preserve and transfer specialized knowledge. This paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs), to automate and enhance the extraction of information from particle accelerator technical documents. By exploiting LLMs, we aim to address the challenges of knowledge retention, enabling the retrieval of domain expertise embedded in legacy documentation. We present initial results of adapting LLMs to this specialized domain. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in extracting, summarizing, and organizing knowledge, significantly reducing the risk of losing valuable insights as personnel retire. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of current LLMs, such as interpretability and handling of rare domain-specific terms, and propose strategies for improvement. This work highlights the potential of LLMs to play a pivotal role in preserving institutional knowledge and ensuring continuity in highly specialized fields.</description>

      <title>IsoDAR@Yemilab: Preliminary Design Report -- Volume I: Cyclotron Driver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06281v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This Preliminary Design Report (PDR) describes the IsoDAR electron-antineutrino source in two volumes which are mostly site-independent and describe the cyclotron driver providing a 60 MeV, 10 mA proton beam (this Volume); and the medium energy beam transport line (MEBT) and target (Volume II). The IsoDAR driver and target will produce about 1.15e23 electron-antineutrinos over five years. Paired with a kton-scale liquid scintillator detector, it will enable a broad particle physics program including searches for new symmetries, new interactions and new particles. Here in Volume I, we describe the driver, which includes the ion source, low energy beam transport, and cyclotron. The latter features Radio-Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) direct axial injection and represents the first accelerator purpose-built to make use of so-called vortex motion.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing of electron beams using solid-state spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scattering experiments with energetic particles, such as free electrons, have been historically used to reveal the quantum structure of matter. However, realizing coherent interactions between free-electron beams and solid-state quantum systems has remained out of reach, owing to their intrinsically weak coupling. Realizing such coherent control would open up opportunities for hybrid quantum platforms combining free electrons and solid-state qubits for coincident quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing. Here, we present a framework that employs negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV-) in diamond as quantum sensors of a bunched electron beam. We develop a Lindblad master equation description of the magnetic free-electron--qubit interactions and identify spin relaxometry as a sensitive probe of the interaction. Experimentally, we integrate a confocal fluorescence microscopy setup into a microwave-bunched electron beam line. We monitor charge-state dynamics and assess their impact on key sensing performance metrics (such as spin readout contrast), defining safe operating parameters for quantum sensing experiments. By performing $T_1$ relaxometry under controlled electron beam exposure, we establish an upper bound on the free-electron--spin coupling strength. Our results establish NV- centers as quantitative probes of free electrons, providing a metrological benchmark for free-electron--qubit coupling under realistic conditions, and chart a route toward solid-state quantum control with electron beams.</description>
