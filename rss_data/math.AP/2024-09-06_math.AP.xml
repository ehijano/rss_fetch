      <title>Non-harmonic analysis of the wave equation for Schr\"{o}dinger operators with complex potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the wave equation for the Schr\"{o}dinger operator on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, denoted as $\mathcal{H}_0:=-\Delta+V$, where $\Delta$ is the standard Laplacian and $V$ is a complex-valued multiplication operator. We prove that the operator $\mathcal{H}_0$, with $\operatorname{Re}(V)\geq 0$ and $\operatorname{Re}(V)(x)\to\infty$ as $|x|\to\infty$, has a purely discrete spectrum under certain conditions. In the spirit of Colombini, De Giorgi, and Spagnolo, we also prove that the Cauchy problem with regular coefficients is well-posed in the associated Sobolev spaces, and when the propagation speed is H\"{o}lder continuous (or more regular), it is well-posed in Gevrey spaces. Furthermore, we prove that it is very weakly well-posed when the coefficients possess a distributional singularity.</description>

      <title>Rectifiability of the singular set and uniqueness of tangent cones for semicalibrated currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the singular set of an $m$-dimensional integral current $T$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n + m}$, semicalibrated by a $C^{2, \kappa_0}$ $m$-form $\omega$ is countably $(m - 2)$-rectifiable. Furthermore, we show that there is a unique tangent cone at $\mathcal{H}^{m - 2}$-a.e. point in the interior singular set of $T$. Our proof adapts techniques that were recently developed in [DLS23a, DLS23b, DLMS23] for area-minimizing currents to this setting.</description>

      <title>Optimal Regularity for Fully Nonlinear Nonlocal Equations with Unbounded Source Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove optimal regularity estimates for viscosity solutions to a class of fully nonlinear nonlocal equations with unbounded source terms. More precisely, depending on the integrability of the source term $f \in L^p(B_1)$, we establish that solutions belong to classes ranging from $C^{\sigma-d/p}$ to $C^\sigma$, at critical thresholds. We use approximation techniques and Liouville-type arguments. These results represent a novel contribution, providing the first such estimates in the context of not necessarily concave nonlocal equations.</description>

      <title>Critical lengths for the linear Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical length phenomenon of the Korteweg-de Vries equation is well known, however in higher dimensions, it is unknown. This work explores this property in the context of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation, a two-dimensional generalization of the Korteweg-de Vries equation. Specifically, we demonstrate observability inequalities for this equation, which allow us to deduce the exact boundary controllability and boundary exponential stabilization of the linearized system, provided the spatial domain length avoids certain specific values, which is a direct consequence of the Paley-Wiener theorem. To the best of our knowledge, our work introduces new results by identifying a set of critical lengths for the two-dimensional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation.</description>

      <title>Finite time blowup of strong solutions to the two dimensional MHD equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether the smooth solution of the multi-dimensional viscous compressible fluids will blow-up in finite time has always been a chanllenging problem. In the recent work\cite{FM}, Merle et al. proved that there are smooth solutions to the 2D radially symmetric compressible Navier-Stokes equations which will inevitably form shell singularities in finite time.\\ \indent In this article, we first prove the existence of local strong solutions that allow vacuum for the two-dimensional viscous compressible MHD equations on bounded domains without magnetic diffusion. Furthermore, it is shown that if the initial data are radial symmetric and its vacuum set contains a ball centered at the origin where the total magnetic field is non-trivial, then the radial symmetric strong solution to the initial boundary value problem will definitely blow up in finite time. This is the first example for the formation of finite time singularity of strong solutions that allows interior vacuum of a viscous compressible fluid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given region, and specified boundary flux and density rate of an extensive property, the optimal flux field that satisfies the balance conditions is considered. The optimization criteria are the $L^{p}$-norm and a Sobolev-like norm of the flux field. Finally, the capacity of the region to accommodate various boundary fluxes and density rates is defined and analyzed.</description>

      <title>Anomalous dissipation via spontaneous stochasticity with a two-dimensional autonomous velocity field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study anomalous dissipation in the context of passive scalars and we construct a two-dimensional autonomous divergence-free velocity field in $C^\alpha$ (with $\alpha \in (0,1)$ arbitrary but fixed) which exhibits anomalous dissipation. Our proof employs the fluctuation-dissipation formula, which links spontaneous stochasticity with anomalous dissipation. Therefore, we address the issue of anomalous dissipation by showing that the variance of stochastic trajectories, in the zero noise limit, remains positive. Based on this result, we answer Question 2.2 and Question 2.3 in [Bru\`{e} &amp; De Lellis '22] regarding anomalous dissipation for the forced three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>On a doubly sublinear fractional $p$-Laplacian equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a bifurcation result for a Dirichlet problem driven by the fractional $p$-Laplacian (either degenerate or singular), in which the reaction is the difference between two sublinear powers of the unknown. In our argument, a fundamental role is played by a Sobolev vs.\ H\"older minima principle, already known for the degenerate case, which here we extend to the singular case with a simpler proof.</description>

      <title>Derivation of normal forms for dispersive PDEs via arborification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a systematic derivation of normal forms for dispersive equations using decorated trees introduced in arXiv:2005.01649. The key tool is the arborification map which is a morphism from the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra to the Shuffle Hopf algebra. It originates from Ecalle's approach to dynamical systems with singularities. This natural map has been used in many applications ranging from algebra, numerical analysis and rough paths. This connection shows that Hopf algebras also appear naturally in the context of dispersive equations and provide insights into some crucial decomposition.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e and Sobolev inequalities with variable exponents and log-Holder continuity only at the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Sobolev-Poincar\'e and Poincar\'e inequalities in variable Lebesgue spaces $L^{p(\cdot)}(\Omega)$, with $\Omega\subset{\mathbb R}^n$ a bounded John domain, with weaker regularity assumptions on the exponent $p(\cdot)$ that have been used previously. In particular, we require $p(\cdot)$ to satisfy a new \emph{boundary $\log$-H\"older condition} that imposes some logarithmic decay on the oscillation of $p(\cdot)$ towards the boundary of the domain. Some control over the interior oscillation of $p(\cdot)$ is also needed, but it is given by a very general condition that allows $p(\cdot)$ to be discontinuous at every point of $\Omega$. Our results follows from a local-to-global argument based on the continuity of certain Hardy type operators. We provide examples that show that our boundary $\log$-H\"older condition is essentially necessary for our main results. The same examples are adapted to show that this condition is not sufficient for other related inequalities. Finally, we give an application to a Neumann problem for a degenerate $p(\cdot)$-Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Numerical spectral analysis of Cauchy-type inverse problems: A probabilistic approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is devoted to inverse problems for elliptic partial differential equations in an Euclidean domain, in which the boundary and/or interior conditions are given merely on some accessible portion of the boundary and/or inside the domain, the goal being the efficient construction of an approximation for the unknown solution in the remaining part of the domain; such inverse problems are usually called data-completion problems or inverse Cauchy problems. They have been intensively studied in the past decades, but due to their severe instability it has remained an up-to-date challenge to derive both theoretical and numerical methods that can efficiently treat such inverse problems in general settings, especially in high dimensions or in which the solution or the domain exhibit singularities or complex geometries. In this paper we establish a fundamental probabilistic framework in which such inverse problems can be analyzed both theoretically and numerically in terms of the geometry of the domain and the structure of the coefficients. The methods we develop are different from what has been previously proposed in the literature, and are designed to accurately quantify the instability of the inverse problem, as well as to construct a natural subspace of approximate solutions given the available measurements, by simulating the spectrum of the direct problem and performing a singular value decomposition.The approach is based on elliptic measures in conjunction with probabilistic representations and parallel Monte Carlo simulations. The proposed methods are accompanied by a full probabilistic error analysis, showing the convergence of the approximations and providing explicit error bounds. The complexity of the methods is also taken into discussion.We provide thorough numerical simulations performed on graphical processing units, in dimensions two and three, and for various types of domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the regularity property of Hele-Shaw flow, where source and drift are present in the evolution. More specifically we consider H\"{o}lder continuous source and Lipschitz continuous drift. We show that if the free boundary of the solution is locally close to a Lipschitz graph, then it is indeed Lipschitz, given that the Lipschitz constant is small. When there is no drift, our result establishes $C^{1,\gamma}$ regularity of the free boundary by combining our result with the obstacle problem theory. In general, when the source and drift are both smooth, we prove that the solution is non-degenerate, indicating higher regularity of the free boudary.</description>

Abstract: The quantitative analysis of bubbling phenomena for almost constant mean curvature boundaries is an important question having significant applications in various fields including capillarity theory and the study of mean curvature flows. Such a quantitative analysis was initiated in [G. Ciraolo and F. Maggi, Comm. Pure Appl. Math. (2017)], where the first quantitative result of proximity to a set of disjoint balls of equal radii was obtained in terms of a uniform deviation of the mean curvature from being constant. Weakening the measure of the deviation in such a result is a delicate issue that is crucial in view of the applications for mean curvature flows. Some progress in this direction was recently made in [V. Julin and J. Niinikoski, Anal. PDE (2023)], where $L^{N-1}$-deviations are considered for domains in $\mathbb{R}^N$. In the present paper we significantly weaken the measure of the deviation, obtaining a quantitative result of proximity to a set of disjoint balls of equal radii for the following deviation $$ \int_{\partial \Omega } \left( H_0 - H \right)^+ dS_x, \quad \text{ where } \begin{cases} H \text{ is the mean curvature of } \partial \Omega , \\ H_0:=\frac{| \partial \Omega |}{N | \Omega |} , \\ \left( H_0 - H \right)^+:=\max\left\lbrace H_0 - H , 0 \right\rbrace , \end{cases} $$ which is clearly even weaker than $\Vert H_0-H \Vert_{L^1( \partial \Omega )}$.</description>

      <title>Charge transport systems with Fermi-Dirac statistics for memristors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An instationary drift-diffusion system for the electron, hole, and oxygen vacancy densities, coupled to the Poisson equation for the electric potential, is analyzed in a bounded domain with mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions. The electron and hole densities are governed by Fermi-Dirac statistics, while the oxygen vacancy density is governed by Blakemore statistics. The equations model the charge carrier dynamics in memristive devices used in semiconductor technology. The global existence of weak solutions is proved in up to three space dimensions. The proof is based on the free energy inequality, an iteration argument to improve the integrability of the densities, and estimations of the Fermi-Dirac integral. Under a physically realistic elliptic regularity condition, it is proved that the densities are bounded.</description>

      <title>The Selberg trace formula for spin Dirac operators on degenerating hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11793v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectrum of the spin Dirac operator on families of hyperbolic surfaces where a set of disjoint simple geodesics shrink to $0$, under the hypothesis that the spin structure is non-trivial along each pinched geodesic. The main tool is a trace formula for the Dirac operator on finite area hyperbolic surfaces. We derive a version of Huber's theorem and a non-standard small-time heat trace asymptotic expansion for hyperbolic surfaces with cusps. As a corollary we find a simultaneous Weyl law for the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator which is uniform in the degenerating parameter. The main result is the convergence of the Selberg zeta function associated to the Dirac operator on such families of hyperbolic surfaces. A central role is played by a $\{ \pm 1 \}$-valued class function $\varepsilon$ determined by the spin structure.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic limit of the multi-component slow boundary WASEP with collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the hydrodynamic limit for a stochastic interacting particle system whose dynamics consists in a superposition of several dynamics: the exclusion rule, that dictates that no more than a particle per site with a fixed velocity is allowed; a collision dynamics, that dictates that particles at the same site can collide and originate particles with new velocities such that the linear momentum is conserved; a boundary dynamics that injects and removes particle in the system. This last dynamics destroys the conservation law, and its strength is regulated by a parameter $\theta$. The goal is the derivation of the hydrodynamic limit, and the boundary conditions change drastically according to the value of $\theta$.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous compensation of input delay and state/input quantization for linear systems via switched predictor feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a switched predictor-feedback law, which achieves global asymptotic stabilization of linear systems with input delay and with the plant and actuator states available only in (almost) quantized form. The control design relies on a quantized version of the nominal predictor-feedback law for linear systems, in which quantized measurements of the plant and actuator states enter the predictor state formula. A switching strategy is constructed to dynamically adjust the tunable parameter of the quantizer (in a piecewise constant manner), in order to initially increase the range and subsequently decrease the error of the quantizers. The key element in the proof of global asymptotic stability in the supremum norm of the actuator state is derivation of solutions' estimates combining a backstepping transformation with small-gain and input-to-state stability arguments, for addressing the error due to quantization. We extend this result to the input quantization case and illustrate our theory with a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Construct accurate multi-continuum micromorphic homogenisations in multi-D space-time with computer algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homogenisation empowers the efficient macroscale system level prediction of physical problems with intricate microscale structures. Here we develop an innovative powerful, rigorous and flexible framework for asymptotic homogenisation of dynamics at the finite scale separation of real physics, with proven results underpinned by modern dynamical systems theory. The novel systematic approach removes most of the usual assumptions, whether implicit or explicit, of other methodologies. By no longer assuming averages the methodology constructs so-called multi-continuum or micromorphic homogenisations systematically based upon the microscale physics. The developed framework and approach enables a user to straightforwardly choose and create such homogenisations with clear physical and theoretical support, and of highly controllable accuracy and fidelity.</description>

      <title>Robust error estimates of PINN in one-dimensional boundary value problems for linear elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study physics-informed neural networks (PINN) to approximate solutions to one-dimensional boundary value problems for linear elliptic equations and establish robust error estimates of PINN regardless of the quantities of the coefficients. In particular, we rigorously demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of solutions using the Sobolev space theory based on a variational approach. Deriving $L^2$-contraction estimates, we show that the error, defined as the mean square of the differences between the true solution and our trial function at the sample points, is dominated by the training loss. Furthermore, we show that as the quantities of the coefficients for the differential equation increase, the error-to-loss ratio rapidly decreases. Our theoretical and experimental results confirm the robustness of the error regardless of the quantities of the coefficients.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for orthonormal functions and probabilistic convergence of density functions of compact operators on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish some Strichartz estimates for orthonormal functions and probabilistic convergence of density functions related to compact operators on manifolds. Firstly, we present the suitable bound of $\int_{a\leq|s|\leq b}e^{isx}s^{-1+i\gamma}ds$ for the cases $\gamma \in \mathbb{R},a\geq0,b&gt;0,$ $\gamma \in \mathbb{R},\gamma\neq0,a,b\in \mathbb{R}$ and $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}$, which extends the result of Page 204 of Vega (199-211,IMA Vol. Math. Appl., 42, 1992.) Secondly, we prove that $\left|\gamma\int_{a}^{b}e^{isx}s^{-1+i\gamma}ds\right|\leq C(1+|\gamma|)^{2}(\gamma \in \mathbb{R},a,b\in \mathbb{R}),$ where $C$ is independent of $\gamma,a, b$, which extends Lemma 1 of Bez et al. (Forum of Mathematics, Sigma, 9(2021), 1-52). Thirdly, we extend the result of Theorems 8, 9 of R. Frank, J. Sabin (Amer. J. Math. 139(2017), 1649-1691.) with the aid of the suitable bound of the above complex integrals established in this paper. Fourthly, we establish the Strichartz estimates for orthonormal functions related to Boussinesq operator on the real line for both small time interval and large time interval and on the torus with small time interval; we also establish the convergence result of some compact operators in Schatten norm. Fifthly, we establish the convergence result related to nonlinear part of the solution to some operator equations in Schatten spaces. Finally, inspired by the work of Hadama and Yamamoto (Probabilistic Strichartz estimates in Schatten classes and their applications to Hartree equation, arxiv:2311.02713v1.), for $\gamma_{0}\in \mathfrak{S}^{2}$, we establish the probabilistic convergence of density functions of compact operator on manifolds with full randomization, which improves the result of Corollary 1.2 of Bez et al. (Selecta Math. 26(2020), 24 pp) in the probabilistic sense.</description>

      <title>Bounds for Eigenvalue Sums of Schr\"odinger Operators with Complex Radial Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider eigenvalue sums of Schr\"odinger operators $-\Delta+V$ on $L^2(\R^d)$ with complex radial potentials $V\in L^q(\R^d)$, $q&lt;d$. We prove quantitative bounds on the distribution of the eigenvlaues in terms of the $L^q$ norm of $V$. A consequence of our bounds is that, if the eigenvlaues $(z_j)$ accumulates to a point in $(0,\infty)$, then $(\im z_j)$ is summable. The key technical tools are resolvent estimates in Schatten spaces. We show that these resolvent estimates follow from spectral measure estimates by an epsilon removal argument.</description>
