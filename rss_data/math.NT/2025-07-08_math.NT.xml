      <title>On the exceptional set in the $abc$ conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $abc$ conjecture states that there are only finitely many triples of coprime positive integers $(a,b,c)$ such that $a+b=c$ and $\operatorname{rad}(abc) &lt; c^{1-\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Using the optimized methods in a recent work of Browning, Lichtman and Ter\"av\"ainen, we showed that the number of those triples with $c \leqslant X$ is $O\left(X^{56/85+\varepsilon}\right)$ for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, where $\frac{56}{85} \approx 0.658824$. This constitutes an improvement of the previous bound $O\left(X^{33/50}\right)$.</description>

      <title>On sums involving powers of harmonic numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a Dirichlet series generated by powers of harmonic numbers. As an application of these functions, we derive certain series involving harmonic numbers. We also study the analytic properties of these Dirichlet series such as values negative integers and behavior at poles. In particular, objects similar to the Stieltjes constants are discussed. Asymptotics of the sums involving harmonic numbers are also studied. From these results I showed a connection between its analytic properties and a possible route to showing the irrationality of the Euler-Mascheroni constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study solutions to the Egyptian fractions equation with the prime factors of the denominators constrained to lie in a fixed set of primes. We evaluate the effectiveness of the greedy algorithm in establishing bounds on such solutions. Additionally, we present improved algorithms for generating low-rank solutions and solutions restricted to specific prime sets. Computational results obtained using these algorithms are provided, alongside a discussion on their performance.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Chabauty Experiments on Genus 2 Bielliptic Modular Curves in the LMFDB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of quadratic Chabauty experiments on genus 2 bielliptic modular curves of Jacobian rank 2 that have recently been added to the LMFDB. We apply quadratic Chabauty methods over both the rationals and quadratic imaginary fields. In a number of cases, the experiments yielded algebraic irrational points among the set of mock rational points. We highlight specific notable examples, including the non-split Cartan modular curve $X^+_{ns}(15)$. Lastly, we offer a conjecture relating the level of the modular curve to the potential number fields over which points can arise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the existence and uniqueness property on a finite sum involving a polynomial and a homogeneous linear recurrence sequence. This finite sum is of the form $\sum_{k=1}^n P(k)s_{hk+r}$ where $n$ is a positive integer, $P(x)$ is a polynomial in $\mathbb C[x]$, $h$ and $r$ are some integers, and $(s_k)_{k\in\mathbb Z}$ is a homogeneous linear recurrence sequence of degree $m\geq 2$ with some constraints.</description>

      <title>Antiquantum $q$-series and mock theta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ramanujan's original definition of mock theta functions from 1920 involves their asymptotic behaviors at roots of unity on the boundary of the disk of convergence $|q|&lt;1$. More recently this topic has been related by several authors, including the first author with Ono and Rhoades in 2013, to quantum modular forms, first defined in 2010 by Zagier. In 2021, Lovejoy defined and studied related quantum $q$-series identities, which do not hold as equalities between power series inside the disk $|q|&lt;1$ but which do hold on dense subsets of roots of unity on the boundary. Inspired by this, in our prior joint work from 2024 we further studied quantum $q$-series identities as related to mock theta functions and quantum modular forms; we also defined and studied antiquantum $q$-series identities, between series which are equal inside the disk $|q|&lt;1$ but which hold at dense sets of roots of unity on the boundary for which one of the series diverges and is unnaturally truncated. Here, building from our previous work, we establish antiquantum $q$-series identities for all of Ramanujan's third order mock theta functions. We deduce these results in part by establishing and applying more general identities which are also of independent interest, and by using the theory of modular eta-quotients.</description>

      <title>Hecke $L$-series for Sinha modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Goss $L$-functions associated to Anderson $t$-modules defined by Sinha having complex multiplication by Carlitz cyclotomic fields. We show that these $t$-modules are defined over the cyclotomic field and that their $L$-functions are products of Hecke $L$-series for Anderson's Hecke character defined via Coleman functions. Applying identities of Fang and Taelman, we prove that special values of these $L$-functions are expressible in terms of products of values of Thakur's geometric $\Gamma$-function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive explicit formulas for the Frobenius-Hecke traces of the etale cohomology of certain strata of Kottwitz varieties (which are certain compact unitary type Shimura varieties considered by Kottwitz), in terms of automorphic representations and certain explicit polynomials. We obtain our results using the trace formula, representations of general linear groups over p-adic fields, and a truncation of the formula of Kottwitz for the number of points on Shimura varieties over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Selberg's Central Limit Theorem weighted by Linear Statistics of Zeta Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the value distribution of the logarithm of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line, weighted by the local statistics of zeta zeros. We show that, with appropriate normalization, it satisfies a complex Central Limit Theorem, provided that the Fourier support of the test function in the linear statistics is sufficiently small. For the imaginary part, we extend this support condition up to its natural barrier under the Riemann Hypothesis. Finally, we prove that the correlation between $\log \zeta$ and the one-level density, while negligible on the level of Selberg's Central Limit Theorem, only decays at a rather slow rate if the Riemann Hypothesis is assumed. Our results can be viewed as a combination of Selberg's Central Limit Theorem with work of Hughes and Rudnick on mock-Gaussian behavior of the local statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the computational framework of polyseries and poly-numbers introduced by Wildberger and Rubine in [2]. After reviewing Peano arithmetic, computable naturals, and non-standard models, we define the core data and procedure operations on polyseries. We then apply Catalan number expansions to solve quadratic congruences and derive explicit truncated series formulas in a finite field $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Our main result gives a closed form poly series solution in terms of Catalan numbers.</description>

      <title>On Minimal Excludant over Overpartitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A partition of a positive integer $n$ is a non-increasing sequence of positive integers which sum to $n$. A recently studied aspect of partitions is the minimal excludant of a partition, which is defined to be the smallest positive integer that is not a part of the partition. In 2024, Aricheta and Donato studied the minimal excludant of the non-overlined parts of an overpartition, where an overpartition of $n$ is a partition of $n$ in which the first occurrence of a number may be overlined. In this research, we explore two other definitions of the minimal excludant of an overpartition: (i) considering only the overlined parts, and (ii) considering both the overlined and non-overlined parts. We discuss the combinatorial, asymptotic, and arithmetic properties of the corresponding $\sigma$-function, which gives the sum of the minimal excludants over all overpartitions.</description>

      <title>Twisted Diophantine approximation on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In twisted Diophantine approximation, for a fixed $m\times n$ matrix $\boldsymbol\alpha$ one is interested in sets of vectors $\boldsymbol\beta\in\mathbb R^m$ such that the system of affine forms $\mathbb R^n \ni \mathbf q \mapsto \boldsymbol\alpha\mathbf q + \boldsymbol\beta \in \mathbb R^m$ satisfies some given Diophantine condition. In this paper we introduce the notion of manifolds which are of $\boldsymbol\alpha$-twisted Khintchine type for convergence or divergence. We provide sufficient conditions under which nondegenerate analytic manifolds exhibit this twisted Khintchine-type behaviour. Furthermore, we investigate the intersection properties of the sets of $\boldsymbol\alpha$-twisted badly approximable and well approximable vectors with nondegenerate manifolds.</description>

      <title>Class groups of imaginary quadratic points on $X_1(16)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main result is to show that if $K \ncong \mathbb Q(\sqrt{-15})$ is an imaginary quadratic field and $E$ is an elliptic curve over $K$ with a torsion point of order 16, then the class number of $K$ is divisible by 10. This gives an affirmative answer to a 12 year old question by David Krumm. This is done by setting up a more general framework for studying divisibility of class groups of imaginary quadratic points on hyper-elliptic curves and applying it to $X_1(16)$.</description>

      <title>$q$-Congruences for Z.-W. Sun's generalized polynomials $w^{(\alpha)}_k(x)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2022, Z.-W. Sun defined \begin{equation*} w_k^{(\alpha)}{(x)}=\sum_{j=1}^{k}w(k,j)^{\alpha}x^{j-1}, \end{equation*} where $k,\alpha$ are positive integers and $w(k,j)=\frac{1}{j}\binom{k-1}{j-1}\binom{k+j}{j-1}$. Let $(x)_{0}=1$ and $(x)_{n}=x(x+1)\cdots(x+n-1)$ for all $n\geq 1$. In this paper, it is proved by $q$-congruences that for any positive integers ${\alpha,\beta, m,n,r}$, we have \begin{equation*} \frac{(2,n)}{n(n+1)(n+2)}\sum_{k=1}^{n}k^r(k+1)^r(2k+1)w_{k}^{(\alpha)}(x)^{m}\in\mathbb{Z}[x], \end{equation*} \begin{equation*} \frac{(2,n)}{n(n+1)(n+2)}\sum_{k=1}^{n}(-1)^{k}k^r(k+1)^r(2k+1) w_{k}^{(\alpha)}(x)^{m}\in\mathbb{Z}[x], \end{equation*} and \begin{equation*} \frac{2}{[n,n+1,\cdots,n+2\beta+1]}\sum_{k=1}^{n}(k)_{\beta}^r(k+\beta+1)_{\beta}^r(k+\beta) \prod_{i=0}^{2\beta-1}w_{k+i}^{(\alpha)}(x)^m\in\mathbb{Z}[x], \end{equation*} where $[n,n+1,\cdots,n+2\beta+1]$ is the least common multiple of $n$, $n+1$, $\cdots$, $n+2\beta+1$. Taking $r=\beta=1$ above will confirm some of Z.-W. Sun's conjectures.</description>

      <title>Counting linear congruence systems with a fixed number of solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a prime p and a positive integer s consider a homogeneous linear system over the ring Z_p^s (the ring of integers modulo p^s) described by an n x m-matrix. The possible number of solutions to such a system is p^j, where j=0,1,..., sm. We study the problem of how many n x m -matrices over Z_p^s there are given that we have exactly p^j homogeneous solutions. For the case s=1 (when Z_p^s is a field) George von Landsberg proved a general formula in 1893. However, there seems to be few published general results for the case s&gt;1 except when we have a unique solution (j=0). In this article we present recursive methods for counting such matrices and present explicit formulas for the case when j=&gt; s and n&gt;= m. We will use a generalization of Euler's phi-function and Gaussian binomial coefficients to express our formulas. As an application we compute the probability that gcd(det(A),p^s) gives the number of solutions to the quadratic system Ax=0.</description>

      <title>Computing Expansions in Infinitely Many Cantor Real Bases via a Single Transducer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representing real numbers using convenient numeration systems (integer bases, $\beta$-numeration, Cantor bases, etc.) has been a longstanding mathematical challenge. This paper focuses on Cantor real bases and, specifically, on automatic Cantor real bases and the properties of expansions of real numbers in this setting. We develop a new approach where a single transducer associated with a fixed real number $r$, computes the $\mathbf{B}$-expansion of $r$ but for an infinite family of Cantor real bases $\mathbf{B}$ given as input. This point of view contrasts with traditional computational models for which the numeration system is fixed. Under some assumptions on the finitely many Pisot numbers occurring in the Cantor real base, we show that only a finite part of the transducer is visited. We obtain fundamental results on the structure of this transducer and on decidability problems about these expansions, proving that for certain classes of Cantor real bases, key combinatorial properties such as greediness of the expansion or periodicity can be decided algorithmically.</description>

      <title>On function fields of curves over higher local fields and their division LFD-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K _{m}$ be an $m$-local field with an $m$-th residue field $K _{0}$, for some integer $m &gt; 0$, and let $K/K _{m}$ be a field extension of transcendence degree trd$(K/K _{m}) \le 1$. This paper shows that if $K _{0}$ is a field of finite Diophantine dimension (for example, a finitely-generated extension of a finite or a pseudo-algebraically closed perfect field $E$), then the absolute Brauer $p$-dimension abrd$_{p}(K)$ of $K$ is finite, for every prime number $p$. Thus it turns out that if $R$ is an associative locally finite-dimensional (abbr., LFD) central division $K$-algebra, then it is a normally locally finite algebra over $K$, that is, every nonempty finite subset $Y$ of $R$ is contained in a finite-dimensional central $K$-subalgebra $\mathcal{R}_{Y}$ of $R$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build a modified universal Kolyvagin system for the Galois representation attached to a Hida family of modular forms, starting from the big Heegner point Euler system of Longo--Vigni built in towers of Shimura curves. We generalize the work of B\"uy\"ukboduk to a quaternionic setting, relaxing the classical \emph{Heegner hypothesis} on the tame conductor of the family. As a byproduct of this construction, we give a proof of one divisibility of the anticyclotomic Iwasawa main conjecture for Hida families.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish several formulas relating periods of modular forms on quaternion algebras over number fields to special values of L-functions. Our main inputs are the cohomological techniques for working with periods introduced in [Mol21], along with explicit versions of the Waldspurger formula due to Cai-Shu-Tian. We work in general even positive weights; when specialized to parallel weight 2, our formulas provide partial evidence for the conjectures of Oda and of Prasanna-Venkatesh in the case of forms associated to elliptic curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of smooth supersingular curves of genus $5$ in characteristic $2$ with several notable features: its dimension matches the expected dimension of any component of the supersingular locus in genus $5$, its members are non-hyperelliptic curves with non-trivial automorphism groups, and each curve in the family admits a double cover structure over both an elliptic curve and a genus-$2$ curve. We also provide an explicit parametrization of this family.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The local non-tempered Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture suggests that, for a pair of irreducible Arthur type representations of two successive general linear groups, they have a non-zero Rankin-Selberg period if and only if they are "relevant". In this paper, we prove the "period implies relevance" direction of this conjecture for general linear groups over Archimedean local fields. Our proof is based on a previous result of Gourevitch-Sayag-Karshon on the annihilator varieties of distinguished representations. Combining with a recent result of P. Boisseau on the direction "relevance implies period'', this conjecture for general linear groups over Archimedean local fields is settled.</description>

      <title>The Bilinear Hilbert-Carleson operator along curves. The purely non-zero curvature case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the maximal boundedness range (up to end-points) for the Bilinear Hilbert-Carleson operator along curves in the (purely) non-zero curvature setting. More precisely, we show that the operator $$ BHC_{[\vec{a},\vec{\alpha}]}(f_1,f_2)(x) := \sup_{\lambda\in\mathbb{R}} \left|\,p.v.\, \int_{\mathbb{R}} f_1(x - a_1 t^{\alpha_1}) \,f_2(x - a_2 t^{\alpha_2}) \,e^{i\,\lambda\,a_3 \,t^{\alpha_3}} \,\frac{dt}{t}\right|$$ obeys the bounds $$\|BHC_{[\vec{a},\vec{\alpha}]} (f_1,f_2)\|_{L^r} \lesssim_{\vec{a} \,\vec{\alpha},r,p_1,p_2} \|f_1\|_{L^{p_1}}\,\|f_2\|_{L^{p_2}}$$ whenever $\vec{a}=(a_1,a_2,a_3),\,\vec{\alpha}=(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3)\in (\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\})^3$ with $\vec{\alpha}$ having pairwise distinct coordinates and for any H\"older range $\frac{1}{p_1}+\frac{1}{p_2}=\frac{1}{r}$ with $1&lt;p_1,p_2&lt;\infty$ and $\frac{1}{2}&lt;r&lt;\infty$. This result is achieved via the Rank II LGC method introduced in arXiv:2308.10706.</description>

Abstract: Consider a dominant rational self-map $f$ on a smooth projective variety $X$ defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. We prove that \begin{align} \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{h_{Y}(f^{n}(x))}{h_{H}(f^{n}(x)) } = 0, \end{align} where $h_{Y}$ is a height associated with a closed subscheme $Y \subset X$ of codimension $c$, $h_{H}$ is any ample height on $X$, and $x \in X(\overline{\mathbb{Q}})$ is a point with well-defined orbit, under the following assumptions: (1) either $f$ is a morphism, or $Y$ is pure dimensional, regularly embedded in $X$, and contained in the locus over which all iterates of $f$ are finite; (2) the orbit of $x$ is generic; (3) $d_{c}(f)^{1/c} &lt; \alpha_{f}(x)$, where $d_{c}(f)$ is the $c$-th dynamical degree of $f$ and $ \alpha_{f}(x)$ is the arithmetic degree of $x$.</description>

      <title>Profinite geometric iterated monodromy groups of postcritically finite polynomials in degree 3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the properties of profinite geometric iterated monodromy groups associated to polynomials. Such groups can be seen as generic representations of absolute Galois groups of number fields into the automorphism group of a regular rooted tree. Our main result is that, for a degree 3 postcritically finite polynomial over a number field, where each finite postcritical point has at least one preimage outside the critical orbits, the associated profinite geometric iterated monodromy group is finitely invariably generated. Moreover, this group is determined by the isomorphism class of the ramification portrait of the polynomial, up to conjugation by an automorphism of the ternary rooted tree. We also study the group-theoretical properties of such groups, namely their branch and torsion properties. In particular, we show that such groups are regular branch over the closure of their commutator subgroup, and that they contain torsion elements of any order realizable in the ternary tree.</description>

Abstract: Orders and fractional ideals in number fields provide interesting examples of lattices. We ask: what lattices arise from orders in number fields? We prove that all nontrivial multiplicative constraints on successive minima of orders come from multiplication. Moreover, inspired by a conjecture of Lenstra, for infinitely many positive integers $n$ (including all $n &lt; 18$), we explicitly determine all multiplicative constraints on successive minima of orders in degree $n$ number fields. We also prove analogous results for scrollar invariants of curves.</description>

      <title>A Chebotarev Density Theorem over Local Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.00294v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the $p$-adic densities of points with a given splitting type along a (generically) finite map, analogous to the classical Chebotarev theorem over number fields and function fields. Under some mild hypotheses, we prove that these densities satisfy a functional equation in the size of the residue field. This functional equation is a direct reflection of Poincar\'e duality in \'etale cohomology. As a consequence, we prove a conjecture of Bhargava, Cremona, Fisher, and Gajovi\'c on factorization densities of p-adic polynomials.
  The key tool is the notion of admissible pairs associated to a group, which we use as an invariant of the inertia and decomposition action of a local field on the fibers of the finite map. We compute the splitting densities by M\"obius inverting certain p-adic integrals along the poset of admissible pairs. The conjecture on factorization densities follows immediately for tamely ramified primes from our general results. We reduce the complete conjecture (including the wild primes) to the existence of an explicit "Tate-type" resolution of the "resultant locus" over the integers and complete the proof of the conjecture by constructing this resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00668v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to obtain asymptotic results for shifted sums of multiplicative functions of the form $g \ast 1$, where the function $g$ satisfies the Ramanujan conjecture and has conjectured upper bounds on square moments of its L-function. We establish that for $H$ within the range $X^{23/24+10\varepsilon} \leq H \leq X^{1-\varepsilon}$, there exist constants $B_{f,h}$ such that $$ \sum_{X\leq n \leq 2X} f(n)f(n+h)-B_{f,h}X=O_{f,\varepsilon}\big(X^{1-\varepsilon^{2}/4}\big)$$ for all but $O_{f,\varepsilon}\big(HX^{-\varepsilon^{2}/3}\big)$ integers $h \in [1,H].$ Our method is based on the Hardy-Littlewood circle method. In order to treat minor arcs, we use the convolution structure and a cancellation of $g(n)$ that are additively twisted, applying some arguments from a paper of Matomaki, Radziwill and Tao. Also, we establish an upper bound for weighted exponential sums, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The trace formula is a versatile tool for computing sums of spectral data across families of automorphic forms. Using specialized test functions, one can treat small families with refined spectral properties. This has proven fruitful in analytic applications. We detail such methodology here, with the aim of counting newforms in certain small families. The result (Theorem 7.1) is a general formula for the number of holomorphic newforms of weight $k$ and level $N$ whose local representation type at each $p|N$ is a fixed supercuspidal representation $\sigma_p$ of $\operatorname{GL}_2(\mathbf{Q}_p)$. This is given in terms of local elliptic orbital integrals attached to matrix coefficients of the $\sigma_p$. We evaluate the formula explicitly in the case where each $\sigma_p$ has conductor $\le p^3$. The technical heart of the paper is the explicit calculation of elliptic orbital integrals attached to such $\sigma_p$. We also compute the traces of Hecke operators on the span of these newforms. Some applications are given to biases among root numbers of newforms.</description>

Abstract: In 1983, Feingold and Frenkel discovered a relation between Siegel modular forms of genus two and a rank-three hyperbolic Kac--Moody algebra extending the affine Lie algebra of type $A_1$. It inspires a problem to explore more general relations between affine Lie algebras, hyperbolic Kac--Moody algebras and modular forms. In this paper, we give an automorphic answer to this problem. We classify hyperbolic Borcherds--Kac--Moody superalgebras whose super-denominators define reflective automorphic products of singular weight on lattices of type $2U\oplus L$. As a consequence, we prove that there are exactly $81$ affine Lie algebras $\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$ which have extensions to hyperbolic BKM superalgebras for which the leading Fourier--Jacobi coefficients of super-denominators coincide with the denominators of $\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$. We find that $69$ of them appear in Schellekens' list of semi-simple $V_1$ structures of holomorphic CFT of central charge $24$, while $8$ of them correspond to the $N=1$ structures of holomorphic SCFT of central charge $12$ composed of $24$ chiral fermions. The last $4$ cases are related to exceptional modular invariants from nontrivial automorphisms of fusion algebras. This clarifies the relationship of affine Lie algebras, vertex algebras and hyperbolic BKM superalgebras at the level of modular forms.</description>

Abstract: Assuming a uniform $q$-variant of the prime $k$-tuple conjecture, we compute moments of the number of primes in arithmetic progressions to a large modulus $q$ as the residue classes vary. Consequently, depending on the size of $\varphi(q)$, the prime count follows either a Gaussian or a Poisson distribution. In particular, the least prime in progressions follows an exponential distribution, with some unexpected discrepancies observed for smooth moduli.</description>

Abstract: Let $k$ be a perfect field of characteristic $p$ and $W(k)$ its ring of Witt vectors. We construct an equivalence of categories between the full subcategory of the derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves on the syntomification of $W(k)$ spanned by objects whose Hodge-Tate weights are between $[0,p-2]$ and an appropriate derived category of Fontaine-Laffaille modules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\chi$ be an idele class character over a number field $F$, and let $\pi,\pi'$ be non-dihedral twist-inequivalent cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{A}_F)$. We prove that if $m,n\geq 0$ are integers, $m+n\geq 1$, $F$ is totally real, $\chi$ corresponds with a ray class character, and $\pi,\pi'$ correspond with primitive non-CM holomorphic Hilbert cusp forms, then the Rankin--Selberg $L$-function $L(s,\mathrm{Sym}^m(\pi)\times(\mathrm{Sym}^n(\pi')\otimes\chi))$ has a standard zero-free region with no exceptional Landau--Siegel zero. This is new even for $F=\mathbb{Q}$. As an application, we establish the strongest known unconditional effective rates of convergence in the Sato--Tate distribution for $\pi$ and the joint Sato--Tate distribution for $\pi$ and $\pi'$.</description>

      <title>The distribution of lattices arising from orders in low degree number fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orders in number fields provide natural examples of lattices. We ask: what can the successive minima of lattices arising from orders in number fields be? Given an order $\mathcal{O}$ of absolute discriminant $\Delta$ in a degree $n$ number field, let $1=\lambda_0,\dots,\lambda_{n-1}$ denote the successive minima. For $3 \leq n \leq 5$ and many groups $G \subseteq S_n$, we compute asymptotics of the points $(\log_{ \Delta }\lambda_{1},\dots,\log_{ \Delta }\lambda_{n-1}) \in \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ as $\mathcal{O}$ ranges across orders in degree $n$ fields with Galois group $G$ as $\Delta \rightarrow \infty$. In many cases, we find that the asymptotics, normalized appropriately, are given by a piecewise linear expression and are supported on a finite union of polytopes.</description>

      <title>Semi-stable and splitting models for unitary Shimura varieties over ramified places. II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Shimura varieties associated to a unitary group of signature $(n-1, 1)$. For these varieties, we construct $p$-adic integral models over odd primes $p$ which ramify in the imaginary quadratic field with level subgroup at $p$ given by the stabilizer of a vertex lattice in the hermitian space. Our models are given by a variation of the construction of the splitting models of Pappas-Rapoport and they have a simple moduli theoretic description. By an explicit calculation, we show that these splitting models are normal, flat, Cohen-Macaulay and with reduced special fiber. In fact, they have relatively simple singularities: we show that a single blow-up along a smooth codimension one subvariety of the special fiber produces a semi-stable model. This also implies the existence of semi-stable models of the corresponding Shimura varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a lower bound for the classical Kloosterman sum $S(a,b;c)$ where $(ab,c)=1$ and $c$ is an odd integer. We apply this lower bound for Kloosterman sums to derive an explicit lower bound in Petersson's trace formula, subject to a given condition. Consequently, we achieve a modified version of a theorem by Jung and Sardari, where weight $k$ and level $N$ are permitted to vary independently. Using this modified version, we get a lower bound concerning the trace of the Hecke operator $T_n$ acting on the space $S(N, k)$, of cusp forms of weight $k$ and level $N$ for $(n, N) =1$.</description>

      <title>On Galois Extensions of Local Fields with a Single Wild Ramification Jump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14845v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a given unramified extension $K/K_1$ of finite extensions of $\mathbb{Q}_p$, we effectively determine the number of finite Galois extensions $L/K_1$ with maximal unramified subextension $K/K_1$ and a single wild ramification jump at $2$. In fact, we determine explicit formulas in the cases when $K_1/\mathbb{Q}_p$ is totally ramified and when it is unramified. This builds upon the tamely ramified case, which is a classical consequence of Serre's Mass Formula, exhibiting a more restrictive behavior than in the tamely ramified case because the degrees of such extensions are bounded. As a consequence of the calculation, it is also found that the count depends only on the extension $k/k_1$ of residue fields.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we improve the recent work of Hasanalizade, Shen, and Wong by establishing

  \] for every $T\ge e$, where $N(T)$ is the number of non-trivial zeros $\rho=\beta+i\gamma$, with $0&lt;\gamma \le T$, of the Riemann zeta-function $\zeta(s)$. The main source of improvement comes from implementing new subconvexity bounds for $\zeta(\sigma+it)$ on some $\sigma_k$-lines inside the critical strip.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markov polynomials are the Laurent-polynomial solutions of the generalised Markov equation $$X^2 + Y^2 + Z^2 = kXYZ, \quad k=\frac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{x y z}$$ which are the results of cluster mutations applied to the initial triple $(x, y, z)$. They were first introduced and studied by Itsara, Musiker, Propp and Viana, who proved, in particular, that their coefficients are non-negative integers. We study the coefficients of Markov polynomials as functions on the corresponding Newton polygons, proposing several new conjectures. Some of these conjectures are proved for the special cases of Markov polynomials corresponding to Fibonacci and Pell numbers.</description>

Abstract: Let $K$ be a totally real number field and $ \mathcal{O}_K$ be the ring of integers of $K$. This manuscript examines the asymptotic solutions of the Fermat equation of signature $(r, r, p)$, specifically $x^r+y^r=dz^p$ over $K$, where $r,p \geq5$ are rational primes and odd $d\in \mathcal{O}_K \setminus \{0\}$. For a certain class of fields $K$, we first prove that the equation $x^r+y^r=dz^p$ has no asymptotic solution $(a,b,c) \in \mathcal{O}_K^3$ with $2 |c$. Then, we study the asymptotic solutions $(a,b,c) \in \mathcal{O}_K^3$ to the equation $x^5+y^5=dz^p$ with $2 \nmid c$. We use the modular method to prove these results.</description>

Abstract: We prove upper bounds on the number of rational points on transcendental curves in arbitrary $1$-h-minimal fields, similar to the Pila--Wilkie counting theorem in the o-minimal setting. These results extend results due to Cluckers--Comte--Loeser from $p$-adic fields to arbitrary valued fields of mixed characteristic. Our methods rely on parametrizations, where we avoid the usage of $r$-th power maps, combined with the determinant method.</description>

Abstract: We prove a new automorphy lifting theorem for certain 2-adic Galois representations $\rho:G_F\longrightarrow {\rm GSp}_{2n}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_2)$ where $F$ an arbitrary totally real field. This extends the minimal case previously established by Thorne to the non-minimal case. A key ingredient is a detailed analysis for the residual monodromy representations associated to the Dwork family in characteristic two. As an application, combining with the author's previous work with Tsuzuki, we prove the automorphy of certain rank 4 symplectic motives over $F$ coming from the Dwork quintic family under suitable conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.04046v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a (perfectoid) mixed characteristic version of $F$-signature and Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity by utilizing the perfectoidization functor of Bhatt-Scholze and Faltings' normalized length (also developed in the work of Gabber-Ramero). We show that these definitions coincide with the classical theory in equal characteristic $p &gt; 0$. We prove that a ring is regular if and only if either its perfectoid signature or perfectoid Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity is 1 and we show that perfectoid Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity characterizes BCM closure and extended plus closure of $m$-primary ideals. We demonstrate that perfectoid signature detects BCM-regularity and transforms similarly to $F$-signature or normalized volume under quasi-\'etale maps. As a consequence, we prove that BCM-regular rings have finite local \'etale fundamental group and also finite torsion part of their divisor class groups. Finally, we also define a mixed characteristic version of relative rational signature, and show it characterizes BCM-rational singularities.</description>

We define the equivariant analogues of the non-archimedean differential forms and currents appearing in \emph{loc.~cit.} and relate them to piecewise polynomial functions on the polyhedral complexes defining the toric models. In particular, we give combinatorial characterizations of the Green currents associated to equivariant cycles and combinatorial descriptions of the arithmetic Chow groups.</description>

Abstract: The Cohen-Lenstra heuristic predicts the distribution of ideal class groups over number fields. Random matrix models provide a natural framework for explaining this heuristic, and recent results demonstrate the effectiveness of these tools. In this paper, we extend the analysis of the random matrix model to examine the error term in the Cohen-Lenstra heuristic. Additionally, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the corank of random matrices over finite fields, which can be modeled as a special class of Markov chains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11912v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a supersingular elliptic curve E and a non-scalar endomorphism $\alpha$ of E, we prove that the endomorphism ring of E can be computed in classical time about disc(Z[$\alpha$])^1/4 , and in quantum subexponential time, assuming the generalised Riemann hypothesis. Previous results either had higher complexities, or relied on heuristic assumptions. Along the way, we prove that the Primitivisation problem can be solved in polynomial time (a problem previously believed to be hard), and we prove that the action of smooth ideals on oriented elliptic curves can be computed in polynomial time (previous results of this form required the ideal to be powersmooth, i.e., not divisible by any large prime power). Following the attacks on SIDH, isogenies in high dimension are a central ingredient of our results.</description>

Abstract: The adele ring of a number field is a central object in modern number theory. Its status as a locally compact topological ring is one of the key reasons why. We describe a formal proof that the adele ring of a number field is locally compact implemented in the Lean 4 theorem prover. Our work includes the formalisations of new types, including the completion of a number field at an infinite place, the infinite adele ring and the finite $S$-adele ring, as well as formal proofs that completions of a number field are locally compact and that their rings of integers at finite places are compact.</description>

      <title>An old number theory problem related to the Legendre symbol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02434v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is using a very simple constructive method to study an old number theory problem related to the Legendre symbol modulo $p$, and completely solved it. The proving method of the result is purely elementary and has been desired in the literature at least since 1927.</description>

      <title>The Pythagoras number of fields of transcendence degree $1$ over $\mathbb{Q}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any sum of squares in a field of transcendence degree $1$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is a sum of $5$ squares, answering a question of Pop and Pfister. We deduce this result from a representation theorem, in $k(C)$, for quadratic forms of rank $\geq 5$ with coefficients in $k$, where $C$ is a curve over a number field $k$.</description>
