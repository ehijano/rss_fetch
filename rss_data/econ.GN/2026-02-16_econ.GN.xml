      <title>Scale and Capacity Limits in Decentralized FDA Food-Safety Enforcement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper asks whether regulatory monitoring exhibits nonlinear capacity limits as the scale and complexity of the regulated environment increase. Using a county--year panel of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspections merged with local establishment counts, we identify a sharp breakpoint: beyond a threshold scale, severe inspection findings rise while inspection effort per establishment flattens or declines. The threshold and the post-break deterioration vary across food-related industry groups and shift with proxies for local density and connectedness, consistent with monitoring becoming ``too big to monitor" in more interconnected production environments rather than driven by simple reallocation or delay. Methodologically, we provide a portable breakpoint selection and piecewise-estimation framework that can be applied to other enforcement settings.</description>

      <title>Generative AI and the Reallocation of Time: Productivity, Leisure, and Fulfilling Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a representative survey of Korean workers, we provide evidence on the adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) and how GenAI reallocates time at work. We find that 51.8\% of workers use GenAI for work and GenAI reduces working time by 3.8\%. However, these gains may not materialize in aggregate productivity statistics yet: the correlation between time savings and output changes is near zero. We show this disconnect arises because workers capture efficiency gains primarily as on-the-job leisure, rather than increasing their output. These findings suggest that standard productivity measures may understate AI's impact by missing non-pecuniary welfare channels.</description>

      <title>"Unmatched" From Skewed Births to a Structural Surplus of Grooms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data on marriage flows are not available in most developing countries, making marriage market imbalance difficult to measure. Existing measures use crude fertility rates and do not account for early-life mortality, overstating the number of births surviving to marriageable ages. This paper develops the Surplus Groom Index to quantify marriage market imbalance under monogamy using census age structure, vital registration of births and deaths, and marriage timing data. The index incorporates effective fertility-total births adjusted for under-five mortality - to reflect actual cohort progression from birth to marriageable ages. This adjustment matters in settings where child mortality shapes the supply of marriage partners. Using India's 2011 Census data, we find that eleven percent of men aged 15-54 cannot marry due to bride shortage, approximately 39 million men. Marriage imbalance is widespread rather than regionally concentrated. Punjab records the highest deficit at 33 percent, but states considered demographically progressive show substantial imbalance: Kerala 18 percent, West Bengal 14 percent, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu 11 percent each. Declining fertility has produced smaller female cohorts unable to absorb male-heavy cohorts from earlier birth years. Balanced sex ratios at birth do not ensure marriage market equilibrium once fertility declines and marriage is delayed.</description>

      <title>The Directions of Technical Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI is a directional technology: it excels at some task combinations and performs poorly at others. Knowledge work is also directional and endogenous: workers can satisfy their job requirements with different combinations of tasks. Studying AI adoption by knowledge workers hence requires comparing two vectors.We develop a high-dimensional model of task choice and technology adoption, with otherwise standard neoclassical assumptions. AI is adopted when its direction is aligned with what the worker values at the margin -- the worker's shadow prices, rather than with what the worker actually does -- their activity vector. This yields a cone of adoption that widens as AI capability grows; near the entry threshold, small improvements in capability translate into large expansions in the set of adopted directions. Adoption also has a structured intensive margin: a tool can be worth using but not worth using all the time, generating a region of stable hybrid production between an entry threshold and an all-in threshold. We also show how to derive shadow prices as explicit functions of observable skill and requirement vectors. The framework explains rapid adoption in aligned occupations, heterogeneous adoption elsewhere, and weak correlation with one-dimensional skill measures: the key heterogeneity is directional alignment, not skill level.</description>

      <title>Workers as Partners: a Theory of Responsible Firms in Labor Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study responsible firms that internalize incumbent-worker surplus in frictional labor markets. In a firm-level benchmark, responsibility creates an endogenous wedge in the effective marginal cost of labor -- akin to a hiring subsidy in the firm's first-order conditions -- so it changes wage and vacancy incentives rather than only redistributing rents. The wedge is largest when outside options are weak and separations are rare, implying larger responsible wage premia in low-mobility environments and pointing to a countercyclical role for responsible wage setting. In a wage-posting model with on-the-job search, responsible firms occupy the upper tail of the wage distribution and can generate a segmented high-wage sector. In a DMP model with bargaining and endogenous tightness, responsible governance raises the value of unemployment and spills over to wages at profit-maximizing firms.</description>

      <title>Not-so-Cleansing Recessions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recessions are periods in which the least productive firms in the economy exit, and as the economy recovers, they are replaced by new and more productive entrants. These cleansing effects improve the average firm productivity. At the same time, recessions induce a loss of varieties. In an economy with Homothetic Single Aggregator technology, we show that their long-run welfare effects trade off these two forces. This trade-off is governed by love-of-variety and the elasticity of substitution in aggregate production. If industry output is aggregated using the standard CES aggregator, recessions do not improve long-run GDP or welfare. If the economy features more love-of-variety than CES, the social planner optimally subsidizes economic activity both in steady state and even more so in recessions to avoid firm exit. We use the model and quasi-exogenous variation in demand to estimate love-of-variety. We find it to be significantly higher than implied by CES aggregation, suggesting that even the long-run effects of recessions are negative. Finally, we quantitatively characterize the optimal policy response both along the transition and in the steady state.</description>

      <title>Deviations from the Nash equilibrium in a two-player optimal execution game with reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning algorithms in financial trading is becoming increasingly prevalent. However, the autonomous nature of these algorithms can lead to unexpected outcomes that deviate from traditional game-theoretical predictions and may even destabilize markets. In this study, we examine a scenario in which two autonomous agents, modelled with Double Deep Q-Learning, learn to liquidate the same asset optimally in the presence of market impact, under the Almgren-Chriss (2000) framework. We show that the strategies learned by the agents deviate significantly from the Nash equilibrium of the corresponding market impact game. Notably, the learned strategies exhibit supra-competitive solution, {which might be compatible with a tacit collusive behaviour}, closely aligning with the Pareto-optimal solution. We further explore how different levels of market volatility influence the agents' performance and the equilibria they discover, including scenarios where volatility differs between the training and testing phases.</description>
