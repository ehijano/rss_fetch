      <title>The Yoneda embedding in simplicial type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Riehl and Shulman introduced simplicial type theory (STT), a variant of homotopy type theory which aimed to study not just homotopy theory, but its fusion with category theory: $(\infty,1)$-category theory. While notoriously technical, manipulating $\infty$-categories in simplicial type theory is often easier than working with ordinary categories, with the type theory handling infinite stacks of coherences in the background. We capitalize on recent work by Gratzer et al. defining the $(\infty,1)$-category of $\infty$-groupoids in STT to define presheaf categories within STT and systematically develop their theory. In particular, we construct the Yoneda embedding, prove the universal property of presheaf categories, refine the theory of adjunctions in STT, introduce the theory of Kan extensions, and prove Quillen's Theorem A. In addition to a large amount of category theory in STT, we offer substantial evidence that STT can be used to produce difficult results in $\infty$-category theory at a fraction of the complexity.</description>

      <title>RTT presentation of coideal subalgebra of quantized enveloping algebra of type CI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pair consisting of a quantum group and its corresponding coideal subalgebra, known as a quantum symmetric pair, was developed independently by M. Noumi and G. Letzter through different approaches. The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, for symmetric pairs $(\mathfrak{sp}_{2n},\mathfrak{gl}_n)$, we construct a coideal subalgebra $U_q^{tw}(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ of the quantized enveloping algebra of type CI using the $R$-matrix presentation, based on the work of Noumi. Second, we derive a Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt(PBW) basis for $U_q^{tw}(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ by the $\mathbb{A}$-form approach. As a consequence of the isomorphism btween $U_q^{tw}(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ and the $\imath$quantum group $\mathcal{U}^{\imath}$, our method also yields the PBW basis for the $\imath$quantum group of type CI. Finally, as an application of the $R$-matrix presentation, we construct a Poisson algebra $\mathcal{P}_n$ associated with $U_q^{tw}(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$, and explicitly describe the action of the braid group $\mathcal{B}_n$ on the elements of $\mathcal{P}_n$.</description>

      <title>Double categories of relations relative to factorisation systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We relativise double categories of relations to stable orthogonal factorisation systems. Furthermore, we present the characterisation of the relative double categories of relations in two ways. The first utilises a generalised comprehension scheme, and the second focuses on a specific class of vertical arrows defined solely double-categorically. We organise diverse classes of double categories of relations and correlate them with significant classes of factorisation systems. Our framework embraces double categories of spans and double categories of relations on regular categories, which we meticulously compare to existing work on the characterisations of bicategories and double categories of spans and relations.</description>

      <title>An Internal Logic of Virtual Double Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a type theory called fibrational virtual double type theory (FVDblTT) designed specifically for formal category theory, which is a succinct reformulation of New and Licata's Virtual Equipment Type Theory (VETT). FVDblTT formalizes reasoning on isomorphisms that are commonly employed in category theory. Virtual double categories are one of the most successful frameworks for developing formal category theory, and FVDblTT has them as a theoretical foundation. We validate its worth as an internal language of virtual double categories by providing a syntax-semantics duality between virtual double categories and specifications in FVDblTT as a biadjunction.</description>

      <title>On The Axioms Of $\mathcal{M},\mathcal{N}$-Adhesive Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12638v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adhesive and quasiadhesive categories provide a general framework for the study of algebraic graph rewriting systems. In a quasiadhesive category any two regular subobjects have a join which is again a regular subobject. Vice versa, if regular monos are adhesive, then the existence of a regular join for any pair of regular subobjects entails quasiadhesivity. It is also known (quasi)adhesive categories can be embedded in a Grothendieck topos via a functor preserving pullbacks and pushouts along (regular) monomorphisms. In this paper we extend these results to $\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N}$-adhesive categories, a concept recently introduced to generalize the notion of (quasi)adhesivity. We introduce the notion of $\mathcal{N}$-adhesive morphism, which allows us to express $\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N}$-adhesivity as a condition on the subobjects's posets. Moreover, $\mathcal{N}$-adhesive morphisms allows us to show how an $\mathcal{M},\mathcal{N}$-adhesive category can be embedded into a Grothendieck topos, preserving pullbacks and $\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N}$-pushouts.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Monoidal Algebra: Axiomatising Distance with String Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: String diagrammatic calculi have become increasingly popular in fields such as quantum theory, circuit theory, probabilistic programming, and machine learning, where they enable resource-sensitive and compositional algebraic analysis. Traditionally, the equations of diagrammatic calculi only axiomatise exact semantic equality. However, reasoning in these domains often involves approximations rather than strict equivalences. In this work, we develop a quantitative framework for diagrammatic calculi, where one may axiomatise notions of distance between string diagrams. Unlike similar approaches, such as the quantitative theories introduced by Mardare et al., this requires us to work in a monoidal rather than a cartesian setting. We define a suitable notion of monoidal theory, the syntactic category it freely generates, and its models, where the concept of distance is established via enrichment over a quantale. To illustrate the framework, we provide examples from probabilistic and linear systems analysis.</description>
