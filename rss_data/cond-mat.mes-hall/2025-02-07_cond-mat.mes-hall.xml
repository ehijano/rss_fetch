      <title>Super-diffusion of Photoexcited Carriers in Topological Insulator Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the ultrafast dynamics and transport of photoexcited carriers in topological insulators is crucial for the optical manipulation of spins and may shed light on the nature of topological excitons. Here we investigate bulk-insulating Sb-doped $\mathrm{Bi_2Se_3}$ nanoribbons via ultrafast transient photovoltage microscopy. The probe-pulse-induced photovoltage is substantially suppressed by a pump pulse. Recovery time increases from 50 to 1600 picoseconds as the pump fluence increases. We found that the diffusivity of photoexcited carriers increases significantly at lower carrier concentrations, up to 800 cm$^2$/s at 21 K, two to three orders of magnitude higher than that of band-edge carriers. Remarkably, the photoexcited carriers travel up to 10 $\mu$m for hundreds of picoseconds at this high diffusivity. The diffusivity peaks in intrinsic devices and is reduced at high temperatures. We discuss the possible mechanisms of long-ranged super-diffusion in the frames of hot carriers and exciton condensation.</description>

      <title>Polarons and Exciton-Polarons in Two-Dimensional Polar Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a macroscopic theory of optical phonons, Fr{\"oh}lich polarons, and exciton-polarons in two-dimensional (2D) polar crystalline monolayers. Our theory extends the classical macroscopic formulation of the electron-phonon problem in three-dimensional (3D) polar crystals to the new generation of 2D materials. Similarly to the 3D case, in our approach, the effective electron-phonon Hamiltonian is parametrized solely in terms of macroscopic experimentally accessible quantities -- 2D polarizabilities of the monolayer at low and high frequencies. We derive the dispersion of long wave length longitudinal optical (LO) phonons, which can be viewed as a 2D form of the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation, and study the formation of 2D Fr{\"oh}lich polarons by adopting the intermediate coupling approximation. Finally, we apply this approach to excitons in polar 2D crystals and derive an effective potential of the electron-hole interaction dressed by LO phonons. Due to the specific dispersion of LO phonons, the polarons and exciton-polarons in 2D materials exhibit unique features not found in their 3D counterparts. As an illustration, the polaron and exciton-polaron binding energies are computed for a representative set of 2D polar crystals, demonstrating the interplay between dimensionality, polarizability of materials, and electron-phonon coupling.</description>

      <title>Co-existing topological and Volkov-Pankratov plasmonic edge states in magnetized graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene placed in a perpendicular magnetic field supports optical modes known as magnetoplasmons which are transversally confined to the graphene layer. Unlike ordinary graphene plasmons, these magnetoplasmonic surface waves are characterized by a band gap corresponding to the cyclotron frequency. In addition, these magnetoplasmon bands are topological, characterized by a non-zero Chern number. This leads to the existence of topologically protected edge states at domain edges where the Chern number changes. Since the Chern number is dependent on the direction of the magnetic field, edge states exist at domain edges across which the magnetic field flips direction. Physically, the magnetic field can only flip direction at gradual domain edges with finite width creating topological heterojunctions. These topological heterojunctions support extra edge states known as Volkov-Pankratov edge states which can enter the band gap and support propagation in both directions. The number of Volkov-Pankratov states at a heterojunction varies as a function of the width of the gradual domain edge.</description>

      <title>Correlated helimagnetic configuration in a nonsymmorphic magnetic nodal semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonsymmorphic magnetic Weyl semimetal materials such as ReAlX (Re=rare earth, X=Si/Ge) provide a unique opportunity to explore the correlated phenomena between Weyl fermions and nontrivial magnetic configurations. To be specific, we study a lattice model in which the magnetic configuration is determined by the competition among ferromagnetic (FM) interaction, the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction, and the Kondo coupling $K_0$ to the Weyl fermion. Both quantum and finite-temperature phase transitions between FM and correlated nesting helical configurations are found. Different from the uncorrelated helimagnet that decouples to the Weyl fermions, this correlated helimagnet induces a magnetic Brillouin zone with a $K_0$-dependent nesting in the band structure of the conducting fermions instead of the magnetic monopole-like Weyl cone. By measuring the current induced by the chiral magnetic effect on the conducting fermion with nesting Weyl nodes, one can distinguish the correlated nesting helical order and the ferromagnetism because the chiral magnetic effect is considerably suppressed in the former case. These properties we study here may explain the experimental observations in ReAlX.</description>

      <title>Electric field tunable bands in doubly aligned bilayer graphene hBN moire superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we demonstrate electric field-induced band modification of an asymmetrically twisted hBN/BLG/hBN supermoire lattice. Distinct from unaligned BLG/hBN systems, we observe regions in the density-displacement field (n-D) plane where the device conductance is independent of n and decreases as |D| increases. This distinction arises due to the angle asymmetry between the layers, which induces field-controlled layer polarization. We identify D-dependent additional band gaps near the charge neutrality point that appear in the conduction (valence) band for negative (positive) D values. In the quantum Hall regime, new 6-fold degenerate Landau levels are observed. Our findings establish that in an asymmetric supermoire heterostructure, an external vertical displacement field affects the valence and conduction bands very differently and sheds light on the asymmetric conductance patterns noted in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Non-renormalization of the fractional quantum Hall conductivity by interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect (QHE) proposed a long time ago by Lopez and Fradkin \cite{Fradkin1991chern}. The magnetic fluxes of the statistical gauge field attached to electrons remain at rest in the reference frame moving together with the electron liquid. In the laboratory reference frame the electric field of the statistical gauge field forms and screens the external electric field. The fractional QHE conductivity appears as a consequence of this screening already on the mean field theory level. We consider a relativistic extension of the model, and propose an alternative description of the fractional QHE based on macroscopic motion of the electron liquid within the Zubarev statistical operator approach. It is this macroscopic motion of electrons which in this pattern gives rise to the fractional QHE. Within this approach we propose the proof to all orders of perturbation theory that the interaction corrections cannot change the above mentioned mean field theory result for the QHE conductivity.</description>

      <title>Phonon spectra, quantum geometry, and the Goldstone theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonons are essential (quasi)particles of all crystals and play a key role in fundamental properties such as thermal transport and superconductivity. In particular, acoustic phonons can be viewed as the Goldstone modes arising from the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry. In this article, we present a comprehensive - in the absence of Holstein phonons - theory of the quantum geometric contributions to the phonon spectra of crystals. Using graphene as a case study, we separate the dynamical matrix into several terms that depend differently on the electron energy and wavefunction, and demonstrate that the quantum geometric effects are crucial in shaping the phonon spectra of the material. Neglecting them leads to a gap in the acoustic phonon branches, which clearly violates the Goldstone theorem.</description>

      <title>Anderson insulator-based cryogenic photonic thermal amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A photonic heat amplifier (PHA) designed for cryogenic operations is introduced and analyzed. This device comprises two Anderson insulator reservoirs connected by lossless lines, allowing them to exchange heat through photonic modes. This configuration enables negative differential thermal conductance (NDTC), which can be harnessed to amplify thermal signals. To achieve this, we maintain one reservoir at a high temperature, serving as the source terminal of a thermal transistor. Concurrently, in the other one, we establish tunnel contacts to metallic reservoirs, which function as the gate and drain terminals. With this arrangement, it is possible to control the heat flux exchange between the source and drain by adjusting the gate temperature. We present two distinct parameter choices that yield different performances: the first emphasizes modulating the source-drain heat current, while the second focuses on the temperature modulation of the colder Anderson insulator. Lastly, we present a potential design variation in which all electronic reservoirs are thermally connected through only photonic modes, allowing interactions between distant elements. The proposal of the PHA addresses the lack of thermal transistors and amplifiers in the mK range while being compatible with the rich toolbox of circuit quantum electrodynamics. It can be adapted to various applications, including sensing and developing thermal circuits and control devices at sub-Kelvin temperatures, which are relevant to quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Non-unitary time dynamics of topological modes in open planar quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nontrivial topological invariant of bulk electronic wavefunctions in two-dimensional quantum crystals leaves its footprints on the edge, dislocation, and corner modes. Here we investigate non-unitary time dynamics of these topological modes in square lattice-based open quantum systems in which the time-dependent Hamiltonian smoothly interpolates between topologically distinct insulators across band gap closing quantum critical points. The temporal dynamics of these modes is described by a Lindblad equation in which the instantaneous Hamiltonian plays the role of the Lindblad operator, thereby allowing the environment to couple with the system through the energy channels (weak measurement protocol). We show that in the presence of such a real time ramp, the survival probability of these modes decreases (increases) in short (long) time scale where the dephasing (quantum Zeno) effect dominates with the increasing amplitude of the system-to-environment coupling, for both slow and fast ramps from a topological to a normal insulating state. For a reverse course of the time evolution, the revival or condensation probability of nucleating such topological modes, otherwise absent in the initial system, increases for stronger system-to-environment coupling. This phenomenon can be attributed to the strong decoherence of the initial mixed state among all the energy eigenstates of the final Hamiltonian which also includes the topological modes, causing their enhanced condensation probability. Our findings can be germane to real open topological materials with time-tunable band gap, and should be applicable to open topological crystals of arbitrary dimension and belonging to any symmetry class.</description>

      <title>Many-body non-Hermitian skin effect with exact steady states in dissipative lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a dissipative lattice gauge model that exhibits the many-body version of the non-Hermitian skin effect. The dissipative couplings between dynamical gauge fields on the lattice links and the surrounding environment generate chiral motions of particles residing on lattice sites. Although the system involves many-body interactions, the local gauge symmetries offer a flexible approach to exactly constructing the steady state that demonstrates the many-body non-Hermitian skin effect. Furthermore, our approach can be generalized to realize a new type of many-body non-Hermitian skin effect, dubbed the hierarchical skin effect, where different subsystem degrees of freedom exhibit boundary accumulation of multiple moments at different orders. Our findings can be readily observed by engineering dissipation in state-of-the-art lattice gauge simulators.</description>

      <title>Topological phases of non-interacting systems: A general approach based on states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we provide a classification scheme for topological phases of certain systems whose observable algebra is described by a trivial $C^*$-bundles. The classification is based on the study of the homotopy classes of \emph{configurations}, which are maps from a \emph{quantum parameter space} to the space of pure states of a reference \emph{fiber} $C^*$-algebra. Both the quantum parameter space and the fiber algebra are naturally associated with the observable algebra. A list of various examples described in the last section shows that the common classification scheme of non-interacting topological insulators of type A is recovered inside this new formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetics of biological motors such as kinesin or dynein is notably influenced by viscoelastic intracellular environment. The characteristic relaxation time of the cytosol is not separable from the colloidal timescale and therefore their dynamics is inherently non-Markovian. In this paper we consider a variant of a Brownian motor model, namely a Brownian ratchet immersed in a correlated thermal bath and analyze how memory influences its dynamics. In particular, we demonstrate the memory-induced current reversal effect and explain this phenomenon by applying the effective mass approximation as well as uncovering the memory-induced dynamical localization of the motor trajectories in the phase space. Our results reveal new aspects of the role of memory in microscopic systems out of thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Photoluminescence Features of Few-Layer Hexagonal $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indium (III) selenide is currently one of the most actively studied materials in the two-dimensional family due to its remarkable ferroelectric and optical properties. This study focuses on the luminescent properties of few-layer In$_2$Se$_3$ flakes with thicknesses ranging from 7 to 100 monolayers. To explore the photoluminescence features and correlate them with changes in crystal symmetry and surface potential, we employed a combination of techniques, including temperature-dependent micro-photoluminescence, time-resolved photoluminescence, Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and Kelvin probe force microscopy. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy confirmed that the samples studied possess the $\alpha$-polytype structure. The micro-photoluminescence spectrum consists of two bands, A and B, with band B almost completely disappearing at room temperature. Temperature-dependent photoluminescence and time-resolved measurements helped us to elucidate the nature of the observed bands. We find that peak A is associated with emission from interband transitions in In$_2$Se$_3$, while peak B is attributed to defect-related emission. Additionally, the photoluminescence decay times of In$_2$Se$_3$ flakes with varying thicknesses were determined. No significant changes were observed in the decay components as the thickness increased from 7 to 100 monolayers, suggesting that there are no qualitative changes in the band structure.</description>

      <title>Atomically Thin Metallenes at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomically thin metallenes are a new family of materials representing the ultimate limit of a thin free-electron gas for novel applications. Although metallene research has gained traction, limited attention has been paid to the properties of their ubiquitous edges. Here, we use density-functional theory simulations to investigate various edges of Mg, Cu, Y, Au, and Pb metallenes with hexagonal and buckled honeycomb lattices. Investigating relaxations, energies, stresses, and electronic structures at the edge, we find that some properties have clear trends while others are sensitive to both element and lattice type. Given that edge properties are fundamental to metallene stability and interactions in lateral heterostructures, their detailed understanding will help guide the development of metallene synthesis and applications.</description>

Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems are widespread in both classical and quantum physics. The dynamics of such systems has recently become a focal point of research, showcasing surprising behaviors that include apparent violation of the adiabatic theorem and chiral topological conversion related to encircling exceptional points (EPs). These have both fundamental interest and potential practical applications. Yet the current literature features a number of apparently irreconcilable results. Here we develop a general theory for slow evolution of non-Hermitian systems and resolve these contradictions. We prove an analog of the adiabatic theorem for non-Hermitian systems and generalize it in the presence of uncontrolled environmental fluctuations (noise). The effect of noise turns out to be crucial due to inherent exponential instabilities present in non-Hermitian systems. Disproving common wisdom, the end state of the system is determined by the final Hamiltonian only, and is insensitive to other details of the evolution trajectory in parameter space. Our quantitative theory, leading to transparent physical intuition, is amenable to experimental tests. It provides efficient tools to predict the outcome of the system's evolution, avoiding the need to follow costly time-evolution simulations. Our approach may be useful for designing devices based on non-Hermitian physics and may stimulate analyses of classical and quantum non-Hermitian-Hamiltonian dynamics, as well as that of quantum Lindbladian and hybrid-Liouvillian systems.</description>

      <title>Light-matter correlations in Quantum Floquet engineering of cavity quantum materials</title>

Abstract: Quantum Floquet engineering (QFE) seeks to generalize the control of quantum systems with classical external fields, widely known as Semi-Classical Floquet engineering (SCFE), to quantum fields. However, to faithfully capture the physics at arbitrary coupling, a gauge-invariant description of light-matter interaction in cavity-QED materials is required, which makes the Hamiltonian highly non-linear in photonic operators. We provide a non-perturbative truncation scheme of the Hamiltonian, which is valid or arbitrary coupling strength, and use it to investigate the role of light-matter correlations, which are absent in SCFE. We find that even in the high-frequency regime, light-matter correlations can be crucial, in particular for the topological properties of a system. As an example, we show that for a SSH chain coupled to a cavity, light-matter correlations break the original chiral symmetry of the chain, strongly affecting the robustness of its edge states. In addition, we show how light-matter correlations are imprinted in the photonic spectral function and discuss their relation with the topology of the bands.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Dirac cones with valley-dependent lifetimes</title>

Abstract: Relativistic quasiparticles emerging from band degeneracies in crystals play crucial roles in the transport and topological properties of materials and metamaterials. Quasiparticles are commonly described by Hermitian Hamiltonians, with non-Hermiticity usually considered detrimental. In this work, we show that such an assumption of Hermiticity can be lifted to bring quasiparticles into non-Hermitian regime. We propose a concrete lattice model containing two Dirac cones with valley-dependent lifetimes. The lifetime contrast enables an ultra-strong valley selection rule: only one valley can survive in the long-time limit regardless of the excitation, lattice shape and other details. This property leads to an effective parity anomaly with a single Dirac cone and offers a simple way to generate vortex states. Additionally, extending non-Hermitian features to boundaries generates valley kink states with valley-locked lifetimes, making them effectively unidirectional and more resistant against inter-valley scattering. All these phenomena are experimentally demonstrated in a non-Hermitian electric circuit lattice.</description>

      <title>Wigner-function formalism for the detection of single microwave pulses in a resonator-coupled double quantum dot</title>

Abstract: Semiconductor double quantum dots (DQD) coupled to superconducting microwave resonators offer a promising platform for the detection of single microwave photons. In previous works, the photodetection was studied for a monochromatic source of microwave photons. Here, we theoretically analyze the photodetection of single microwave pulses. The photodetection in this case can be seen as a non-linear filtering process of an incoming signal, the pulse, to an outgoing one, the photocurrent. This analogy to signal processing motivated the derivation of a Wigner-function formalism which provides a compelling visualization of the time and frequency properties of the photodetector for low intensities. We find a trade-off between detecting the time and the frequency of the incoming photons in agreement with the time-energy uncertainty relation. As the intensity of the source increases, the photodetection is influenced by coherent Rabi oscillations of the DQD. Our findings give insight into the time-dependent properties of microwave photons interacting with electrons in a DQD-resonator hybrid system and provide guidance for experiments on single microwave pulse detection.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal spin-wave dispersion in magnetic bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal spin-wave propagation in bilayer ferromagnetic systems has attracted significant attention due to its potential to precisely quantify material parameters as well as for applications in magnonic logic and information processing. In this study we investigate the nonreciprocity of spin-wave dispersions in heterostructures consisting of two distinct ferromagnetic materials, focusing on the influence of saturation magnetization and thickness of the magnetic layers. We exploit Brillouin light scattering to confirm numerical calculations which are conducted with the finite element software TETRAX. An extensive numerical analysis reveals that the nonreciprocal behavior is strongly influenced by the changing material parameters, with asymmetry in the spin-wave propagation direction reaching several GHz under optimized conditions. Our findings demonstrate that tailoring the bilayer composition enables precise control over nonreciprocity, providing a pathway for engineering efficient unidirectional spin-wave devices. These results offer a deeper understanding of hybrid ferromagnetic systems and open avenues for designing advanced magnonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and magnetic ordering in chalcogen-intercalated graphene bilayers with charge compensation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a new class of two-dimensional crystals with the structure AC$_8$XC$_8$, consisting of two layers of graphene, a chalcogen (X = O, S, Se, Te) intercalation layer, and an alkaline earth (A = Be, Ca, Mg, Sr, Ba) adlayer. The electronic band structure for the 20 compounds was studied using density functional theory. The chalcogen $p$ orbitals interact with the carbon $\pi$ orbitals to form weakly dispersing bands that intersect the Fermi level and give rise to complex Fermi surfaces featuring electron and hole pockets whose densities exactly compensate each other, and van Hove singularities that are very close to, or coincident with, the Fermi level in the majority of compounds studied. The resulting electron-electron interaction effects are studied using both the temperature-flow renormalisation group approach and a spin fluctuation model, which show a ferromagnetic phase with critical temperatures as high as $\sim 10^3$ K that coexists with $p$- or $f$-wave spin triplet superconductivity over a range of temperatures.</description>

      <title>Mie-enhanced micro-focused Brillouin light scattering with wavevector resolution</title>

Abstract: Magnons, the quanta of spin waves, are magnetic excitations of matter spanning through the entire crystal's Brillouin zone and covering a wide range of frequencies ranging from sub-gigahertz to hundreds of terahertz. Magnons play a crucial role in many condensed matter phenomena, such as the reduction of saturation magnetization with increasing temperature or Bose-Einstein condensation. However, current experimental techniques cannot resolve magnons with wavevectors between 30 and 300$\,$rad$\,\mu$m$^{-1}$. In this letter, we address this gap by tailoring the light in Brillouin light scattering process with dielectric periodic nanoresonators and thus gaining access to the previously unmeasurable spin waves with full wavevector resolution using table-top optical setup. Filling this gap can stimulate further experimental investigations of the fundamental phenomena associated with magnons but also stimulate the application of magnonics in computational and microwave devices. In addition, the same methodology can be applied to other excitations of matter, such as phonons, opening up new possibilities in e.g. mechanobiological studies.</description>
