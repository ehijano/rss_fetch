      <title>Non-invertible defects from the Conway SCFT to K3 sigma models I: general results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of supersymmetry-preserving topological defect lines (TDLs) in the Conway moonshine module $V^{f \natural}$. We show that the tensor category of such defects, under suitable assumptions, admits a surjective but non-injective ring homomorphism into the ring of $\mathbb{Z}$-linear maps of the Leech lattice into itself. This puts strong constraints on possible defects and their quantum dimensions. We describe a simple construction of non-invertible TDLs from orbifolds of holomorphic (super)vertex operator algebras, which yields non-trivial examples of TDLs satisfying our main theorem. We conjecture a correspondence between four--plane--preserving TDLs in $V^{f\natural}$ and supersymmetry--preserving TDLs in K3 non-linear sigma models, which extends the correspondence between symmetry groups to the level of tensor category symmetry. We establish evidence for this conjecture by constructing non-invertible TDLs in special K3 non-linear sigma models.</description>

      <title>Studying replica wormholes and the Page curve with simplicial quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The replica paradigm has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating the black hole information paradox, offering a semiclassical route to reproducing the Page curve and suggesting unitary evolution for evaporating black holes. However, existing analyses have relied on simplified models such as JT gravity, and mostly remain limited to the $n \to 1^+$ limit in Euclidean signature. This work develops a framework based on Quantum Regge Calculus (QRC) that provides a lattice-like approach to address these gaps. A triangulation scheme is introduced that accommodates both gravitational and radiation degrees of freedom, enabling explicit evaluation of the fundamental components of the Regge gravity and radiation actions in a spherically symmetric setting. The formulation naturally incorporates analytic continuation techniques to probe the role of complex saddles in Lorentzian signature. A proof-of-principle implementation is carried out within a controlled minisuperspace reduction, revealing semiclassical saddles in the $n \to 1^+$ limit that recover the Page transition. While significant challenges remain (including the definition of the discrete configuration space, ambiguities in the gravitational measure, and the treatment of asymptotic boundaries), the framework developed here provides a promising foundation for further progress. The results suggest that sufficiently refined QRC calculations could extend the replica approach beyond existing models.</description>

      <title>Far from equilibrium hydrodynamics of nonthermal fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonthermal fixed points are paradigmatic far-from-equilibrium phenomena of relevance to high-energy physics, cosmology, and cold atomic gases. We propose that, despite their intrinsically nonequilibrium nature, nonthermal fixed points give rise to hydrodynamic excitations otherwise known in the vicinity of thermal equilibrium. As a result, nonthermal fixed points can also be characterized by transport coefficients, such as a far-from-equilibrium, and therefore manifestly time-dependent, incarnation of shear viscosity. We corroborate our proposal with explicit studies using relativistic kinetic theory with binary collisions of massless particles in the 14-moment approximation and comparisons to QCD kinetic theory simulations.</description>

      <title>Yang-Mills flows for multilayered graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We clarify the origin of magic angles in twisted multilayered graphene using Yang-Mills flows in two dimensions. We relate the effective Hamiltonian describing the electrons in the multilayered graphene to the ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operator on a two dimensional torus coupled to an $SU(N)$ gauge field. Despite the absence of a characteristic class such as $c_{1}$ relevant for the quantum Hall effect, we show that there are topological invariants associated with the zero modes occuring in a family of Hamiltonians. The flatbands in the spectrum of the effective Hamiltonian are associated with Yang-Mills connections, studied by M.~Atiyah and R.~Bott long time ago. The emergent $U(1)$ magnetic field with nonzero flux is presumably responsible for the observed Hall effect in the absence of (external) magnetic field. We provide a numeric algorithm transforming the original single-particle Hamiltonian to the direct sum of ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operators coupled to abelian gauge fields with non-zero $c_1$'s.</description>

      <title>Spectral form factor of quadratic $R$-para-particle SYK model with Random Matrix Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the spectral form factor (SFF) of the quadratic $R$-para-particle Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev ($R$-PSYK$_2$) model with various random matrix ensemble couplings. We generalize previous work on Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) couplings to all three Gaussian ensembles (GUE, GOE, GSE) and three circular ensembles (CUE, COE, CSE). Through analytical and numerical methods, we establish precise correspondences between GUE and CUE results, demonstrating their SFFs satisfy $\mathcal{K}_{\text{GUE}}(2t) \approx \mathcal{K}_{\text{CUE}}(t)$ in the time regime $1 \ll t \ll N$. For the symplectic ensembles, we observe similar behavior with appropriate time rescaling, while we only provide the calculation method for the orthogonal ensembles.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Renormalization as Riemann-Hilbert Decomposition of Schwinger-Dyson D-Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a non-perturbative formulation of renormalization by viewing the regularized Schwinger-Dyson hierarchy as a meromorphic connection, that is, as a D-module on the product of spacetime with the regulator disc. The irregular Riemann-Hilbert correspondence splits this connection into a purely formal submodule that contains every ultraviolet pole and a holomorphic submodule that is finite at the regulator origin. In this setting, counterterms coincide with the formal Stokes data, the renormalized theory is identified with the analytic submodule, and the Callan-Symanzik flow appears as an isomonodromic deformation in the physical scale. Viewed through this lens, the Connes-Kreimer construction with its graph Hopf algebra, Bogoliubov recursion, and Birkhoff factorisation is simply the perturbative shadow cast by the global geometric decomposition of the full Schwinger-Dyson system.</description>

      <title>A Perturbatively Stable Non-Supersymmetric String Model with AdS Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a construction of a perturbatively stable non-supersymmetric type II closed string model in four dimensions. It is based on a freely acting Scherk-Schwarz Z2-deformation of a supersymmetric construction which is recovered in appropriate decompactification limits. The model exhibits also the so-called misaligned supersymmetry with alternating signs for the number difference between bosons and fermions at successive mass levels. The tree-level spectrum is tachyon free for any value of the radii and moduli. At one loop level, the scalar potential has a non-supersymmetric minimum at the self-dual (free fermionic) point with negative energy, around which all tree-level massless scalars acquire positive masses. The model is thus non-supersymmetric and perturbatively stable.</description>

      <title>A topological quantum field theory for $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$-instantons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a topological quantum field theory based on the moduli space of $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$-instantons on 8-dimensional manifolds. Using the Mathai-Quillen formalism, we derive the action of the theory in purely geometric terms, which coincides with prior results in the literature. We then reformulate the theory within the AKSZ formalism, obtaining a Batalin-Vilkovisky action that, after gauge fixing, matches our Mathai-Quillen construction while making the BRST symmetry explicit and providing a natural framework for classical observables. We also show that the Batalin-Vilkovisky action can be elegantly recast as a Chern-Simons type theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elucidate the dynamics induced by a Wilson Line of charge $q$ and electron charge $e$ in $QED_4$ coupled to a real scalar via Yukawa interactions. We observe that there is a range of the fixed product $e^2 q$ with $e\rightarrow 0$ and $q\rightarrow \infty$ for which four-fermion operators play a dominant role for the dynamics of the theory. We uncover the fixed-point dynamics of the theory and analyze their critical behavior.</description>

      <title>Timelike entanglement entropy with gravitational anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the timelike entanglement entropy (TEE) in two dimensional conformal field theories (CFT) with gravitational anomalies. We employ analytical continuation to compute the timelike entanglement entropy for a pure timelike interval in such CFTs. We find that, unlike the real part, the imaginary part of the TEE displays an asymmetric dependence on the central charges of the left and right moving modes. We propose that the asymmetric dependence on central charges of the imaginary part of the TEE can be used to probe the presence of gravitational anomalies in chiral CFT. Furthermore, we propose a holographic construction to obtain the timelike entanglement entropy from the bulk dual geometries involving topologically massive gravity in AdS$_3$. The holographic results obtained matches exactly with the dual field theory results.</description>

      <title>Simplicity of Mellin amplitudes for AdS$_3 \times$S$^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectrum of half-BPS single-particle operators of the D1-D5 system in the supergravity regime is dual to the spectrum of Kaluza-Klein modes of tensor and graviton multiplets in AdS$_3\times$S$^3$. We present simple formulae for all four-point tree-level correlators of scalar half-BPS primary operators in the spectrum, and in particular, we bootstrap the four-point correlator of the graviton multiplet for all KK levels. A key insight of our approach is the use of generalized Mellin space, and a decomposition of the correlators into distinct subsectors each one characterized by different on-shell constraints among the Mellin variables. The resulting Mellin amplitudes involve a small set of building blocks with manifest properties under a six-dimensional symmetry.</description>

      <title>Holographic Consequences of Heterotic String Theory beyond its Supergravity Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the effects of stringy corrections on the low energy effective action derived from heterotic string theory beyond its supergravity approximation. Compactifying the ten dimensional theory with these stringy corrections produces an effective action for a scalar field whose higher derivative term is governed by a single coefficient that depends on the internal volume, average curvature, and flux of the compactification manifold. The higher derivative coupling imported from compactification shifts the Breitenlohner Freedman stability bound by an amount set by the relative strengths of internal flux and curvature, relaxing it in flux dominated vacua and tightening it in curvature dominated ones. Furthermore, we analyze how the stringy corrections shift the scaling dimensions of the dual operators, track the resulting renormalization group flow, and investigate the higher derivative term using a holographic Lee Wick regulator. In holographic superconductors, stringy corrections lower the effective bulk mass and raise the critical temperature when flux dominates, but have the opposite effect when curvature dominates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the building blocks of open and closed string amplitudes on $AdS$. These are given by two infinite towers of world-sheet integrals generalising the Euler and complex beta functions respectively. We show that the open and closed building blocks are related by an $AdS$ version of the KLT relations, whose Kernel can be computed exactly. We furthermore show that the building blocks for open string amplitudes are given by Aomoto-Gelfand hypergeometric functions, and give their closed form expression up to weight four.</description>

      <title>Implications of Complexity Factor on Evolution of New Dynamical and Static Wormholes in $f(R, T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents new spherically symmetric and dynamical wormhole solutions supported by ordinary matter modeled as an anisotropic fluid, exhibiting a traversable nature. To achieve this goal, we adopt different approaches to obtain both evolving static and genuinely dynamical solutions, such as imposing a viable condition on the Ricci scalar, considering an anisotropic equation of state, and choosing a suitable energy density profile. For each derived shape function, we analyze the corresponding $2D$ and $3D$ embedding diagrams and verify their compatibility with the weak energy condition through density plots. The equilibrium conditions are also explored graphically to assess the stability of the obtained solutions, which are shown to be stable within the analyzed framework. Additionally, we investigate the complexity factor associated with each configuration, examining its dependence on both temporal evolution and the coupling parameter $\lambda$ of the $f(R,T)$ theory.</description>

      <title>Holographic analysis of near-conformal dynamics and light dilaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry out a detailed analysis of the region slightly outside the conformal window of a non-trivial infrared fixed point in a generic bottom-up holographic setup. We focus on models, which study the dynamics of a scalar field, dual to quark degrees of freedom, in a (nearly) AdS geometry. Such models realize the picture expected for vector-like near-conformal theories from Dyson-Schwinger analysis. The analysis covers a toy model, which allows for analytic solutions, and a more general setup as well, which encompass a complete model for the ultraviolet physics. We analyze the conditions for the appearance of a parametrically light scalar state in the spectrum, which can act as a candidate for the Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson arising from breaking of the approximate conformal symmetry. We also present detailed results for the vacuum structure, correlators, and Ward identities in the near-conformal regime.</description>

      <title>Waveform models for the gravitational-wave memory effect: II. Time-domain and frequency-domain models for nonspinning binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear gravitational-wave (GW) memory effect$\unicode{x2014}$a permanent shift in the GW strain that arises from nonlinear GW interactions in the wave zone$\unicode{x2014}$is a prediction of general relativity which has not yet been observed. The amplitude of the GW memory effect from binary-black-hole (BBH) mergers is small compared to that of primary (oscillatory) GWs and is unlikely to be detected by current ground-based detectors. Evidence for its presence in the population of all the BBH mergers is more likely, once thousands of detections are made by these detectors. Having an accurate and computationally efficient waveform model of the memory signal will assist detecting the memory effect with current data-analysis pipelines. In this paper, we build on our prior work to develop analytical time-domain and frequency-domain models for the dominant nonlinear memory multipole signal ($l=2$, $m=0$) from nonspinning BBH mergers in quasicircular orbits. The model is calibrated for mass ratios between one and eight. There are three parts to the time-domain signal model: a post-Newtonian inspiral, a quasinormal-mode-based ringdown, and a phenomenological signal during the late inspiral and merger (which interpolates between the inspiral and ringdown). The time-domain model also has an analytical Fourier transform, which we compute in this paper. We assess the accuracy of our model using the mismatch between our waveform model and the memory signal computed from the oscillatory modes of a numerical-relativity surrogate model. We use the advanced LIGO sensitivity curve from the fourth observing run and find that the mismatch increases with the total mass of the system and is of order $10^{-2}\unicode{x2013}10^{-4}$.</description>

      <title>On Ising model in magnetic field on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conjecture an approximate expression for the free energy in the thermodynamic limit of the classical square lattice Ising model in a uniform (real) magnetic field. The zero-field result is well known due to Onsager for more than eighty years, but no such result exists for a nonzero magnetic field on a regular lattice. We verify our conjecture using numerical tensor renormalization group (TRG) methods and find good agreement with a maximum deviation of $\sim2\%$ from the numerical results for the free energy across all $\beta$ and real magnetic field, $h$.</description>

      <title>Superradiant dark matter production from primordial black holes: Impact of multiple modes and gravitational wave emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotating primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe can emit particles through superradiance, a process particularly efficient when the particle's Compton wavelength is comparable to the PBH's gravitational radius. Superradiance leads to an exponential growth of particle occupation numbers in gravitationally bound states. We present an analysis of heavy bosonic dark matter (DM) production through three gravitational mechanisms: Hawking radiation, superradiant instabilities, and ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in. We consider PBHs that evaporate before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). For both scalar and vector DM, our analysis incorporates the evolution of a second superradiant mode. We demonstrate that the growth of a second superradiant mode causes the decay of the first mode, and thus the second mode cannot further enhance the DM abundance beyond that already achieved by the first mode. Our study also reveals that while superradiance generally enhances DM production, gravitational wave (GW) emission from the superradiant cloud may significantly modify this picture. For scalar DM, GW emission reduces the parameter space where superradiance effectively augments relic abundance. For vector DM, rapid GW emission from the superradiant cloud may yield relic abundances below those achieved through Hawking radiation alone. These findings demonstrate that multiple-mode effect and GW emission play critical roles in modeling DM production from PBHs in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Propagation of UHE cosmic rays in the light of f(R) gravity power-law model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the origins of ultra-high energy (UHE) cosmic rays (CRs) remain shrouded in uncertainty, several important milestones have been reached in recent years in the experimental study of CRs with energy above 1018 eV. Within the vast expanse of intergalactic space, turbulent magnetic fields (TMFs) are believed to pervade, and these fields could exert a significant influence on the journey of UHECRs across the expanding Universe, which is currently undergoing acceleration. Thus, it is imperative to incorporate these considerations into our theoretical framework to gain a deeper understanding of the empirical observations related to UHECRs. In light of this, our research delves into the impact of UHE particle diffusion in the presence of TMFs, all within the context of the f(R) gravity power-law model. Based on this f(R) model, we explore the diffusive behavior of UHECR protons, particularly focusing on their density enhancement throughout their propagation and their energy spectrum. We found that the f(R) gravity model considered here plays an effective role in the propagation of CRs and the results have lain within our range of interest. Also, we compare our results for flux with observational data like the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) and Telescope Array (TA).</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory of Chiral Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a (non-)Abelian gauge field acquires an isotropic background configuration during inflation, strong gravitational waves (GWs) with parity-violating polarization, known as chiral GWs, can be produced in addition to the intrinsic unpolarized GWs. However, previous studies have analyzed individual models, leaving the generality of this phenomenon unclear. To perform a model-independent analysis, we construct an effective field theory (EFT) of chiral GWs by extending the EFT of inflation and incorporating gauge fields. The resulting action unifies inflationary models with a $SU(2)$ gauge field, such as chromo-natural inflation and gauge-flation, and ones with a triplet of $U(1)$ gauge fields, systematically encompassing all possible GW production mechanisms consistent with the symmetry breaking induced by the gauge field background. We find that chiral GWs are generically and inevitably produced, provided that the effective energy density of the background gauge field is positive and the gauge kinetic function is not fine-tuned to a specific time dependence. This EFT offers a useful foundation for future phenomenological studies as well as for deepening our theoretical understanding of chiral GWs.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic vacua from linear complex structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic vacua play a central role in quantum fields in cosmological spacetimes, where they serve as distinguished initial conditions and as reference states for the renormalization of observables. In this paper we introduce new methods based on linear complex structures which provide a powerful tool for determining adiabatic vacua. The new methods generalize both the standard WKB appoach and the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariants, and allow us to study the problem of many coupled bosonic degrees of freedom with general quadratic time-dependent Hamiltonian. We show that the adiabatic number operator and the adiabatic vacuum of finite order can be expressed in terms of the adiabatic complex structure of the same order. We compare our results to standard techniques which apply only to a single degree of freedom, and comment on its applicability to problems in quantum fields in cosmological spacetimes, many-body systems and quantum thermodynamics, where the Hamiltonian is time dependent with slowly-changing parameters.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry for brane diagrams and bow varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide combinatorial and numerical criteria to characterize affine type A bow diagrams giving rise to a non-empty bow variety. The key idea is to prove that such diagrams correspond to supersymmetric brane systems in type IIB string theory, allowing us to reformulate the problem in purely combinatorial terms. To achieve this, we characterize supersymmetry for affine type A brane systems (and, by extension, for types B, C, and D) using Hanany--Witten transitions. This leads to a finite-step algorithm that decides whether a given affine type A bow or brane diagram is supersymmetric, which consists in checking a finite set of inequalities, so providing a numerical criterion for non-emptiness. Finally, we provide a different perspective by introducing a further criterion in terms of weights of affine Lie algebras. Along the way, we also prove that increasing dimension vectors between two consecutive x-points or arrows in a bow diagram (not necessarily of type A) preserves the properties of generating non-empty bow varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is devoted to examining particle dynamics and thermodynamic behavior of a black hole in the framework of Kalb-Ramond gravity, framing the investigation through the lens of the optical-mechanical analogy. Within this context, we derive a generalized modified dispersion relation, which inherently depends on the underlying spacetime geometry through its metric components. The analysis begins by exploring some physical quantities influenced by the geometry, including the effective index of refraction, the group velocity, and the time delay experienced by particle modes. We then investigate the interparticle potential, considering both massive and massless cases. The thermodynamic properties of the system are subsequently addressed using ensemble theory. In this treatment, we compute the pressure, internal energy, entropy, and heat capacity across three distinct regions: in the immediate vicinity of the event horizon, at the photon sphere, and in the asymptotic region. Notably, all calculations presented throughout this paper admit closed-form analytical solutions.</description>

      <title>The influence of majorons on neutrino oscillations in the presence of a magnetic field and matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino spin-flavour oscillations in the magnetic field, matter, and majoron fields are studied. The effective Lagrangian of Majorana neutrino interaction with a majoron field mediated by heavy neutrino is calculated. It is shown that the presence of a majoron field with a high energy density significantly shifts the resonances in neutrino oscillations, or even induces new resonances. The influence of the majoron suppresses oscillations for neutrino energies below 10 MeV. Additionally, the dependence of the oscillations probabilities on the Dirac and Majorana CP-violating phases becomes weaker under the influence of a dense majoron field. These findings can be applied to experiments that study neutrinos from supernovae, such as JUNO, DUNE, and the upcoming Hyper-Kamiokande experiment.</description>

      <title>Black hole absorption cross sections: Spin and Regge poles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the absorption of massless scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational fields propagating in the Schwarzschild black hole geometry. Using complex angular momentum techniques, we first derive a representation of the absorption cross section that separates it into smooth background integrals and a discrete Regge pole series. This decomposition reveals the physical mechanisms underlying black hole absorption, including classical capture, surface wave interference near the photon sphere, and subleading background effects. We then construct a refined high-frequency analytical approximation that captures both the dominant oscillations and the fine structure of the absorption spectra for scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational fields, incorporating spin-dependent phase corrections and higher-order effects. In addition, we provide a simplified expression that generalizes the sinc approximation to describe the leading oscillations for electromagnetic and gravitational fields. Our analysis offers a unified semiclassical interpretation of black hole absorption, combining geometric optics, surface wave dynamics, and resonant phenomena encoded by the Regge pole structure.</description>

Abstract: We examine the two-party perfect quantum teleportation of an unknown 1-qubit state in the case of sharing various 3-qubit entangled states between a sender and a receiver: GHZ state, W state and W-like state. We give an impossibility proof that the W state cannot be used as the sharing state to realize the perfect quantum teleportation for transmitting an arbitrary 1-qubit state, in sharp contrast with the GHZ state which is well known to realize the perfect quantum transportation. Moreover, we give a procedure of obtaining a modified entangled state which we call the W-like state to achieve the perfect quantum transportation under a prescribed measurement basis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the number of lattice points in the boundary of a positive integer dilate of a Delzant integral polytope is a polynomial in the dilation parameter, analogous to the Ehrhart polynomial giving the number of lattice points in a lattice polytope. We give an explicit formula for this polynomial, analogous to the formulas of Khovanskii-Pukhlikov for the Ehrhart polynomial. These counting polynomials satisfy a lacunarity principle, the vanishing of alternate coefficients, quite unlike the Ehrhart polynomial. We show that formal geometric quantization of singular Calabi Yau hypersurfaces in smooth toric varieties gives this polynomial, in analogy with the relation of the Khovanskii-Pukhlikov formula to the geometric quantization of toric varieties. The Atiyah-Singer theorem for the index of the Dirac operator gives a moral argument for the lacunarity of the counting polynomial. We conjecture that similar formulas should hold for arbitrary simple integral polytope boundaries.</description>

Abstract: We study cosmic strings in the complex symmetron model, a scalar-tensor theory with a spontaneously broken local $U(1)$ symmetry in low matter density regions. Using numerical simulations, we show that these strings preferentially attach to matter halos, leading to the stabilization of string loops. While the requirement for screening of fifth-force interactions in the solar system limits observable signatures in theories with universal coupling to matter, analogous topological defects in the dark sector may still influence cosmic structure formation, offering a novel avenue to constrain dark-sector interactions.</description>

Abstract: We describe asymptotic symmetries at spatial infinity of asymptotically flat spacetimes within the context of a generalization of the Beig-Schmidt-Ashtekar-Romano-framework. We demonstrate that it is possible to relax certain smoothness requirements of the asymptotic transformations considered previously, without violating asymptotic flatness. This leads to an enhancement of the asymptotic symmetry group that includes logarithmic supertranslations at spatial infinity. Our results complement several recent results which confirm the existence of logarithmic supertranslations at spatial infinity in the Hamiltonian formalism.</description>

Abstract: We have studied the quantum gravity signatures that emerge in a gravitational wave detector placed inside a harmonic potential trap, where the quantum state of the graviton is either coherent, squeezed, or squeezed coherent. We compared the transition probabilities of the detector in scenarios where the gravitational wave is quantized versus when it is treated classically. Assuming the gravitational wave propagates in one direction and has only one type of polarization, we found that for graviton states such as coherent, squeezed, and squeezed coherent states, quantum gravity signatures can emerge in events that would not be possible when the graviton state is a quantum state with $n_G$ particles $(\ket{n_G})$, such as graviton annihilation and the increasing energy level of the detector by two levels in final state.</description>

The phases (and accompanying CFTs) we consider come in two types - bosonic phases that are defined on unorientable manifolds and fermionic phases that are sensitive to a $\text{Pin}^-$ structure. In both cases, our analysis leads to eight phase diagrams, with the two sets of eight connected by fermionization/bosonization. Starting from a seed CFT, we obtain the CFT that governs each transition. Many of these exhibit symmetry enriched criticality. In addition to showing many symmetry enriched CFTs in their natural habitats, our work discusses the fermionic analogs of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ bosonic operations, which we have not seen discussed in the literature.</description>

      <title>How Charged Can Neutrinos Be?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how neutrinos may acquire small electric charges within the Standard Model framework while preserving electromagnetic gauge invariance. Instead of gauging the standard hypercharge generator $Y$, a linear combination of $Y$ and a new generator $X$ from a gaugable global $U(1)_X$ symmetry is embedded, under which neutrinos transform non-trivially. We demonstrate that minimal scenarios based on flavor-dependent $U(1)_X$ symmetries, such as $X = L_\alpha - L_\beta$, are incompatible with current neutrino oscillation data. In contrast, we have shown that only flavor-universal $U(1)_X$ symmetries-such as $U(1)_{B-L}$, which shifts both quark and lepton charges, and $U(1)_L$, which modifies only the lepton sector-can generate tiny neutrino charges consistent with observed masses and mixing. We also discuss the necessary connection between such charges and the Dirac nature of neutrinos. By analyzing the phenomenological implications in detail, our findings emphasize that constraints on neutrino charges should be evaluated within the specific framework of the $U(1)_X$ symmetry under consideration, rather than assuming a generic approach, as is often the case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that the quantum states of black hole responsible for the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy are given by a thin shell of Bell particles located at the region just underneath the horizon. We argue that the configuration can be stabilized by a new kind of degeneracy pressure which is suggested by a noncommutative geometry in the interior of the black hole. Black hole singularity is avoided. We utilize the work of Parikh and Wilczek \cite{Parikh:1999mf} to include the effect of tunneling on the Bell particles. We show that partially tunneled Bell particles give the Page curve of Hawking radiation, and the entirety of information initially stored in the black hole is returned to the outside via the Hawking radiation. In view of entropic force, the location of these Bell states is naturally related to the island and the quantum extremal surface.</description>

      <title>Conformal integrals in all dimensions as GKZ hypergeometric functions and Clifford groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17326v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Euclidean conformal integrals for an arbitrary number of points in any dimension are evaluated. Conformal transformations in the Euclidean space can be formulated as the Moebius group in terms of Clifford algebras. This is used to interpret conformal integrals as functions on the configuration space of points on the Euclidean space, solving linear differential equations, which, in turn, is related to toric GKZ systems. Explicit series solutions for the conformal integrals are obtained using toric methods as GKZ hypergeometric functions. The solutions are made symmetric under the action of permutation of the points, as expected of quantities on the configuration space of unordered points, using the monodromy-invariant unique Hermitian form. Consistency of the solutions among different number of points is shown.</description>

      <title>Line defect correlators in fermionic CFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalar-fermion models, such as the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model, admit natural $1d$ defects given by the exponential of a scalar field integrated along a straight line. In $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions the defect coupling is weakly relevant and the setup defines a non-trivial interacting defect CFT. In this work we study correlation functions on these defect CFTs to order $\varepsilon$. We focus on $1d$ correlators constrained to the line, which include canonical operators like the displacement and the one-dimensional analog of the spin field. These results give access to perturbative CFT data that can be used as input in the numerical bootstrap. We also consider local operators outside the line, in particular two-point functions of scalars whose dynamics are non-trivial due to the presence of the defect.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian statistics of de Sitter spectators: A perturbative derivation of stochastic dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalar fields interacting with the primordial curvature perturbation during inflation may communicate their statistics to the latter. This situation motivates the study of how the probability density function (PDF) of a light spectator field $\varphi$ in a pure de Sitter space-time, becomes non-Gaussian under the influence of a scalar potential ${\mathcal V(\varphi)}$. One approach to this problem is offered by the stochastic formalism introduced by Starobinsky and Yokoyama. It results in a Fokker-Planck equation for the time-dependent PDF $\rho (\varphi , t)$ describing the statistics of $\varphi$ which, in the limit of equilibrium gives one back the solution $\rho (\varphi) \propto \exp \big[ - \frac{8 \pi^2}{3 H^4} {\mathcal V(\varphi)} \big]$. We study the derivation of $\rho (\varphi , t)$ using quantum field theory tools. Our approach yields an almost Gaussian distribution function, distorted by minor corrections comprised of terms proportional to powers of $\Delta N \times \mathcal O(\partial_\varphi) {\mathcal V(\varphi)}$, where $\Delta N$ is the number of $e$-folds succeeding the Hubble-horizon crossing of $\varphi$'s wavelengths, and $\mathcal O(\partial_\varphi)$ stands for a derivative operator acting on ${\mathcal V(\varphi)}$. This general form is obtained perturbatively and remains valid even with loop corrections. Our solution satisfies a Fokker-Planck equation that receives corrections with respect to the one found within the stochastic approach, allowing us to comment on the validity of the standard equilibrium solution for generic potentials. We posit that higher order corrections to the Fokker-Planck equation may become important towards the equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate spin-refined partition functions in AdS/CFT using Euclidean gravitational path integrals. We construct phase diagrams for $Z_X = \text{Tr} \big( e^{-\beta H} X \big)$ in various dimensions and for different choices of discrete isometry $X$, discovering rich structures at finite temperature. When $X$ is a reflection, $Z_X$ counts the difference between the number of even- and odd-spin microstates. The high-temperature regime is universally dominated by $\mathcal{CRT}$-twisted black holes in any dimension, and in odd spacetime dimensions we examine whether complex rotating black hole solutions can contribute to spin-refined observables or potentially dominate at finite temperature. We also analyze the microcanonical ensemble. There the leading contribution almost always comes from rotating black holes, showing that the two ensembles are not necessarily equivalent.</description>

      <title>Correlators of long strings on AdS$_3\times$S$^3\times$T$^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16712v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we calculate correlators of long strings on AdS$_3\times$S$^3\times$T$^4$ with pure NS-NS flux. We first construct physical vertex operators that correspond to long strings. Due to the GSO projection, they depend on the parity of the spectral flow parameter $w$. For a given $w$, we construct the physical operators that have the lowest space-time weights in both the NS and R sector. Then, we calculate three point correlators for each possible type of parities of spectral flows. We find that the recursion relations of correlators in the bosonic SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$ WZW model can be understood from the equivalence of these superstring correlators with different picture choices. Furthermore, after carefully mapping the vertex operators to appropriate operators in the dual CFT, we find that once the fermionic contributions together with the picture changing effects are correctly taken into account, some mathematical identities of covering maps lead to the matching of the correlators of the two sides. We check this explicitly at the leading order in the conformal perturbation computation and conjecture that this remains correct to all orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the Movshev-Mason-Skinner Cauchy-Riemann (CR) ambitwistor approach, we provide a rigorous yet elementary construction of a twisted CR holomorphic Chern-Simons action on CR ambitwistor space for maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on four-dimensional Euclidean space. The key ingredient in our discussion is the homotopy algebraic perspective on perturbative quantum field theory. Using this technology, we show that both theories are semi-classically equivalent, that is, we construct a quasi-isomorphism between the cyclic $L_\infty$-algebras governing both field theories. This confirms a conjecture from the literature. Furthermore, we also show that the Yang-Mills action is obtained by integrating out an infinite tower of auxiliary fields in the Chern-Simons action, that is, the two theories are related by homotopy transfer. Given its simplicity, this Chern-Simons action should form a fruitful starting point for analysing perturbative properties of Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Higher Spin Symmetries I: Covariant Wedge Algebra in Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study gravitational symmetry algebras that live on 2-dimensional cuts $S$ of asymptotic infinity. We define a notion of wedge algebra $\mathcal{W}(S)$ which depends on the topology of $S$. For the cylinder $S=\mathbb{C}^*$ we recover the celebrated $Lw_{1+\infty}$ algebra. For the 2-sphere $S^2$, the wedge algebra reduces to a central extension of the anti-self-dual projection of the Poincar\'e algebra. We then extend $\mathcal{W}(S)$ outside of the wedge space and build a new Lie algebra $\mathcal{W}_\sigma(S)$, which can be viewed as a deformation of the wedge algebra by a spin two field $\sigma$ playing the role of the shear at a cut of $\mathscr{I}$. This algebra represents the gravitational symmetry algebra in the presence of a non trivial shear and is characterized by a covariantized version of the wedge condition. Finally, we construct a dressing map that provides a Lie algebra isomorphism between the covariant and regular wedge algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A systematic construction for supersymmetric negative graded (non-local) flows for mKdV and KdV based on $sl(2,1)$ with a principal gradation is proposed in this paper. We show that smKdV and sKdV can be mapped onto each other through a gauge super Miura transformation, together with an additional condition for the negative flows, which ensure the supersymmetry of the negative sKdV flow. In addition, we classify both smKdV and sKdV flows with respect to the vacuum (boundary) solutions. These are classified according to zero or non-zero vacuum. Each vacuum solution is used to derive both soliton solutions and the corresponding Heisenberg subalgebra for the smKdV hierarchy. We present the new solutions corresponding to non-zero bosonic and fermionic vacuum by constructing the deformed vertex operators. Finally, the gauge Miura transformation is employed to obtain the sKdV solutions, which exhibit a rich degeneracy due to both multiple gauge super Miura transformations and multiple vacuum possibilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for the conjectured QCD critical point in heavy-ion collisions requires to account for far-from equilibrium effects as well as fluctuations, and in particular non-Gaussian fluctuations, in the modeling of the dynamics of the hot and dense matter created in such collisions. In order to study far-from equilibrium effects as well as fluctuations, in this work we construct a Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory (EFT) for the diffusion of the density to all orders in derivatives. The dissipation in the free part of our EFT follows the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation-time approximation (RTA). The interaction part of the EFT is constructed based on the self-interaction of the density field. We analytically find the quadratic and cubic parts of the KMS-invariant EFT in closed form, resummed in derivatives. We then explicitly compute the symmetrized three-point function at tree level, and investigate its analytical structure in detail. We also analytically calculate the branch-point singularity that appears in the structure of the two-point response function due to loop effects. Our results are important for future studies of the real-time dynamics of the correlation functions and the possible relation to thermalization when the system is far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Consistency of EFT illuminated via relative entropy: A case study in scalar field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21062v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relative entropy is a non-negative quantity and offers a powerful means of achieving a unified understanding of fundamental properties in physics, including the second law of thermodynamics and positivity bounds on effective field theories (EFTs). We analyze the relative entropy in scalar field theories and show that the non-negativity of relative entropy is potentially violated in perturbative calculations based on operator and loop expansions. Conversely, this suggests that the consistency of the EFT description in the scalar field theory can be identified by the sign of the relative entropy. In fact, we revisit an EFT of single-field inflation and present a relation between its non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the consistency condition of the EFT description derived from the relative entropy method. We find that interesting regions of $f_{\rm NL}$ that are observationally allowed can be constrained from the relative entropy by imposing the consistency of the EFT description when the EFT is generated via the interaction with heavy fields in UV theories.</description>

      <title>A rich structure of renormalization group flows for Higgs-like models in 4 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider $2$ coupled Higgs doublets which transform in the usual way under SU(2)$\otimes$U(1). By constructing marginal operators which satisfy an operator product expansion based on the SU(2) Lie algebra, we can obtain a rich pattern of renormalization group (RG) flows which includes lines of fixed points and more interestingly, cyclic RG flows which are unavoidable in this model. The hamiltonian is pseudo-hermitian, $H^\dagger = {\cal K} H {\cal K}^\dagger $ with ${\cal K}$ unitary satisfying ${\cal K}^2 =1$, thus the model is non-unitary. The hamiltonian still has real eigenvalues, but the non-unitarity is manifested in negative norm states. One can use the operator ${\cal K}$ to define projection operators onto positive norm states, and in this sub-Hilbert space the time evolution is unitary with positive probabilities. Upon spontaneous symmetry breaking, the Higgs fields have an infinite number of vacuum expectation values $v_n$ which satisfy ``Russian Doll" scaling $v_n \sim e^{2 n \lambda}$ where $n=1,2,3,\ldots$ and $\lambda$ is the period of one RG cycle which is an RG invariant. We speculate that this Russian Doll RG flow can perhaps resolve the so-called hierarchy problem and may shed light on the origin of ``families" in the Standard Model of particle physics</description>

      <title>Chaos and moduli space volumes in unorientable JT gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the late time, or $\tau-$scaled, limit of the canonical spectral form factor (SFF) in unorientable JT gravity agrees with universal random matrix theory (RMT) up to genus one in the topological expansion, establishing a key signature of quantum chaos for the time-reversal symmetric case. The loop equations for an orthogonal matrix model with spectral curve $y(z) \propto \sin(2\pi z)$ are used to compute the moduli space volumes of unorientable surfaces. The divergences of the unorientable volumes are regularized by first regularizing the resolvents of the orthogonal matrix model. To this end, we make use of the large $p$ limit of the $(2,2p+1)$ minimal string model. Using properties of the volumes and the loop equations, we derive streamlined formulas to compute the volumes for one and two boundaries, giving explicit results up to genus one. We find the general structure of the unorientable volumes to be written in terms of multiple polylogarithms and zeta values, with weight determined by the genus, number of boundaries, and number of crosscaps. In the $\tau-$scaled limit, contributions to the SFF from the divergent parts of the volume cancel, and the SFF becomes finite and independent of regularization. The SFF from universal RMT is a distinct computation, that depends on the leading order energy density of JT gravity, which we also derive up to genus one.</description>

      <title>One-loop integrability with shifting masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the perturbative integrability of two-dimensional massive quantum field theories with polynomial-like interactions and show that any theory of such class which is purely elastic at the tree level is also purely elastic at one loop. To preserve the elasticity, the physical renormalized masses of the theory must differ from the classical ones by quantum corrections carried by one-loop bubble diagrams. After the masses are corrected in this manner we show that one-loop inelastic processes vanish and integrability is preserved under one-loop effects. Relying on this fact we show that the closed expression for one-loop S-matrices in terms of tree S-matrices obtained in arXiv:2402.12087 extends to models that do not preserve the mass ratios at one loop. We test our results on the full class of nonsimply-laced affine Toda theories and find exact match with the S-matrices bootstrapped in the past.</description>

      <title>Index and localization for type B superconformal mechanics on singular spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04390v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type B superconformal quantum mechanical sigma models are of physical interest as they arise in the description of D-brane bound states forming an AdS$_2$ throat. In this work we discuss the applicability of localization methods to compute the superconformal index in these theories, despite the fact that their target spaces are generically singular. Similar in spirit to recent works on type A models, we propose to work on a suitably resolved target space to compute a regularized index. While this regularized index correctly captures the actual index unambiguously in models of physical interest, we do uncover a subtlety in more pathological examples. This occurs in situations where the supercharge is not essentially-selfadjoint, in which case the index becomes ambiguous and depends on the chosen selfadjoint extension. We also discuss the special class of models with K\"ahler target spaces, which can accommodate both type A and type B models, and show that the type B index is a particular limit of the type A index. For Calabi-Yau cones, the type B index coincides with the Hilbert series of the unresolved space.</description>

      <title>Coupled minimal models revisited II: Constraints from permutation symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21107v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupling $N$ large $m$ minimal models and flowing to IR fixed points is a systematic way to build new classes of compact unitary 2d CFTs which are likely to be irrational, and potentially have a positive Virasoro twist gap above the vaccuum. In this paper, we build on the construction of [1], establishing that, for spins less than 10, additional currents transforming in non-trivial irreducible representations of the permutation symmetry $S_N$ are not conserved at the IR fixed points. Along the way, we develop a finer understanding of the spectrum of these theories, of the special properties of the $N=4$ case and of non-invertible symmetries that constrain them. We also discuss variations of the original setup of [1] some of which can exist for smaller values of the UV central charge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We follow up on our proposal for dressing factors for the mixed-flux $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ background presented in arXiv:2402.11732. We discuss in detail the analytic properties of the dressing factors in the string and mirror kinematics for fundamental massive particles and bound states. We prove that the dressing factors are unitary and CP-invariant in the string kinematics, parity invariant in the mirror, and solve the crossing equations in both kinematics. In the limit of pure Ramond-Ramond flux they reduce to the known ones. Finally, we present their expansion at strong tension, as well as in the (small-RR-flux) relativistic limit, finding agreement with the literature.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Higher Spin Symmetries III: Noether Realization in Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a non-perturbative action of the higher spin symmetry algebra on the asymptotic Yang-Mills phase space. We introduce a symmetry algebroid which admits a realization on the asymptotic phase space generated by a Noether charge defined non-perturbatively for all spins. This Noether charge is naturally conserved in the absence of radiation. Furthermore, the algebroid can be restricted to the covariant wedge symmetry algebra, which we analyze for non radiative cuts. The key ingredient in this construction is to consider field and time dependent symmetry parameters constrained to evolve according to equations of motion dual to (a truncation of) the asymptotic Yang-Mills equations of motion. This result then guarantees that the underlying symmetry algebra is represented canonically as well.</description>

      <title>Single versus multifield scalar potentials from string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the properties of string effective theories with scalar field(s) and a scalar potential. We first claim that in most examples known, such theories are multifield, with at least 2 non-compact field directions; the few counter-examples appear to be very specific and isolated. Such a systematic multifield situation has important implications for cosmology. Characterising properties of the scalar potential $V$ is also more delicate in a multifield setting. We provide several examples of string effective theories with $V&gt;0$, where the latter admits an asymptotically flat direction along an off-shell field trajectory: in other words, there exists a limit $\varphi \rightarrow \infty$ for which $\frac{|\partial_{\varphi} V|}{V} \rightarrow 0$. It is thus meaningless to look for a lower bound to this single field quantity in a multifield setting; the complete gradient $\nabla V$ is then better suited. Restricting to on-shell trajectories, this question remains open, especially when following the steepest descent or more generally a gradient flow evolution. Interestingly, single field statements in multifield theories seem less problematic for $V&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Weyl Superconductors with Different Pairings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and its symmetries for a time-reversal symmetry broken three dimensional Weyl superconductor. In the limit of vanishing pairing potential, we specify that this Hamiltonian is invariant under two sets of continues symmetries, i.e. the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry and the $U(1)_A$ axial symmetry. Although a pairing of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer type spontaneously breaks both of these symmetries, we show that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov type pairing spontaneously breaks only the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry (that is then restored via the well-known scalar phase mode of superconductivity). Consequently, in the former case, two Nambu-Goldstone modes are required in the system to restore the broken symmetries. We indicate that one of these two modes is an emergent pseudo-scalar phase mode. We also demonstrate that such a phase mode leads to a pseudo-Meissner effect.</description>

      <title>Discrete Bulk Spectrum in Jackiw-Teitelboim Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that the discrete bulk spectrum appears naturally in the Lorentzian description of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity if an extra confining potential is introduced in the region where the renormalized geodesic length becomes of order $e^{S_0}$. The existence of such an extra confining potential may be inferred from the late behavior of complexity and also from the Saad-Shenker-Stanford (SSS) duality between JT gravity and the matrix model. We derive the explicit form of the extra confining potential from the well-established density of states obtained in the Euclidean approach to JT gravity. This extra potential is implicitly determined by the solution of the Abel's integral equation which turns out to be identical to the string equation of the matrix model in the SSS duality formulation of JT gravity. Thanks to the extra confining potential and the random nature of the spectrum, the time evolution of the Krylov complexity, which is identified with the renormalized geodesic length, naturally exhibits four phases, namely a ramp, a peak, a slope, and a plateau.</description>

      <title>Code construction and ensemble holography of simply-laced WZW models at level 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a code construction for Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models associated with simply-laced affine Lie algebras at level 1. The chiral primary fields of these rational CFTs can be parametrized by the elements of the outer automorphism group of the affine algebra, which is isomorphic to the discriminant group $G$ of the root lattice. We show that the classification of even, self-dual codes over the alphabet $G$ is equivalent to the classification of modular-invariant CFTs. Each individual CFT is dual to a Chern-Simons theory, after gauging the maximal, non-anomalous subgroup of its $1$-form symmetry group specified by the code. We calculate the ensemble average of these CFTs, which is holographically dual to ``CS gravity"-- where the bulk theory is summed over topologies. When the alphabet $G$ consists only of elements of square-free order, we explicitly show that this ensemble average reproduces the Poincar\'e series of the vacuum character, which can be interpreted as the CS path-integral summed only over handlebody topologies. However, when $G$ contains elements of non-square-free order, additional contributions from singular topologies arise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism, we show the existence of (i) a couple of off-shell nilpotent (i.e. fermionic) BRST and co-BRST symmetry transformations, and (ii) a full set of non-nilpotent (i.e. bosonic) symmetry transformations for an appropriate Lagrangian density that describes the combined system of the free Abelian 3-form and 1-form gauge theories in the physical four (3 + 1)-dimensions of the flat Minkowskian spacetime. We concentrate on the full algebraic structures of the above continuous symmetry transformation operators along with a couple of very useful discrete duality symmetry transformation operators existing in our four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) field-theoretic model. We establish the relevance of the algebraic structures, respected by the above discrete and continuous symmetry operators, to the algebraic structures that are obeyed by the de Rham cohomological operators of differential geometry. One of the highlights of our present endeavor is the observation that there are no ``exotic'' fields with the negative kinetic terms in our present 4D field-theoretic example for Hodge theory.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the $q=2$ SYK model with $R$-para-particles ($R$-PSYK$_2$), analyzing its thermodynamics and spectral form factor (SFF) using random matrix theory. The Hamiltonian is quadratic, with coupling coefficients randomly drawn from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). The model displays self-averaging behavior and exhibits an exponential ramp in its SFF dynamics: $\mathcal{K}(t) \sim e^{C_0 t}$. The growth rate $C_0$ tends toward either constants or infinity in the $N\to \infty$ limit, depending on specific statistics of the model. These results provide novel perspectives on quantum systems with unconventional statistics.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Lie-Poisson algebra and Lie algebra solutions of mass-deformed type IIB matrix model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24060v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantization of Lie-Poisson algebras is studied. Classical solutions of the mass-deformed IKKT matrix model can be constructed from semisimple Lie algebras whose dimension matches the number of matrices in the model. We consider the geometry described by the classical solutions of the Lie algebras in the limit where the mass vanishes and the matrix size tends to infinity. Lie-Poisson varieties are regarded as such geometric objects. We provide a quantization called ``weak matrix regularization''of Lie-Poisson algebras (linear Poisson algebras) on the algebraic varieties defined by their Casimir polynomials. Casimir polynomials correspond with Casimir operators of the Lie algebra by the quantization. This quantization is a generalization of the method for constructing the fuzzy sphere. In order to define the weak matrix regularization of the quotient space by the ideal generated by the Casimir polynomials, we take a fixed reduced Gr\"obner basis of the ideal. The Gr\"obner basis determines remainders of polynomials. The operation of replacing this remainders with representation matrices of a Lie algebra roughly corresponds to a weak matrix regularization. As concrete examples, we construct weak matrix regularization for $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ and $\mathfrak{su}(3)$. In the case of $\mathfrak{su}(3)$, we not only construct weak matrix regularization for the quadratic Casimir polynomial, but also construct weak matrix regularization for the cubic Casimir polynomial.</description>

      <title>Generalized Free Energy Landscapes from Iyer-Wald Formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized free energy landscape plays a pivotal role in understanding black hole thermodynamics and phase transitions. In general relativity, one can directly derive the generalized free energy from the contributions of black holes exhibiting conical singularities. In this work, we extend this idea to general covariant theories. By employing Noether's second theorem, we present an alternative formulation of the Lagrangian, which can elucidate the role of conical singularities. We demonstrate that, in general, the contribution from conical singularities depends on the specific implementation of the regularization scheme and is not uniquely determined; this feature is explicitly exhibited and confirmed in three-dimensional new massive gravity. Nevertheless, these ambiguities can be absorbed into the second-order (and higher) corrections induced by conical singularities when the gravitational theory is described by the Lagrangian $L(g_{ab},R_{abcd})$. Moreover, for certain theories such as general relativity and Bumblebee gravity, this contribution simplifies to a well-defined result. However, the interpretation of the generalized free energy in Bumblebee gravity is somewhat different, with its extrema corresponding to the geometry of conical singularities. Our results uncover the particular properties of the generalized free energy beyond general relativity.</description>

Abstract: Through the holographic correspondence, we compute the entanglement entropy of the gluonic field sourced by a quark-antiquark pair undergoing uniform back-to-back acceleration. Previous calculations had obtained this only for the case where the entanglement surface is located midway between the quark and antiquark. Here, we consider the more general case with a relative lateral displacement, and determine the entanglement entropy as a function of the distance between the quark and the entanglement surface.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative renormalization group for Higgs-like models in 4D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We recently defined a model of 2 coupled SU(2) Higgs-like doublets which revealed an interesting structure of renormalization group flows to 1-loop when the SU(2) is broken to U(1). In this article we compute the beta functions to 3 loops and show that the 1-loop structure of flows persists to higher orders. For SU(2) broken to U(1), we conjecture a beta function to all orders. The flows can be extended to large coupling using a strong-weak coupling duality $g \to 1/g$. One finds a line of fixed points which are new conformal field theories in 4 spacetime dimensions which are non-unitary due to negative norm states but still have real eigenvalues. We also find massless flows between 2 non-trivial fixed points, and a regime with a cyclic RG flow. For the flows between points on the critical line, we compute the anomalous dimensions of the perturbations in the UV and IR, and identify some special points where anomalous dimensions are rational numbers. The model is non-unitary since the hamiltonian is pseudo-hermitian, $H^\dagger = {\cal K} H {\cal K}^\dagger$. The unitary operator ${\cal K} $ satisfies $ {\cal K}^2 =1$ and this allows a projection onto positive norm states with a unitary time evolution with positive probabilities. We also provide some evidence for a hidden SL(2,Z) symmetry.</description>

      <title>Two faces of $N=7,8$ superconformal mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two variants of $N=7$ superconformal mechanics with manifest $so(7)$ and $su(2) \times su(2)$ $R$-symmetries possessing exceptional $G(3)$ dynamical symmetry are presented. To construct these $G(3)$ theories, we developed two new versions of covariant embedding of the exceptional $g_2$ algebra into the $so(7)$ algebra and then the embedding of $so(7)$ into $so(8)$. As a result, two $N=8$ superconformal mechanics with the $OSp(8|2)$ and $F(4)$ superconformal algebras and $N=7, G(3)$ superconformal mechanics were constructed in a uniform way. The constants of the octonion multiplication play a key role in the construction of superconformal mechanics with manifest $so(7)$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>A systematic approach to $\ell$-loop planar integrands from the classical equation of motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we present a recursive method for $\ell$-loop planar integrands in colored quantum field theories. We start with the classical equation of motion and then pick out the comb component, which will help us to define the loop kernels. Then we construct the $\ell$-loop integrands based on some recursion rules for the $\ell$-loop kernels. Finally, we reach a recursion formula for the $\ell$-loop planar integrands. Our method can be easily generalized to general quantum field theories, even non-Lagrangian theories, to obtain the planar part of the whole $\ell$-loop integrands.</description>

      <title>SymTFT, Protected Gaplessness, and Spontaneous Breaking of Non-invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years we have learned that several four-dimensional field theories can manifest non-invertible zero-form symmetries generalizing the Kramers-Wannier duality defect of the 2d critical Ising model. Several recent works by various groups have observed a deep interplay among such non-invertible symmetries in 3+1 dimensions, their anomalies, and the properties of the ground state(s). The purpose of this work is to present a first coarse classification of all possible classes of non-invertible symmetries of this type that can either enforce gaplessness or be spontaneously broken in the infrared exploiting the topological symmetry theory formalism. Our methods also generalize to non-invertible KW-like duality symmetries graded by non-abelian finite subgroups. As a first applications of our results we present examples in the context of supersymmetric models. Along the way we notice the potential for further global structures that could be realized by non-SUSY versions of Argyres-Douglas type fixed points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Walcher's disk potential for the quintic threefold can be represented as a central charge of a specific Gauged Linear Sigma Model which we call the extended quintic GLSM. This representation provides an open/closed correspondence for the quintic threefold since the central charge is a generating function of closed genus-zero GLSM invariants. We also explain how open Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence and open mirror symmetry for the quintic are compatible with wall-crossing and mirror symmetry of the extended GLSM, respectively.</description>

      <title>Too Hot to Handle: Searching for Inflationary Particle Production in Planck Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-adiabatic production of massive particles is a generic feature of many inflationary mechanisms. If sufficiently massive, these particles can leave features in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) that are not well-captured by traditional correlation function analyses. We consider a scenario in which particle production occurs only in a narrow time-interval during inflation, eventually leading to CMB hot- or coldspots with characteristic shapes and sizes. Searching for such features in CMB data is analogous to searching for late-Universe hot- or coldspots, such as those due to the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. Exploiting this data-analysis parallel, we perform a search for particle-production hotspots in the Planck PR4 temperature dataset, which we implement via a matched-filter analysis. Our pipeline is validated on synthetic observations and found to yield unbiased constraints on sufficiently large hotspots across $\approx 60\%$ of the sky. After removing point sources and tSZ clusters, we find no evidence for new physics and place novel bounds on the coupling between the inflaton and massive particles. These bounds are strongest for larger hotspots, produced early in inflation, whilst sensitivity to smaller hotspots is limited by noise and beam effects. Through such methods we can constrain particles with masses $\mathcal{O}(100)$ times larger than the inflationary Hubble scale, which represents possibly the highest energies ever directly probed with observational data.</description>

      <title>Kerr metric from two commuting complex structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to simplify and popularise the construction from the 2013 paper by Apostolov, Calderbank, and Gauduchon, which (among other things) derives the Plebanski-Demianski family of solutions of GR using ideas of complex geometry. The starting point of this construction is the observation that the Euclidean versions of these metrics should have two different commuting complex structures, as well as two commuting Killing vector fields. After some linear algebra, this leads to an ansatz for the metrics, which is half-way to their complete determination. Kerr metric is a special 2-parameter subfamily in this class, which makes these considerations directly relevant to Kerr as well. This results in a derivation of the Kerr metric that is self-contained and elementary, in the sense of being mostly an exercise in linear algebra.</description>

      <title>Tensor Reduction for Feynman Integrals with Lorentz and Spinor Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient graphical approach to construct projectors for the tensor reduction of multi-loop Feynman integrals with both Lorentz and spinor indices in $D$ dimensions. An ansatz for the projectors is constructed making use of its symmetry properties via an orbit partition formula. The graphical approach allows to identify and enumerate the orbits in each case. For the case without spinor indices we find a 1 to 1 correspondence between orbits and integer partitions describing the cycle structure of certain bi-chord graphs. This leads to compact combinatorial formulae for the projector ansatz. With spinor indices the graph-structure becomes more involved, but the method is equally applicable. Our spinor reduction formulae are based on the antisymmetric basis of $\gamma$ matrices, and make use of their orthogonality property. We also provide a new compact formula to pass into the antisymmetric basis. We compute projectors for vacuum tensor Feynman integrals with up to 32 Lorentz indices and up to 4 spinor indices. We discuss how to employ the projectors in problems with external momenta.</description>

      <title>Speed Limits and Scrambling in Krylov Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between Krylov complexity and operator quantum speed limits (OQSLs) of the complexity operator and level repulsion in random/integrable matrices and many-body systems. An enhanced level-repulsion corresponds to increased OQSLs in random/integrable matrices. However, in many-body systems, the dynamics is more intricate due to the tensor product structure of the models. Initially, as the integrability-breaking parameter increases, the OQSL also increases, suggesting that breaking integrability allows for faster evolution of the complexity operator. At larger values of integrability-breaking, the OQSL decreases, suggesting a slowdown in the operator's evolution speed. Information-theoretic properties, such as scrambling, coherence and entanglement, of Krylov basis operators in many-body systems, are also investigated. The scrambling behaviour of these operators exhibits distinct patterns in integrable and chaotic cases. For systems exhibiting chaotic dynamics, the Krylov basis operators remain a reliable measure of these properties of the time-evolved operator at late times. However, in integrable systems, the Krylov operator's ability to capture the entanglement dynamics is less effective, especially during late times.</description>

      <title>Cluster structures on spinor helicity and momentum twistor varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14956v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the homogeneous coordinate rings of partial flag varieties and Grassmannians in their Pl\"ucker embeddings and exhibit an embedding of the former into the latter. Both rings are cluster algebras and the embedding respects the cluster algebra structures in the sense that there exists a seed for the Grassmannian that restricts to a seed for the partial flag variety (\textit{i.e.} it is obtained by freezing and deleting some cluster variables).
  The motivation for this project stems from the application of cluster algebras in scattering amplitudes: spinor helicity and momentum twistor varieties describe massless scattering without assuming dual conformal symmetry. Both may be obtained from Grassmanninas which model the dual conformal case. They are instances of partial flag varieties and their cluster structures reveal information for the scattering amplitudes. As an application of our main result we exhibit the relation between these cluster algebras.</description>

      <title>Charged critical behavior and nonperturbative continuum limit of three-dimensional lattice SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the three-dimensional (3D) lattice SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs theories with multicomponent ($N_f&gt;1$) degenerate scalar fields and U($N_f$) global symmetry, focusing on systems with $N_c=2$, to identify critical behaviors that can be effectively described by the corresponding 3D SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theory. The field-theoretical analysis of the RG flow allows one to identify a stable charged fixed point for large values of $N_f$, that would control transitions characterized by the global symmetry-breaking pattern ${\rm U}(N_f)\rightarrow \mathrm{SU}(2)\otimes \mathrm{U}(N_f-2)$. Continuous transitions with the same symmetry-breaking pattern are observed in the SU(2) lattice gauge model for $N_f \ge 30$. Here we present a detailed finite-size scaling analysis of the Monte Carlo data for several large values of $N_f$. The results are in substantial agreement with the field-theoretical predictions obtained in the large-$N_f$ limit. This provides evidence that the SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theories provide the correct effective description of the 3D large-$N_f$ continuous transitions between the disordered and the Higgs phase, where the flavor symmetry breaks to $\mathrm{SU}(2)\otimes \mathrm{U}(N_f-2)$. Therefore, at least for large enough $N_f$, the 3D SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theories with multicomponent scalar fields can be nonperturbatively defined by the continuum limit of lattice discretizatized models with the same local and global symmetries.</description>

      <title>The maximum radiated energy and final spin of high speed collision of two black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20239v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We performed a series of 769 full numerical simulations of high energy collision of black holes to search for the maximum gravitational energy emitted $E_{rad}$, during their merger. We consider equal mass binaries with spins pointing along their orbital angular momentum $\vec{L}$ and perform a search over impact parameters $b$ and initial linear momenta $p/m=\gamma v$ to find the maximum $E_{rad}$ for a given spin $\vec{S}$. The total radiated energy proves to have a weak dependence on the intrinsic spin $s$ of the holes, for the sequence $s=+0.8, 0.0, -0.8$ studied here. We thus estimate the maximum $E_{rad}^{max}/M_{ADM}\approx32\%\pm2\%$ for these direct merger encounters. We also explore the radiated angular momentum and the maximum spin of the merger remnant (within these configurations), finding $\alpha_f^{max}=0.987$. We then use the zero frequency limit expansion to analytically model the radiated energy in the small impact parameter and large initial linear momentum regime.</description>

      <title>Divergent Energy-Momentum Fluxes In Nonlocal Gravity Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the second order perturbations of the Deser-Woodard II (DWII), Vardanyan-Akrami-Amendola-Silvestri (VAAS) and Amendola-Burzilla-Nersisyan (ABN) nonlocal gravity models in an attempt to extract their associated gravitational wave energy-momentum fluxes. In Minkowski spacetime, the gravitational spatial momentum density is supposed to scale at most as $1/r^{2}$, in the $r \rightarrow \infty$ limit, where $r$ is the observer-source spatial distance. The DWII model has a divergent flux because its momentum density goes as $1/r$; though this can be avoided when we set to zero the first derivative of its distortion function at the origin. Meanwhile, the ABN model also suffers from a divergent flux because its momentum density goes as $r^{2}$. The momentum density from the VAAS model was computed on a cosmological background expressed in a Fermi-Normal-Coordinate system, and was found to scale as $r$. For generic parameters, therefore, none of these three Dark Energy models appear to yield well-defined gravitational wave energies, as a result of their nonlocal gravitational self-interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03538v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the suggestion that it is possible to eliminate the Big Bang curvature singularity of the Friedmann cosmological solution by considering a particular type of degenerate spacetime metric. Specifically, we take the 4-dimensional spacetime metric to have a spacelike 3-dimensional defect with a vanishing determinant of the metric. This new solution suggests the existence of another "side" of the Big Bang (perhaps a more appropriate description than "pre-Big-Bang" phase used in our original paper). The corresponding new solution for defect wormholes is also briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: We present a stable cosmological model of a closed universe in the presence of conventional scalar field. The stability of the model and absence of singularity is ensured by spatial curvature without the need for additional peculiar matter. We reconstruct the Lagrangian and numerically compute observational predictions, including the number of e-folds, the spectral index $n_s$, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We present several sets of parameters that satisfy the current observational data.</description>

      <title>Soft symmetries of topological orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (2+1)D topological orders possess emergent symmetries given by a group $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$, which consists of the braided tensor autoequivalences of the modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ that describes the anyons. In this paper we discuss cases where $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ has elements that neither permute anyons nor are associated to any symmetry fractionalization but are still non-trivial, which we refer to as soft symmetries. We point out that one can construct topological defects corresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain class of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus partition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on soft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important implications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases of matter. We also demonstrate analogous phenomena in higher dimensions, such as (3+1)D gauge theory with gauge group given by the quaternion group $Q_8$.</description>

      <title>Black Holes Rule Out Heavy Tachyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present direct observational constraints on tachyons; particles with group velocity greater than $c$ in vacuum in a Lorentz invariant theory. Since tachyons may have no direct couplings to Standard Model particles, the most robust and model independent constraints come from gravitational effects, especially black holes. We compute the Hawking radiation of tachyons from black holes, finding it to be significantly enhanced in the presence of heavy tachyons. For a black hole of mass $M$ and tachyons of mass $m$ with $g$ degrees of freedom, the black hole lifetime is found to be $t_{bh} \approx 192 \pi \hbar M/(g c^2 m^2)$ (or doubled for fermions). This implies that the observation of black holes of a few solar masses, with lifetime of several billion years, rules out tachyons of mass $m &gt; 3 \times 10^9$ GeV. This means there cannot exist any tachyons associated with unification scales or quantum gravity. So while there already exists theoretical reasons to be skeptical of tachyons, our work provides a complementary direct observational constraint.</description>

      <title>Exploring new variational quantum circuit ansatzes for solving $SU(2)$ matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explored and experimented with new forms of parameterized quantum circuits to be used as variational ansatzes for solving the bosonic and supersymmetric $SU(2)$ matrix models at different couplings using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. Working with IBM Qiskit quantum computing platform, we show that two types of quantum circuits named TwoLocal and EvolvedOperatorAnsatz can outperform the popular EfficientSU2 circuits which have been routinely used in the recent quantum physics literature to run VQE. With their more customizable constructions that allow for more flexibility beyond choosing the types of parameterized rotation gates, both types of new circuit ansatzes used in this work have led to performances that are either better than or at least comparable to EfficientSU2 in the setting of $SU(2)$ matrix models. In particular, in the strong coupling regime of the bosonic model, both TwoLocal and EvolvedOperatorAnsatz circuits provided a better approximation to the exact ground state, while in the supersymmetric model, shallow EvolvedOperatorAnsatz circuits, with a small number of parameters, attained a comparable or even better performance compared to the much deeper EfficientSU2 circuits with around 8 to 9 times more parameters. The results of this work demonstrate conclusively the potential of TwoLocal and EvolvedOperatorAnsatz quantum circuits as efficient new types of variational ansatzes that should be considered more frequently in future VQE studies of quantum physics systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify an observable that operates as a probe of the quark versus hadron content of a bath of quarks and gluons at finite temperature and chemical potential. To this purpose, we relate the Polyakov and anti-Polyakov loops, which determine how energetically costly it is to bring an external static quark or antiquark probe into the thermal bath, to the ability of that medium to provide the conditions for the formation of meson-like or baryon-like configurations that would screen the probes.</description>

      <title>Lectures on the Bondi--Metzner--Sachs group and related topics in infrared physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These are the extended lecture notes for a minicourse presented at the I S\~ao Paulo School on Gravitational Physics discussing the Bondi--Metzner--Sachs (BMS) group, the group of symmetries at null infinity on asymptotically flat spacetimes. The BMS group has found many applications in classical gravity, quantum field theory in flat and curved spacetimes, and quantum gravity. These notes build the BMS group from its most basic prerequisites (such as group theory, symmetries in differential geometry, and asymptotic flatness) up to modern developments. These include its connections to the Weinberg soft graviton theorem, the memory effect, its use to construct Hadamard states in quantum field theory in curved spacetimes, and other ideas. Advanced sections briefly discuss the main concepts behind the infrared triangle in electrodynamics, superrotations, and the Dappiaggi--Moretti--Pinamonti group in expanding universes with cosmological horizons. New contributions by the author concerning asymptotic (conformal) Killing horizons are discussed at the end.</description>

      <title>Three-local Charge Conservation Implies Quantum Integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the existence of a local conserved charge supported by three neighboring sites, or its local version, Reshetikhin's condition, suffices to guarantee the existence of all higher conserved charges and hence the integrability of a quantum spin chain. This explains the 'coincidence' that no counterexample is known to Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture despite the folklore that the conservation of local charges of order higher than 4 imposes additional constraints not implied by the conservation of the three-local charge.</description>
