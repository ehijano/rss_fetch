      <title>On prime coprime graphs of certain finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prime coprime graph $\Theta(G)$ of a finite group $G$ is the graph whose vertex set is $G$ and any two distinct vertices are adjacent if the greatest common divisor of their orders is either $1$ or a prime. In this paper, we investigate Hamiltonicity, clique number, and vertex degree of $\Theta(G)$ for cyclic, dihedral, and dicyclic groups $G$. We establish that $\Theta(G)$ admits a $(k,1)$-partition for cyclic, dihedral, and dicyclic groups $G$ of specified orders.</description>

      <title>Exotic presentations of quaternion groups and Wall's D2 problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The D2 problem of C. T. C. Wall asks whether every finite cohomologically 2-dimensional CW-complex is homotopy equivalent to a finite 2-complex. Several potential counterexamples have been proposed, the longest standing of which is a CW-complex constructed by Cohen and Dyer whose fundamental group is a quaternion group of order 32. We show that this CW-complex is homotopy equivalent to the presentation 2-complex of a presentation constructed by Mannan-Popiel, thus showing it is not a counterexample to the D2 problem. We next introduce an infinite family of presentations for a quaternion group of order $4n$ and prove that they achieve homotopy types which are not achieved by the presentations of Mannan-Popiel.</description>

      <title>Toric arrangements and Bloch-Kato pro-$p$ groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a purely combinatorial obstruction for the Bloch-Kato property within the class of fundamental groups of complement manifolds of toric arrangements (i.e., arrangements of hypersurfaces in the complex torus). As a stepping stone we obtain a combinatorial obstruction for the cohomology of a supersolvable arrangement to be generated in degree 1. Our result allows us to prove that - for all prime numbers $p$, the pro-$p$ completion of the pure braid group on $k$ strands has the Bloch-Kato property if and only if $k\leq 3$; - for all prime numbers $p$, the pro-$p$ completion of the pure mapping class group of the sphere $S^2$ with $k$ punctures has the Bloch-Kato property if and only if $k\leq 4$.</description>

      <title>On the isomorphism problem for cyclic JSJ decompositions: vertex elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two new moves on graphs of groups with cyclic edge groups that preserve the fundamental group. These moves allow us to address the isomorphism problem without the use of expansions, therefore keeping the number of vertices and edges constant along sequences of moves witnessing an isomorphism between two groups. We further show that the isomorphism problem for a large family of cyclic JSJ decompositions reduces to the case of generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups (GBS), and that among GBSs, it suffices to consider one-vertex graphs. As an application of the methods, we solve the isomorphism problem for a broad class of flexible GBSs. Finally, we discuss potential further applications of our techniques.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of graphs of groups with cyclic edge groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the outer automorphism group of a one-ended fundamental group of a graph of groups, when edge groups are cyclic, and vertex groups are torsion-free with cyclic centralizers. We show that in this case the outer automorphism group is virtually built from the outer automorphisms of the vertex groups (fixing some elements), the outer automorphisms of some associated generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups, and generalized twists - partial conjugations by elements in the centralizers of some elliptic elements in the group.</description>

      <title>Spinning and random quotients preserve hierarchical hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider random quotients of hierarchically hyperbolic groups, obtained by taking the quotient of the group by the n-th steps of a finite family of independent random walks. We show that a random quotient of a hierarchically hyperbolic group is again hierarchically hyperbolic asymptotically almost surely. The same techniques also yield that a random quotient of a non-elementary hyperbolic group (relative to a finite collection of peripheral subgroups) is asymptotically almost surely hyperbolic (relative to isomorphic peripheral subgroups). Our main tools come from the theory of spinning families and projection complexes, which we further develop.</description>

      <title>Transverse groups preserving proper domains in flag manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a semisimple Lie group $G$ and a self-opposite flag manifold $\mathcal{F}$ of $G$, we establish a necessary condition for an infinite subgroup $H$ of $G$ to preserve a proper domain in $\mathcal{F}$. In the case where $G$ is a Hermitian Lie group of tube type, we introduce and study a notion of causal convexity in the Shilov boundary $\mathbf{Sb}(G)$ of the symmetric space of $G$, inspired by the one already existing in conformal Lorentzian geometry. We show that subgroups $H$ of $G$ that are transverse with respect to a parabolic subgroup of $G$ defining $\mathbf{Sb}(G)$ and that preserve a proper domain in $\mathbf{Sb}(G)$ satisfy a geometric property with respect to this causal convexity, close to the strong projective convex cocompactness defined by Danciger--Gu\'eritaud--Kassel. This result highlights the spatial nature of the dynamics of $H$. We construct Zariski-dense examples of such transverse subgroups.</description>

      <title>The dependency digraph for irreducible finite-range random walk in free groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is one of a triptych composed with [Che25a] and [Che25b], that aims at proving an asymptotic expansion to any order of the passage probability of an irreducible equivariant finite range random walk on a tree. In this text we study the analytic and geometric properties of the objects introduced in [Che25b]. To do so we introduce the definition of a ''flooded cavern tree'' enabling a precise study of some dependency digraph associated with a given irreducible finite-range random walk on a free group.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces of flat Riemannian metrics on orbifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study moduli spaces of flat metrics on closed Riemannian orbifolds admitting such metrics. We show that for such orbifolds $\mathcal{O}$, the Teichm\"uller space of flat metrics $\mathcal{T}_{\text{flat}}(\mathcal{O})$ serves as a classifying space for proper actions of the mapping class group, $\operatorname{MCG}(\mathcal{O})$, in the appropriate category. We show that the moduli space of flat metrics, $\mathcal{M}_{\text{flat}}(\mathcal{O}) = \mathcal{T}_{\text{flat}}(\mathcal{O}) / \operatorname{MCG}(\mathcal{O})$, is itself a very good orbifold, and, under a technical assumption, describe this orbifold algebraically up to commensurability.</description>

      <title>On distinguishing coloring and some variants of proper coloring of graphs derived from subdivision operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let G be a simple, finite, connected, and undirected graph, and T be a finite tree. The middle graph M(G) of G is obtained from the subdivision graph S(G) after joining pairs of subdivided vertices that lie on adjacent edges of G and the central graph C(G) of G is obtained from S(G) after joining all non-adjacent vertices of G.
  We show that if the order of G is at least 4, then Aut(G), Aut(C(G)), and Aut(M(G)) are isomorphic (as abstract groups) and apply these results to obtain new sharp upper bounds of the distinguishing number and the distinguishing index of C(G) and M(G) inspired by an algorithm due to Kalinowski, Pilsniak, and Wozniak from 2016.
  Furthermore, we study the total distinguishing chromatic number of C(G) and S(G), use Latin squares to verify the AVD-total coloring conjecture for central graphs of regular graphs and some other classes of graphs (which is a partial progress towards answering an open question of Panda, Verma, and Keerti from 2020), and obtain new bounds of the total dominator chromatic number of C(G) and C(T).</description>

Abstract: I present a modified version of the Manogue-Dray-Wilson `octions' model of elementary particles, that overcomes some of the objections to that model that have been raised. In particular, I restore the compactness of the Standard Model gauge group, and explain the symmetry-breaking of the weak $SU(2)$ in terms of the symmetry-breaking between the three generations of elementary fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a measure equivalence coupling between two finitely generated groups, Delabie, Koivisto, Le Ma\^itre and Tessera have found explicit upper bounds on how integrable the associated cocycles can be. These bounds are optimal in many cases but the integrability of the cocycles with respect to these critical thresholds remained unclear. For instance, a cocycle from $\mathbb{Z}^{k+\ell}$ to $\mathbb{Z}^{k}$ can be $\mathrm{L}^p$ for all $p&lt;\frac{k}{k+\ell}$ but not for $p&gt;\frac{k}{k+\ell}$, and the case $p=\frac{k}{k+\ell}$ was an open question which we answer by the negative. Our main result actually yields much more examples where the integrability threshold given by Delabie-Koivisto-Le Ma\^itre-Tessera Theorems cannot be reached.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We transform the method of Glasson into a sufficient condition under which a monoid is non-finitely related, add a new member to the collection of interlocking word-patterns, and use it to show that the monoid $M(ab^2a, a^2b^2)$ is non-finitely related.
  We also give a sufficient condition under which a monoid is finitely related and use it show that $M(a^2b^2)$ is finitely related. Together with the results of Glasson this completes the description of all finitely related monoids among the monoids of the form $M(W)$ where every word ${\bf u} \in W$ depends on two variables and every variable occurs twice in $\bf u$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that an Artin group splits over infinite cyclic subgroups if and only if its defining graph has a separating vertex, and explicitly construct a JSJ decomposition over infinite cyclic subgroups for all Artin groups. This is then used to show that, if two Artin groups are isomorphic, then they have the same set of big chunks, that is, maximal subgraphs without separating vertices. We also deduce acylindrical hyperbolicity for the automorphism groups of many Artin groups, partially answering a question of Genevois in the case of Artin groups. As a consequence, this produces new families of Artin groups with the R-infinity property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14060v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear Geometry studies geometric properties which can be expressed via the notion of a line. All information about lines is encoded in a ternary relation called a line relation. A set endowed with a line relation is called a liner. So, Linear Geometry studies liners. Imposing some additional axioms on a liner, we obtain some special classes of liners: regular, projective, affine, proaffine, etc. Linear Geometry includes Affine and Projective Geometries and is a part of Incidence Geometry. The aim of this book is to present a self-contained logical development of Linear Geometry, starting with some intuitive acceptable geometric axioms and ending with algebraic structures that necessarily arise from studying the structure of geometric objects that satisfy those simple and intuitive geometric axioms. We shall meet many quite exotic algebraic structures that arise this way: magmas, loops, ternars, quasi-fields, alternative rings, procorps, profields, etc. We strongly prefer (synthetic) geometric proofs and use tools of analytic geometry only when no purely geometric proof is available. Liner Geometry has been developed by many great mathematicians since times of Antiquity (Thales, Euclides, Proclus, Pappus), through Renaissance (Descartes, Desargues), Early Modernity (Playfair, Gauss, Lobachevski, Bolyai, Poncelet, Steiner, M\"obius), Late Modernity Times (Steinitz, Klein, Hilbert, Moufang, Hessenberg, Jordan, Beltrami, Fano, Gallucci, Veblen, Wedderburn, Lenz, Barlotti) till our contempories (Hartshorne, Hall, Buekenhout, Gleason, Kantor, Doyen, Hubault, Dembowski, Klingenberg, Grundh\"ofer).</description>
