      <title>Time-Inhomogeneous Volatility Aversion for Financial Applications of Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In finance, sequential decision problems are often faced, for which reinforcement learning (RL) emerges as a promising tool for optimisation without the need of analytical tractability. However, the objective of classical RL is the expected cumulated reward, while financial applications typically require a trade-off between return and risk. In this work, we focus on settings where one cares about the time split of the total return, ruling out most risk-aware generalisations of RL which optimise a risk measure defined on the latter. We notice that a preference for homogeneous splits, which we found satisfactory for hedging, can be unfit for other problems, and therefore propose a new risk metric which still penalises uncertainty of the single rewards, but allows for an arbitrary planning of their target levels. We study the properties of the resulting objective and the generalisation of learning algorithms to optimise it. Finally, we show numerical results on toy examples.</description>

      <title>Liquidation Dynamics in DeFi and the Role of Transaction Fees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquidation of collateral are the primary safeguard for solvency of lending protocols in decentralized finance. However, the mechanics of liquidations expose these protocols to predatory price manipulations and other forms of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). In this paper, we characterize the optimal liquidation strategy, via a dynamic program, from the perspective of a profit-maximizing liquidator when the spot oracle is given by a Constant Product Market Maker (CPMM). We explicitly model Oracle Extractable Value (OEV) where liquidators manipulate the CPMM with sandwich attacks to trigger profitable liquidation events. We derive closed-form liquidation bounds and prove that CPMM transaction fees act as a critical security parameter. Crucially, we demonstrate that fees do not merely reduce attacker profits, but can make such manipulations unprofitable for an attacker. Our findings suggest that CPMM transaction fees serve a dual purpose: compensating liquidity providers and endogenously hardening CPMM oracles against manipulation without the latency of time-weighted averages or medianization.</description>

      <title>Can LLM-based Financial Investing Strategies Outperform the Market in Long Run?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07078v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been leveraged for asset pricing tasks and stock trading applications, enabling AI agents to generate investment decisions from unstructured financial data. However, most evaluations of LLM timing-based investing strategies are conducted on narrow timeframes and limited stock universes, overstating effectiveness due to survivorship and data-snooping biases. We critically assess their generalizability and robustness by proposing FINSABER, a backtesting framework evaluating timing-based strategies across longer periods and a larger universe of symbols. Systematic backtests over two decades and 100+ symbols reveal that previously reported LLM advantages deteriorate significantly under broader cross-section and over a longer-term evaluation. Our market regime analysis further demonstrates that LLM strategies are overly conservative in bull markets, underperforming passive benchmarks, and overly aggressive in bear markets, incurring heavy losses. These findings highlight the need to develop LLM strategies that are able to prioritise trend detection and regime-aware risk controls over mere scaling of framework complexity.</description>

      <title>The Invisible Handshake: Tacit Collusion between Adaptive Market Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the emergence of tacit collusion in a repeated game between a market maker, who controls market liquidity, and a market taker, who chooses trade quantities. The market price evolves according to the endogenous price impact of trades and exogenous innovations to economic fundamentals. We define collusion as persistent overpricing over economic fundamentals and characterize the set of feasible and collusive strategy profiles. Our main result shows that a broad class of simple learning dynamics, including gradient ascent updates, converges in finite time to collusive strategies when the agents maximize individual wealth, defined as the value of their portfolio, without any explicit coordination. The key economic mechanism is that when aggregate supply in the market is positive, overpricing raises the market capitalization and thus the total wealth of market participants, inducing a cooperative component in otherwise non-cooperative learning objectives. These results identify an inherent structure through which decentralized learning by AI-driven agents can autonomously generate persistent overpricing in financial markets.</description>
