      <title>A New Construction of the Vietoris-Rips Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new, inductive construction of the Vietoris-Rips complex, in which we take advantage of a small amount of unexploited combinatorial structure in the $k$-skeleton of the complex in order to avoid unnecessary comparisons when identifying its $(k+1)$-simplices. In doing so, we achieve a significant reduction in the number of comparisons required to construct the Vietoris-Rips compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, which is seen here by examining the computational complexity of the critical step in the algorithms. In experiments comparing a C/C++ implementation of our algorithm to the GUDHI v3.9.0 software package, this results in an observed $5$-$10$-fold improvement in speed of on sufficiently sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs with the best advantages as the graphs become sparser, as well as for higher dimensional Vietoris-Rips complexes. We further clarify that the algorithm described in Boissonnat and Maria (https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-33090-2_63) for the construction of the Vietoris-Rips complex is exactly the Incremental Algorithm from Zomorodian (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cag.2010.03.007), albeit with the additional requirement that the result be stored in a tree structure, and we explain how these techniques are different from the algorithm presented here.</description>

      <title>Generative Escher Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14564v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a fully-automatic, text-guided generative method for producing perfectly-repeating, periodic, tile-able 2D imagery, such as the one seen on floors, mosaics, ceramics, and the work of M.C. Escher. In contrast to square texture images that are seamless when tiled, our method generates non-square tilings which comprise solely of repeating copies of the same object. It achieves this by optimizing both geometry and texture of a 2D mesh, yielding a non-square tile in the shape and appearance of the desired object, with close to no additional background details, that can tile the plane without gaps nor overlaps. We enable optimization of the tile's shape by an unconstrained, differentiable parameterization of the space of all valid tileable meshes for given boundary conditions stemming from a symmetry group. Namely, we construct a differentiable family of linear systems derived from a 2D mesh-mapping technique - Orbifold Tutte Embedding - by considering the mesh's Laplacian matrix as differentiable parameters. We prove that the solution space of these linear systems is exactly all possible valid tiling configurations, thereby providing an end-to-end differentiable representation for the entire space of valid tiles. We render the textured mesh via a differentiable renderer, and leverage a pre-trained image diffusion model to induce a loss on the resulting image, updating the mesh's parameters so as to make its appearance match the text prompt. We show our method is able to produce plausible, appealing results, with non-trivial tiles, for a variety of different periodic tiling patterns.</description>
