      <title>Generative Principal Component Regression via Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to manipulate complex systems, such as the brain, to modify specific outcomes has far-reaching implications, particularly in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. One approach to designing appropriate manipulations is to target key features of predictive models. While generative latent variable models, such as probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA), is a powerful tool for identifying targets, they struggle incorporating information relevant to low-variance outcomes into the latent space. When stimulation targets are designed on the latent space in such a scenario, the intervention can be suboptimal with minimal efficacy. To address this problem, we develop a novel objective based on supervised variational autoencoders (SVAEs) that enforces such information is represented in the latent space. The novel objective can be used with linear models, such as PPCA, which we refer to as generative principal component regression (gPCR). We show in simulations that gPCR dramatically improves target selection in manipulation as compared to standard PCR and SVAEs. As part of these simulations, we develop a metric for detecting when relevant information is not properly incorporated into the loadings. We then show in two neural datasets related to stress and social behavior in which gPCR dramatically outperforms PCR in predictive performance and that SVAEs exhibit low incorporation of relevant information into the loadings. Overall, this work suggests that our method significantly improves target selection for manipulation using latent variable models over competitor inference schemes.</description>

      <title>Optimal sampling for least-squares approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Least-squares approximation is one of the most important methods for recovering an unknown function from data. While in many applications the data is fixed, in many others there is substantial freedom to choose where to sample. In this paper, we review recent progress on optimal sampling for (weighted) least-squares approximation in arbitrary linear spaces. We introduce the Christoffel function as a key quantity in the analysis of (weighted) least-squares approximation from random samples, then show how it can be used to construct sampling strategies that possess near-optimal sample complexity: namely, the number of samples scales log-linearly in $n$, the dimension of the approximation space. We discuss a series of variations, extensions and further topics, and throughout highlight connections to approximation theory, machine learning, information-based complexity and numerical linear algebra. Finally, motivated by various contemporary applications, we consider a generalization of the classical setting where the samples need not be pointwise samples of a scalar-valued function, and the approximation space need not be linear. We show that even in this significantly more general setting suitable generalizations of the Christoffel function still determine the sample complexity. This provides a unified procedure for designing improved sampling strategies for general recovery problems. This article is largely self-contained, and intended to be accessible to nonspecialists.</description>

      <title>Demographic parity in regression and classification within the unawareness framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the theoretical foundations of fair regression under the constraint of demographic parity within the unawareness framework, where disparate treatment is prohibited, extending existing results where such treatment is permitted. Specifically, we aim to characterize the optimal fair regression function when minimizing the quadratic loss. Our results reveal that this function is given by the solution to a barycenter problem with optimal transport costs. Additionally, we study the connection between optimal fair cost-sensitive classification, and optimal fair regression. We demonstrate that nestedness of the decision sets of the classifiers is both necessary and sufficient to establish a form of equivalence between classification and regression. Under this nestedness assumption, the optimal classifiers can be derived by applying thresholds to the optimal fair regression function; conversely, the optimal fair regression function is characterized by the family of cost-sensitive classifiers.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction in Dynamic Biological Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is the process of systematically determining and characterizing the degree of confidence in computational model predictions. In the context of systems biology, especially with dynamic models, UQ is crucial because it addresses the challenges posed by nonlinearity and parameter sensitivity, allowing us to properly understand and extrapolate the behavior of complex biological systems. Here, we focus on dynamic models represented by deterministic nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Many current UQ approaches in this field rely on Bayesian statistical methods. While powerful, these methods often require strong prior specifications and make parametric assumptions that may not always hold in biological systems. Additionally, these methods face challenges in domains where sample sizes are limited, and statistical inference becomes constrained, with computational speed being a bottleneck in large models of biological systems. As an alternative, we propose the use of conformal inference methods, introducing two novel algorithms that, in some instances, offer non-asymptotic guarantees, enhancing robustness and scalability across various applications. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithms through several scenarios, highlighting their advantages over traditional Bayesian approaches. The proposed methods show promising results for diverse biological data structures and scenarios, offering a general framework to quantify uncertainty for dynamic models of biological systems.The software for the methodology and the reproduction of the results is available at https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13644870.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This book introduces the mathematical foundations and techniques that lead to the development and analysis of many of the algorithms that are used in machine learning. It starts with an introductory chapter that describes notation used throughout the book and serve at a reminder of basic concepts in calculus, linear algebra and probability and also introduces some measure theoretic terminology, which can be used as a reading guide for the sections that use these tools. The introductory chapters also provide background material on matrix analysis and optimization. The latter chapter provides theoretical support to many algorithms that are used in the book, including stochastic gradient descent, proximal methods, etc. After discussing basic concepts for statistical prediction, the book includes an introduction to reproducing kernel theory and Hilbert space techniques, which are used in many places, before addressing the description of various algorithms for supervised statistical learning, including linear methods, support vector machines, decision trees, boosting, or neural networks. The subject then switches to generative methods, starting with a chapter that presents sampling methods and an introduction to the theory of Markov chains. The following chapter describe the theory of graphical models, an introduction to variational methods for models with latent variables, and to deep-learning based generative models. The next chapters focus on unsupervised learning methods, for clustering, factor analysis and manifold learning. The final chapter of the book is theory-oriented and discusses concentration inequalities and generalization bounds.</description>

      <title>Regularized Multi-output Gaussian Convolution Process with Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-output Gaussian process (MGP) has been attracting increasing attention as a transfer learning method to model multiple outputs. Despite its high flexibility and generality, MGP still faces two critical challenges when applied to transfer learning. The first one is negative transfer, which occurs when there exists no shared information among the outputs. The second challenge is the input domain inconsistency, which is commonly studied in transfer learning yet not explored in MGP. In this paper, we propose a regularized MGP modeling framework with domain adaptation to overcome these challenges. More specifically, a sparse covariance matrix of MGP is proposed by using convolution process, where penalization terms are added to adaptively select the most informative outputs for knowledge transfer. To deal with the domain inconsistency, a domain adaptation method is proposed by marginalizing inconsistent features and expanding missing features to align the input domains among different outputs. Statistical properties of the proposed method are provided to guarantee the performance practically and asymptotically. The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in comprehensive simulation studies and one real case study of a ceramic manufacturing process. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in dealing with both the negative transfer and the domain inconsistency.</description>

      <title>Global Public Sentiment on Decentralized Finance: A Spatiotemporal Analysis of Geo-tagged Tweets from 150 Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the digital era, blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have transformed financial and decentralized systems. However, existing research often neglects the spatiotemporal variations in public sentiment toward these technologies, limiting macro-level insights into their global impact. This study leverages Twitter data to explore public attention and sentiment across 150 countries, analyzing over 150 million geotagged tweets from 2012 to 2022. Sentiment scores were derived using a BERT-based multilingual sentiment model trained on 7.4 billion tweets. The analysis integrates global cryptocurrency regulations and economic indicators from the World Development Indicators database. Results reveal significant global sentiment variations influenced by economic factors, with more developed nations engaging more in discussions, while less developed countries show higher sentiment levels. Geographically weighted regression indicates that GDP-tweet engagement correlation intensifies following Bitcoin price surges. Topic modeling shows that countries within similar economic clusters share discussion trends, while different clusters focus on distinct topics. This study highlights global disparities in sentiment toward decentralized finance, shaped by economic and regional factors, with implications for poverty alleviation, cryptocurrency crime, and sustainable development. The dataset and code are publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Optimization by Parallel Quasi-Quantum Annealing with Gradient-Based Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning-based methods have gained attention as general-purpose solvers because they can automatically learn problem-specific heuristics, reducing the need for manually crafted heuristics. However, these methods often face challenges with scalability. To address these issues, the improved Sampling algorithm for Combinatorial Optimization (iSCO) using discrete Langevin dynamics has been proposed, demonstrating better performance than several learning-based solvers. This study proposes a different approach that integrates gradient-based update through continuous relaxation, combined with Quasi-Quantum Annealing (QQA). QQA smoothly transitions the objective function from a simple convex form, where half-integral solutions dominate, to the original objective function, where the variables are restricted to 0 or 1. Furthermore, we incorporate parallel run communication leveraging GPUs, enhancing exploration capabilities and accelerating convergence. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach is a competitive general-purpose solver, achieving comparable performance to iSCO across various benchmark problems. Notably, our method exhibits superior trade-offs between speed and solution quality for large-scale instances compared to iSCO, commercial solvers, and specialized algorithms.</description>

      <title>COmoving Computer Acceleration (COCA): $N$-body simulations in an emulated frame of reference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $N$-body simulations are computationally expensive, so machine-learning (ML)-based emulation techniques have emerged as a way to increase their speed. Although fast, surrogate models have limited trustworthiness due to potentially substantial emulation errors that current approaches cannot correct for. To alleviate this problem, we introduce COmoving Computer Acceleration (COCA), a hybrid framework interfacing ML with an $N$-body simulator. The correct physical equations of motion are solved in an emulated frame of reference, so that any emulation error is corrected by design. This approach corresponds to solving for the perturbation of particle trajectories around the machine-learnt solution, which is computationally cheaper than obtaining the full solution, yet is guaranteed to converge to the truth as one increases the number of force evaluations. Although applicable to any ML algorithm and $N$-body simulator, this approach is assessed in the particular case of particle-mesh cosmological simulations in a frame of reference predicted by a convolutional neural network, where the time dependence is encoded as an additional input parameter to the network. COCA efficiently reduces emulation errors in particle trajectories, requiring far fewer force evaluations than running the corresponding simulation without ML. We obtain accurate final density and velocity fields for a reduced computational budget. We demonstrate that this method shows robustness when applied to examples outside the range of the training data. When compared to the direct emulation of the Lagrangian displacement field using the same training resources, COCA's ability to correct emulation errors results in more accurate predictions. COCA makes $N$-body simulations cheaper by skipping unnecessary force evaluations, while still solving the correct equations of motion and correcting for emulation errors made by ML.</description>

      <title>FastVoiceGrad: One-step Diffusion-Based Voice Conversion with Adversarial Conditional Diffusion Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based voice conversion (VC) techniques such as VoiceGrad have attracted interest because of their high VC performance in terms of speech quality and speaker similarity. However, a notable limitation is the slow inference caused by the multi-step reverse diffusion. Therefore, we propose FastVoiceGrad, a novel one-step diffusion-based VC that reduces the number of iterations from dozens to one while inheriting the high VC performance of the multi-step diffusion-based VC. We obtain the model using adversarial conditional diffusion distillation (ACDD), leveraging the ability of generative adversarial networks and diffusion models while reconsidering the initial states in sampling. Evaluations of one-shot any-to-any VC demonstrate that FastVoiceGrad achieves VC performance superior to or comparable to that of previous multi-step diffusion-based VC while enhancing the inference speed. Audio samples are available at https://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/people/kaneko.takuhiro/projects/fastvoicegrad/.</description>

      <title>Optimal Neural Network Approximation for High-Dimensional Continuous Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the authors of Shen Yang Zhang (JMLR, 2022) developed a neural network with width $36d(2d + 1)$ and depth $11$, which utilizes a special activation function called the elementary universal activation function, to achieve the super approximation property for functions in $C([a,b]^d)$. That is, the constructed network only requires a fixed number of neurons to approximate a $d$-variate continuous function on a $d$-dimensional hypercube with arbitrary accuracy. Their network uses $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ fixed neurons. One natural question to address is whether we can reduce the number of these neurons in such a network. By leveraging a variant of the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem, our analysis shows that there is a neural network generated by the elementary universal activation function with only $366d +365$ fixed, intrinsic (non-repeated) neurons that attains this super approximation property. Furthermore, we present a family of continuous functions that requires at least width $d$, and therefore at least $d$ intrinsic neurons, to achieve arbitrary accuracy in its approximation. This shows that the requirement of $\mathcal{O}(d)$ intrinsic neurons is optimal in the sense that it grows linearly with the input dimension $d$, unlike some approximation methods where parameters may grow exponentially with $d$.</description>

      <title>Building Math Agents with Multi-Turn Iterative Preference Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that large language models' (LLMs) mathematical problem-solving capabilities can be enhanced by integrating external tools, such as code interpreters, and employing multi-turn Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. While current methods focus on synthetic data generation and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), this paper studies the complementary direct preference learning approach to further improve model performance. However, existing direct preference learning algorithms are originally designed for the single-turn chat task, and do not fully address the complexities of multi-turn reasoning and external tool integration required for tool-integrated mathematical reasoning tasks. To fill in this gap, we introduce a multi-turn direct preference learning framework, tailored for this context, that leverages feedback from code interpreters and optimizes trajectory-level preferences. This framework includes multi-turn DPO and multi-turn KTO as specific implementations. The effectiveness of our framework is validated through training of various language models using an augmented prompt set from the GSM8K and MATH datasets. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements: a supervised fine-tuned Gemma-1.1-it-7B model's performance increased from 77.5% to 83.9% on GSM8K and from 46.1% to 51.2% on MATH. Similarly, a Gemma-2-it-9B model improved from 84.1% to 86.3% on GSM8K and from 51.0% to 54.5% on MATH.</description>

      <title>Relative-Translation Invariant Wasserstein Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of distances, relative-translation invariant Wasserstein distances ($RW_p$), for measuring the similarity of two probability distributions under distribution shift. Generalizing it from the classical optimal transport model, we show that $RW_p$ distances are also real distance metrics defined on the quotient set $\mathcal{P}_p(\mathbb{R}^n)/\sim$ and invariant to distribution translations. When $p=2$, the $RW_2$ distance enjoys more exciting properties, including decomposability of the optimal transport model, translation-invariance of the $RW_2$ distance, and a Pythagorean relationship between $RW_2$ and the classical quadratic Wasserstein distance ($W_2$). Based on these properties, we show that a distribution shift, measured by $W_2$ distance, can be explained in the bias-variance perspective. In addition, we propose a variant of the Sinkhorn algorithm, named $RW_2$ Sinkhorn algorithm, for efficiently calculating $RW_2$ distance, coupling solutions, as well as $W_2$ distance. We also provide the analysis of numerical stability and time complexity for the proposed algorithm. Finally, we validate the $RW_2$ distance metric and the algorithm performance with three experiments. We conduct one numerical validation for the $RW_2$ Sinkhorn algorithm and show two real-world applications demonstrating the effectiveness of using $RW_2$ under distribution shift: digits recognition and similar thunderstorm detection.

      <title>Adversarial Attacks on Machine Learning-Aided Visualizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research in ML4VIS investigates how to use machine learning (ML) techniques to generate visualizations, and the field is rapidly growing with high societal impact. However, as with any computational pipeline that employs ML processes, ML4VIS approaches are susceptible to a range of ML-specific adversarial attacks. These attacks can manipulate visualization generations, causing analysts to be tricked and their judgments to be impaired. Due to a lack of synthesis from both visualization and ML perspectives, this security aspect is largely overlooked by the current ML4VIS literature. To bridge this gap, we investigate the potential vulnerabilities of ML-aided visualizations from adversarial attacks using a holistic lens of both visualization and ML perspectives. We first identify the attack surface (i.e., attack entry points) that is unique in ML-aided visualizations. We then exemplify five different adversarial attacks. These examples highlight the range of possible attacks when considering the attack surface and multiple different adversary capabilities. Our results show that adversaries can induce various attacks, such as creating arbitrary and deceptive visualizations, by systematically identifying input attributes that are influential in ML inferences. Based on our observations of the attack surface characteristics and the attack examples, we underline the importance of comprehensive studies of security issues and defense mechanisms as a call of urgency for the ML4VIS community.</description>

      <title>Solving Video Inverse Problems Using Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, diffusion model-based inverse problem solvers (DIS) have emerged as state-of-the-art approaches for addressing inverse problems, including image super-resolution, deblurring, inpainting, etc. However, their application to video inverse problems arising from spatio-temporal degradation remains largely unexplored due to the challenges in training video diffusion models. To address this issue, here we introduce an innovative video inverse solver that leverages only image diffusion models. Specifically, by drawing inspiration from the success of the recent decomposed diffusion sampler (DDS), our method treats the time dimension of a video as the batch dimension of image diffusion models and solves spatio-temporal optimization problems within denoised spatio-temporal batches derived from each image diffusion model. Moreover, we introduce a batch-consistent diffusion sampling strategy that encourages consistency across batches by synchronizing the stochastic noise components in image diffusion models. Our approach synergistically combines batch-consistent sampling with simultaneous optimization of denoised spatio-temporal batches at each reverse diffusion step, resulting in a novel and efficient diffusion sampling strategy for video inverse problems. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively addresses various spatio-temporal degradations in video inverse problems, achieving state-of-the-art reconstructions.

      <title>(Implicit) Ensembles of Ensembles: Epistemic Uncertainty Collapse in Large Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epistemic uncertainty is crucial for safety-critical applications and out-of-distribution detection tasks. Yet, we uncover a paradoxical phenomenon in deep learning models: an epistemic uncertainty collapse as model complexity increases, challenging the assumption that larger models invariably offer better uncertainty quantification. We propose that this stems from implicit ensembling within large models. To support this hypothesis, we demonstrate epistemic uncertainty collapse empirically across various architectures, from explicit ensembles of ensembles and simple MLPs to state-of-the-art vision models, including ResNets and Vision Transformers -- for the latter, we examine implicit ensemble extraction and decompose larger models into diverse sub-models, recovering epistemic uncertainty. We provide theoretical justification for these phenomena and explore their implications for uncertainty estimation.</description>

      <title>Neural timescales from a computational perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timescales of neural activity are diverse across and within brain areas, and experimental observations suggest that neural timescales reflect information in dynamic environments. However, these observations do not specify how neural timescales are shaped, nor whether particular timescales are necessary for neural computations and brain function. Here, we take a complementary perspective and synthesize three directions where computational methods can distill the broad set of empirical observations into quantitative and testable theories: We review (i) how data analysis methods allow us to capture different timescales of neural dynamics across different recording modalities, (ii) how computational models provide a mechanistic explanation for the emergence of diverse timescales, and (iii) how task-optimized models in machine learning uncover the functional relevance of neural timescales. This integrative computational approach, combined with empirical findings, would provide a more holistic understanding of how neural timescales capture the relationship between brain structure, dynamics, and behavior.</description>

      <title>Approximating mutual information of high-dimensional variables using learned representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is a general measure of statistical dependence with widespread application across the sciences. However, estimating MI between multi-dimensional variables is challenging because the number of samples necessary to converge to an accurate estimate scales unfavorably with dimensionality. In practice, existing techniques can reliably estimate MI in up to tens of dimensions, but fail in higher dimensions, where sufficient sample sizes are infeasible. Here, we explore the idea that underlying low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional data can be exploited to faithfully approximate MI in high-dimensional settings with realistic sample sizes. We develop a method that we call latent MI (LMI) approximation, which applies a nonparametric MI estimator to low-dimensional representations learned by a simple, theoretically-motivated model architecture. Using several benchmarks, we show that unlike existing techniques, LMI can approximate MI well for variables with $&gt; 10^3$ dimensions if their dependence structure has low intrinsic dimensionality. Finally, we showcase LMI on two open problems in biology. First, we approximate MI between protein language model (pLM) representations of interacting proteins, and find that pLMs encode non-trivial information about protein-protein interactions. Second, we quantify cell fate information contained in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) measurements of hematopoietic stem cells, and find a sharp transition during neutrophil differentiation when fate information captured by scRNA-seq increases dramatically.</description>

      <title>Unifying Causal Representation Learning with the Invariance Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal representation learning aims at recovering latent causal variables from high-dimensional observations to solve causal downstream tasks, such as predicting the effect of new interventions or more robust classification. A plethora of methods have been developed, each tackling carefully crafted problem settings that lead to different types of identifiability. The folklore is that these different settings are important, as they are often linked to different rungs of Pearl's causal hierarchy, although not all neatly fit. Our main contribution is to show that many existing causal representation learning approaches methodologically align the representation to known data symmetries. Identification of the variables is guided by equivalence classes across different data pockets that are not necessarily causal. This result suggests important implications, allowing us to unify many existing approaches in a single method that can mix and match different assumptions, including non-causal ones, based on the invariances relevant to our application. It also significantly benefits applicability, which we demonstrate by improving treatment effect estimation on real-world high-dimensional ecological data. Overall, this paper clarifies the role of causality assumptions in the discovery of causal variables and shifts the focus to preserving data symmetries.</description>

      <title>Boosting Certificate Robustness for Time Series Classification with Efficient Self-Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the issue of adversarial robustness in the time series domain has garnered significant attention. However, the available defense mechanisms remain limited, with adversarial training being the predominant approach, though it does not provide theoretical guarantees. Randomized Smoothing has emerged as a standout method due to its ability to certify a provable lower bound on robustness radius under $\ell_p$-ball attacks. Recognizing its success, research in the time series domain has started focusing on these aspects. However, existing research predominantly focuses on time series forecasting, or under the non-$\ell_p$ robustness in statistic feature augmentation for time series classification~(TSC). Our review found that Randomized Smoothing performs modestly in TSC, struggling to provide effective assurances on datasets with poor robustness. Therefore, we propose a self-ensemble method to enhance the lower bound of the probability confidence of predicted labels by reducing the variance of classification margins, thereby certifying a larger radius. This approach also addresses the computational overhead issue of Deep Ensemble~(DE) while remaining competitive and, in some cases, outperforming it in terms of robustness. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating superior performance in robustness testing compared to baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Oops, I Sampled it Again: Reinterpreting Confidence Intervals in Few-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The predominant method for computing confidence intervals (CI) in few-shot learning (FSL) is based on sampling the tasks with replacement, i.e.\ allowing the same samples to appear in multiple tasks. This makes the CI misleading in that it takes into account the randomness of the sampler but not the data itself. To quantify the extent of this problem, we conduct a comparative analysis between CIs computed with and without replacement. These reveal a notable underestimation by the predominant method. This observation calls for a reevaluation of how we interpret confidence intervals and the resulting conclusions in FSL comparative studies. Our research demonstrates that the use of paired tests can partially address this issue. Additionally, we explore methods to further reduce the (size of the) CI by strategically sampling tasks of a specific size. We also introduce a new optimized benchmark, which can be accessed at https://github.com/RafLaf/FSL-benchmark-again</description>

      <title>Small noise analysis for Tikhonov and RKHS regularizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regularization plays a pivotal role in ill-posed machine learning and inverse problems. However, the fundamental comparative analysis of various regularization norms remains open. We establish a small noise analysis framework to assess the effects of norms in Tikhonov and RKHS regularizations, in the context of ill-posed linear inverse problems with Gaussian noise. This framework studies the convergence rates of regularized estimators in the small noise limit and reveals the potential instability of the conventional L2-regularizer. We solve such instability by proposing an innovative class of adaptive fractional RKHS regularizers, which covers the L2 Tikhonov and RKHS regularizations by adjusting the fractional smoothness parameter. A surprising insight is that over-smoothing via these fractional RKHSs consistently yields optimal convergence rates, but the optimal hyper-parameter may decay too fast to be selected in practice.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao Bound Estimation with Score-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) provides a lower bound on the mean square error of any Bayesian estimator under mild regularity conditions. It can be used to benchmark the performance of statistical estimators, and provides a principled metric for system design and optimization. However, the Bayesian CRB depends on the underlying prior distribution, which is often unknown for many problems of interest. This work introduces a new data-driven estimator for the Bayesian CRB using score matching, i.e., a statistical estimation technique that models the gradient of a probability distribution from a given set of training data. The performance of the proposed estimator is analyzed in both the classical parametric modeling regime and the neural network modeling regime. In both settings, we develop novel non-asymptotic bounds on the score matching error and our Bayesian CRB estimator based on the results from empirical process theory, including classical bounds and recently introduced techniques for characterizing neural networks. We illustrate the performance of the proposed estimator with two application examples: a signal denoising problem and a dynamic phase offset estimation problem in communication systems.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Dimensionality Reduction: A Data Efficient Approach for Multimodal Representations Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore two primary classes of approaches to dimensionality reduction (DR): Independent Dimensionality Reduction (IDR) and Simultaneous Dimensionality Reduction (SDR). In IDR methods, of which Principal Components Analysis is a paradigmatic example, each modality is compressed independently, striving to retain as much variation within each modality as possible. In contrast, in SDR, one simultaneously compresses the modalities to maximize the covariation between the reduced descriptions while paying less attention to how much individual variation is preserved. Paradigmatic examples include Partial Least Squares and Canonical Correlations Analysis. Even though these DR methods are a staple of statistics, their relative accuracy and data set size requirements are poorly understood. We introduce a generative linear model to synthesize multimodal data with known variance and covariance structures to examine these questions. We assess the accuracy of the reconstruction of the covariance structures as a function of the number of samples, signal-to-noise ratio, and the number of varying and covarying signals in the data. Using numerical experiments, we demonstrate that linear SDR methods consistently outperform linear IDR methods and yield higher-quality, more succinct reduced-dimensional representations with smaller datasets. Remarkably, regularized CCA can identify low-dimensional weak covarying structures even when the number of samples is much smaller than the dimensionality of the data, which is a regime challenging for all dimensionality reduction methods. Our work corroborates and explains previous observations in the literature that SDR can be more effective in detecting covariation patterns in data. These findings suggest that SDR should be preferred to IDR in real-world data analysis when detecting covariation is more important than preserving variation.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Bias of Machine Learning Regression Models and Its Correction: an Application to Imaging-based Brain Age Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning models for continuous outcomes often yield systematically biased predictions, particularly for values that largely deviate from the mean. Specifically, predictions for large-valued outcomes tend to be negatively biased (underestimating actual values), while those for small-valued outcomes are positively biased (overestimating actual values). We refer to this linear central tendency warped bias as the "systematic bias of machine learning regression". In this paper, we first demonstrate that this systematic prediction bias persists across various machine learning regression models, and then delve into its theoretical underpinnings. To address this issue, we propose a general constrained optimization approach designed to correct this bias and develop computationally efficient implementation algorithms. Simulation results indicate that our correction method effectively eliminates the bias from the predicted outcomes. We apply the proposed approach to the prediction of brain age using neuroimaging data. In comparison to competing machine learning regression models, our method effectively addresses the longstanding issue of "systematic bias of machine learning regression" in neuroimaging-based brain age calculation, yielding unbiased predictions of brain age.</description>

      <title>A Confidence Interval for the $\ell_2$ Expected Calibration Error</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have significantly improved prediction accuracy in various applications. However, ensuring the calibration of probabilistic predictions remains a significant challenge. Despite efforts to enhance model calibration, the rigorous statistical evaluation of model calibration remains less explored. In this work, we develop confidence intervals the $\ell_2$ Expected Calibration Error (ECE). We consider top-1-to-$k$ calibration, which includes both the popular notion of confidence calibration as well as full calibration. For a debiased estimator of the ECE, we show asymptotic normality, but with different convergence rates and asymptotic variances for calibrated and miscalibrated models. We develop methods to construct asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the ECE, accounting for this behavior as well as non-negativity. Our theoretical findings are supported through extensive experiments, showing that our methods produce valid confidence intervals with shorter lengths compared to those obtained by resampling-based methods.</description>

      <title>EnsLoss: Stochastic Calibrated Loss Ensembles for Preventing Overfitting in Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical risk minimization (ERM) with a computationally feasible surrogate loss is a widely accepted approach for classification. Notably, the convexity and calibration (CC) properties of a loss function ensure consistency of ERM in maximizing accuracy, thereby offering a wide range of options for surrogate losses. In this article, we propose a novel ensemble method, namely EnsLoss, which extends the ensemble learning concept to combine loss functions within the ERM framework. A key feature of our method is the consideration on preserving the "legitimacy" of the combined losses, i.e., ensuring the CC properties. Specifically, we first transform the CC conditions of losses into loss-derivatives, thereby bypassing the need for explicit loss functions and directly generating calibrated loss-derivatives. Therefore, inspired by Dropout, EnsLoss enables loss ensembles through one training process with doubly stochastic gradient descent (i.e., random batch samples and random calibrated loss-derivatives). We theoretically establish the statistical consistency of our approach and provide insights into its benefits. The numerical effectiveness of EnsLoss compared to fixed loss methods is demonstrated through experiments on a broad range of 14 OpenML tabular datasets and 46 image datasets with various deep learning architectures. Python repository and source code are available on GitHub at https://github.com/statmlben/ensloss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1807.09932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivation: In this paper we present the latest release of EBIC, a next-generation biclustering algorithm for mining genetic data. The major contribution of this paper is adding support for big data, making it possible to efficiently run large genomic data mining analyses. Additional enhancements include integration with R and Bioconductor and an option to remove influence of missing value on the final result.
  Results: EBIC was applied to datasets of different sizes, including a large DNA methylation dataset with 436,444 rows. For the largest dataset we observed over 6.6 fold speedup in computation time on a cluster of 8 GPUs compared to running the method on a single GPU. This proves high scalability of the algorithm.

      <title>Convex Regression in Multidimensions: Suboptimality of Least Squares Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.02044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under the usual nonparametric regression model with Gaussian errors, Least Squares Estimators (LSEs) over natural subclasses of convex functions are shown to be suboptimal for estimating a $d$-dimensional convex function in squared error loss when the dimension $d$ is 5 or larger. The specific function classes considered include: (i) bounded convex functions supported on a polytope (in random design), (ii) Lipschitz convex functions supported on any convex domain (in random design), (iii) convex functions supported on a polytope (in fixed design). For each of these classes, the risk of the LSE is proved to be of the order $n^{-2/d}$ (up to logarithmic factors) while the minimax risk is $n^{-4/(d+4)}$, when $d \ge 5$. In addition, the first rate of convergence results (worst case and adaptive) for the unrestricted convex LSE are established in fixed-design for polytopal domains for all $d \geq 1$. Some new metric entropy results for convex functions are also proved which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A variational inference framework for inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.05909v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A framework is presented for fitting inverse problem models via variational Bayes approximations. This methodology guarantees flexibility to statistical model specification for a broad range of applications, good accuracy and reduced model fitting times. The message passing and factor graph fragment approach to variational Bayes that is also described facilitates streamlined implementation of approximate inference algorithms and allows for supple inclusion of numerous response distributions and penalizations into the inverse problem model. Models for one- and two-dimensional response variables are examined and an infrastructure is laid down where efficient algorithm updates based on nullifying weak interactions between variables can also be derived for inverse problems in higher dimensions. An image processing application and a simulation exercise motivated by biomedical problems reveal the computational advantage offered by efficient implementation of variational Bayes over Markov chain Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of Variance-reduced Distributionally Robust Q-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic decision-making under distributional shifts is of fundamental interest in theory and applications of reinforcement learning: The distribution of the environment in which the data is collected can differ from that of the environment in which the model is deployed. This paper presents two novel model-free algorithms, namely the distributionally robust Q-learning and its variance-reduced counterpart, that can effectively learn a robust policy despite distributional shifts. These algorithms are designed to efficiently approximate the $q$-function of an infinite-horizon $\gamma$-discounted robust Markov decision process with Kullback-Leibler ambiguity set to an entry-wise $\epsilon$-degree of precision. Further, the variance-reduced distributionally robust Q-learning combines the synchronous Q-learning with variance-reduction techniques to enhance its performance. Consequently, we establish that it attains a minimax sample complexity upper bound of $\tilde O(|\mathbf{S}||\mathbf{A}|(1-\gamma)^{-4}\epsilon^{-2})$, where $\mathbf{S}$ and $\mathbf{A}$ denote the state and action spaces. This is the first complexity result that is independent of the ambiguity size $\delta$, thereby providing new complexity theoretic insights. Additionally, a series of numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings and the efficiency of the algorithms in handling distributional shifts.</description>

      <title>Adaptive operator learning for infinite-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fundamental computational issues in Bayesian inverse problems (BIP) governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) stem from the requirement of repeated forward model evaluations. A popular strategy to reduce such costs is to replace expensive model simulations with computationally efficient approximations using operator learning, motivated by recent progress in deep learning. However, using the approximated model directly may introduce a modeling error, exacerbating the already ill-posedness of inverse problems. Thus, balancing between accuracy and efficiency is essential for the effective implementation of such approaches. To this end, we develop an adaptive operator learning framework that can reduce modeling error gradually by forcing the surrogate to be accurate in local areas. This is accomplished by adaptively fine-tuning the pre-trained approximate model with training points chosen by a greedy algorithm during the posterior evaluation process. To validate our approach, we use DeepOnet to construct the surrogate and unscented Kalman inversion (UKI) to approximate the BIP solution, respectively. Furthermore, we present a rigorous convergence guarantee in the linear case using the UKI framework. The approach is tested on a number of benchmarks, including the Darcy flow, the heat source inversion problem, and the reaction-diffusion problem. The numerical results show that our method can significantly reduce computational costs while maintaining inversion accuracy.</description>

      <title>Pseudo Replay-based Class Continual Learning for Online New Category Anomaly Detection in Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The incorporation of advanced sensors and machine learning techniques has enabled modern manufacturing enterprises to perform data-driven classification-based anomaly detection based on the sensor data collected in manufacturing processes. However, one critical challenge is that newly presented defect category may manifest as the manufacturing process continues, resulting in monitoring performance deterioration of previously trained machine learning models. Hence, there is an increasing need for empowering machine learning models to learn continually. Among all continual learning methods, memory-based continual learning has the best performance but faces the constraints of data storage capacity. To address this issue, this paper develops a novel pseudo replay-based continual learning framework by integrating class incremental learning and oversampling-based data generation. Without storing all the data, the developed framework could generate high-quality data representing previous classes to train machine learning model incrementally when new category anomaly occurs. In addition, it could even enhance the monitoring performance since it also effectively improves the data quality. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated in three cases studies, which leverages supervised classification problem for anomaly detection. The experimental results show that the developed method is very promising in detecting novel anomaly while maintaining a good performance on the previous task and brings up more flexibility in model architecture.</description>

      <title>Fast and interpretable Support Vector Classification based on the truncated ANOVA decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are an important tool for performing classification on scattered data, where one usually has to deal with many data points in high-dimensional spaces. We propose solving SVMs in primal form using feature maps based on trigonometric functions or wavelets. In small dimensional settings the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and related methods are a powerful tool in order to deal with the considered basis functions. For growing dimensions the classical FFT-based methods become inefficient due to the curse of dimensionality. Therefore, we restrict ourselves to multivariate basis functions, each of which only depends on a small number of dimensions. This is motivated by the well-known sparsity of effects and recent results regarding the reconstruction of functions from scattered data in terms of truncated analysis of variance (ANOVA) decompositions, which makes the resulting model even interpretable in terms of importance of the features as well as their couplings. The usage of small superposition dimensions has the consequence that the computational effort no longer grows exponentially but only polynomially with respect to the dimension. In order to enforce sparsity regarding the basis coefficients, we use the frequently applied $\ell_2$-norm and, in addition, $\ell_1$-norm regularization. The found classifying function, which is the linear combination of basis functions, and its variance can then be analyzed in terms of the classical ANOVA decomposition of functions. Based on numerical examples we show that we are able to recover the signum of a function that perfectly fits our model assumptions. Furthermore, we perform classification on different artificial and real-world data sets. We obtain better results with $\ell_1$-norm regularization, both in terms of accuracy and clarity of interpretability.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Character-level Adversarial Attacks for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks in Natural Language Processing apply perturbations in the character or token levels. Token-level attacks, gaining prominence for their use of gradient-based methods, are susceptible to altering sentence semantics, leading to invalid adversarial examples. While character-level attacks easily maintain semantics, they have received less attention as they cannot easily adopt popular gradient-based methods, and are thought to be easy to defend. Challenging these beliefs, we introduce Charmer, an efficient query-based adversarial attack capable of achieving high attack success rate (ASR) while generating highly similar adversarial examples. Our method successfully targets both small (BERT) and large (Llama 2) models. Specifically, on BERT with SST-2, Charmer improves the ASR in 4.84% points and the USE similarity in 8% points with respect to the previous art. Our implementation is available in https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/Charmer.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Interacting Particle Langevin Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and analyses interacting underdamped Langevin algorithms, termed Kinetic Interacting Particle Langevin Monte Carlo (KIPLMC) methods, for statistical inference in latent variable models. We propose a diffusion process that evolves jointly in the space of parameters and latent variables and exploit the fact that the stationary distribution of this diffusion concentrates around the maximum marginal likelihood estimate of the parameters. We then provide two explicit discretisations of this diffusion as practical algorithms to estimate parameters of statistical models. For each algorithm, we obtain nonasymptotic rates of convergence for the case where the joint log-likelihood is strongly concave with respect to latent variables and parameters. In particular, we provide convergence analysis for the diffusion together with the discretisation error, providing convergence rate estimates for the algorithms in Wasserstein-2 distance. We achieve accelerated convergence rates clearly demonstrating improvement in dimension dependence, similar to the underdamped samplers. To demonstrate the utility of the introduced methodology, we provide numerical experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed diffusion for statistical inference and the stability of the numerical integrators utilised for discretisation. Our setting covers a broad number of applications, including unsupervised learning, statistical inference, and inverse problems.</description>

      <title>A unified theory and statistical learning approach for traffic conflict detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10959v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a unified theory and statistical learning approach for traffic conflict detection, addressing the long-existing call for a consistent and comprehensive methodology to evaluate the collision risk emerging in road user interactions. The proposed theory assumes context-dependent probabilistic collision risk and frames conflict detection as assessing this risk by statistical learning of extreme events in daily interactions. Experiments using real-world trajectory data are conducted for demonstration. Firstly, a unified metric for indicating conflicts is trained with lane-changing interactions on German highways. This metric and other existing metrics are then applied to near-crash events from the 100-Car Naturalistic Driving Study in the U.S. for performance comparison. Results of the experiments show that the trained metric provides effective collision warnings, generalises across distinct datasets and traffic environments, covers a broad range of conflict types, and delivers a long-tailed distribution of conflict intensity. Reflecting on these results, the proposed theory ensures consistent evaluation by a generic formulation that encompasses varying assumptions of traffic conflicts; the statistical learning approach then enables a comprehensive consideration of influencing factors such as motion states of road users, environment conditions, and participant characteristics. Therefore, the theory and learning approach jointly provide an explainable and adaptable methodology for conflict detection among different road users and across various interaction scenarios. This promises to reduce accidents and improve overall traffic safety, by enhanced safety assessment of traffic infrastructures, more effective collision warning systems for autonomous driving, and a deeper understanding of road user behaviour in different traffic conditions.</description>

      <title>Pre-processing and Compression: Understanding Hidden Representation Refinement Across Imaging Domains via Intrinsic Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been interest in how geometric properties such as intrinsic dimension (ID) of a neural network's hidden representations change through its layers, and how such properties are predictive of important model behavior such as generalization ability. However, evidence has begun to emerge that such behavior can change significantly depending on the domain of the network's training data, such as natural versus medical images. Here, we further this inquiry by exploring how the ID of a network's learned representations changes through its layers, in essence, characterizing how the network successively refines the information content of input data to be used for predictions. Analyzing eleven natural and medical image datasets across six network architectures, we find that how ID changes through the network differs noticeably between natural and medical image models. Specifically, medical image models peak in representation ID earlier in the network, implying a difference in the image features and their abstractness that are typically used for downstream tasks in these domains. Additionally, we discover a strong correlation of this peak representation ID with the ID of the data in its input space, implying that the intrinsic information content of a model's learned representations is guided by that of the data it was trained on. Overall, our findings emphasize notable discrepancies in network behavior between natural and non-natural imaging domains regarding hidden representation information content, and provide further insights into how a network's learned features are shaped by its training data.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Framework for Spatial Interpolation: Merging Data-driven with Domain Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating spatially distributed information through the interpolation of scattered observation datasets often overlooks the critical role of domain knowledge in understanding spatial dependencies. Additionally, the features of these data sets are typically limited to the spatial coordinates of the scattered observation locations. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates data-driven spatial dependency feature extraction with rule-assisted spatial dependency function mapping to augment domain knowledge. We demonstrate the superior performance of our framework in two comparative application scenarios, highlighting its ability to capture more localized spatial features in the reconstructed distribution fields. Furthermore, we underscore its potential to enhance nonlinear estimation capabilities through the application of transformed fuzzy rules and to quantify the inherent uncertainties associated with the observation data sets. Our framework introduces an innovative approach to spatial information estimation by synergistically combining observational data with rule-assisted domain knowledge.</description>
