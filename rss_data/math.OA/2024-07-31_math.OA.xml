      <title>Abstract semiclassical analysis of the van Hove model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the semiclassical limit $\hslash\to 0$ of a completely solvable model in quantum field theory: the van Hove model, describing a scalar field created and annihilated by an immovable source. Despite its simplicity, the van Hove model possesses many characterizing features of quantum fields, especially in the infrared region. In particular, the existence of non-Fock ground and equilibrium states in the presence of infrared singular sources makes a representation-independent algebraic approach of utmost importance. We make use of recent representation-independent techniques of infinite dimensional semiclassical analysis to establish the Bohr correspondence principle for the dynamics, equilibrium states, and long-time asymptotics in the van Hove model.</description>

      <title>Unitary Easy Quantum Groups Arising as Quantum Symmetries of Graph C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2009, T. Banica and R. Speicher introduced the orthogonal easy quantum group which can be completely determined using the combinatorics of set partitions. Later, P. Tarrago and M. Weber extended this formulation to another special class of compact matrix quantum groups, known as unitary easy quantum groups, which are quantum subgroups of the free unitary quantum group ($U_n^+$) containing $S_n$. On the other hand, the quantum symmetry of graph $C^{*}$-algebras has been explored by several mathematicians within different categories in the past few years. In this article, we establish that there are exactly three families of unitary easy quantum groups that can be achieved as the quantum symmetry of graph $C^*$-algebra $C^*(\Gamma)$ associated with a finite, connected, directed graph $\Gamma$ in the category introduced by Joardar and Mandal. Moreover, we demonstrate that there does not exist any graph $C^*$-algebra associated with a finite, connected, directed graph $\Gamma$ having $A_{U^t}(F^{\Gamma})$ as the quantum automorphism group of $C^*(\Gamma)$ for non-scalar matrix $F^{\Gamma}$.</description>
