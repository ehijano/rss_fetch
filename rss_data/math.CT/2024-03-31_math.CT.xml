      <title>Relativized universal algebra via partial Horn logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algebraic theories, sometimes called equational theories, are syntactic notions given by finitary operations and equations, such as monoids, groups, and rings. There is a well-known category-theoretic treatment of them that algebraic theories are equivalent to finitary monads on $\mathbf{Set}$. In this paper, using partial Horn theories, we syntactically generalize such an equivalence to arbitrary locally presentable categories from $\mathbf{Set}$; the corresponding algebraic concepts relative to locally presentable categories are called relative algebraic theories. Finally, we give a framework for universal algebra relative to locally presentable categories by generalizing Birkhoff's variety theorem.</description>

      <title>On Monadic Vector-Valued Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent times, there has been a growing interest in a structuralist understanding of probability, measure and integration theory. The present thesis contributes to this programme in three ways. First, we construct a commutative probability monad on the cartesian closed category of hk-spaces (also known as CGWH spaces, or weak Hausdorff k-spaces in the literature). Secondly, in order to achieve this in a seamless way, we develop the theory of paired linear hk-spaces, a functional-analytic category tailored to the duality between measures and functionals. Finally, vector-valued integration emerges naturally from the free-forgetful adjunction between paired linear hk-spaces and hk-spaces, inducing a commutative monad of compactly supported measures and leading to a theory of monadic vector-valued integration.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gradient Descent is a Hypergraph Functor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cartesian reverse derivative categories (CRDCs) provide an axiomatic generalization of the reverse derivative, which allows generalized analogues of classic optimization algorithms such as gradient descent to be applied to a broad class of problems. In this paper, we show that generalized gradient descent with respect to a given CRDC induces a hypergraph functor from a hypergraph category of optimization problems to a hypergraph category of dynamical systems. The domain of this functor consists of objective functions that are 1) general in the sense that they are defined with respect to an arbitrary CRDC, and 2) open in that they are decorated spans that can be composed with other such objective functions via variable sharing. The codomain is specified analogously as a category of general and open dynamical systems for the underlying CRDC. We describe how the hypergraph functor induces a distributed optimization algorithm for arbitrary composite problems specified in the domain. To illustrate the kinds of problems our framework can model, we show that parameter sharing models in multitask learning, a prevalent machine learning paradigm, yield a composite optimization problem for a given choice of CRDC. We then apply the gradient descent functor to this composite problem and describe the resulting distributed gradient descent algorithm for training parameter sharing models.</description>

      <title>Representing Knowledge and Querying Data using Double-Functorial Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Category theory offers a mathematical foundation for knowledge representation and database systems. Popular existing approaches model a database instance as a functor into the category of sets and functions, or as a 2-functor into the 2-category of sets, relations, and implications. The functional and relational models are unified by double functors into the double category of sets, functions, relations, and implications. In an accessible, example-driven style, we show that the abstract structure of a 'double category of relations' is a flexible and expressive language in which to represent knowledge, and we show how queries on data in the spirit of Codd's relational algebra are captured by double-functorial semantics.</description>

      <title>Twisted simplicial distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theory of twisted simplicial distributions on simplicial principal bundles, which allow us to capture Bell's non-locality, and the more general notion of quantum contextuality. We leverage the classical theory of simplicial principal bundles, as well as structures on categories of such bundles, to provide powerful computational tools for analyzing twisted distributions in terms of both direct constructions in simplicial sets and techniques from homological algebra. We use these techniques to analyze our key examples: quantum distributions and operator-theoretic polytopes used in the classical simulation of quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Endomorphism Algebras of Equivariant Exceptional Collections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an action of a finite group on a triangulated category with a suitable strong exceptional collection, a construction of Elagin produces an associated strong exceptional collection on the equivariant category. We prove that the endomorphism algebra of the induced exceptional collection is the basic reduction of the skew group algebra of the endomorphism algebra of the original exceptional collection.</description>

      <title>Liftings of point-wise finite dimensional persistence modules over local commutative Artinian rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{k}$ be a field and let $V: \mathscr{C} \to \mathbf{k}\textup{-Mod}$ be a point-wise finite dimensional persistence modules, where $\mathscr{C}$ is a small category. Assume that for all local Artinian $\mathbf{k}$-algebras $R$ with residue field isomorphic to $\mathbf{k}$, there is a generalized persistence module $M: \mathscr{C} \to R\textup{-Mod}$, such that for all $x\in \mathrm{Ob}(\mathscr{C})$, $M(x)$ is free over $R$ with finite rank and $\mathbf{k}\otimes_R M(x)\cong V(x)$. If $V$ is a direct sum of indecomposable persistence modules $V_I: \mathscr{C}\to \mathbf{k}\textup{-Mod}$ with endomorphism ring isomorphic to $\mathbf{k}$, then $M$ is a direct sum of indecomposables $M_I:\mathscr{C}\to R\textup{-Mod}$ with endomorphism ring isomorphic to $R$</description>

      <title>Linear Arboreal Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arboreal categories, introduced by Abramsky and Reggio, axiomatise categories with tree-shaped objects. These categories provide a categorical language for formalising behavioural notions such as simulation, bisimulation, and resource-indexing. In this paper, we strengthen the axioms of an arboreal category to exclude `branching' behaviour, obtaining a notion of `linear arboreal category'. We then demonstrate that every arboreal category satisfying a linearisability condition has an associated linear arboreal subcategory related via an adjunction. This identifies the relationship between the pebble-relation comonad, of Montacute and Shah, and the pebbling comonad, of Abramsky, Dawar, and Wang, and generalises it further. As another outcome of this new framework, we obtain a linear variant of the arboreal category for modal logic. By doing so we recover different linear-time equivalences between transition systems as instances of their categorical definitions. We conclude with new preservation and characterisation theorems relating trace inclusion and trace equivalence with different linear fragments of modal logic.</description>
