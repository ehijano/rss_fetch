      <title>Blast wave induced unsteady flow at the shock tube opening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shock tubes have been a crucial device, facilitating studies across a wide range of practical applications. An open-ended shock tube employing the wire-explosion technique with a rectangular cross section is used in the present study to generate blast waves over a Mach number range of 1.2-1.8, enabling detailed investigation of unsteady compressible flow at the tube opening. The blast wave produces a complex flow field comprising a compressible vortex ring with a trailing jet, and several transient structures, including embedded shocks, inward-moving shock or reverse shocks, shear layers, and Prandtl-Meyer expansion fans. An approximate model based on a power-law density profile describes the blast evolution inside and outside the tube, with the equivalent source deduced from measured shock trajectories. The blast wave-tube exit interaction is analyzed using the method of characteristics with alternate exit boundary conditions. A steady-pressure outlet best reproduces experimental observations, predicting supersonic efflux, embedded shocks, expansion waves, and circulation production. Several previously unreported unsteady features, including reverse shock or "reshock" formation and embedded shock shedding, are documented. The findings highlight the intricate dynamics of various features associated with such highly transient, blast-driven flows emanating from an open-ended shock tube.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification in Resolvent Analysis of Experimental Wall-Bounded Turbulent Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental mean flows are commonly used to study wall-bounded turbulence. However, these measurements are often unable to resolve the near-wall region and thus introduce ambiguity in the velocity closest to the wall. This poses a source of uncertainty in equation-based approaches that rely on these mean flow measurements such as resolvent analysis. Resolvent analysis provides a scale-dependent decomposition of the linearized Navier Stokes equations that identifies optimal gains, response modes and forcing modes that has been used to great effect in turbulent wall-bounded flows. Its potential in the development of predictive tools for a variety of wall-bounded flows is high but the limitations of the input data must be addressed. Here, we quantify the sensitivity of resolvent analysis to common sources of experimental uncertainty and show that this sensitivity can be quantified with minimal additional computational cost. This approach is applied to both local and biglobal resolvent analysis by using artificial disturbances to mean profiles in the former and particle image velocimetry measurements with differing near-wall fits in the latter. We also highlight an example where poor near-wall resolution can lead to erroneous conclusions compared to the full-resolution data in an adverse pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer.</description>

      <title>Jet drop production from bubbles with neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bubbles bursting at the surface of the ocean produce drops that heavily influence ocean-atmosphere interactions. One of the mechanisms through which drops are formed is called jet drop production, where the collapse of the bubble cavity leads to the formation of a fast upwards jet that breaks to form drops. While isolated bubble bursting has been extensively studied, bubbles are often found in rafts (for instance in the ocean surface or a sparkling wine glass) and the understanding of collective effects remains more limited. We investigate experimentally how jet drop formation is modified by the presence of neighboring bubbles during the collapse. With the help of multiple high speed views of the collapsing bubble, we show how a change of cavity shape during collapse leads to the selection of smaller, faster, and more numerous drops. The size of the emitted drops is monotonically reduced with increasing number of neighboring bubbles (up to six for hexagonal packing) with the size reduction reaching a factor 5. The drop size distribution associated with bubbles arranged in rafts of various sizes is therefore much wider than in the case of isolated bubbles, and with a peak shifted to smaller sizes.</description>

      <title>Evaluating simulation techniques for lubricant distribution in gearboxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient lubrication is crucial for the performance and durability of high-speed gearboxes, particularly under varying load conditions. Excess lubrication leads to increased churning losses, while insufficient lubrication accelerates wear on contact surfaces. Due to the high rotational speeds involved, direct experimental visualization of lubricant distribution within gearboxes is challenging, making numerical simulations indispensable. Although various modelling approaches exist, a direct comparison that jointly evaluates accuracy and computational efficiency is missing. Furthermore, studies on the computational modelling of highly viscous lubricants such as grease in gearboxes are limited. This study addresses these gaps by comparing two mesh-based Eulerian solvers (OpenFOAM and Ansys-Fluent) and two Lagrangian particle-based solvers (PreonLab and MESHFREE) for oil distribution in gearboxes. Two benchmark cases are considered: one for qualitative assessment and another for quantitative evaluation. OpenFOAM and Ansys-Fluent show good agreement with the experiment data in selected cases, but incur a significant computational cost. PreonLab performs well qualitatively, yet exhibits greater deviation in quantitative predictions. These comparisons provide information for selecting the suitable solver according to specific simulation requirements. Furthermore, the study extends to grease distribution by first validating the solver and then investigating the influence of filling volume and gear speed on the amount of grease deposited on gears. The benchmark cases presented provide a reference framework for evaluating additional solvers in future gearbox lubrication studies.</description>

      <title>Bubble damping of non-stationary oscillatory flow stabilization in microfluidic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherent instability of oscillatory flows presents a significant challenge in microfluidics, impairing performance in different applications from particle detachemnt to organs-on-a-chip. Trapped air inside a microfluidic system passively dampens these fluctuations because of the compressible nature of air. However, a foundational theoretical model that describes this effect has remained elusive. Here, a first-principles model that fully characterizes the effects of a trapped air volume in oscillatory microfluidic flow is derived. The model identifies a dimensionless product as the governing parameter, unifying the interplay between air compressibility and fluidic resistance. It precisely predicts the volume displacement dynamics of the liquid front, which compared with the original flow, it presents amplitude reduction, phase shift, and transient drift. The theoretical framework was validated with different experiments across a broad range of conditions. This work transforms trapped air from a source of unpredictability into a powerful, predictable element for tailoring oscillatory flow stability, providing a rigorous design tool for microfluidic systems.</description>

      <title>Extraction of Moment Closures for Strongly Non-Equilibrium Flows via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a machine learning framework for moment-equation modeling of rarefied gas flows, addressing strongly non-equilibrium conditions inaccessible to conventional computational fluid dynamics. Our approach utilizes high-order moments and collision integrals, highly sensitive to non-equilibrium effects, as key predictive variables. Training datasets are created from one-dimensional steady shock simulations, and a methodology of computing collision integrals is developed. By learning thermodynamically consistent closures directly from DSMC data, our R13-ML model, combined with a discontinuous Galerkin solver for the transfer equations of moments, preserves physical structure and accurately predicts normal shock structures and generalizes to hypersonic and some unsteady, one-dimensional wave scenarios. This work bridges machine learning with continuum mechanics, offering a road map for high-fidelity aerothermal predictions in next-generation supersonic vehicles.</description>

      <title>Importance of the continuous spectrum in the excitation of sheared surface gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial value problem is solved for the excitation of long surface gravity waves in a continuously sheared flow. This reveals the presence of a continuous spectrum along side the standard normal modes of gravity wave propagation. An analytical similarity solution for the evolution of the free surface displacement from the continuous spectrum is found for the impulse response to surface excitation. It is demonstrated that the continuous spectrum contribution can be a significant fraction of the surface response, with the amplitude of the continuous spectrum exceeding that of the upstream gravity wave mode for Froude numbers of order unity. The Landau damped mode description of the continuous spectrum is found to provide a link between methods using dispersion relations for phase speeds within the range of the velocity profile, and the variable-shear profiles that do not admit normal modes in this range.</description>

      <title>Two-point Turbulence Closures in Physical Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a predictive two-point statistical closure framework for turbulence formulated in physical space. A closure model for ensemble-averaged, incompressible homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) is developed as a starting point to demonstrate the viability of the approach in more general flows. The evolution equation for the longitudinal correlation function is derived in a discrete form, circumventing the need for a Fourier transformation. The formulation preserves the near-exact representation of the linear terms, a defining feature of rapid distortion theory. The closure of the nonlinear higher-order moments follows the phenomenological principles of the Eddy-Damped Quasi-Normal Markovian (EDQNM) model of Orszag (1970). Several key differences emerge from the physical-space treatment, including the need to evaluate a matrix exponential in the evolution equation and the appearance of triple integrals arising from the non-local nature of the pressure-Poisson equation. This framework naturally incorporates non-local length-scale information into the evolution of turbulence statistics. Verification of the physical-space two-point closure is performed by comparison with direct numerical simulations of statistically stationary forced HIT and with classical EDQNM predictions for decaying HIT. Finally, extensions to inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulence are discussed, emphasizing advantages in applications where spectral methods are ill-conditioned, such as compressible flows with discontinuities.</description>

      <title>Convective flux analysis on the propagation mechanism of oblique detonation waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to investigate the propagation mechanism of oblique detonation waves using the vector flux analysis method through numerical simulations. A two-dimensional numerical study is conducted on stoichiometric hydrogen-air oblique detonation waves based on the conservative Euler equations and a one-step global chemical reaction model. The wedge angle is 25{\deg}, with a freestream static temperature of 851.5 K, velocity of 2473.4 m/s, and pressure of 42.5 kPa. The motion mechanism of transverse waves is analyzed using the vector flux method. The results show that the oblique detonation front consists of three regions: an induction zone, an overdriven detonation zone, and a transverse-wave region. Under different activation energies, only either upward-propagating or downward-propagating transverse waves exist on the oblique detonation front; the two do not occur simultaneously. At low activation energy, downward-propagating transverse waves dominate, whereas at high activation energy, upward-propagating transverse waves appear.</description>

      <title>HFNO: an interpretable data-driven decomposition strategy for turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have demonstrated exceptional accuracy in mapping functional spaces by leveraging Fourier transforms to establish a connection with underlying physical principles. However, their opaque inner workings often constitute an obstacle to physical interpretability. This work introduces Hierarchical Fourier Neural Operators (HFNOs), a novel FNO-based architecture tailored for reduced-order modeling of turbulent fluid flows, designed to enhance interpretability by explicitly separating fluid behavior across scales. The proposed architecture processes wavenumber bins in parallel, enabling the approximation of dispersion relations and non-linear interactions. Inputs are lifted to a higher-dimensional space, Fourier-transformed, and partitioned into wavenumber bins. Each bin is processed by a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN), with outputs subsequently padded, summed, and inverse-transformed back into physical space. A final transformation refines the output in physical space as a correction model, by means of one of the following architectures: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Echo State Network (ESN). We evaluate the proposed model on a series of increasingly complex dynamical systems: first on the one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, then on the two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow, and finally on the prediction of wall shear stress in turbulent channel flow, given the near-wall velocity field. In all test cases, the model demonstrates its ability to decompose turbulent flows across various scales, opening up the possibility of increased interpretability and multiscale modeling of such flows.</description>

      <title>The dual solution stability gap bounded by sub- and supercritical geometric thresholds in steady shock reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the significance of the lower geometric limit, defined as the trailing-edge height at which the reflected shock grazes the trailing edge, for both regular reflection (RR) and Mach reflection (MR). We show that this lower limit for MR is greater than that for RR, within the dual-solution domain away from its lower and left boundaries. We thus identify a dual-solution stability gap lying between the subcritical threshold (the lower limit for RR) and the supercritical threshold (the lower limit for MR). Within this gap RR is stable while MR is unstable, implying a new dynamic transition possiblity there: a steady RR configuration (start flow) can undergo a dynamic transition to an unstable MR state (unstart flow) under suitable disturbance of density or other flow parameters. Numerical simulations confirm the existence of this stability gap and illustrate the time history of dynamic transitions, including (1) direct transitions from RR to MR to unstart flow, with complex flow structures such as hybrid MR-type VI shock interference and double MR -- MR reflections, and (2) inverted transitions, in which RR first shifts to MR and then returns back to RR.</description>

      <title>Constraint Penalization Method in the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) for Fluid-Structure Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A constraint penalization method is introduced within the Lattice Boltzmann (LBM) framework to model fluid-structure interactions involving rigid bodies. The proposed approach extends the fictitious domain concept by enforcing the rigid-body motion through a penalization term directly applied to the fluid velocity field, eliminating the need for explicit Lagrange multipliers or interface force computation. This formulation preserves the locality and simplicity of the LBM algorithm while ensuring an implicit coupling between the fluid and solid regions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the method accurately reproduces rigid-body motion and hydrodynamic interactions with minimal additional computational cost. The method is applied to particle sedimentation, starting with a simple example and progressing to increasingly complex cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of droplets on concave surfaces is poorly understood, although it is relevant to a mode of dispersal that has evolved independently in several species of plants and fungi. This mode relies on splash-cups, specialized organs that use raindrops to disperse reproductive units away from the parent organism. We investigated the impact of droplets on conical cavities that mimic splash-cups and we found that such impact may lead to the formation of two types of jets, which appear essential for dispersal in nature. We built a minimal kinematic model that explains jet formation, involving the motion of fluid particles along geodesics (shortest paths) on the cone surface and we predicted cone angles that optimize jet formation, consistent with the geometries of natural splash-cups</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Gauss--Jacobi Quadrature for Multiscale Boltzmann Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discretization of velocity space plays a crucial role in the accuracy and efficiency of multiscale Boltzmann solvers. Conventional velocity space discretization methods suffer from uneven node distribution and mismatch issues, limiting the performance of numerical simulations. To address this, a Gaussian quadrature scheme with a parameterized weight function is proposed, combined with a polar coordinate transformation for flexible discretization of velocity space. This method effectively mitigates node mismatch problems encountered in traditional approaches. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly improves accuracy while reducing computational cost. Under highly rarefied conditions, the proposed method achieves a speed-up of up to 50 times compared to the conventional Newton-Cotes quadrature, offering an efficient tool with broad applicability for numerical simulations of rarefied and multiscale gas flows.</description>

      <title>Emergent clusters in strongly confined systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven suspensions, where energy is input at a particle scale, are a framework for understanding general principles of out-of-equilibrium organization. A large number of simple interacting units can give rise to non-trivial structure and hierarchy. Rotationally driven colloidal particles are a particularly nice model system for exploring this pattern formation, as the dominant interaction between the particles is hydrodynamic. Here, we use experiments and large-scale simulations to explore how strong confinement alters dynamics and emergent structure at the particle scale in these driven suspensions. Surprisingly, we find that large-scale (many times the particle size) density fluctuations emerge as a result of confinement, and that these density fluctuations sensitively depend on the degree of confinement. We extract a characteristic length scale for these fluctuations, demonstrating that the simulations quantitatively reproduce the experimental pattern. Moreover, we show that these density fluctuations are a result of the large-scale recirculating flow generated by the rotating particles inside a sealed chamber. This surprising result shows that even when system boundaries are far away, they can cause qualitative changes to mesoscale structure and ordering.</description>

      <title>Improving the Robustness of Control of Chaotic Convective Flows with Domain-Informed Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaotic convective flows arise in many real-world systems, such as microfluidic devices and chemical reactors. Stabilizing these flows is highly desirable but remains challenging, particularly in chaotic regimes where conventional control methods often fail. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise for control in laminar flow settings, but its ability to generalize and remain robust under chaotic and turbulent dynamics is not well explored, despite being critical for real-world deployment. In this work, we improve the practical feasibility of RL-based control of such flows focusing on Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection (RBC), a canonical model for convective heat transport. To enhance generalization and sample efficiency, we introduce domain-informed RL agents that are trained using Proximal Policy Optimization across diverse initial conditions and flow regimes. We incorporate domain knowledge in the reward function via a term that encourages B\'enard cell merging, as an example of a desirable macroscopic property. In laminar flow regimes, the domain-informed RL agents reduce convective heat transport by up to 33%, and in chaotic flow regimes, they still achieve a 10% reduction, which is significantly better than the conventional controllers used in practice. We compare the domain-informed to uninformed agents: Our results show that the domain-informed reward design results in steady flows, faster convergence during training, and generalization across flow regimes without retraining. Our work demonstrates that elegant domain-informed priors can greatly enhance the robustness of RL-based control of chaotic flows, bringing real-world deployment closer.</description>

      <title>Broadband traveling wave generation using acoustic black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies the effectiveness of acoustic black holes to generate broadband non-reflective traveling waves using a single excitation source. This is inspired by similar observations in the basilar membrane of the mammalian inner ear. An aluminum beam is machined to introduce a gradual, asymmetric power-law taper at one of its ends. This tapered termination was then partially covered by viscoelastic tape to enhance the acoustic black hole effect in the system. This setup is then used to validate a model developed based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. Following good agreement between the model and the experimental setup over a broad excitation frequency range (1 kHz to 10 kHz), the model is used to conduct a parametric study investigating the effects of different variables on the system's response. This study revealed the effectiveness of acoustic black holes in sustaining traveling waves over a broad frequency range. By optimizing parameters, such as the power-law order, one can significantly enhance this effect. This is especially noticeable towards the lower-frequency end.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving Physics-Informed Neural Network for the Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a flexible framework for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), yet conventional implementations often fail to preserve key physical invariants during long-term integration. This paper introduces a \emph{structure-preserving PINN} framework for the nonlinear Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) equation, a prototypical model for nonlinear and dispersive wave propagation. The proposed method embeds the conservation of mass and Hamiltonian energy directly into the loss function, ensuring physically consistent and energy-stable evolution throughout training and prediction. Unlike standard \texttt{tanh}-based PINNs~\cite{raissi2019pinn,wang2022modifiedpinn}, our approach employs sinusoidal activation functions that enhance spectral expressiveness and accurately capture the oscillatory and dispersive nature of KdV solitons. Through representative case studies -- including single-soliton propagation (shape-preserving translation), two-soliton interaction (elastic collision with phase shift), and cosine-pulse initialization (nonlinear dispersive breakup) -- the model successfully reproduces hallmark behaviors of KdV dynamics while maintaining conserved invariants. Ablation studies demonstrate that combining invariant-constrained optimization with sinusoidal feature mappings accelerates convergence, improves long-term stability, and mitigates drift without multi-stage pretraining. These results highlight that computationally efficient, invariant-aware regularization coupled with sinusoidal representations yields robust, energy-consistent PINNs for Hamiltonian partial differential equations such as the KdV equation.</description>

      <title>Phase Separation Dynamics and Active Turbulence in a Binary Fluid Mixture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active matter, encompassing natural systems, converts surrounding energy to sustain autonomous motion, exhibiting unique non-equilibrium behaviors such as active turbulence and motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). In this study, we present a novel two-fluids model considering dynamics of the Cahn-Hilliard (CH) model for phase separation with Beris-Edwards nematohydrodynamics equation for orientational order and two distinct momentum equations for active and passive fluids coupled by viscous drag. A phase field-based lattice Boltzmann method is used to investigate the existence of active turbulence and phase separation in the binary mixture. We analyze micro-phase separated domain under extensile and contractile stresses, long the statistical properties of turbulent flow. Key parameters, like active parameter, tumbling parameter and elastic constant, affect the characteristic scale of flow. Our findings show that the interaction of active stress and two-fluid hydrodynamics leads to complex non-equilibrium pattern formation. This offers insights into biological and synthetic active materials.</description>

      <title>Thermoacoustic internal gravity wave turbulence in the Earth's lower atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose, for the first time, a two-dimensional model for the nonlinear coupling of internal gravity and thermal waves in the presence of temperature-dependent density inhomogeneity due to thermal expansion and thermal feedback in stratified fluids of the Earth's lower atmosphere ($0-50$ km). Such a coupling gives rise to the evolution of thermoacoustic internal gravity waves (IGWs), which are distinctive from the known IGWs in the literature. We perform numerical simulations to study the nonlinear interactions of velocity and density perturbations associated with the IGWs and thermal fluctuations corresponding to the thermal mode. We show that solitary vortices of IGWs coupled to the thermal wave can lead to thermoacoustic turbulence. We observe the formation of large-scale velocity potential flows and small-scale structures in the density and temperature profiles. Interestingly, while the wave energy spectra exhibit power laws: $ k_x^{-1.67}$ and $ k_z^{-2.89}$, respectively, for horizontal and vertical wave numbers, in the troposphere ($0-15$ km) with negative temperature gradient, the same in the stratosphere ($15-50$ km) with positive temperature gradient tend to relax toward $k_x^{-1.83}$-horizontal and $k_z^{-1.03}$-vertical spectra. We find that while the energy spectra in the tropospheric turbulence are consistent with the observed phenomena without temperature gradients, those in the stratosphere differ.</description>

      <title>Modeling dust dynamics in OpenGadget3 -- I. SPH implementation of the One-Fluid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dust dynamics plays a critical role in astrophysical processes and has been modeled in hydrodynamical simulations using various approaches. Among particle-based methods like Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), the One-Fluid model has proven to be highly effective for simulating gas-dust mixtures. This study presents the implementation of the One-Fluid model in OpenGadget3, introducing improvements to the original formulation. These enhancements include time-dependent artificial viscosity and conductivity, as well as a novel treatment of dust diffusion using a pressure-like term. The improved model is tested using a suite of dust dynamics benchmark problems: DUSTYBOX, DUSTYWAVE, and DUSTYSHOCK, with the latter extended to multidimensional scenarios, as well as a dusty Sedov-Taylor blast wave. Additional tests include simulations of Cold Keplerian Disks, dusty protoplanetary disks, and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities to evaluate the model's robustness in more complex flows. The implementation successfully passes all standard benchmark tests. It demonstrates stability and accuracy in both simple and complex simulations. The new diffusion term improves the handling of flows with large dust-to-gas ratios and low drag coefficients, although limitations of the One-Fluid model in these regimes remain. The enhanced One-Fluid model is a reliable and robust tool for simulating dust dynamics in OpenGadget3. While it retains some limitations inherent to the original formulation, the introduced improvements expand its applicability and address some challenges in gas-dust dynamics.</description>

      <title>An Adjoint Method for Differentiable Fluid Simulation on Flow Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel adjoint solver for differentiable fluid simulation based on bidirectional flow maps. Our key observation is that the forward fluid solver and its corresponding backward, adjoint solver share the same flow map as the forward simulation. In the forward pass, this map transports fluid impulse variables from the initial frame to the current frame to simulate vortical dynamics. In the backward pass, the same map propagates adjoint variables from the current frame back to the initial frame to compute gradients. This shared long-range map allows the accuracy of gradient computation to benefit directly from improvements in flow map construction. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel adjoint solver that solves the adjoint equations directly on the flow map, enabling long-range and accurate differentiation of incompressible flows without differentiating intermediate numerical steps or storing intermediate variables, as required in conventional adjoint methods. To further improve efficiency, we propose a long-short time-sparse flow map representation for evolving adjoint variables. Our approach has low memory usage, requiring only 6.53GB of data at a resolution of $192^3$ while preserving high accuracy in tracking vorticity, enabling new differentiable simulation tasks that require precise identification, prediction, and control of vortex dynamics.</description>

      <title>Wave Attenuation in Drifting Sea Ice: A Mechanistic Model for Observed Decay Profiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave-sea ice interactions shape the transition zone between open ocean and pack ice in the polar regions. Most theoretical paradigms, implemented in coupled wave-sea ice models, predict exponential decay of the wave energy but recent observations deviate from this behaviour. Expanding on a framework based on wave energy dissipation due to ice-water drag, we account for drifting sea ice to derive an improved model for wave energy attenuation. Analytical solutions replicate the observed non-exponential wave energy decay and the spatial evolution of the effective attenuation rate in Antarctic sea ice.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Flux Reconstruction Scheme for Robust Shock Capturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the case of hyperbolic conservation laws, high-order methods, such as the classical DG method, experience the phenomenon of unwanted high-frequency oscillations in the vicinity of a shock. Shock-capturing methods such as artificial dissipation, solution, flux, or TVD limiting are generally used to eliminate non-physical oscillations and provide bounds on physical quantities. For entropy-stable schemes, the additional objective would be to retain provable entropy dissipation guarantees of the underlying scheme, i.e. subcell limiting or entropy filtering [1, 2, 3, 4]. The nonlinearly-stable flux reconstruction (NSFR) semi-discretization given in Eq. 7 with a suitable flux reconstruction scheme has been demonstrated to mitigate spurious oscillations in the presence of shock discontinuities and at CFL values substantially larger than the DG variant of the NSFR scheme whilst retaining the property of entropy stability [5]. NSFR schemes achieve this by introducing an alternative lifting operator for surface numerical flux penalization, albeit at the expense of accuracy. In this technical note, we present an adaptive approach to the choice of the lifting operator employed, which maintains higher accuracy and allows for larger CFL values while retaining the underlying provable attributes of the scheme. While it cannot eliminate oscillations such as the aforementioned shock-capturing methods, together with a positivity-preserving limiter, the scheme provides for solutions that are essentially oscillation-free.</description>

      <title>Capillary and priming pressures control the penetration of yield-stress fluids through non-wetting 2D meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forcing hydrophilic fluids through hydrophobic porous solids is a recurrent industrial challenge. If the penetrating fluid is Newtonian, the imposed pressure has to overcome the capillary pressure at the fluid-air interface in a pore. The presence of a yield-stress, however, makes the pressure transfer and the penetration significantly more complex. In this study, we experimentally investigate the forced penetration of a water based yield-stress fluid through a regular hydrophobic mesh under quasi-static conditions, combining quantitative pressure measurements and direct visualisation of the penetration process. We reveal that the penetration is controlled by a competition between the yield-stress and two distinct pressures. The capillary pressure, that dictates the threshold at which the yield-stress fluid penetrates the hydrophobic mesh, and a priming pressure, that controls how the fluid advances through it. The latter corresponds to a pressure drop ensuing a local capillary instability, never reported before. Our findings shine a new light on forced imbibition processes, with direct implications on their fundamental understanding and practical engineering.</description>

      <title>Towards Multi-Fidelity Scaling Laws of Neural Surrogates in CFD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling laws describe how model performance grows with data, parameters and compute. While large datasets can usually be collected at relatively low cost in domains such as language or vision, scientific machine learning is often limited by the high expense of generating training data through numerical simulations. However, by adjusting modeling assumptions and approximations, simulation fidelity can be traded for computational cost, an aspect absent in other domains. We investigate this trade-off between data fidelity and cost in neural surrogates using low- and high-fidelity Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations. Reformulating classical scaling laws, we decompose the dataset axis into compute budget and dataset composition. Our experiments reveal compute-performance scaling behavior and exhibit budget-dependent optimal fidelity mixes for the given dataset configuration. These findings provide the first study of empirical scaling laws for multi-fidelity neural surrogate datasets and offer practical considerations for compute-efficient dataset generation in scientific machine learning.</description>

      <title>FLRONet: Deep Operator Learning for High-Fidelity Fluid Flow Field Reconstruction from Sparse Sensor Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08009v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity fluid flow fields from sparse sensor measurements is vital for many science and engineering applications but remains challenging because of dimensional disparities between state and observational spaces. Due to such dimensional differences, the measurement operator becomes ill-conditioned and non-invertible, making the reconstruction of flow fields from sensor measurements extremely difficult. Although sparse optimization and machine learning address the above problems to some extent, questions about their generalization and efficiency remain, particularly regarding the discretization dependence of these models. In this context, deep operator learning offers a better solution as this approach models mappings between infinite-dimensional functional spaces, enabling superior generalization and discretization-independent reconstruction. We introduce FLRONet, a deep operator learning framework that is trained to reconstruct fluid flow fields from sparse sensor measurements. FLRONet employs a branch-trunk network architecture to represent the inverse measurement operator that maps sensor observations to the original flow field, a continuous function of both space and time. Validation performed on the CFDBench dataset has demonstrated that FLRONet consistently achieves high levels of reconstruction accuracy and robustness, even in scenarios where sensor measurements are inaccurate or missing. Furthermore, the operator learning approach endows FLRONet with the capability to perform zero-shot super-resolution in both spatial and temporal domains, offering a solution for rapid reconstruction of high-fidelity flow fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum vortices leave a macroscopic signature in the normal fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the remarkable properties of quantum turbulence in superfluid helium II, consisting of a disordered tangle of quantised vortex lines which interact with each other and reconnect when they collide. According to Landau's two-fluid theory, these vortex lines move in a surrounding of thermal excitations called the normal fluid. Until now, the normal fluid has often been considered a passive background which simply provides the vortex lines with a mechanism for dissipating their kinetic energy into heat. Using a model which fully takes into account the two-way interaction between the vortex lines and the normal fluid, here we show numerically that each vortex line creates a macroscopic wake in the normal fluid that can be larger than the average distance between vortex lines; this is surprising, given the microscopic size of the superfluid vortex cores which induce these wakes. We show that in heat transfer experiments, the flow of the normal fluid can therefore be described as the superposition of an imposed uniform flow and wakes generated by the vortex lines, leading to non-classical statistics of the normal fluid velocity. We also argue that this first evidence of independent fluid structures in the thermal excitations postulated by Landau may be at the root of recent, unaccounted for, experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory flows in three-dimensional deformable microchannels</title>

Abstract: Deformable microchannels emulate a key characteristic of soft biological systems and flexible engineering devices: the flow-induced deformation of the conduit due to slow viscous flow within. Elucidating the two-way coupling between oscillatory flow and deformation of a three-dimensional (3D) rectangular channel is crucial for designing lab- and organ-on-a-chip microsystems and eventually understanding flow-structure instabilities that can enhance mixing and transport. To this end, we determine the axial variations of the primary flow, pressure, and deformation for Newtonian fluids in the canonical geometry of a slender (long) and shallow (wide) 3D rectangular channel with a deformable top wall under the assumption of weak compliance and without restriction on the oscillation frequency (\textit{i.e.}, on the Womersley number). Unlike rigid conduits, the pressure distribution is not linear with the axial coordinate. To validate this prediction, we design a PDMS-based experimental platform with a speaker-based flow-generation apparatus and a pressure acquisition system with multiple ports along the axial length of the channel. The experimental measurements show good agreement with the predicted pressure profiles across a wide range of the key dimensionless quantities: the Womersley number, the compliance number, and the elastoviscous number. Finally, we explore how the nonlinear flow-deformation coupling leads to self-induced streaming (rectification of the oscillatory flow). Following Zhang and Rallabandi (\textit{J.\ Fluid Mech.}, vol.~996, 2024, A16), we develop a theory for the cycle-averaged pressure based on the primary problem's solution, and we validate the predictions for the axial distribution of the streaming pressure against the experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>The U2H map explains the effect of (sub)mesoscale currents on significant wave height statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Currents modulate the energy of surface gravity waves, leading to spatial inhomogeneities in significant wave height (SWH). Previous work indicates that the overall scale of the inhomogeneities is set by the scale of the currents, that the inhomogeneities are strongly anisotropic even for isotropic currents, and that the rotational and divergent components of the currents have sharply distinct effects. We explain these and other features of current-induced SWH inhomogeneities using the U2H map, a linear relation between SWH and currents deduced from wave-action conservation by making simplifying assumptions. We obtain a linear law relating the spectrum of SWH to the spectra of rotational and divergent kinetic energy of the current. This makes it possible to relate SWH statistics (such as variance and anisotropy) to the current statistics and wave properties including directional spreading.</description>

      <title>Atwood effects on nonlocality of the scalar transport closure in three-dimensional Rayleigh-Taylor mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The importance of nonlocality is assessed in modeling mean scalar transport for turbulent Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) mixing at different Atwood numbers. Building on the two-dimensional incompressible work of Lavacot et al. (2024, JFM), the present work extends the Macroscopic Forcing Method (MFM) to variable density problems in three-dimensional space to measure moments of the generalized eddy diffusivity kernel in RT mixing for increasing Atwood numbers (A=0.05, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8). It is found that as A increases: 1) the eddy diffusivity moments become asymmetric, and 2) the higher-order eddy diffusivity moments become larger relative to the leading-order diffusivity, indicating that nonlocality becomes more important at higher A. There is a particularly strong temporal nonlocality at higher $A$, suggesting stronger history effects. The implications of these findings for closure modeling for finite-Atwood RT are discussed.</description>

      <title>Scale-by-scale kinetic energy flux calculations in simulations of rotating convection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15463v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence is an out-of-equilibrium flow state that is characterised by nonzero net fluxes of kinetic energy between different scales of the flow. These fluxes play a crucial role in the formation of characteristic flow structures in many turbulent flows encountered in nature. However, measuring these energy fluxes in practical settings can be challenging as soon as one moves away from unrestricted turbulence in an idealised periodic box. Here, we focus on rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, being the canonical model system to study geophysical and astrophysical flows. Owing to the effect of rotation, this flow can yield a split cascade, where part of the energy is transported to smaller scales (direct cascade), while another fraction is transported to larger scales (inverse cascade). We compare two different techniques for measuring these energy fluxes throughout the domain: one based on a spatial filtering approach and an adapted Fourier-based method. We show how one can use these methods to measure the energy flux adequately in the anisotropic, aperiodic domains encountered in rotating convection, even in domains with spatial confinement. Our measurements reveal that in the studied regime, the bulk flow is dominated by the direct cascade, while significant inverse cascading action is observed most strongly near the top and bottom plates, due to the vortex merging of Ekman plumes into larger flow structures.</description>

      <title>Hybrid deep learning and iterative methods for accelerated solutions of viscous incompressible flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pressure Poisson equation, central to the fractional step method in incompressible flow simulations, incurs high computational costs due to the iterative solution of large-scale linear systems. To address this challenge, we introduce HyDEA, a novel framework that synergizes deep learning with classical iterative solvers. It leverages the complementary strengths of a DeepONet - capable of capturing large-scale features of the solution - and the CG or a PCG method, which efficiently resolves fine-scale errors. Specifically, within the framework of line-search methods, the DeepONet predicts search directions to accelerate convergence in solving sparse, symmetric-positive-definite linear systems, while the CG/ PCG method ensures robustness through iterative refinement. The framework seamlessly extends to flows over solid structures via the decoupled immersed boundary projection method. Crucially, the DeepONet is trained on fabricated linear systems rather than flow specific data, endowing it with inherent generalization across geometric complexities and Reynolds numbers without retraining. Benchmarks demonstrate superior efficiency and accuracy of HyDEA over the CG/PCG methods for flows with no obstacles, single or multiple stationary obstacles, and one moving obstacle - using fixed network weights. Remarkably, HyDEA also exhibits super-resolution capability: although the DeepONet is trained on a 128*128 grid for Re=1000, the hybrid solver delivers accurate solutions on a 512*512 grid for Re=10000 via interpolation, despite discretizations mismatch. In contrast, a purely data-driven DeepONet fails for complex flows, underscoring the necessity of hybridizing deep learning with iterative methods. Robustness, efficiency, and generalization across geometries, resolutions, and Reynolds numbers of HyDEA highlight its potential as a transformative solver for real world fluid dynamics problems.</description>

Abstract: Starting from the Navier-Stokes equation in the $f$-plane approximation, we provide an exact and explicit solution of the governing equations at leading order for fluid flows in the upper layer of the ocean at mid-latitudes, driven by a wind stress. Such a solution highlights the presence of a mean Ekman current superimposed to trochoidal oscillations and a background geostrophic current.</description>

      <title>Estimation of kinetic dissipation in thermal convection systems based on mechanical energy conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the theoretical analysis of convective heat transfer processes, global kinetic dissipation $\langle\varepsilon_u\rangle$ plays an important role. In this study, we introduce a unified framework to derive the scaling laws for $\langle\varepsilon_u\rangle$ in buoyancy-driven convection by establishing a direct linkage with potential energy conversion. This potential-energy-based approach starting from the distributions of the thermal boundary conditions and the functional forms of the temperature-density relationships provides a rigorous foundation for $\langle\varepsilon_u\rangle$ scaling. The framework reveals an intrinsic distinction between Rayleigh-B\'enard (RBC) and horizontal convection (HC), allowing the derived scaling laws to reproduce the established-yet distinct-results for both systems, while also offering a straightforward way to derive scalings for vertical convection (VC). Importantly, this framework is extended to thermal convection incorporating non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq (NOB) effects. In HC with a non-monotonic temperature-density relation, our analysis reveals a transition in the scaling laws that occurs when thermal plumes reach a height comparable to the cavity height. This transition enables the system to exceed the conventional YP-bound. Through direct numerical simulations (DNS) under different boundary conditions and temperature-density relationships, we quantitatively verify the theoretical analysis based on the new framework. Given the central role of $\langle\varepsilon_u\rangle$ in Grossmann-Lohse (GL) theory, our work provides a new basis for extending GL theory to predict heat transport and flow intensity in NOB and other complex flows, enhancing the theoretical understanding of kinetic dissipation with implications for geophysical and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Resolvent-Based Optimisation for Invariant Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a robust optimisation framework for computing invariant solutions of wall-bounded flows by recasting the Navier-Stokes equations as a variational problem as established in Ashtari and Schneider, JFM (2023). The approach minimises the residual of the governing equations over a finite time horizon, seeking periodic or equilibrium solutions. A novel contribution is made by including a Galerkin projection onto a basis of divergence-free modes that satisfy the no-slip boundary conditions. This projection not only makes the variational framework applicable to wall-bounded flows but it also yields a low-order representation of the dynamics. The basis is derived from resolvent analysis, which provides an orthonormal set. We demonstrate the method on a 2D3C formulation of rotating plane Couette flow, obtaining exact equilibrium and periodic solutions consistent with direct numerical simulations. The conditioning of the optimisation problem is analysed in detail, showing that convergence rates depend on the stability properties of the targeted solutions. Finally, we highlight a direct link between the conditioning of the optimisation and the structure of the resolvent operator, suggesting a unifying perspective on both the efficiency of the optimisation and the dynamical significance of resolvent modes.</description>

      <title>Wake dynamics of a square cylinder while moving upward in quiescent water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the wake dynamics of a square cylinder rising through quiescent water over a range of Froude numbers ($\mathrm{Fr}$). Time-resolved Particle Image Velocimetry provides velocity and vorticity fields that enable pressure reconstruction and vortex characterization. Diagnostics based on swirl strength ($\lambda_{ci}$), the Okubo-Weiss parameter ($W$), and a shear-vortex interaction measure ($\Lambda$) reveal that the wake is governed by a persistent pair of counter-rotating vortices rather than by periodic shedding. Circulation exhibits a two-regime dependence on $\mathrm{Fr}$, with a sharp increase below $\mathrm{Fr}\approx 1$ and saturation above this threshold, mirroring entrainment force scaling reported previously. While vortex area remains nearly constant, swirl strength and negative-$W$ regions expand with $\mathrm{Fr}$, indicating that entrainment enhancement arises from intensified rotation rather than an enlarged vortex footprint. These findings provide new physical insight into vortex-free-surface interactions and enrich the understanding of entrainment mechanisms in unsteady wakes, with implications for multiphase flows and the hydrodynamic design of naval and offshore structures.</description>

      <title>Model-Adaptive Simulation of Hierarchical Shallow Water Moment Equations in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shallow free surface flows are often characterized by both subdomains that require high modeling complexity and subdomains that can be sufficiently accurately modeled with low modeling complexity. Moreover, these subdomains may change in time as the water flows through the domain. This motivates the need for space and time adaptivity in the simulation of shallow free surface flows. In this paper, we develop the first adaptive simulations using the recently developed Shallow Water Moment Equations, which are an extension of the standard Shallow Water Equations that allow for vertically changing velocity profiles by including additional variables and equations. The model-specific modeling complexity of a shallow water moment model is determined by its order. The higher the order of the model, the more variables and equations are included in the model. Shallow water moment models are ideally suited for adaptivity because they are hierarchical such that low-order models and high-order models share the same structure. To enable adaptive simulations, we propose two approaches for the coupling of the varying-order shallow water moment equations at their boundary interfaces. The first approach dynamically updates padded state variables but cannot be written in conservative form, while the second approach uses fixed padded state variable values of zero and reduces to conservative form for conservative moment equations. The switching procedure between high-order models and low-order models is based on a new set of model error estimators, originating from a decomposition of the high-order models. Numerical results of the collision of a dam-break wave with a smooth wave yield accurate results, while achieving speedups up to 60 percent compared to a non-adaptive model with fixed modeling complexity.</description>

      <title>Lost in Latent Space: An Empirical Study of Latent Diffusion Models for Physics Emulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02608v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation, this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we found critical to train latent-space emulators.</description>

      <title>Closing a catenary loop: the lariat chain, the string shooter, and the heavy elastica</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review, critique, and extend results related to the problem of closed loop shape equilibria of a string shooter, a type of catenary consisting of steady, axially moving configurations of an inertial, inextensible, perfectly flexible string in the presence of gravity and drag forces. We highlight recurring misconceptions, and relate to similar problems, including the lariat (no gravity), chain fountain (not closed), and heavy \emph{elastica} (bending stiffness). We focus on the difficulty inherent to continuing a catenary through a vertical orientation, necessary to close a loop, which difficulty changes in nature as the system undergoes bifurcations with increasing drag. We construct solutions by implementing available analytical results, and numerically generate additional solutions with added bending stiffness. We briefly discuss global balances of linear, angular, and pseudo-momentum for this system.</description>
