      <title>Tunable Second-Order Structural Transition in As-Deficient MnAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report measurements of magnetization, specific heat, and thermal expansion performed on As-deficient MnAs single crystals (MnAs$_{0.968}$). Ferromagnetic order is observed near $T_C \simeq$ 306 K on warming and $T_C \simeq$ 302 K on cooling, which is consistent with previously-reported values for stoichiometric MnAs samples. In contrast, the second-order structural phase transition is observed at $T_S \simeq$ 353 K, which is nearly 50 K lower than in the stoichiometric compound. We observe differences in the thermal expansion of our samples when compared to reports of stoichiometric MnAs including: (1) the $\sim$1.5% volume decrease at $T_C$ is smaller than the expected value of 1.9%, (2) the lattice parameters perpendicular to the basal plane exhibit a discontinuous jump of $\sim$1.1% at $T_C$ instead of being continuous across $T_C$, and (3) thermal expansion perpendicular to the basal plane for $T_C \le T \le$ 315 K is negative rather than positive. We also observe a correlation between the ratio of hexagonal lattice parameters, $c/a$, and $T_S$, strongly suggesting that the degree of structural anisotropy in MnAs could play an important role in tuning $T_S$.</description>

      <title>Left-left-right-right magnetic order in spin-1/2 Kitaev-Heisenberg chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a combination of analytical and numerical studies on the phase diagram of the spin-1/2 Kitaev-Heisenberg chain in the region of negative Kitaev and positive Heisenberg couplings. Apart from the antiferromagnetic phase, we find a magnetically ordered phase with left-left-right-right order and a gapless phase with central charge value $c=1$, resolving the existing contradictory results in literature regarding this parameter region. In particular, the origin of the left-left-right-right phase is clarified based on a perturbative Luttinger liquid analysis. Using a coupled-chain method, we further show that the one-dimensional (1D) left-left-right-right order is able to give a quasi-1D explanation for the 2D stripy order of the same model on the honeycomb lattice.</description>

      <title>Magnetostructural Coupling at the N\'eel point in YNiO3 Single Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in infinite layer thin films and bulk Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates has stimulated the investigation of other predicted properties of these materials. Among them, the existence of magnetism-driven ferroelectricity in the parent compounds RNiO3 (R = 4f lanthanide and Y) at the onset of the N\'eel order, TN, has remained particularly elusive. Using diffraction techniques, we reveal here the existence of magnetostriction at TN in bulk YNiO3 single crystals. Interestingly, the associated lattice anomalies are much more pronounced along the b crystal axis, which coincides with the electric polarization direction expected from symmetry arguments. This axis undergoes an abrupt contraction below TN that reaches deltab/b ~ - 0.01 %, a value comparable to those found in some magnetoresistive manganites and much larger than those reported for magnetism-driven multiferroics. This observation suggests a strong spin-lattice coupling in these materials, consistent with theoretical predictions. Using the symmetry-adapted distortion mode formalism we identify the main ionic displacements contributing to the lattice anomalies and discuss the most likely polar displacements below TN. Furthermore, our data support symmetric superexchange as the most likely mechanism responsible for the magnetoelastic coupling. These results, that may be common to the full RNiO3 family, provide new experimental evidence supporting the predicted existence of magnetism-driven ferroelectricity in RNiO3 perovskites</description>

      <title>Probing hydrodynamic crossovers with dissipation-assisted operator evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using artificial dissipation to tame entanglement growth, we chart the emergence of diffusion in a generic interacting lattice model for varying U(1) charge densities. We follow the crossover from ballistic to diffusive transport above a scale set by the scattering length, finding the intuitive result that the diffusion constant scales as $D \propto 1/\rho$ at low densities $\rho$. Our numerical approach generalizes the Dissipation-Assisted Operator Evolution (DAOE) algorithm: in the spirit of the BBGKY hierarchy, we effectively approximate non-local operators by their ensemble averages, rather than discarding them entirely. This greatly reduces the operator entanglement entropy, while still giving accurate predictions for diffusion constants across all density scales. We further construct a minimal model for the transport crossover, yielding charge correlation functions which agree well with our numerical data. Our results clarify the dominant contributions to hydrodynamic correlation functions of conserved densities, and serve as a guide for generalizations to low temperature transport.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba effects in many-body localization systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems have attracted growing attention due to various intriguing phenomena absent in equilibrium physics. One famous example is the quantum Mpemba effect, where the subsystem symmetry is restored faster under a symmetric quench from a more asymmetric initial state. The quantum Mpemba effect has been extensively studied in integrable and chaotic systems. In this Letter, we investigate symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in many-body localized systems with various initial states. We reveal that the symmetry can still be fully restored in many-body localization phases without approaching thermal equilibrium. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the presence of the quantum Mpemba effect is universal for any initial tilted product state, contrasting to the cases in the chaotic systems where the presence of the quantum Mpemba effect relies on the choice of initial states. We also provide a theoretical analysis of symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effects with the help of the effective model for many-body localization. This Letter not only sheds light on extending the quantum Mpemba effect to more non-equilibrium settings but also contributes to a deeper understanding of the many-body localization.</description>

      <title>Non-iterative triples for transcorrelated coupled cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an implementation of a perturbative triples correction for coupled cluster including single and double excitations based on the transcorrelated Hamiltonian. Transcorrelation introduces explicit electron correlation in the electronic Hamiltonian through similarity transformation with a correlation factor. Due to this transformation, the transcorrelated Hamiltonian includes up to three-body couplings and becomes non-hermitian. Since conventional coupled cluster is solved by projection, it is well suited to harbor non-hermitian Hamiltonians. The arising three-body operator, however, creates a huge memory bottleneck and increases the runtime scaling of the coupled cluster equations. As it has been shown that the three-body operator can be approximated, by expressing the Hamiltonian in the normal-ordered form, we investigate this approximation for the perturbative triples correction. Results are compared with code-generation based transcorrelated coupled cluster up to quadruple excitations.</description>

      <title>Identifying Entanglement Phases with Bipartite Projected Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce bipartite projected ensembles (BPEs) for quantum many-body wave functions, which consist of pure states supported on two local subsystems, with each state associated with the outcome of a projective measurement of the complementary subsystem in a fixed local basis. We demonstrate that the corresponding ensemble-averaged entanglements (EAEs) between two subsystems can effectively identify entanglement phases. In volume-law entangled states, EAE converges to a nonzero value with increasing distance between subsystems. For critical systems, EAE exhibits power-law decay, and it decays exponentially for area-law systems. Thus, entanglement phase transitions can be viewed as a disorder-order phase transition. We also apply BPE and EAE to measured random Clifford circuits to probe measurement-induced phase transitions. We show that EAE serves not only as a witness to phase transitions, but also unveils additional critical phenomena properties, including dynamical scaling and surface critical exponents. Our findings provide an alternative approach to diagnosing entanglement laws, thus enhancing the understanding of entanglement phase transitions. Moreover, given the scalability of measuring EAE in quantum simulators, our results hold promise for impacting quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical analysis of spin dynamics in the non-Hermitian Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a specific limit of the one-dimensional non-Hermitian Hubbard Hamiltonian with complex interactions. In this framework, fermions with different spin quantum numbers are mapped onto two distinct spin species, resulting in two $XY$ spin chains that are coupled through Ising $ZZ$ interaction. The spin ladder model is then examined within the semiclassical limit using a spin-coherent state basis, where the dynamics is governed by a set of coupled Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations. The non-Hermitian interactions in this model generate a spin-transfer torque term. We analyze the system's evolution toward several potential steady states, including a state of decoupled chains that is accessible when each chain has uniform initial conditions. Other possible steady states involve dimerized configurations with decoupled rungs, where the rung spins are either ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically coupled, depending on the sign of the imaginary interactions. The spin dynamics is then studied in the infinite-temperature limit, which favors dimerized steady states. Despite the decoupled rungs, we observe the formation of ferromagnetic domains along each chain in the steady state. Additionally, we investigate the spin correlation functions and identify signatures of anomalous spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional superconductivity in a thick exfoliated kagome film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of two-dimensional superconductivity (2D SC) in exfoliated kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ with a thickness far thicker than the atomic limit. By examining the critical current and upper critical magnetic fields ($H_{c2}$) of 40-60 nm thick films in the superconducting state, we identify a pronounced Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition behavior, i.e. a drastic decrease of the superfluid stiffness near the transition, and a cusp-like feature of the angular dependent $H_{c2}$, both of which serve as direct evidence of 2D SC. In addition, an exceeding of the Pauli paramagnetic limit of the in-plane $H_{c2}$ is consistent with the 2D SC nature. The observed 2D SC occurs in thick films with the highest superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ and the lowest charge density wave transition temperature $T_{\rm {CDW}}$, which suggests that the charge density wave states are interrelated with the superconducting states. Our findings impose constraints in understanding the enhancement of SC in kagome superconductors, and illuminate pathways for achieving novel 2D superconducting states in more stable and much thicker systems.</description>

      <title>Integrals of Products of Bessel Functions: An Insight from the Physics of Bloch Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrals of products of Bessel functions exhibit an intriguing feature: under certain conditions on the parameters specifying the integrand, they vanish identically. We provide a physical interpretation of this feature in the context of both single-particle and many-body properties of electrons on a lattice ("Bloch electrons"), namely, in terms of their density of states and umklapp scattering rate. (In an umklapp event, the change in the momentum of two colliding electrons is equal to a reciprocal lattice vector, which gives rise to a finite resistivity due to electron-electron interaction.) In this context, the vanishing of an integral follows simply from the condition that either the density of states vanishes due to the electron energy lying outside the band in which free propagation of electron waves is allowed, or that an umklapp process is kinematically forbidden due to the Fermi surface being smaller than a critical value.</description>

      <title>Doublons Bloch oscillations in the mass-imbalanced extended Fermi-Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactions between particles normally induce the decay of the particles Bloch oscillations (BOs) in a periodic lattice. In the large on-site interactions region, spin-$1/2$ fermions may form into doublon bound state and undergoes doublon BOs in the present of tilted potential. Here we investigate the impact of nearest-neighbor interaction $V$ on the multi-doublon BOs in a mass-imbalanced extended Fermi-Hubbard model. We derive a doublons effective Hamiltonian, and show that a minor change of $V$ can alter the dynamic behaviors of doublons qualitatively. Notably, at a resonance point, the doublons act like free hard-core bosons. Under a tilted potential, the system may exhibit different types of multi-doublon BOs at or deviation from the resonance point with different initial states. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate our conclusions in the one- and two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are atypical, highly nonthermal eigenstates embedded in a sea of thermal eigenstates that have been observed in, for example, kinetically constrained quantum many-body models. These special eigenstates are characterized by a bipartite entanglement entropy that scales as most logarithmically with the subsystem size. We use numerical optimization techniques to investigate if quantum many-body scars of the experimentally relevant PXP model can be well approximated by Gaussian states. Gaussian states are described by a number of parameters that scales quadratically with system size, thereby having a much lower complexity than generic quantum many-body states, for which this number scales exponentially. We find that while quantum many-body scars can typically be well approximated by (symmetrized) Gaussian states, this is not the case for ergodic (thermal) eigenstates. This observation suggests that the non-ergodic part of the PXP Hamiltonian is related to certain quadratic parent Hamiltonians, thereby hinting on the origin of the quantum many-body scars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity often couples to other electronic orders in a cooperative or competing fashion. Identifying external stimuli that tune between these two limits is of fundamental interest. Here, we show that strain perpendicular to the copper-oxide planes couples directly to the competing interaction between charge stripe order and superconductivity in La$_{1.88}$Sr$_{0.12}$CuO$_4$ (LSCO). Compressive $c$-axis pressure amplifies stripe order within the superconducting state, while having no impact on the normal state. By contrast, strain dramatically diminishes the magnetic field enhancement of stripe order in the superconducting state. These results suggest that $c$-axis strain acts as tuning parameter of the competing interaction between charge stripe order and superconductivity. This interpretation implies a uniaxial pressure-induced ground state in which the competition between charge order and superconductivity is reduced.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy and deconfined criticality: emergent SO(5) symmetry and proper lattice bipartition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the R\'enyi entanglement entropy (EE) of the two-dimensional $J$-$Q$ model, the emblematic quantum spin model of deconfined criticality at the phase transition between antiferromagnetic and valence-bond-solid ground states. State-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the EE reveal critical corner contributions that scale logarithmically with the system size, with a coefficient in remarkable agreement with the form expected from a large-$N$ conformal field theory with SO($N=5$) symmetry. However, details of the bipartition of the lattice are crucial in order to observe this behavior. If the subsystem for the reduced density matrix does not properly accommodate valence-bond fluctuations, logarithmic contributions appear even for corner-less bipartitions. We here use a $45^\circ$ tilted cut on the square lattice. Beyond supporting an SO($5$) deconfined quantum critical point, our results for both the regular and tilted cuts demonstrate important microscopic aspects of the EE that are not captured by conformal field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10503v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the optical conductivity of a Fermi liquid (FL) in the absence of umklapp scattering is dramatically affected by the topology of the Fermi surface (FS). Specifically, electron-electron (ee) scattering leads to rapid current relaxation in systems with multiple, or multiply connected, FSs, provided the valleys have different effective masses. This effect results from intervalley drag. We microscopically derive the optical conductivity of a two-valley system, both within the FL regime and near a quantum critical point (QCP) of the Ising-nematic type. In the FL regime, intervalley drag restores the Gurzhi-like scaling of the conductivity, $\mathrm{Re} \sigma(\omega) \sim \omega^0$. This dependence contrasts sharply with the previously identified sub-leading contribution to the conductivity of a two-dimensional FL with a single convex FS, where $\mathrm{Re} \sigma(\omega) \sim \omega^2 \ln |\omega|$. The vanishing of the leading term in the optical conductivity is a signature of geometric constraints on ee scattering channels, which are lifted for a multiply connected FS. A large differential response, $d \mathrm{Re} \sigma/d \mu$ with $\mu$ being the chemical potential, is predicted at the Lifshitz transition from a single-valley to a multi-valley FS, which should be observable within the experimentally accessible frequency range. Near a QCP, intervalley drag leads to a $|\omega|^{-2/3}$ scaling of $\mathrm{Re} \sigma(\omega)$ in 2D, thus providing a specific current-relaxing process for this long-standing conjecture.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity with Tc 116 K discovered in antimony polyhydrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity (SC) was experimentally observed for the first time in antimony polyhydride. The diamond anvil cell combined with laser heating system was used to synthesize the antimony polyhydride sample at high pressure and high temperature conditions. In-situ high pressure transport measurements as function of temperature with applied magnet are performed to study the SC properties. It was found that the antimony polyhydride samples show superconducting transition with critical temperature $T_c = 116^\circ$K at 184 GPa. The investigation of SC at magnetic field revealed that the superconducting coherent length ~40 angstroms based on Ginzburg Landau (GL) equation. Antimony polyhydride superconductor has the second highest Tc in addition to sulfur hydride among the polyhydrides of elements from main group IIIA to VIIA in periodic table.</description>

      <title>Quantum anomalous Hall crystal at fractional filling of moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict the emergence a state of matter with intertwined ferromagnetism, charge order and topology in fractionally filled moir\'e superlattice bands. Remarkably, these quantum anomalous Hall crystals exhibit a quantized integer Hall conductance that is different than expected from the filling and Chern number of the band. Microscopic calculations show that this phase is robustly favored at half-filling ($\nu=1/2$) at larger twist angles of the twisted semiconductor bilayer $t$MoTe$_2$</description>

      <title>Anomalous impurity effect in the heavy-fermion superconductor CeCu2Si2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of contradictory impurity effect in the heavy-fermion superconductor CeCu2Si2 at ambient pressure have hindered the identification of its pairing symmetry. Here we perform theoretical analyses with both intraband and interband impurity scatterings for the nodeless $s^\pm$-wave pairing, and report an anomalous nonmonotonic variation of its $T_c$ suppression with the scattering strength. Our results reproduce the prominent reduction of $T_c$ in good agreement with earlier experiments by atomic substitution and explains as well its robustness against electron irradiation. We ascribe the latter to the screening of the interband impurity potential in the strong scattering or unitary region. This resolves the seeming contradiction in different experimental probes and provides an important support to the nodeless $s^\pm$-wave scenario in CeCu2Si2 at ambient pressure. Our theory may be extended to other narrow band systems such as twisted bilayer graphene and the recently discovered bilayer or trilayer nickelate superconductors, and provide a useful way to distinguish different paring candidates thereof.</description>
