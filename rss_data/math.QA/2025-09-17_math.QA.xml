      <title>Nichols algebras, tensor categories and Kazhdan-Lusztig correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a very general picture emerging that conjecturally describes what happens to the representation theory of a vertex algebra $\mathcal{V}$ if we pass to the kernel $\mathcal{W}$ of a set of screening operators. Namely, the screening operators generate a Nichols algebra $H$ inside $\mathrm{Rep}(\mathcal{V})$ and in many cases $\mathrm{Rep}(\mathcal{W})$ coincides with the relative Drinfeld center of $\mathrm{Rep}(H)$. This vastly generalizes the construction of a quantum group as the Drinfeld double of a Nichols algebra over the Cartan part. In this example, the conjectural category equivalence has been studied since around $20$ years as logarithmic Kazhdan Lusztig correspondence.
  The present survey was part of my habilitation thesis about my work in this area. I want to make it available as an introductory text, intended for readers from a pure algebra background as well as from a physics background. I motivate and explain gently and informally the different topics involved (quantum groups, Nichols algebras, vertex algebras, braided tensor categories) with a distinct categorical point of view, to the point that I can explain my general expectation. Then I explain some previous results and explain the main techniques in my recent proof of the conjectured category equivalence in case $\mathcal{V}$ is a free field theory and under technical assumptions on the analysis side.</description>

      <title>Zhu algebras of superconformal vertex algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to demonstrate the advantages of Y.-Z.\ Huang's definition of the Zhu algebra (Comm.\ Contemp.\ Math., 7 (2005), no.\ 5, 649--706) for an arbitrary vertex algebra, not necessarily equipped with Hamiltonian operators or Virasoro elements, by achieving the following two goals: (1) determining the Zhu algebras of $N=1,2,3,4$ and big $N=4$ superconformal vertex algebras, and (2) introducing the Zhu algebras of $N_K=N$ supersymmetric vertex algebras.</description>

      <title>A new approach to (3+1)-dimensional TQFTs via topological modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a construction toward a new type of TQFTs at the crossroads of low-dimensional topology, algebraic geometry, physics, and homotopy theory. It assigns TMF-modules to closed 3-manifolds and maps of TMF-modules to 4-dimensional cobordisms. This is a mathematical proposal for one of the simplest examples in a family of ${\pi}_*({\rm TMF})$-valued invariants of 4-manifolds which are expected to arise from 6-dimensional superconformal field theories. As part of the construction, we define TMF-modules associated with symmetric bilinear forms, using (spectral) derived algebraic geometry. The invariant of unimodular bilinear forms takes values in ${\pi}_*({\rm TMF})$, conjecturally generalizing the theta function of a lattice. We discuss gluing properties of the invariants. We also demonstrate some interesting physics applications of the TMF-modules such as distinguishing phases of quantum field theories in various dimensions.</description>

      <title>Category O for quantum loop algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the Hernandez-Jimbo category O of representations of Borel subalgebras of quantum affine algebras to the case of quantum loop algebras for arbitrary Kac-Moody g (as well as related algebras, such as quantum toroidal gl_1). Moreover, we give explicit realizations of all simple modules, and devise tools for the computation of q-characters that are new even for g of finite type. Our techniques allow us to generalize classic results of Frenkel-Hernandez, Frenkel-Mukhin, Hernandez-Jimbo and Hernandez-Leclerc, as well as prove conjectures of Feigin-Jimbo-Miwa-Mukhin and Mukhin-Young.</description>

      <title>Modular families of elliptic long-range spin chains from freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the construction of quantum-integrable spin chains with q-deformed long-range interactions by `freezing' integrable quantum many-body systems with spins. The input is a (quantum) spin-Ruijsenaars system along with an equilibrium configuration of the underlying spinless classical Ruijsenaars-Schneider system. For a distinguished choice of equilibrium, the resulting long-range spin chain has a real spectrum and admits a short-range limit, providing an integrable interpolation from nearest-neighbour to long-range interacting spins. We focus on the elliptic case. We first define an action of the modular group on the spinless elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider system to show that, for a fixed elliptic parameter, it has a whole modular family of classical equilibrium configurations. These typically have constant but nonzero momenta. Then we use the setting of deformation quantisation to provide a uniform framework for freezing elliptic spin-Ruijsenaars systems at any classical equilibrium whilst preserving quantum integrability. As we showed in previous work, the results include the Heisenberg, Inozemtsev and Haldane-Shastry chains along with their xxz-like q-deformations (face-type), or the antiperiodic Haldane-Shastry chain of Fukui-Kawakami, its elliptic generalisation of Sechin-Zotov, and their completely anisotropic q-deformations due to Matushko-Zotov (vertex type). Finally, we show how freezing fits in the setting of 'hybrid' integrable systems.</description>

      <title>How to build a Hopf algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a functor that inputs a retract in an $(\infty,3)$-category satisfying some adjunctibility conditions and outputs a Hopf algebra in a braided monoidal $(\infty,1)$-category. Provided the braided monoidal category is presentable, any Hopf algebra can be obtained in this way. Our functor specializes to - and provides a higher-categorical explanation for - the Tannakian reconstruction of a Hopf algebra from a monoidal category with duals and a fiber functor. Towards this end, we review and develop the lax (aka Gray) tensor product $\otimes$ of $(\infty,\infty)$-categories, and we analyze the "lax smash product" of pointed $(\infty,\infty)$-categories. We compute the lax-$\wedge$-square of the "walking adjunction" and show that its $3$-localization corepresents retracts with some adjunctibilty conditions, whereas the $3$-localization of the lax-$\wedge$-square of the "walking monad" corepresents bialgebras. In these terms, our functor is restriction along the lax-$\wedge$-square of the inclusion $\{\text{walking monad}\} \to \{\text{walking adjunction}\}$. After $3$-localization, we show that this restriction inverts a certain shear map, proving the existence of an antipode. We discuss generalizations of this construction to Hopf monads, analyze additional adjunctibility conditions and their interplay with integrals and cointegrals, and finally explain how variants of classical Tannakian reconstruction fit into our scheme.</description>
