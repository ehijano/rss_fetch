      <title>Mask prior-guided denoising diffusion improves inverse protein folding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse protein folding generates valid amino acid sequences that can fold into a desired protein structure, with recent deep-learning advances showing significant potential and competitive performance. However, challenges remain in predicting highly uncertain regions, such as those with loops and disorders. To tackle such low-confidence residue prediction, we propose a \textbf{Ma}sk \textbf{p}rior-guided denoising \textbf{Diff}usion (\textbf{MapDiff}) framework that accurately captures both structural and residue interactions for inverse protein folding. MapDiff is a discrete diffusion probabilistic model that iteratively generates amino acid sequences with reduced noise, conditioned on a given protein backbone. To incorporate structural and residue interactions, we develop a graph-based denoising network with a mask prior pre-training strategy. Moreover, in the generative process, we combine the denoising diffusion implicit model with Monte-Carlo dropout to improve uncertainty estimation. Evaluation on four challenging sequence design benchmarks shows that MapDiff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the in-silico sequences generated by MapDiff closely resemble the physico-chemical and structural characteristics of native proteins across different protein families and architectures.</description>

      <title>Deep learning assisted SERS detection of prolines and hydroxylated prolines using nitrilotriacetic acid functionalized gold nanopillars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proline (Pro) is one kind of proteinogenic amino acid and an important signaling molecule in the process of metabolism. Hydroxyproline (Hyp) is a product on Pro oxygen sensing post-translational modification (PTM), which is efficiently modulated tumor cells for angiogenesis. Distinguishing between Pro and Hyp is crucial for diagnosing connective tissue disorders, as elevated levels of Hyp can indicate abnormal collagen metabolism, often associated with diseases like osteogenesis imperfecta or fibrosis. However, there is a very small difference between molecular structures of Pro and Hyp, which is a big challenge for current detection technologies to distinguish them. For surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensors, the similar molecule structure leads to similar Raman spectra that are difficult to distinguish. Furthermore, another problem is the weak affinity between amino acids sample and SERS-active substrates by physical adsorption. The selecting capturing of Pro and Hyp in the mixture of amino acids is not easy to achieve. In this work, we designed a new method for Pro and Hyp specifical detection and recognition by using gold nanopillars as the SERS substrate and combing nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) with nickel (Ni) to form NTA-Ni structure as a specifical affinity agent. One side of NTA-Ni was attached to gold nanopillars through thiol binding. Another side captured the amino acids using reversible binding by receptor-ligand interaction between Ni and amino acids. Because of the different binding time with NTA-Ni and amino acids, the sensor can recognize Pro and Hyp from amino acids mixture. Then we used automatic peak assignment program for data analysis and machine learning model to distinguish between Pro and Hyp. The label-free SERS detection of amino acids PTM using gold nanopillars provides a potential method to further biomolecule detection and specifical capture.</description>

      <title>Towards a Better Model with Dual Transformer for Drug Response Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GNN-based methods have achieved excellent results as a mainstream task in drug response prediction tasks in recent years. Traditional GNN methods use only the atoms in a drug molecule as nodes to obtain the representation of the molecular graph through node information passing, whereas the method using the transformer can only extract information about the nodes. However, the covalent bonding and chirality of a drug molecule have a great influence on the pharmacological properties of the molecule, and these information are implied in the chemical bonds formed by the edges between the atoms. In addition, CNN methods for modelling cell lines genomics sequences can only perceive local rather than global information about the sequence. In order to solve the above problems, we propose the decoupled dual transformer structure with edge embedded for drug respond prediction (TransEDRP), which is used for the representation of cell line genomics and drug respectively. For the drug branch, we encoded the chemical bond information within the molecule as the embedding of the edge in the molecular graph, extracted the global structural and biochemical information of the drug molecule using graph transformer. For the branch of cell lines genomics, we use the multi-headed attention mechanism to globally represent the genomics sequence. Finally, the drug and genomics branches are fused to predict IC50 values through the transformer layer and the fully connected layer, which two branches are different modalities. Extensive experiments have shown that our method is better than the current mainstream approach in all evaluation indicators.</description>

      <title>Sequence-Augmented SE(3)-Flow Matching For Conditional Protein Backbone Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proteins are essential for almost all biological processes and derive their diverse functions from complex 3D structures, which are in turn determined by their amino acid sequences. In this paper, we exploit the rich biological inductive bias of amino acid sequences and introduce FoldFlow-2, a novel sequence-conditioned SE(3)-equivariant flow matching model for protein structure generation. FoldFlow-2 presents substantial new architectural features over the previous FoldFlow family of models including a protein large language model to encode sequence, a new multi-modal fusion trunk that combines structure and sequence representations, and a geometric transformer based decoder. To increase diversity and novelty of generated samples -- crucial for de-novo drug design -- we train FoldFlow-2 at scale on a new dataset that is an order of magnitude larger than PDB datasets of prior works, containing both known proteins in PDB and high-quality synthetic structures achieved through filtering. We further demonstrate the ability to align FoldFlow-2 to arbitrary rewards, e.g. increasing secondary structures diversity, by introducing a Reinforced Finetuning (ReFT) objective. We empirically observe that FoldFlow-2 outperforms previous state-of-the-art protein structure-based generative models, improving over RFDiffusion in terms of unconditional generation across all metrics including designability, diversity, and novelty across all protein lengths, as well as exhibiting generalization on the task of equilibrium conformation sampling. Finally, we demonstrate that a fine-tuned FoldFlow-2 makes progress on challenging conditional design tasks such as designing scaffolds for the VHH nanobody.</description>
