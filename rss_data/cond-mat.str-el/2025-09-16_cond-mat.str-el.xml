      <title>Higher-Form Anomalies on Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-form symmetry in a tensor product Hilbert space is always emergent: the symmetry generators become genuinely topological only when the Gauss law is energetically enforced at low energies. In this paper, we present a general method for defining the 't Hooft anomaly of higher-form symmetries in lattice models built on a tensor product Hilbert space. In (2+1)D, for given Gauss law operators realized by finite-depth circuits that generate a finite 1-form $G$ symmetry, we construct an index representing a cohomology class in $H^4(B^2G, U(1))$, which characterizes the corresponding 't Hooft anomaly. This construction generalizes the Else-Nayak characterization of 0-form symmetry anomalies. More broadly, under the assumption of a specified formulation of the $p$-form $G$ symmetry action and Hilbert space structure in arbitrary $d$ spatial dimensions, we show how to characterize the 't Hooft anomaly of the symmetry action by an index valued in $H^{d+2}(B^{p+1}G, U(1))$.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetism and Stripe Channel Order in the $\mathrm{SU}(N)$-Symmetric Two-Channel Kondo Lattice Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out large-scale, sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the square lattice $\mathrm{SU}(N)$-symmetric two-channel Kondo lattice model at half-filling. We map out the zero-temperature phase diagram for $N = 2, 4, 6$, and $8$, as a function of the Kondo coupling strength. In the weak-coupling regime, we observe antiferromagnetic order of the localized moments. Remarkably, for $N \geq 6$, sufficiently strong Kondo coupling induces spontaneous channel symmetry breaking, forming a stripe dimerization pattern with a wave vector $\boldsymbol{k}=(\pi,0)$ alternating between channels. These findings are supported by a complementary large-$N$ saddle point analysis, which identifies the striped hybridization pattern as the energetically preferred configuration. The spatial symmetry-breaking results in an anisotropic Fermi surface reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Putting a new spin on the incommensurate Kekul\'e spiral: from spin-valley locking and collective modes to fermiology and implications for superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the global phase diagram of magic-angle twisted bilayer and [symmetric] trilayer graphene (MA-TBG/TSTG) in light of recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements on these materials. These experiments both confirmed the importance of strain in stabilizing the predicted incommensurate Kekul\'{e} spiral (IKS) order near filling $|\nu|=2$ of the weakly dispersive central bands in both systems, and suggested a key role for electron-phonon couplings and short-range Coulomb interactions in selecting between various competing orders at low strain in MA-TBG. Here, we show that such interactions $\textit{also}$ play a crucial role in selecting the spin structure of the strain-stabilized IKS state. This in turn influences the visibility of the IKS order in STM in a manner that allows us to infer their relative importance. We use this insight in conjunction with various other pieces of experimental data to build a more complete picture of the phase diagram, focusing on the spectrum of low-lying collective modes and the nature of the doped Fermi surfaces. We explore the broad phenomenological implications of these results for superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Driven-Dissipative Landau Polaritons: Two Highly Nonlinearly-Coupled Quantum Harmonic Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landau levels (LLs) are the massively-degenerate discrete energy spectrum of a charged particle in a transverse magnetic field and lie at the heart of many intriguing phenomena such as the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects as well as quantized vortices. In this Letter, we consider coupling of LLs of a transversely driven charge neutral particle in a synthetic gauge potential to a quantized field of an optical cavity -- a setting reminiscent of superradiant self-ordering setups in quantum gases. We uncover that this complex system can be surprisingly described in terms of two highly nonlinearly-coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, thus enabling a full quantum mechanical treatment. Light-matter coupling mixes the LLs and the superradiant photonic mode, leading to the formation of hybrid states referred to as ``Landau polaritons''. They inherit partially the degeneracy of the LLs and possess intriguing features such as non-zero light-matter entanglement and quadrature squeezing. Depending on the system parameters and the choice of initial state, the system exhibits diverse nonequilibrium quantum dynamics and multiple steady states, with distinct physical properties. This work lays the foundation for further investigating the novel, driven-dissipative Landau-polariton physics in quantum-gas--cavity-QED settings.</description>

      <title>A graphical diagnostic of topological order using ZX calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing a universal diagnostic of topological order remains an open theoretical challenge. In particular, diagnosing long-range entanglement through the entropic area law suffers from spurious contributions, failing to unambiguously identify topological order. Here we devise a protocol based on the ZX calculus, a graphical tensor network, to determine the topological order of a state circumventing entropy calculations. The protocol takes as input real-space bipartitions of a state and returns a ZX contour diagram, $\mathcal{D}_{\partial A}$, displaying long-range graph connectivity only for long-range entangled states. We validate the protocol by showing that the contour diagrams of the toric and color codes are equivalent except for the number of non-local nodes, which differentiates their topological order. The number of these nodes is robust to the choice of the boundary and ground-state superposition, and they are absent for trivial states, even those with spurious entropy contributions. Our results single out ZX calculus as a tool to detect topological long-range entanglement by leveraging the advantages of diagrammatic reasoning against entropic diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Topological Phase Diagram of Generalized SSH Models with Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains with two- and three-site unit cells using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations. By selecting appropriate filling fractions and sweeping across interaction strength \( J_z \) and dimerization \( \delta \), we map out their phase diagrams and identify transition lines via entanglement entropy and magnetization measurements. In the two-site model, we observe the emergence of an interaction-induced antiferromagnetic intermediate phase between the topologically trivial and non-trivial regimes, as well as a critical region at negative \( J_z \) with suppressed magnetization and finite-size scaling of entanglement entropy. In contrast, the three-site model lacks an intermediate phase and exhibits asymmetric edge localization and antiferromagnetic ordering in both positive and negative \( J_z \) regimes. We further examine the response of edge states to Ising perturbations. In the two-site model, zero-energy edge modes are topologically protected and remain robust up to a finite interaction strength. However, in the three-site model, where the edge states reside at finite energy, this protection breaks down. Despite this, the edge-localized nature of these states survives in the form of polarized modes whose spatial profiles reflect the non-interacting limit.</description>

      <title>Neural-Quantum-States Impurity Solver for Quantum Embedding Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a promising approach to solve second-quantised Hamiltonians, because of their scalability and flexibility. In this work, we design and benchmark an NQS impurity solver for the quantum embedding methods, focusing on the ghost Gutzwiller Approximation (gGA) framework. We introduce a graph transformer-based NQS framework able to represent arbitrarily connected impurity orbitals and develop an error control mechanism to stabilise iterative updates throughout the quantum embedding loops. We validate the accuracy of our approach with benchmark gGA calculations of the Anderson Lattice Model, yielding results in excellent agreement with the exact diagonalisation impurity solver. Finally, our analysis of the computational budget reveals the method's principal bottleneck to be the high-accuracy sampling of physical observables required by the embedding loop, rather than the NQS variational optimisation, directly highlighting the critical need for more efficient inference techniques.</description>

      <title>Quintuplet condensation in the skyrmionic insulator Cu2OSeO3 at ultrahigh magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report ultrahigh magnetic field Faraday rotation results on the chiral helimagnet Cu2OSeO3, the first Mott insulator showing skyrmion lattice phases and a linear magnetoelectric effect. Between 180 and 300 T, we find signatures of a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of magnons, which can be described as a canted XY ferrimagnet. Due to the magnetoelectric coupling, the transverse magnetic order of the indivual Cu2+ spins is accompanied by a characteristic dome-like electric polarization which is crucial for the observation of the condensate via the Faraday rotation effect.</description>

      <title>Nature of the Topological Transition of the Kitaev Model in [111] Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of the topological phase transition of the antiferromagnetic Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice in the presence of a magnetic field along the [111] direction. The field opens a topological gap in the Majorana fermion spectrum and leads to a sequence of topological phase transitions before the field polarised state is reached. At mean field level the gap first closes at the three $M$ points in the Brillouin zone, where the Majorana fermions form Dirac cones, resulting in a change of Chern number by three. An odd number of Dirac fermions in the infrared is unusual and requires Berry curvature compensation in the UV, which occurs via topological, ring-like hybridisation gaps with higher-energy bands. We perform a renormalisation-group analysis of the topological phase transition at the three $M$ points within the Yukawa theory, allowing for intra- and inter-valley fluctuations of the spin-liquid bond operators. We find that the latter lead to a breaking of Lorentz invariance and hence a different universality compared to the standard Ising Gross-Neveu-Yukawa class.</description>

      <title>Dispersion of collective modes in spinful fractional quantum Hall states on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective modes capture the dynamical aspects of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluids. Depending on the active degrees of freedom, different types of collective modes can arise in a FQH state. In this work, we consider spinful FQH states in the lowest Landau level (LLL) along the Jain sequence of fillings $\nu{=}n/(2n{\pm}1)$ and compute the Coulomb dispersion of their spin-flip and spin-conserving collective modes in the spherical geometry. We use the LLL-projected density-wave and composite fermion (CF) exciton states as trial wave functions for these modes. To evaluate the dispersion of density-wave states, we derive the commutation algebra of spinful LLL-projected density operators on the sphere, which enables us to extract the gap of the density-wave excitations from the numerically computed density-density correlation function, i.e., the static structure factor, of the FQH ground state. We find that the CF excitons provide an accurate description of the collective modes at all wavelengths, while the density-wave states fail to do so. Specifically, the spin-flip density wave reliably captures the spin-flip collective mode only for the Laughlin and Halperin states, and that too only in the long-wavelength limit. Interestingly, for spin-singlet primary Jain states, the spin-conserving density mode is inaccurate even in the long-wavelength regime. We show that this discrepancy stems from the presence of an additional high-energy spin-conserving parton mode, similar to that found in fully polarized secondary Jain states at $\nu{=}n/(4n{\pm}1)$. We propose an ansatz for this parton mode and compute its Coulomb dispersion in the singlet state at $\nu{=}2/5$. The predicted parton mode can be observed in circularly polarized inelastic light scattering experiments.</description>

      <title>Phases of 2d Gauge Theories and Symmetric Mass Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and phase structure of Abelian gauge theories in $d=1+1$ dimensions. These include $U(1)$ gauge theory coupled to a scalar and a fermion, as well as the two-flavour Schwinger model with different charges. Both theories exhibit a surprisingly rich phase diagram as masses are varied, with both $c=1$ and $c=1/2$ critical lines or points. We build up to the study of 2d chiral gauge theories, which hold particular interest because they provide a mechanism for symmetric mass generation, a phenomenon in which fermions become gapped without breaking chiral symmetries.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Kolmogorov-Arnold Geometry in Shallow MLPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold (KA) representation theorem constructs universal, but highly non-smooth inner functions (the first layer map) in a single (non-linear) hidden layer neural network. Such universal functions have a distinctive local geometry, a "texture," which can be characterized by the inner function's Jacobian $J({\mathbf{x}})$, as $\mathbf{x}$ varies over the data. It is natural to ask if this distinctive KA geometry emerges through conventional neural network optimization. We find that indeed KA geometry often is produced when training vanilla single hidden layer neural networks. We quantify KA geometry through the statistical properties of the exterior powers of $J(\mathbf{x})$: number of zero rows and various observables for the minor statistics of $J(\mathbf{x})$, which measure the scale and axis alignment of $J(\mathbf{x})$. This leads to a rough understanding for where KA geometry occurs in the space of function complexity and model hyperparameters. The motivation is first to understand how neural networks organically learn to prepare input data for later downstream processing and, second, to learn enough about the emergence of KA geometry to accelerate learning through a timely intervention in network hyperparameters. This research is the "flip side" of KA-Networks (KANs). We do not engineer KA into the neural network, but rather watch KA emerge in shallow MLPs.</description>

      <title>Particle-hole symmetry in the pseudogap phase of moderately underdoped cuprate high temperature superconductors evidenced from joint density of states analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In conventional superconductors, the energy scale associated with the superfluid stiffness is much larger compared to the pairing energy and hence, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is entirely dictated by the superconducting (SC) energy gap. The phase rigidity of the SC condensate in unconventional superconductors, on the other hand, can be low enough to enable destruction of superconductivity via phase incoherence and persistence of an energy gap even at the absence of macroscopic superconductivity above Tc. This is considered a possible mechanism of the pseudogap (PG) state of cuprate high temperature superconductors (HTSCs). We have investigated the electronic energy ({\omega}) and momentum-separation vector (q) dependence of the joint density of states (JDOS), derived from the autocorrelated Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) data, from moderately underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta}HTSC samples at temperatures below and above Tc. We found that q-space structure of the constant {\omega} JDOS intensity maps and the dispersions of the JDOS peaks are essentially the same both below and above Tc. Furthermore, the dispersions of the JDOS peaks above Tc are particle-hole symmetric. These observations evince similarity between the nature of the energy gap below and above Tc, which supports preformed pairing scenario for the PG state at least in the moderately underdoped regime.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Variational Quantum Eigensolver: Escaping Barren Plateaus through Staircase Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Cyclic Variational Quantum Eigensolver (CVQE), a hardware-efficient framework for accurate ground-state quantum simulation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. CVQE departs from conventional VQE by incorporating a measurement-driven feedback cycle: Slater determinants with significant sampling probability are iteratively added to the reference superposition, while a fixed entangler (e.g., single-layer UCCSD) is reused throughout. This adaptive reference growth systematically enlarges the variational space in most promising directions, avoiding manual ansatz or operator-pool design, costly searches, and preserving compile-once circuits. The strategy parallels multi-reference methods in quantum chemistry, while remaining fully automated on quantum hardware. Remarkably, CVQE exhibits a distinctive staircase-like descent pattern, where successive energy drops sharply signal efficient escape from barren plateaus. Benchmarks show that CVQE consistently maintains chemical precision across correlation regimes, outperforms fixed UCCSD by several orders of magnitude, and achieves favorable accuracy-cost trade-offs compared to the Selected Configuration Interaction. These results position CVQE as a scalable, interpretable, and resource-efficient paradigm for near-term quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>From higher-order moments to time correlation functions in strongly correlated systems: A DMRG-based memory kernel coupling theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a hybrid approach for computing dynamical observables in strongly correlated systems using higher-order moments. This method integrates memory kernel coupling theory (MKCT) with the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), extending our recent work on MKCT to strongly correlated systems. The method establishes that correlation functions can be derived from the moments. Within our framework, operators and wavefunctions are represented as matrix product operators (MPOs) and matrix product states (MPSs), respectively. Crucially, the repeated application of the Liouville operator is achieved through an iterative procedure analogous to the DMRG algorithm itself. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MKCT-DMRG by computing the spectral function of the Hubbard model. Furthermore, we successfully apply the method to compute the electronic friction in the Hubbard-Holstein model. In all cases, the results show excellent agreement with time-dependent DMRG (TD-DMRG) benchmarks. The advantage of MKCT-DMRG over TD-DMRG is the computational efficiency, which avoids expensive real-time propagation in TD-DMRG. These findings establish MKCT-DMRG as a promising and accurate framework for simulating challenging dynamical properties in strongly correlated quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Engineering strong correlations in a perfectly aligned dual moir\'e system</title>

Abstract: Exotic collective phenomena emerge when bosons strongly interact within a lattice. However, creating a robust and tunable solid-state platform to explore such phenomena has been elusive. Dual moir\'e systems$-$compromising two Coulomb-coupled moir\'e lattices$-$offer a promising system for investigating strongly correlated dipolar excitons (composite bosons) with electrical control. Thus far, their implementation has been hindered by the relative misalignment and incommensurability of the two moir\'e patterns. Here we report a dual moir\'e system with perfect translational and rotational alignment, achieved by utilizing twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) bilayer to both generate an electrostatic moir\'e potential and separate MoSe$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$ monolayers. We observe strongly correlated electron phases driven by intralayer interactions and identify interlayer Rydberg trions, which become trapped in the presence of the Mott insulating state. Importantly, our platform is electrostatically programmable, allowing the realization of different lattice symmetries with either repulsive or attractive interlayer interactions. In particular, we implement the latter scenario by optically injecting charges, which form a dipolar excitonic phase. Our results establish a versatile platform for the exploration and manipulation of exotic and topological bosonic quantum many-body phases.</description>

      <title>Mixed Triplet-Singlet Order Parameter in Decoupled Superconducting 1H Monolayers of Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the emergence of unconventional superconductivity, where the order parameter deviates from simple isotropic s-wave pairing, is a central puzzle in condensed matter physics. Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), though generally regarded as conventional superconductors, display signatures of this unusual behavior and thus provide a particularly intriguing platform to explore how exotic states arise. Here we investigate the misfit compound (SnS)$_{1.15}$(TaS$_2$), a heterostructure composed of alternating SnS and 1H-TaS$_2$ layers. Using transport, photoemission, and scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the SnS layers effectively decouple the TaS$_2$ into electronically isolated 1H sheets. In this limit, the tunneling density of states reveals a clear two-gap superconducting spectrum with T$_c \sim$ 3.1 K. A theoretical model based on lack of inversion symmetry and finite-range attraction reproduces the observed multi-gap structure as a mixed singlet-triplet state. These results establish misfit compounds as a powerful platform for studying unconventional superconductivity in isolated 1H layers and for realizing multiple uncoupled superconductors within a single crystal.</description>

      <title>Higgs Phases and Boundary Criticality</title>

Abstract: Motivated by recent work connecting Higgs phases to symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, we investigate the interplay of gauge redundancy and global symmetry in lattice gauge theories with Higgs fields in the presence of a boundary. The core conceptual point is that a global symmetry associated to a Higgs field, which is pure-gauge in a closed system, acts physically at the boundary under boundary conditions which allow electric flux to escape the system. We demonstrate in both Abelian and non-Abelian models that this symmetry is spontaneously broken in the Higgs regime, implying the presence of gapless edge modes. Starting with the U(1) Abelian Higgs model in 4D, we demonstrate a boundary phase transition in the 3D XY universality class separating the bulk Higgs and confining regimes. Varying the boundary coupling while preserving the symmetries shifts the location of the boundary phase transition. We then consider non-Abelian gauge theories with fundamental and group-valued Higgs matter, and identify the analogous non-Abelian global symmetry acting on the boundary generated by the total color charge. For SU($N$) gauge theory with fundamental Higgs matter we argue for a boundary phase transition in the O($2N$) universality class, verified numerically for $N=2,3$. For group-valued Higgs matter, the boundary theory is a principal chiral model exhibiting chiral symmetry breaking. We further demonstrate this mechanism in theories with higher-form Higgs fields. We show how the higher-form matter symmetry acts at the boundary and can spontaneously break, exhibiting a boundary confinement-deconfinement transition. We also study the electric-magnetic dual theory, demonstrating a dual magnetic defect condensation transition at the boundary. We discuss some implications and extensions of these findings and what they may imply for the relation between Higgs and SPT phases.</description>

Abstract: Physical quantities with long lifetimes have both theoretical significance in the study of quantum many-body systems and practical implications for quantum technologies. In this manuscript, we investigate the roles played by topological defects in the construction of quasi-conserved quantities, using as a prototypical example the Kramers-Wannier duality defect in a deformed 1d quantum transverse field Ising model. We construct the duality defect Hamiltonian in three different ways: half-chain Kramers-Wannier transformation, utilization of techniques in the Ising fusion category, and defect-modified weak integrability breaking deformation. The third method is also applicable for the study of generic integrable defects under weak integrability breaking deformations. We also work out the deformation of defect-modified higher charges in the model and study their slower decay behavior. Furthermore, we consider the corresponding duality defect twisted deformed Floquet transverse field Ising model, and investigate the stability of the isolated zero mode associated with the duality defect in the integrable Floquet Ising model, under such weak integrability breaking deformation.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Mott transitions and finite-temperature effects of quantum criticality in Dirac semimetals</title>

Abstract: Gross-Neveu-Yukawa-type models such as the chiral Ising, chiral XY, and chiral Heisenberg models, serve as effective descriptions of two-dimensional Dirac semi-metals undergoing quantum phase transitions into various symmetry-broken ordered states. Their relativistic quantum critical points govern the systems' physical behavior in the vicinity of the transition also at finite temperatures, which is strongly influenced by critical order-parameter and chiral fermion fluctuations. Here, we explore the effect of these fluctuations at zero and finite temperature, both in the Dirac phase and in the Mott phases with spontaneously broken symmetry. To that end, we set up a functional renormalization group approach, which allows us to systematically calculate the quantum phase diagrams and scaling behavior at and near quantum criticality. We explicitly estimate quantum critical exponents, calculate the quasiparticle weight of the chiral Dirac excitations, and determine the extent of the quantum critical fan. Furthermore, we expose a semi-metallic precondensation regime where order-parameter fluctuations destroy order at finite temperature and we show the related manifestation of the Coleman-Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem. For the chiral XY model, we also expose signatures of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless physics in a system that includes strong fermion fluctuations. In view of recent experimental developments on correlated phases in highly tunable two-dimensional Dirac materials, our work aims at a more comprehensive theoretical description of relativistic quantum criticality in semi-metals, including non-Dirac-liquid behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A low-energy neutral quasiparticle in a fractional quantum Hall system appears in the latter's energy spectrum on a sphere as a series of many-body excited states labeled by the angular momentum $L$ and whose energy is a smooth function of $L$ in the limit of large sphere radius. We argue that the signature of a nonvanishing spin (intrinsic angular momentum) $s$ of the quasiparticle is the absence, in this series, of states with total angular momentum less than $s$.We reinterpret the missing of certain states, observed in an exact-diagonalization calculation of the spectrum of the $\nu=7/3$ FQH state in a wide quantum well as well as in many proposed wave functions for the excited states as a consequence of the spin-2 nature of the zero-momentum magnetoroton.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases from Subsystem SymTFT of 2-Foliated Exotic Tensor Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), or topological holography, posits a correspondence between symmetries in a $d$-dimensional theory and topological order in a $(d+1)$-dimensional theory. In this work, we extend this framework to subsystem symmetries and develop subsystem SymTFT as a systematic tool to characterize and classify subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases. For $(2+1)$D gapped phases, we introduce a 2-foliated $(3+1)$D exotic tensor gauge theory (which is equivalent to 2-foliated $(3+1)$D BF theory via exotic duality) as the subsystem SymTFT and systematically analyze its topological boundary conditions and linearly rigid subsystem symmetries. Taking subsystem symmetry groups $G = \mathbb{Z}_N$ and $G=\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_M$ as examples, we demonstrate how to recover the classification scheme $\mathcal{C}[G] = H^{2}(G^{\times 2}, U(1)) / \left( H^2(G, U(1)) \right)^3$, which was previously derived by examining topological invariant under linear subsystem-symmetric local unitary transformations in the lattice Hamiltonian formalism. To illustrate the correspondence between field-theoretic and lattice descriptions, we further analyze $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_M$ cluster state models as concrete examples.</description>

Abstract: We report a comprehensive bulk characterization and neutron scattering investigation of single-crystalline Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$, a magnetic pyrochlore synthesized via a flux-growth method. Unpolarized neutron diffuse scattering reveals the emergence of spin-ice correlations below $T \sim 1$ K, evidenced by the development of anisotropic pinch-point features that are consistent with quantum-spin-ice (QSI) behavior. A.C. susceptibility measurements indicate a progressive slowing of spin dynamics in this regime, culminating in complete spin freezing below $T_f \approx 0.15$ K. Inelastic neutron scattering at $T = 0.5$ K reveals a broad spectrum of quasi-elastic magnetic excitations, with intensity in the low-energy range $[0, 0.2]$ meV significantly suppressed below $T_f$. Meanwhile, an incipient (100)-type magnetic order begins to nucleate, and a gapped excitation centered at $\hbar\omega = 0.23$ meV persists. We further identify two distinct dynamical timescales above $T_f$, a slow component $\tau_{\mathrm{slow}} \sim 10^{-5}$ s and a fast component $\tau_{\mathrm{fast}} \sim 10^{-10}$ s, in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions for QSI systems. Taken together, these results indicate that Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ enters a disorder-induced spin-frozen phase below $T_f$, lying in close proximity to a $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement entropy in quantum states featuring repeated sequential excitations of unit patterns in momentum space. In the scaling limit, each unit pattern contributes independently and universally to the entanglement entropy, leading to a characteristic volume-law scaling. Crucially, this universal contribution remains identical for both free and interacting models, enabling decomposition of the total entanglement into pattern-specific components. Numerical verification in fermionic and bosonic chains confirms this volume-law fragmentation phenomenon. For fermionic systems, we derive analytical expressions where many-body entanglement becomes expressible through few-body entanglement components. Notably, this analytical framework extends to spin-1/2 XXZ chains through appropriate identifications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport and Molecular Sensing in Reduced Graphene Oxide Measured with Scanning Probe Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report combined scanning probe microscopy and electrical measurements to investigate local electronic transport in reduced graphene oxide (rGO) devices. We demonstrate that quantum transport in these materials can be significantly tuned by the electrostatic potential applied with a conducting atomic force microscope (AFM) tip. Scanning gate microscopy (SGM) reveals a clear p-type response in which local gating modulates the source-drain current, while scanning impedance microscopy (SIM) indicates corresponding shifts of the Fermi level under different gating conditions. The observed transport behavior arises from the combined effects of the AFM tip induced Fermi level shifts and defect mediated scattering. These results show that resonant scattering associated with impurities or structural defects plays a central role and highlight the strong influence of local electrostatic potentials on rGO conduction. Consistent with this electrostatic control, the device also exhibits chemical gating and sensing: during exposure to electron-withdrawing molecules (acetone), the source-drain current increases reversibly and returns to baseline upon purging with air. Repeated cycles over 15 minutes show reproducible amplitudes and recovery. Using a simple transport model we estimate an increase of about 40 percent in carrier density during exposure, consistent with p-type doping by electron-accepting analytes. These findings link nanoscale electrostatic control to macroscopic sensing performance, advancing the understanding of charge transport in rGO and underscoring its promise for nanoscale electronics, flexible chemical sensors, and tunable optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix Product States (MPS) and Tensor Networks provide a general framework for the construction of solvable models. The best-known example is the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model, which is the ground state of a 2-body nearest-neighbor parent Hamiltonian. We show that such simple parent Hamiltonians for MPS models are, in fact, much more prevalent than hitherto known: The existence of a single example with a simple Hamiltonian for a given choice of dimensions already implies that any generic MPS with those dimensions possesses an equally simple Hamiltonian. We illustrate our finding by discussing a number of models with nearest-neighbor parent Hamiltonians, which generalize the AKLT model on various levels.</description>

Abstract: We prove a general version of the crystalline equivalence principle which gives an equivalence of categories between a category of TQFTs defined on a generic space with $G$-symmetry, and a category of TQFTs with internal symmetry. We give a definition and classification of anomalies associated to TQFTs in the presence of spatial symmetry, which we then generalize to a definition of an anomaly for a categorical symmetry.</description>
