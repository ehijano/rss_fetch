      <title>Asymmetric Duffing oscillator: metamorphoses of $1:2$ resonance and its interaction with the primary resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $1: 2$ resonance in the periodically forced asymmetric Duffing oscillator due to the period-doubling of the primary $1: 1$ resonance or forming independently, coexisting with the primary resonance. We compute the steady-state asymptotic solution - the amplitude-frequency implicit function. Working in the differential properties of implicit functions framework, we describe complicated metamorphoses of the $1:2$ resonance and its interaction with the primary resonance.</description>

      <title>Balancing a vertical stick on a stochastically driven horizontal plate : a variation on the Kapitza effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the trick of balancing a vertical stick on a horizontal plate. It is shown that the horizontal stochastic driving of the point of contact can prevent the stick from falling provided that the stochasticity is that of a coloured noise with a correlation strength stronger than a critical value.</description>

      <title>Efficient detection of chaos through the computation of the Generalized Alignment Index (GALI) by the multi-particle method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a thorough analysis of computing the Generalized Alignment Index (GALI), a rapid and effective chaos indicator, through a simple multi-particle approach, which avoids the use of variational equations. We develop a theoretical leading-order estimation of the error in the computed GALI for both the variational method (VM) and the multi-particle method (MPM), and confirm its predictions through extensive numerical simulations of two well-known Hamiltonian models: the H\'enon-Heiles and the $\beta$-Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou systems. For these models the GALIs of several orders are computed and the MPM results are compared to the VM outcomes. The dependence of the accuracy of the MPM on the renormalization time, integration time step, as well as the deviation vector size, is studied in detail. We find that the implementation if the MPM in double machine precision ($\varepsilon \approx 10^{-16}$) is reliable for deviation vector magnitudes centred around $d_0\approx \varepsilon^{1/2}$, renormalization times $\tau \lesssim 1$, and relative energy errors $E_r \lesssim \varepsilon^{1/2}$. These results are valid for systems with many degrees of freedom and for several orders of the GALIs, with the MPM particularly capturing very accurately the $\textrm{GALI}_2$ behavior. Our results show that the computation of the GALIs by the MPM is a robust and efficient method for investigating the global chaotic dynamics of autonomous Hamiltonian systems, something which is of distinct importance in cases where it is difficult to explicitly write the system's variational equation or when these equations are too cumbersome.</description>

      <title>Parallel fast random bit generation based on spectrotemporally uncorrelated Brillouin random fiber lasing oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlations existing between spectral components in multi-wavelength lasers have been the key challenge that hinders these laser sources from being developed to chaotic comb entropy sources for parallel random bit generation. Herein, spectrotemporally uncorrelated multi-order Stokes/anti-Stokes emissions are achieved by cooperatively exploiting nonlinear optical processes including cascaded stimulated Brillouin scattering and quasi-phase-matched four-wave mixing in a Brillouin random fiber laser. Chaotic instabilities induced by random mode resonance are enhanced and disorderly redistributed among different lasing lines through complex nonlinear optical interactions, which comprehensively releases the inherent correlation among multiple Stokes/anti-Stokes emission lines, realizing a chaotic frequency comb with multiple spectrotemporally uncorrelated channels. Parallel fast random bit generation is fulfilled with 31 channels, single-channel bit rate of 35-Gbps and total bit rate of 1.085-Tbps. National Institute of Standards and Technology statistic tests verify the randomness of generated bit streams. This work, in a simple and efficient way, breaks the correlation barrier for utilizing multi-wavelength laser to achieve high-quality spectrotemporally uncorrelated chaotic laser source, opening new avenues for achieving greatly accelerated random bit generation through parallelization and potentially revolutionizing the current architecture of secure communication and high-performance computation.</description>

      <title>Composition of q-entropies and hyperbolic orthogonality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out that the q-entropy composition for independent events has exactly the same form as the Pythagorean theorem in hyperbolic geometry. We justify the formal relation of hyperbolic geometry with the q-entropy through the use of the $\kappa$-entropy, which is directly related to the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic space. We comment on the relation between orthogonality in this form of the Pythagorean theorem and the independence of the probability distributions appearing in the q-entropy composition through the use of the Dvoretzky-Rogers lemma.</description>

      <title>Turbulence Scaling from Deep Learning Diffusion Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex spatial and temporal structures are inherent characteristics of turbulent fluid flows and comprehending them poses a major challenge. This comprehesion necessitates an understanding of the space of turbulent fluid flow configurations. We employ a diffusion-based generative model to learn the distribution of turbulent vorticity profiles and generate snapshots of turbulent solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We consider the inverse cascade in two spatial dimensions and generate diverse turbulent solutions that differ from those in the training dataset. We analyze the statistical scaling properties of the new turbulent profiles, calculate their structure functions, energy power spectrum, velocity probability distribution function and moments of local energy dissipation. All the learnt scaling exponents are consistent with the expected Kolmogorov scaling. This agreement with established turbulence characteristics provides strong evidence of the model's capability to capture essential features of real-world turbulence.</description>

      <title>On the second law of thermodynamics: Spontaneous cold-to-hot heat transfer in a nonchaotic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has long been known that, fundamentally different from a large body of rarefied gas, when a Knudsen gas is immersed in a thermal bath, it may never reach thermal equilibrium. The root cause is nonchaoticity: as the particle-particle collisions are sparse, the particle trajectories tend to be independent of each other. Usually, this counterintuitive phenomenon is studied through kinetic theory and is not considered a thermodynamic problem. In current research, we show that if incorporated in a compound setup, such an intrinsically nonequilibrium behavior has nontrivial consequences and cannot circumvent thermodynamics: cold-to-hot heat transfer may happen spontaneously, either continuously (with an energy barrier) or cyclically (with time-dependent entropy barriers). It allows for production of useful work by absorbing heat from a single thermal reservoir without any other effect. As the system obeys the first law of thermodynamics, the refrigeration statement and the heat-engine statement of the second law of thermodynamics cannot be applied. The basic principle of maximum entropy is adhered to.</description>

      <title>Controlling Many-Body Quantum Chaos: Bose-Hubbard systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work develops a quantum control application of many-body quantum chaos for ultracold bosonic gases trapped in optical lattices. It is long known how to harness exponential sensitivity to changes in initial conditions for control purposes in classically chaotic systems. In the technique known as targeting, instead of a hindrance to control, the instability becomes a resource. Recently, this classical targeting has been generalized to quantum systems either by periodically countering the inevitable quantum state spreading or by introducing a control Hamiltonian, where both enable localized states to be guided along special chaotic trajectories toward any of a broad variety of desired target states. Only strictly unitary dynamics are involved; i.e., it gives a coherent quantum targeting. In this paper, the introduction of a control Hamiltonian is applied to Bose-Hubbard systems in chaotic dynamical regimes. Properly selected unstable mean field solutions can be followed quite rapidly to states possessing precise phase relationships and occupancies. In essence, the method generates a quantum simulation technique that can access rather special states. The protocol reduces to a time-dependent control of the chemical potentials, opening up the possibility for application in optical lattice experiments. Explicit applications to custom state preparation and stabilization of quantum many-body scars are presented in one- and two-dimensional lattices (three-dimensional applications are similarly possible).</description>
