      <title>Exploring Analytical Methods for Glucose-Sensitive Membranes in Closed-Loop Insulin Delivery Using Akbar Ganji's Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research explores a novel mathematical model for closed loop insulin delivery systems, featuring a glucose sensitive membrane. It employs a sophisticated framework of nonlinear reaction diffusion equations and enzyme kinetics. Central to the study is the development of analytical solutions for the glucose, gluconic acid, and oxygen concentrations, which are meticulously validated against simulation outcomes. This validation underscores the model's accuracy in capturing the complex dynamics inherent in such systems. Additionally, the study leverages Akbar and Ganji's methodology to provide approximate solutions, enabling a comprehensive comparison with analytical results and offering deeper insights into the system's behavior under varying parameters. By integrating both analytical and approximate approaches, the research not only enhances our understanding of biochemical processes but also lays the groundwork for refining closed-loop insulin delivery technology. The findings promise to significantly improve the precision and efficacy of insulin administration, crucial for managing glucose levels in diabetic patients more effectively. Furthermore, the study's implications extend beyond insulin delivery, potentially informing the development of advanced biomedical systems where precise control and understanding of biochemical interactions are paramount. Ultimately, this work represents a significant contribution to both theoretical biochemistry and practical medical applications, setting a foundation for the next generation of closed-loop insulin delivery systems designed to better meet the complex metabolic needs of patients with diabetes.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Gradient Flows of MMD Functionals with Distance Kernels under Sobolev Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Wasserstein gradient flows of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) functionals $\text{MMD}_K^2(\cdot, \nu)$ for positive and negative distance kernels $K(x,y) := \pm |x-y|$ and given target measures $\nu$ on $\mathbb{R}$. Since in one dimension the Wasserstein space can be isometrically embedded into the cone $\mathcal C(0,1) \subset L_2(0,1)$ of quantile functions, Wasserstein gradient flows can be characterized by the solution of an associated Cauchy problem on $L_2(0,1)$. While for the negative kernel, the MMD functional is geodesically convex, this is not the case for the positive kernel, which needs to be handled to ensure the existence of the flow. We propose to add a regularizing Sobolev term $|\cdot|^2_{H^1(0,1)}$ corresponding to the Laplacian with Neumann boundary conditions to the Cauchy problem of quantile functions. Indeed, this ensures the existence of a generalized minimizing movement for the positive kernel. Furthermore, for the negative kernel, we demonstrate by numerical examples how the Laplacian rectifies a "dissipation-of-mass" defect of the MMD gradient flow.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Stochastic Modeling and Regularity Analysis in Turbulent Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel mathematical framework for examining the regularity and energy dissipation properties of solutions to the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations. By integrating Sobolev-Besov hybrid spaces, fractional differential operators, and quantum-inspired modeling techniques, we provide a comprehensive analysis that captures the multiscale and chaotic dynamics inherent in turbulent flows. Central to this framework is a Schr\"odinger-type operator adapted for fluid dynamics, which encapsulates quantum-scale turbulence effects, thereby elucidating the mechanisms of energy redistribution across scales. Additionally, we develop anisotropic stochastic models with direction-dependent viscosity, characterized by a pseudo-differential operator and a covariance matrix governing directional diffusion. These models more accurately reflect real-world turbulence, where viscosity varies with flow orientation, enhancing both theoretical insights and practical simulation capabilities. Our main contributions include new regularity theorems and rigorous a priori estimates for solutions in Sobolev-Besov spaces, alongside proofs of energy dissipation properties in anisotropic contexts. These findings advance the understanding of fluid turbulence by offering a refined approach to studying scale interactions, stochastic effects, and anisotropy in turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Inverse problems for a quasilinear hyperbolic equation with multiple unknowns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and study several inverse boundary problems associated with a quasilinear hyperbolic equation of the form ${c(x)^{-2}}\partial_t^2u=\Delta_g(u+F(x, u))+G(x, u)$ on a compact Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ with boundary. We show that if $F(x, u)$ is monomial and $G(x, u)$ is analytic in $u$, then $F, G$ and $c$ as well as the associated initial data can be uniquely determined and reconstructed by the corresponding hyperbolic DtN (Dirichlet-to-Neumann) map. Our work leverages the construction of proper Gaussian beam solutions for quasilinear hyperbolic PDEs as well as their intriguing applications in conjunction with light-ray transforms and stationary phase techniques for related inverse problems. The results obtained are also of practical importance in assorted of applications with nonlinear waves.</description>

      <title>On some regularity properties of mixed local and nonlocal elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is concerned with ``up to $C^{2, \alpha}$-regularity results'' about a mixed local-nonlocal nonlinear elliptic equation which is driven by the superposition of Laplacian and fractional Laplacian operators.
  First of all, an estimate on the $L^\infty$ norm of weak solutions is established for more general cases than the ones present in the literature, including here critical nonlinearities.
  We then prove the interior $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity and the $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity up to the boundary of weak solutions, which extends previous results by the authors [X. Su, E. Valdinoci, Y. Wei and J. Zhang, Math. Z. (2022)], where the nonlinearities considered were of subcritical type.
  In addition, we establish the interior $C^{2,\alpha}$-regularity of solutions for all $s\in(0,1)$ and the $C^{2,\alpha}$-regularity up to the boundary for all $s\in(0,\frac{1}{2})$, with sharp regularity exponents.
  For further perusal, we also include a strong maximum principle and some properties about the principal eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>Qualitative properties of positive solutions of a mixed order nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the following mixed local/nonlocal Schr\"{o}dinger equation
  \begin{equation*}
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
  - \Delta u + (-\Delta)^s u+u = u^p \quad \hbox{in $\mathbb{R}^n$,}
  u&gt;0 \quad \hbox{in $\mathbb{R}^n$,}
  \lim\limits_{|x|\to+\infty}u(x)=0,
  \end{array}
  \right.
  \end{equation*} where $n\geqslant2$, $s\in (0,1)$ and $p\in\left(1,\frac{n+2}{n-2}\right)$.
  The existence of positive solutions for the above problem is proved, relying on some new regularity results. In addition, we study the power-type decay and the radial symmetry properties of such solutions.
  The methods make use also of some basic properties of the heat kernel and the Bessel kernel associated with the operator $- \Delta + (-\Delta)^s$: in this context, we provide self-contained proofs of these results based on Fourier analysis techniques.</description>

      <title>The fibering method for singular degenerate Kirchhoff problems with unbalanced-growth operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study quasilinear elliptic Kirchhoff equations driven by a non-homogeneous operator with unbalanced growth and right-hand sides that consist of sub-linear, possibly singular, and super-linear reaction terms. Under very general assumptions we prove the existence of at least two solutions for such problems by using the fibering method along with an appropriate splitting of the associated Nehari manifold. In contrast to other works our treatment is very general, with much easier and shorter proofs as it was done in the literature before. Furthermore, the results presented in this paper cover a large class of second-order differential operators like the $p$-Laplacian, the $(p,q)$-Laplacian, the double phase operator, and the logarithmic double phase operator.</description>

      <title>Multi-bubbling solutions to critical Hamiltonian type elliptic systems with nonlocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a coupled Hartree-type system given by \[ \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} -\Delta u = K_{1}(x)(|x|^{-(N-\alpha)} * K_{1}(x)v^{2^{*}_{\alpha}})v^{2^{*}_{\alpha}-1} &amp; \text{in } \mathbb{R}^N, \\[1mm] -\Delta v = K_{2}(x)(|x|^{-(N-\alpha)} * K_{2}(x)u^{2^{*}_{\alpha}})u^{2^{*}_{\alpha}-1} &amp; \text{in } \mathbb{R}^N, \end{array} \right. \] which is critical with respect to the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality. Here, $N \geq 5$, $\alpha &lt; N - 5 + \frac{6}{N-2}$, $2^{*}_{\alpha} = \frac{N + \alpha}{N - 2}$, and $(x', x'') \in \mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{R}^{N-2}$. The functions $K_{1}(|x'|, x'')$ and $K_{2}(|x'|, x'')$ are bounded, nonnegative functions on $\mathbb{R}^{+} \times \mathbb{R}^{N-2}$, sharing a common, topologically nontrivial critical point. We address the challenge of establishing the nondegeneracy of positive solutions to the limiting system. By employing a finite-dimensional reduction technique and developing new local Poho\v{z}aev identities, we construct infinitely many synchronized-type solutions, with energies that can be made arbitrarily large.</description>

      <title>Bilinear Strichartz estimates on rescaled waveguides with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10012v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on the bilinear Strichartz estimates for free solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation on rescaled waveguides $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}_\lambda^n$, $\mathbb{T}_\lambda^n=(\lambda\mathbb{T})^n$ with $n\geq 1$ and their applications. First, we utilize a decoupling-type estimate originally from Fan-Staffilani-Wang-Wilson [Anal. PDE 11 (2018)] to establish a global-in-time bilinear Strichartz estimate with a `$N_2^\epsilon$' loss on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}^n_\lambda$ when $n\geq1$, which generalize the local-in time estimate in Zhao-Zheng [SIAM J. Math. Anal. (2021)] and fills a gap left by the unresolved case in Deng et al. [J. Func. Anal. 287 (2024)]. Second, we prove the local-in-time angularly refined bilinear Strichartz estimates on the 2d rescaled waveguide $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}_\lambda$, which generalize the estimate obtained by Takaoka [J. Differ. Equa. 394 (2024)] with $\lambda=1$. As applications, we show the local well-posedness and small data scattering for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with algebraic nonlinearities in the critical space on $\mathbb R^m\times\mathbb{T}^n$ and the global well-posedness for cubic NLS on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}$ in the lower regularity space $H^s$ with $s&gt;\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Long time well-posdness for the 3D Prandtl boundary layer equations without structural assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with existence and uniqueness, and stability of the solution for the 3D Prandtl equation in a polynomial weighted Sobolev space. The main novelty of this paper is to directly prove the long time well-posdness to 3D Prandtl equation without any structural assumption by the energy method. Moreover, the solution's lifespan can be extended to any large $T$, provided that the initial data with a perturbation lies in the monotonic shear profile of small size $e^{-T}$. This result improves the work by Xu and Zhang (J. Differential Equations, 263(12)(2017), 8749-8803) on the 2D Prandtl equations, achieving an extension to the three-dimensional case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the global well-posedness for the defocusing, cubic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation posed on $\T^3$ with intial data lying in its critical space $H^\frac{1}{2}(\T^3)$. By establishing the linear profile decomposition, and applied this to the concentration-compactness/rigidity argument, we prove that if the solution remains bounded in the critical Sobolev space throughout the maximal lifespan, i.e. $u\in L_t^\infty{H}^\frac{1}{2}(I\times\T^3)$, then $u$ is global.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss two optimization problems related to the fractional $p$-Laplacian. First, we prove the existence of at least one minimizer for the principal eigenvalue of the fractional $p$-Laplacian with Dirichlet conditions, with a bounded weight function varying in a rearrangement class. Then, we investigate the maximization of the energy functional for general nonlinear equations driven by the same operator, as the reaction varies in a rearrangement class. In both cases, we provide a pointwise relation between the optimizing datum and the corresponding solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetrized Asymptotic Mean Value Laplacian $\tilde{\Delta}$, obtained as limit of approximating operators $\tilde{\Delta}_r$, is an extension of the classical Euclidean Laplace operator to the realm of metric measure spaces. We show that, as $r \downarrow 0$, the operators $\tilde{\Delta}_r$ eventually admit isolated eigenvalues defined via min-max procedure on any compact locally Ahlfors regular metric measure space. Then we prove $L^2$ and spectral convergence of $\tilde{\Delta}_r$ to the Laplace--Beltrami operator of a compact Riemannian manifold, imposing Neumann conditions when the manifold has a non-empty boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the time-dependent von K\'arm\'an plate equations from three dimensional, purely atomistic particle models. In particular, we prove that a thin structure of interacting particles whose dynamics is governed by Newton's laws of motion is effectively described by the von K\'arm\'an equations in the limit of vanishing interatomic distance $\eps$ and vanishing plate thickness $h$. While the classical plate equations are obtained for $\eps \ll h \ll 1$, we find new plate equations for finitely many layers in the ultrathin case $\eps \sim h$.</description>

      <title>An action approach to nodal and least energy normalized solutions for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to the investigation of normalized solutions for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations based on the analysis of the masses of ground states of the corresponding action functional. Our first result is a complete characterization of the masses of action ground states, obtained via a Darboux-type property for the derivative of the action ground state level. We then exploit this result to tackle normalized solutions with a twofold perspective. First, we prove existence of normalized nodal solutions for every mass in the $L^2$-subcritical regime, and for a whole interval of masses in the $L^2$-critical and supercritical cases. Then, we show when least energy normalized solutions/least energy normalized nodal solutions are action ground states/nodal action ground states.</description>

      <title>Pointwise Weyl Laws for Quantum Completely Integrable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the asymptotics of the spectral function for self-adjoint, elliptic differential, or more generally pseudodifferential, operators on a compact manifold has a long history. The seminal 1968 paper of H\"ormander, following important prior contributions by G\"arding, Levitan, Avakumovi\'c, and Agmon-Kannai (to name only some), obtained pointwise asymptotics (or a "pointwise Weyl law") for a single elliptic, self-adjoint operator.
  Here, we establish a microlocalized pointwise Weyl law for the joint spectral functions of quantum completely integrable (QCI) systems, $\overline{P}=(P_1,P_2,\dots, P_n)$, where $P_i$ are first-order, classical, self-adjoint, pseudodifferential operators on a compact manifold $M^n$, with $\sum P_i^2$ elliptic and $[P_i,P_j]=0$ for $1\leq i,j\leq n$. A particularly important case is when $(M,g)$ is Riemannian and $P_1=(-\Delta)^\frac12$. We illustrate our result with several examples, including surfaces of revolution.</description>

      <title>Conservation Laws with Discontinuous Gradient-Dependent Flux: the Stable Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with a scalar conservation law with discontinuous gradient-dependent flux. Namely, the flux is described by two different functions $f(u)$ or $g(u)$, when the gradient $u_x$ of the solution is positive or negative, respectively. We study here the stable case where $f(u)&lt;g(u)$ for all $u\in {\mathbb R}$, with $f,g$ smooth but possibly not convex. A front tracking algorithm is introduced, proving that piecewise constant approximations converge to the trajectories of a contractive semigroup on $\mathbf{L}^1({\mathbb R})$. In the spatially periodic case, we prove that semigroup trajectories coincide with the unique limits of a suitable class of vanishing viscosity approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a heterogeneous host population, the basic reproduction number of an infectious disease, $\cR_0$, is defined as the spectral radius of the next generation operator (NGO). The threshold properties of the basic reproduction number are typically established by imposing conditions that make $\cR_0$ an eigenvalue of the NGO associated with a positive eigenvector and a positive eigenfunctional (eigenvector of the dual of the NGO). More general results can be obtained by imposing conditions that associate $\cR_0$ just with a positive eigenfunctional. The next generation operator is conveniently expressed by a measure kernel or a Feller kernel which enables the use of analytic rather than functional analytic methods.</description>

      <title>Determination and reconstruction of a semilinear term from point measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we study the inverse problem of determining a semilinear term appearing in an elliptic equation from boundary measurements. Our main objective is to develop flexible and general theoretical results that can be used for developing numerical reconstruction algorithm for this inverse problem. For this purpose, we develop a new method, based on different properties of solutions of elliptic equations, for treating the determination of the semilinear term as a source term from a point measurement of the solutions. This approach not only allows us to make important relaxations on the data used so far for solving this class of inverse problems, including general Dirichlet excitation lying in a space of dimension one and measurements located at one point on the boundary of the domain, but it also allows us to derive a novel algorithm for the reconstruction of the semilinear term. The effectiveness of our algorithm is corroborated by extensive numerical experiments. Notably, as demonstrated by the theoretical analysis, we are able to effectively reconstruct the unknown nonlinear source term by utilizing solely the information provided by the measurement data at a single point.</description>

      <title>Shape optimization involving the Tresca friction law in a 2D linear elastic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to analyse a shape optimization problem in a mechanical friction context. Precisely we perform a shape sensitivity analysis of a Tresca friction problem, that is, a boundary value problem involving the usual linear elasticity equations together with the (nonsmooth) Tresca friction law on a part of the boundary. We prove that the solution to the Tresca friction problem admits a directional shape derivative which moreover coincides with the solution to a boundary value problem involving tangential Signorini's unilateral conditions. Then an explicit expression of the shape gradient of the Tresca energy functional is provided (which allows us to provide numerical simulations illustrating our theoretical results). Our methodology is not based on any regularization procedure, but rather on the twice epi-differentiability of the (nonsmooth) Tresca friction functional which is analyzed thanks to a change of variables which is well-suited in the two-dimensional case. The obstruction in the higher-dimensional case is discussed.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds on the top Lyapunov exponent for linear PDEs driven by the 2D stochastic Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the top Lyapunov exponent associated to the advection-diffusion and linearised Navier-Stokes equations on the two-dimensional torus. The velocity field is given by the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations driven by a non-degenerate white-in-time noise with a power-law correlation structure. We show that the top Lyapunov exponent is bounded from below by a negative power of the diffusion parameter. This partially answers a conjecture of Doering and Miles and provides a first lower bound on the Batchelor scale in terms of the diffusivity. The proof relies on a robust analysis of the projective process associated to the linear equation, through its spectral median dynamics. We introduce a probabilistic argument to show that high-frequency states for the projective process are unstable under stochastic perturbations, leading to a Lyapunov drift condition and quantitative-in-diffusivity estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19562v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive global curvature estimates for closed, strictly star-shaped $(n-2)$-convex hypersurfaces in warped product manifolds, which satisfy the prescribed $(n-2)$-curvature equation with a general right-hand side. The proof can be readily adapted to establish curvature estimates for semi-convex solutions to the general $k$-curvature equation. Furthermore, it can also be used to prove the same estimates for $k$-convex solutions to the prescribed curvature measure type equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a fluid governed by the randomly forced 2D Navier-Stokes system. It is assumed that the force is bounded, acts directly only on a small number of Fourier modes, and satisfies some natural decomposability and observability properties. Under these assumptions, we show that the Lagrangian flow associated with the random fluid exhibits chaotic behavior characterized by the strict positivity of the top Lyapunov exponent. To achieve this, we introduce a new abstract result that allows to derive positivity of the top Lyapunov exponent from controllability properties of the underlying deterministic system.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we extend the results in [16] to more general domains. More precisely, we obtain transmission eigenvalue-free regions for the interior transmission problem with one complex-valued refraction index, that is, with a damping term which does not vanish on the boundary. In particular, we remove the non-trapping condition as well as the strict concavity condition from [16]. Instead, we impose new, more general conditions in terms of the highfrequency behavior of certain cut-off resolvents associated to exterior problems.</description>

      <title>Curve shortening flow with an ambient force field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the anisotropic curve shortening flow in the plane in the presence of an ambient force. We consider force fields in which all their derivatives are bounded in the $L^{\infty}$ sense. We prove that closed embedded curves that have a minimum of curvature sufficiently large shrink to round points. The method of proof follows along the same lines of Gage and Hamilton, in that we study a rescaling to prove curvature bounds. We additionally show that the influence of an ambient force field may make such a result untrue, by giving sufficient conditions on the ambient field that ensures eventual non-convexity of an initially convex curve evolving under the flow.</description>

      <title>Quantitative bounds for bounded solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations in endpoint critical Besov spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the quantitative regularity and blow-up criteria for classical solutions to the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a critical Besov space setting. Specifically, we consider solutions $u\in L^\infty_T(\dot{B}_{p,\infty}^{-1+\frac{3}{p}})$ such that $|D|^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}|u|\in L^\infty_t (L_x^p)$ with $3&lt;p&lt;\infty$. by establishing delicate regularity estimates and substantially improving the strategy in \cite{Tao_20}, we are able to overcome difficulties stemming from the low regularity of $\dot{B}_{p,\infty}^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}$ and derive quantitative bounds for solutions $u$ involving a quadruple exponential of their Besov norm and a double exponent of $L^p$ norm of $|D|^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}|u|$. As a consequence, we establish a new blow-up rate for solutions blowing up at a finite time expressed in terms of quadruple and double logarithms of the two critical norms respectively.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove a sharp, weighted Hardy-type inequality for the Dirac operator. A key feature of our result is that the inequality is not only sharp but also attained, and we construct explicit minimizers that satisfy the equality case. This extends previous work on the spectral properties of Dirac operators, especially in the context of relativistic quantum mechanics and Coulomb-like potentials.</description>

      <title>Bona-Smith-type systems in bounded domains with slip-wall boundary conditions: Theoretical justification and a conservative numerical scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considered herein is a class of Boussinesq systems of Bona-Smith type that describe water waves in bounded two-dimensional domains with slip-wall boundary conditions and variable bottom topography. Such boundary conditions are necessary in situations involving water waves in channels, ports, and generally in basins with solid boundaries. We prove that, given appropriate initial conditions, the corresponding initial-boundary value problems have unique solutions locally in time, which is a fundamental property of deterministic mathematical modeling. Moreover, we demonstrate that the systems under consideration adhere to three basic conservation laws for water waves: mass, vorticity, and energy conservation.
  The theoretical analysis of these specific Boussinesq systems leads to a conservative mixed finite element formulation. Using explicit, relaxation Runge-Kutta methods for the discretization in time, we devise a fully discrete scheme for the numerical solution of initial-boundary value problems with slip-wall conditions, preserving mass, vorticity, and energy. Finally, we present a series of challenging numerical experiments to assess the applicability of the new numerical model.</description>
