      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communication with Nested Array: Beam Pattern and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Towards the upcoming 6G wireless networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been identified as one of the typical usage scenarios. To further enhance the performance of ISAC, increasing the number of antennas as well as array aperture is one of the effective approaches. However, simply increasing the number of antennas will increase the cost of radio frequency chains and power consumption. To address this issue, in this paper, we consider an uplink ISAC system with nested array deployed at the base station. Nested array is a classic sparse array architecture that is able to enlarge the array aperture without increasing the number of physical antennas. While nested array for wireless sensing has been extensively studied, its potential for ISAC system has not been fully exploited. To fill this gap, in this paper, we provide the beam pattern analysis of nested arrays, and derive the closed-form expressions for the three beam pattern metrics, namely, the main lobe beam width, peak-to-local-minimum ratio, and prominent side lobes height. Extensive simulation results are provided to show that compared with conventional uniform arrays, nested arrays can achieve higher communication performance for densely located users while maintaining its advantage of sensing.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficiency Optimization in Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial UAV-Enabled Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) into satellite-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks offers an effective solution for enhancing connectivity. In this setup, UAVs serve as access points (APs) of a terrestrial CF-mMIMO network extending the satellite network capabilities, thereby ensuring robust, high-quality communication links. In this work, we propose a successive convex approximation algorithm for maximizing the downlink energy efficiency (EE) at the UAVs under per-UAV power budget and user quality-of-service constraints. We derive a closed-form expression for the EE that accounts for maximum-ratio transmission and statistical channel knowledge at the users. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in maximizing the EE at the UAV layer. Moreover, we observe that a few tens of UAVs transmitting with a fine-tuned power are sufficient to empower the service of satellite networks and significantly increase the spectral efficiency.</description>

      <title>Quantile Learn-Then-Test: Quantile-Based Risk Control for Hyperparameter Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in engineering problems calls for the development of calibration methods capable of offering robust statistical reliability guarantees. The calibration of black box AI models is carried out via the optimization of hyperparameters dictating architecture, optimization, and/or inference configuration. Prior work has introduced learn-then-test (LTT), a calibration procedure for hyperparameter optimization (HPO) that provides statistical guarantees on average performance measures. Recognizing the importance of controlling risk-aware objectives in engineering contexts, this work introduces a variant of LTT that is designed to provide statistical guarantees on quantiles of a risk measure. We illustrate the practical advantages of this approach by applying the proposed algorithm to a radio access scheduling problem.</description>

      <title>Reliability on QR codes and Reed-Solomon codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the use of Reed-Solomon error correction codes in QR codes to enhance resilience against failures. To fully grasp this approach, a basic cryptographic context is provided, necessary for understanding Reed-Solomon codes. The study begins by defining a code and explores key outcomes for codes with additional properties, such as linearity. The theoretical framework is further developed with specific definitions and examples of Reed-Solomon codes, presented as a particular variant of BCH codes. Additionally, the structure of QR codes is analyzed, encompassing different versions and how data is represented in the form of black and white pixels within an image. Finally, an inherent vulnerability of Reed-Solomon Codes, and particularly of QR codes, related to selective manipulation of modules is examined. This vulnerability leverages the error correction mechanisms present in Reed-Solomon codes.</description>

      <title>Minimax Optimality of Score-based Diffusion Models: Beyond the Density Lower Bound Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15602v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic error of score-based diffusion model sampling in large-sample scenarios from a non-parametric statistics perspective. We show that a kernel-based score estimator achieves an optimal mean square error of $\widetilde{O}\left(n^{-1} t^{-\frac{d+2}{2}}(t^{\frac{d}{2}} \vee 1)\right)$ for the score function of $p_0*\mathcal{N}(0,t\boldsymbol{I}_d)$, where $n$ and $d$ represent the sample size and the dimension, $t$ is bounded above and below by polynomials of $n$, and $p_0$ is an arbitrary sub-Gaussian distribution. As a consequence, this yields an $\widetilde{O}\left(n^{-1/2} t^{-\frac{d}{4}}\right)$ upper bound for the total variation error of the distribution of the sample generated by the diffusion model under a mere sub-Gaussian assumption. If in addition, $p_0$ belongs to the nonparametric family of the $\beta$-Sobolev space with $\beta\le 2$, by adopting an early stopping strategy, we obtain that the diffusion model is nearly (up to log factors) minimax optimal. This removes the crucial lower bound assumption on $p_0$ in previous proofs of the minimax optimality of the diffusion model for nonparametric families.</description>

      <title>Quantum Constacyclic BCH Codes over Qudits: A Spectral-Domain Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize constacyclic codes in the spectral domain using the finite field Fourier transform (FFFT) and propose a reduced complexity method for the spectral-domain decoder. Further, we also consider repeated-root constacyclic codes and characterize them in terms of symmetric and asymmetric $q$-cyclotomic cosets. Using zero sets of classical self-orthogonal and dual-containing codes, we derive quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) for both constacyclic Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes and repeated-root constacyclic codes. We provide some examples of QECCs derived from repeated-root constacyclic codes and show that constacyclic BCH codes are more efficient than repeated-root constacyclic codes. Finally, quantum encoders and decoders are also proposed in the transform domain for Calderbank-Shor-Steane CSS-based quantum codes. Since constacyclic codes are a generalization of cyclic codes with better minimum distance than cyclic codes with the same code parameters, the proposed results are practically useful.</description>

      <title>Robust, Secure and Private Cache-aided Scalar Linear Function Retrieval from Distributed System with Blind and Adversarial Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, a distributed server system composed of multiple servers that holds some coded files and multiple users that are interested in retrieving the linear functions of the files is investigated, where the servers are robust, blind and adversarial in the sense that any $J$ servers can together recover all files, while any $I$ colluding servers cannot obtain any information about the files, and at most $A$ servers maliciously provides erroneous information. In addition, the file library must be secure from a wiretapper who obtains all the signals, and the demands of any subset of users must kept private from the other users and servers, even if they collude. A coding scheme is proposed by incorporating the ideas of Shamir's secret sharing and key superposition into the framework of Placement Delivery Array (PDA), originally proposed to characterize the single-server coded caching system without any security or privacy constraints. It is shown that PDAs associated to Maddah-Ali and Niesen's coded caching scheme results in an achievable memory-storage-communication region, such that the storage size and communication load were optimal to within a multiplicative gap, except for the small memory regime when the number of files was smaller than the number of users.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Interference Mitigation for Uplink NOMA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has become a promising technology for next-generation wireless communications systems due to its capability to provide access for multiple users on the same resource. In this paper, we consider an uplink power-domain NOMA system aided by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) in the presence of a jammer that aims to maximize its interference on the base station (BS) uplink receiver. We consider two kinds of RISs, a regular RIS whose elements can only change the phase of the incoming wave, and an RIS whose elements can also attenuate the incoming wave. Our aim is to minimize the total power transmitted by the user terminals under quality-of-service constraints by controlling both the propagation from the users and the jammer to the BS with help of the RIS. The resulting objective function and constraints are both non-linear and non-convex, so we address this problem using numerical optimization. Our numerical results show that the RIS can help to dramatically reduce the per user required transmit power in an interference-limited scenario.</description>

      <title>Permutation Capacity Region of Adder Multiple-Access Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point-to-point permutation channels are useful models of communication networks and biological storage mechanisms and have received theoretical attention in recent years. Propelled by relevant advances in this area, we analyze the permutation adder multiple-access channel (PAMAC) in this work. In the PAMAC network model, $d$ senders communicate with a single receiver by transmitting $p$-ary codewords through an adder multiple-access channel whose output is subsequently shuffled by a random permutation block. We define a suitable notion of permutation capacity region $\mathcal{C}_\mathsf{perm}$ for this model, and establish that $\mathcal{C}_\mathsf{perm}$ is the simplex consisting of all rate $d$-tuples that sum to $d(p - 1) / 2$ or less. We achieve this sum-rate by encoding messages as i.i.d. samples from categorical distributions with carefully chosen parameters, and we derive an inner bound on $\mathcal{C}_\mathsf{perm}$ by extending the concept of time sharing to the permutation channel setting. Our proof notably illuminates various connections between mixed-radix numerical systems and coding schemes for multiple-access channels. Furthermore, we derive an alternative inner bound on $\mathcal{C}_\mathsf{perm}$ for the binary PAMAC by analyzing the root stability of the probability generating function of the adder's output distribution. Using eigenvalue perturbation results, we obtain error bounds on the spectrum of the probability generating function's companion matrix, providing quantitative estimates of decoding performance. Finally, we obtain a converse bound on $\mathcal{C}_\mathsf{perm}$ matching our achievability result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In beamformed wireless cellular systems such as 5G New Radio (NR) networks, beam management (BM) is a crucial operation. In the second phase of 5G NR standardization, known as 5G-Advanced, which is being vigorously promoted, the key component is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) based on machine learning (ML) techniques. AI/ML for BM is selected as a representative use case. This article provides an overview of the AI/ML for BM in 5G-Advanced. The legacy non-AI and prime AI-enabled BM frameworks are first introduced and compared. Then, the main scope of AI/ML for BM is presented, including improving accuracy, reducing overhead and latency. Finally, the key challenges and open issues in the standardization of AI/ML for BM are discussed, especially the design of new protocols for AI-enabled BM. This article provides a guideline for the study of AI/ML-based BM standardization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The incompressibility method is a counting argument in the framework of algorithmic complexity that permits discovering properties that are satisfied by most objects of a class. This paper gives a preliminary insight into Kolmogorov's complexity of groupoids and some algebras. The incompressibility method shows that almost all the groupoids are asymmetric and simple: Only trivial or constant homomorphisms are possible. However, highly random groupoids allow subgroupoids with interesting restrictions that reveal intrinsic structural properties. We also study the issue of the algebraic varieties and wonder which equational identities allow randomness.</description>

      <title>Robust Beamforming for RIS-aided Communications: Gradient-based Manifold Meta Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has become a promising technology to realize the programmable wireless environment via steering the incident signal in fully customizable ways. However, a major challenge in RIS-aided communication systems is the simultaneous design of the precoding matrix at the base station (BS) and the phase shifting matrix of the RIS elements. This is mainly attributed to the highly non-convex optimization space of variables at both the BS and the RIS, and the diversity of communication environments. Generally, traditional optimization methods for this problem suffer from the high complexity, while existing deep learning based methods are lack of robustness in various scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce a gradient-based manifold meta learning method (GMML), which works without pre-training and has strong robustness for RIS-aided communications. Specifically, the proposed method fuses meta learning and manifold learning to improve the overall spectral efficiency, and reduce the overhead of the high-dimensional signal process. Unlike traditional deep learning based methods which directly take channel state information as input, GMML feeds the gradients of the precoding matrix and phase shifting matrix into neural networks. Coherently, we design a differential regulator to constrain the phase shifting matrix of the RIS. Numerical results show that the proposed GMML can improve the spectral efficiency by up to 7.31\%, and speed up the convergence by 23 times faster compared to traditional approaches. Moreover, they also demonstrate remarkable robustness and adaptability in dynamic settings.</description>

      <title>Efficient Unbiased Sparsification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An unbiased $m$-sparsification of a vector $p\in \mathbb{R}^n$ is a random vector $Q\in \mathbb{R}^n$ with mean $p$ that has at most $m&lt;n$ nonzero coordinates. Unbiased sparsification compresses the original vector without introducing bias; it arises in various contexts, such as in federated learning and sampling sparse probability distributions. Ideally, unbiased sparsification should also minimize the expected value of a divergence function $\mathsf{Div}(Q,p)$ that measures how far away $Q$ is from the original $p$. If $Q$ is optimal in this sense, then we call it efficient. Our main results describe efficient unbiased sparsifications for divergences that are either permutation-invariant or additively separable. Surprisingly, the characterization for permutation-invariant divergences is robust to the choice of divergence function, in the sense that our class of optimal $Q$ for squared Euclidean distance coincides with our class of optimal $Q$ for Kullback-Leibler divergence, or indeed any of a wide variety of divergences.</description>

      <title>Probing the Information Theoretical Roots of Spatial Dependence Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intuitively, there is a relation between measures of spatial dependence and information theoretical measures of entropy. For instance, we can provide an intuition of why spatial data is special by stating that, on average, spatial data samples contain less than expected information. Similarly, spatial data, e.g., remotely sensed imagery, that is easy to compress is also likely to show significant spatial autocorrelation. Formulating our (highly specific) core concepts of spatial information theory in the widely used language of information theory opens new perspectives on their differences and similarities and also fosters cross-disciplinary collaboration, e.g., with the broader AI/ML communities. Interestingly, however, this intuitive relation is challenging to formalize and generalize, leading prior work to rely mostly on experimental results, e.g., for describing landscape patterns. In this work, we will explore the information theoretical roots of spatial autocorrelation, more specifically Moran's I, through the lens of self-information (also known as surprisal) and provide both formal proofs and experiments.</description>

      <title>PAPR Reduction with Pre-chirp Selection for Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a promising new multicarrier technique for high-mobility communications based on discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT). By properly tuning the pre-chirp parameter and the post-chirp parameter in the DAFT, the effective channel in the DAFT domain can completely circumvent path overlap, thereby constituting a full representation of delay-Doppler profile. However, AFDM has a crucial problem of high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), stemming from randomness of modulated symbols. In this letter, a novel algorithm named grouped pre-chirp selection (GPS) is proposed to reduce PAPR by strategically varying the pre-chirp parameter across subcarrier groups. Initially, it is established that key AFDM properties are maintained when implementing GPS. Next, we proceed to detail the operational procedures of the GPS algorithm, elucidating its principle for PAPR reduction and emphasizing its computational efficiency advantages. Finally, simulation results employing the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) validate the effectiveness of the proposed GPS in reducing PAPR.</description>

      <title>Refined Bitcoin Security-Latency Under Network Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01372v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study security-latency bounds for Nakamoto consensus, i.e., how secure a block is after it becomes $k$-deep in the chain. We improve the state-of-the-art bounds by analyzing the race between adversarial and honest chains in three different phases. We find the probability distribution of the growth of the adversarial chains under models similar to those in [Guo, Ren; AFT 2022] when a target block becomes $k$-deep in the chain. We analyze certain properties of this race to model each phase with random walks that provide tighter bounds than the existing results. Combining all three phases provides novel upper and lower bounds for blockchains with small $\lambda\Delta$.</description>

      <title>The syzygy distinguisher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new distinguisher for alternant and Goppa codes, whose complexity is subexponential in the error-correcting capability, hence better than that of generic decoding algorithms. Moreover it does not suffer from the strong regime limitations of the previous distinguishers or structure recovery algorithms: in particular, it applies to the codes used in the Classic McEliece candidate for postquantum cryptography standardization. The invariants that allow us to distinguish are graded Betti numbers of the homogeneous coordinate ring of a shortening of the dual code.
  Since its introduction in 1978, this is the first time an analysis of the McEliece cryptosystem breaks the exponential barrier.</description>
