      <title>A note on Diagonal sequences of integer partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let \(\mathcal{P}(n)\) be the set of partitions of the positive integer \(n\). For \(\alpha=(\alpha_1,...,\alpha_t) \in \mathcal{P}(n)\) define the diagonal sequence \(\delta(\alpha)=(d_k(\alpha))_{k \geq 1}\) via \( d_k(\alpha) = \big\lvert \{ i \, \rvert \, 1 \leq i \leq k \mbox{ and } \alpha_i + i- 1\geq k \} \big\rvert.\) We show that the set of all partitions in \(\mathcal{P}(n)\) with the same diagonal sequence is a partially ordered set under majorization with unique maximal and minimal elements and we give an explicit formula for the number of partitions with the same diagonal sequence.</description>

      <title>When do Schubert polynomial products stabilize?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "back-stabilization number" for products of Schubert polynomials is the distance the corresponding permutations must be shifted before the structure constants stabilize. We give an explicit formula for this number and thereby prove a conjecture of N. Li in a strengthened form. Our method is to explore back-stable fundamental slide polynomials and their products combinatorially, in the context of their associated words. We use three main tools: (i) an algebra consisting of "colored words", with a modified shuffle product, and which contains the rings of back (quasi)symmetric functions as subquotients; (ii) the combinatorics of increasing suffixes of reduced words; and (iii) the lift of differential operators to the space of colored words.</description>

      <title>The maximum sturdiness of intersecting families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a family $\mathcal{F}\subset 2^{[n]}$ and $1\leq i\neq j\leq n$, we use $\mathcal{F}(\bar{i},j)$ to denote the family $\{F\setminus \{j\}\colon F\in \mathcal{F},\ F\cap \{i,j\}=\{j\}\}$. The sturdiness of $\mathcal{F}$ is defined as the minimum $|\mathcal{F}(\bar{i},j)|$ over all $i,j\in [n]$ with $i\neq j$. It has a very natural algebraic definition as well. In the present paper, we consider the maximum sturdiness of $k$-uniform intersecting families, $k$-uniform $t$-intersecting families and non-uniform $t$-intersecting families. One of the main results shows that for $n\geq 36(k+6)$, an intersecting family $\mathcal{F}\subset \binom{[n]}{k}$ has sturdiness at most $\binom{n-4}{k-3}$, which is best possible.</description>

      <title>A neighborhood union condition for the existence of a spanning tree without degree $2$ vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a connected graph $G$, a spanning tree $T$ of $G$ is called a homeomorphically irreducible spanning tree (HIST) if $T$ has no vertices of degree $2$. In this paper, we show that if $G$ is a graph of order $n\ge 270$ and $|N(u)\cup N(v)|\geq\frac{n-1}{2}$ holds for every pair of nonadjacent vertices $u$ and $v$ in $G$, then $G$ has a HIST, unless $G$ belongs to three exceptional families of graphs or $G$ has a cut-vertex of degree $2$. This result improves the latest conclusion, due to Ito and Tsuchiya, that a HIST in $G$ can be guaranteed if $d(u)+d(v)\geq n-1$ holds for every pair of nonadjacent vertices $u$ and $v$ in $G$.</description>

      <title>Order Polytopes of Dimension $\leq 13$ are Ehrhart Positive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The order polytopes arising from the finite poset were first introduced and studied by Stanley. For any positive integer $d\geq 14$, Liu and Tsuchiya proved that there exists a non-Ehrhart positive order polytope of dimension $d$. They also proved that any order polytope of dimension $d\leq 11$ is Ehrhart positive. We confirm that any order polytope of dimension $12$ or $13$ is Ehrhart positive. This solves an open problem proposed by Liu and Tsuchiya. Besides, we also verify that any $h^{*}$-polynomial of order polytope of dimension $d\leq 13$ is real-rooted.</description>

      <title>Lagrangians are attained as uniform Tur\'an densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of uniform Tur\'an densities was initiated in the 1980s by Erd\H{o}s and S\'os. Given a $3$-graph $F$, the uniform Tur\'an density of $F$, $\pi_{\therefore}(F)$, is defined as the infimum $d\in[0,1]$ such that every $3$-graph $H$ in which every linearly sized $S\subseteq V(H)$ induces at least $(d+o(1))\binom{\vert S\vert}{3}$ edges must contain a copy of $F$. Disproving Erd\H{o}s's famous jumping conjecture, Frankl and R\"odl showed that the set of Tur\'an densities is not well-ordered. We prove an analogous result for the uniform Tur\'an density, namely that the set $\Pi^{(3)}_{\therefore,\infty}=\{\pi_{\therefore}(\mathcal{F}) : \mathcal{F}\text{ a family of }3\text{-graphs} \}$ is not well-ordered. This is a consequence of a more general result, which in particular implies that for every Lagrangian $\Lambda$ of a $3$-graph and integer $1 \leq t \leq 6$ we have $\frac{t}{6}\Lambda\in \Pi^{(3)}_{\therefore,\infty}$.</description>

      <title>Roman domination number of zero-divisor graphs over commutative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G= (V, E)$, a Roman dominating function is a map $f : V \rightarrow \{0, 1, 2\}$ satisfies the property that if $f(v) = 0$, then $v$ must have adjacent to at least one vertex $u$ such that $f(u)= 2$. The weight of a Roman dominating function $f$ is the value $f(V)= \Sigma_{u \in V} f(u)$, and the minimum weight of a Roman dominating function on $G$ is called the Roman domination number of $G$, denoted by $\gamma_R(G)$. The main focus of this paper is to study the Roman domination number of zero-divisor graph $\Gamma(R)$ and find the bounds of the Roman domination number of $T(\Gamma(R))$.</description>

Abstract: We prove the universal optimality of four remarkable spherical 11-designs in 48 dimensions either among all antipodal codes, or all spherical 3-designs, whose inner-products avoid the set $T_1=(-1/3,-1/6) \cup (1/6,1/3)$. We also prove the universal optimality of these configurations among all codes whose distance-avoiding set is $T_2=(-1/2,-1/3) \cup (1/3,1/2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power of symbolic computation, as opposed to mere numerical computation, is illustrated with efficient algorithms for studying the generalized gambler's ruin problem in one and two dimensions. We also consider a new generalization of the classical gambler's ruin where we add a third step which we call the mirror step. In this scenario, we provide closed formulas for the probability and expected duration.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic odd cycles in edge-coloured complete graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is easy to see that every $q$-edge-colouring of the complete graph on $2^q+1$ vertices must contain a monochromatic odd cycle. A natural question raised by Erd\H{o}s and Graham in $1973$ asks for the smallest $L(q)$ such that every $q$-edge-colouring of $K_{2^q+1}$ must contain a monochromatic odd cycle of length at most $L(q)$. In here, we show that $L(q)=O\left(\frac{2^q}{q^{1-o(1)}}\right)$ giving the first non-trivial upper bound on $L(q)$.</description>

      <title>Almost-full transversals in equi-$n$-squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1975, Stein made a wide generalisation of the Ryser-Brualdi-Stein conjecture on transversals in Latin squares, conjecturing that every equi-$n$-square (an $n\times n$ array filled with $n$ symbols where each symbol appears exactly $n$ times) has a transversal of size $n-1$. That is, it should have a collection of $n-1$ entries that share no row, column, or symbol. In 2017, Aharoni, Berger, Kotlar, and Ziv showed that equi-$n$-squares always have a transversal with size at least $2n/3$. In 2019, Pokrovskiy and Sudakov disproved Stein's conjecture by constructing equi-$n$-squares without a transversal of size $n-\frac{\log n}{42}$, but asked whether Stein's conjecture is approximately true. I.e., does an equi-$n$-square always have a transversal with size $(1-o(1))n$?
  We answer this question in the positive. More specifically, we improve both known bounds, showing that there exist equi-$n$-squares with no transversal of size $n-\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ and that every equi-$n$-square contains $n-n^{1-\Omega(1)}$ disjoint transversals of size $n-n^{1-\Omega(1)}$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the restrictions on the number $m$ of conic-line curves in special pencils. The most general result we obtain is an upper bound on $m$: it cannot exceed 6. We construct a one-parameter family of pencils such that each pencil in the family contains exactly 4 conic-line curves. We also deal with pencils whose conic-line curves are in general position.</description>

      <title>A novel approach to the giant component fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to study the evolution of the size (i.e. the number of vertices) of the giant component of a random graph process. It is based on the exploration algorithm called simultaneous breadth-first walk, introduced by Limic in 2019, that encodes the dynamic of the evolution of the sizes of the connected components of a large class of random graph processes. We limit our study to the variant of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph process $(G_n(s))_{s\geq 0}$ with $n$ vertices where an edge connecting a pair of vertices appears at an exponential rate 1 waiting time, independently over pairs. We first use the properties of the simultaneous breadth-first walk to obtain an alternative and self-contained proof of the functional central limit theorem recently established by Enriquez, Faraud and Lemaire in the super-critical regime ($s=\frac{c}{n}$ and $c&gt;1$). Next, to show the versatility of our approach, we prove a functional central limit theorem in the barely super-critical regime ($s=\frac{1+t\epsilon_n}{n}$ where $t&gt;0$ and $(\epsilon_n)_n$ is a sequence of positive reals that converges to 0 such that $(n\epsilon_n^3)_n$ tends to $+\infty$).</description>

      <title>Random regular graph states are complex at almost any depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph states are fundamental objects in the theory of quantum information due to their simple classical description and rich entanglement structure. They are also intimately related to IQP circuits, which have applications in quantum pseudorandomness and quantum advantage. For us, they are a toy model to understand the relation between circuit connectivity, entanglement structure and computational complexity. In the worst case, a strict dichotomy in the computational universality of such graph states appears as a function of the degree $d$ of a regular graph state [GDH+23]. In this paper, we initiate the study of the average-case complexity of simulating random graph states of varying degree when measured in random product bases and give distinct evidence that a similar complexity-theoretic dichotomy exists in the average case. Specifically, we consider random $d$-regular graph states and prove three distinct results: First, we exhibit two families of IQP circuits of depth $d$ and show that they anticoncentrate for any $2 &lt; d = o(n)$ when measured in a random $X$-$Y$-plane product basis. This implies anticoncentration for random constant-regular graph states. Second, in the regime $d = \Theta(n^c)$ with $c \in (0,1)$, we prove that random $d$-regular graph states contain polynomially large grid graphs as induced subgraphs with high probability. This implies that they are universal resource states for measurement-based computation. Third, in the regime of high degree ($d\sim n/2$), we show that random graph states are not sufficiently entangled to be trivially classically simulable, unlike Haar random states. Proving the three results requires different techniques--the analysis of a classical statistical-mechanics model using Krawtchouck polynomials, graph theoretic analysis using the switching method, and analysis of the ranks of submatrices of random adjacency matrices, respectively.</description>

      <title>Automated Discovery of Branching Rules with Optimal Complexity for the Maximum Independent Set Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The branching algorithm is a fundamental technique for designing fast exponential-time algorithms to solve combinatorial optimization problems exactly. It divides the entire solution space into independent search branches using predetermined branching rules, and ignores the search on suboptimal branches to reduce the time complexity. The complexity of a branching algorithm is primarily determined by the branching rules it employs, which are often designed by human experts. In this paper, we show how to automate this process with a focus on the maximum independent set problem. The main contribution is an algorithm that efficiently generate optimal branching rules for a given sub-graph with tens of vertices. Its efficiency enables us to generate the branching rules on-the-fly, which is provably optimal and significantly reduces the number of branches compared to existing methods that rely on expert-designed branching rules. Numerical experiment on 3-regular graphs shows an average complexity of O(1.0441^n) can be achieved, better than any previous methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05487v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider $k$-graphs on $n$ vertices, that is, $\mathcal{F}\subset \binom{[n]}{k}$. A $k$-graph $\mathcal{F}$ is called intersecting if $F\cap F'\neq \emptyset$ for all $F,F'\in \mathcal{F}$. In the present paper we prove that for $k\geq 7$, $n\geq 2k$, any intersecting $k$-graph $\mathcal{F}$ with covering number at least three, satisfies $|\mathcal{F}|\leq \binom{n-1}{k-1}-\binom{n-k}{k-1}-\binom{n-k-1}{k-1}+\binom{n-2k}{k-1}+\binom{n-k-2}{k-3}+3$, the best possible upper bound which was proved in \cite{F80} subject to exponential constraints $n&gt;n_0(k)$.</description>

      <title>CSGO: Constrained-Softassign Gradient Optimization For Large Graph Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.08233v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph matching aims to find correspondences between two graphs. This paper integrates several well-known graph matching algorithms into a framework: the constrained gradient method. The primary difference among these algorithms lies in tuning a step size parameter and constraining operators. By leveraging these insights, we propose an adaptive step size parameter to guarantee the underlying algorithms' convergence, simultaneously enhancing their efficiency and robustness. For the constraining operator, we introduce a scalable softassign for large graph matching problems. Compared to the original softassign, our approach offers increased speed, improved robustness, and reduced risk of overflow. The advanced constraining operator enables a CSGO for large graph matching, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments. Notably, in attributed graph matching tasks, CSGO achieves an over 10X increase in speed compared to current constrained gradient algorithms.</description>

      <title>Comparing list-color functions of uniform hypergraphs with their chromatic polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02497v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 161 (2023), 109--119], the authors showed that the list-color function $P_l(G,k)$ of any simple graph $G$ of size $m$ coincides with its chromatic polynomial $P(G,k)$ for all integers $k\ge m-1$. In this article, we extend this conclusion to any uniform hypergraph. Furthermore, we show that for any $r$-uniform hypergraph ${\cal H}=(V,E)$, where $r\ge 2$, $P({\cal H}, L)-P({\cal H},k)\ge (k-|E|+1)k^{|V|-r-1}\sum\limits_{e\in E}\left (k-\left|\bigcap\limits_{v\in e}L(v)\right|\right )$ holds for all integers $k$ with $k\ge |E|-1\ge 4$ and all $k$-assignments $L$ of ${\cal H}$, where $P({\cal H}, L)$ is the number of $L$-colorings of ${\cal H}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11680v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Tur\'an number of a graph $H$, denoted by $ex(n,H)$, is the maximum number of edges in any graph on $n$ vertices containing no $H$ as a subgraph. A linear (star) forest is a forest consisting of paths (stars). A path-star forest $F$ is a forest consisting of paths and stars. In this paper, we determine $ex(n,F)$ for sufficiently large $n$ and characterize the corresponding extremal graphs, and our result generalizes previous known results on the Tur\'an numbers of linear forests and star forests.</description>

      <title>Locked Polyomino Tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15996v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A locked $t$-omino tiling is a grid tiling by $t$-ominoes such that, if you remove any pair of tiles, the only way to fill in the remaining $2t$ grid cells with $t$-ominoes is to use the same two tiles in the exact same configuration as before. We exclude degenerate cases where there is only one tiling overall due to small dimensions. It is a classic (and straightforward) result that finite grids do not admit locked 2-omino tilings. In this paper, we construct explicit locked $t$-omino tilings for $t \geq 3$ on grids of various dimensions. Most notably, we show that locked 3- and 4-omino tilings exist on finite square grids of arbitrarily large size, and locked $t$-omino tilings of the infinite grid exist for arbitrarily large $t$. The result for 4-omino tilings in particular is remarkable because they are so rare and difficult to construct: Only a single tiling is known to exist on any grid up to size $40 \times 40$. In a weighted version of the problem where vertices of the grid may have weights from the set $\{1, 2\}$ that count toward the total tile size, we demonstrate the existence of locked tilings on arbitrarily large square weighted grids with only 6 tiles.
  Locked $t$-omino tilings arise as obstructions to widely used political redistricting algorithms in a model of redistricting where the underlying census geography is a grid graph. Most prominent is the ReCom Markov chain, which takes a random walk on the space of redistricting plans by iteratively merging and splitting pairs of districts (tiles) at a time. Locked $t$-omino tilings are isolated states in the state space of ReCom. The constructions in this paper are counterexamples to the meta-conjecture that ReCom is irreducible on graphs of practical interest.</description>

      <title>On the $C$-diversity of intersecting hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}\subset \binom{X}{k}$ be a family consisting of $k$-subsets of the $n$-set $X$. Suppose that $\mathcal{F}$ is intersecting, i.e., $F\cap F'\neq \emptyset$ for all $F,F'\in \mathcal{F}$. Let $\Delta(\mathcal{F})$ be the maximum degree of $\mathcal{F}$. For a constant $C\geq 1$ the $C$-diversity, $\gamma_C(\mathcal{F})$ is defined as $|\mathcal{F}|-C\Delta(\mathcal{F})$. Define $\mathcal{F}_{123} =\left\{F\in \binom{X}{k}\colon |F\cap \{1,2,3\}|=2\right\}$. It has $C$-diversity $(3-2C)\binom{n-3}{k-2}$. The main result shows that for $1&lt; C&lt;\frac{3}{2}$ and $n\geq \frac{42}{3-2C}k$, $\gamma_C(\mathcal{F})\leq \gamma_C(\mathcal{F}_{123})$ with equality if and only if $\mathcal{F}$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal{F}_{123}$. For the case of ordinary diversity $(C=1)$ a strong stability is proven.</description>

      <title>What is a 4-connected matroid?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The breadth of a tangle $\mathcal{T}$ in a matroid is the size of the largest spanning uniform submatroid of the tangle matroid of $\mathcal{T}$. The matroid $M$ is weakly 4-connected if it is 3-connected and whenever $(X,Y)$ is a partition of $E(M)$ with $|X|,|Y|&gt;4$, then $\lambda(X)\geq 3$. We prove that if $\mathcal{T}$ is a tangle of order $k\geq 4$ and breadth $l$ in a matroid $M$, then $M$ has a weakly 4-connected minor $N$ with a tangle $\mathcal{T}_N$ of order $k$, breadth $l$ and has the property that $\mathcal{T}$ is the tangle in $M$ induced by $\mathcal{T}_N$.
  A set $Z$ of elements of a matroid $M$ is 4-connected if $\lambda(A)\geq\min\{|A\cap Z|,|Z-A|,3\}$ for all $A\subseteq E(M)$. As a corollary of our theorems on tangles we prove that if $M$ contains an $n$-element 4-connected set where $n\geq 7$, then $M$ has a weakly $4$-connected minor that contains an $n$-element $4$-connected set.</description>

Abstract: We use the differential algebra of polytopes to explain the known remarkable relation of the combinatorics of the associahedra and permutohedra with the universal compositional and multiplicative inversion formulas for the formal power series. This approach allows to single out the associahedra and permutohedra among all graph-associahedra and emphasizes the significance of the differential equations for special sequences of simple polytopes derived earlier by one of the authors. We discuss also the link with the geometry of Deligne-Mumford moduli spaces $\bar M_{0,n}$ and the interpretation of the combinatorics of cyclohedra in relation with the classical Fa\`a di Bruno's formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a parking function, a lucky car is a car that parks in its preferred parking spot and the parking outcome is the permutation encoding the order in which the cars park on the street. We give a characterization for the set of parking outcomes arising from parking functions with a fixed set of lucky cars. This characterization involves the descent bottom set of a permutation, and we use the characterization to we give a formula for the number of parking functions with a fixed set of lucky cars. Our work includes the cases where the number of cars is equal to the number of parking spots, and where there are more spots than cars. We also give product formulas for the number of weakly increasing parking functions having a fixed set of lucky cars, and when the number of cars equals the number of spots this is a product of Catalan numbers.</description>

Abstract: The strong vertex (edge) span of a given graph $G$ is the maximum distance that two players can maintain at all times while visiting all vertices (edges) of $G$ and moving either to an adjacent vertex or staying in the current position independently of each other. We introduce the notions of switching walks and triod size of a tree, which are used to determine the strong vertex and the strong edge span of an arbitrary tree. The obtained results are used in an algorithm that computes the strong vertex (edge) span of the input tree in linear time.</description>

      <title>Vertex-distinguishing and sum-distinguishing edge coloring of regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an integer $k\ge1$, an edge-$k$-coloring of a graph $G$ is an assignment of $k$ colors $1,\ldots,k$ to the edges of $G$ such that no two adjacent edges receive the same color. A vertex-distinguishing (resp. sum-distinguishing) edge-$k$-coloring of $G$ is an edge-$k$-coloring such that for any two distinct vertices $u$ and $v$, the set (resp. sum) of colors taken from all the edges incident with $u$ is different from that taken from all the edges incident with $v$. The vertex-distinguishing chromatic index (resp. sum-distinguishing chromatic index), denoted $\chi'_{vd}(G)$ (resp. $\chi'_{sd}(G)$), is the smallest value $k$ such that $G$ has a vertex-distinguishing-edge-$k$-coloring (resp. sum-distinguishing-edge-$k$-coloring). Let $G$ be a $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, where $n$ is even and sufficiently large. We show that $\chi'_{vd}(G) =d+2$ if $d$ is arbitrarily close to $n/2$ from above, and $\chi'_{sd}(G) =d+2$ if $d\ge \frac{2n}{3}$. Our first result strengthens a result of Balister et al. in 2004 for such class of regular graphs, and our second result constitutes a significant advancement in the field of sum-distinguishing edge coloring.
  To achieve these results, we introduce novel edge coloring results which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>An objective function for order preserving hierarchical clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.04266v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theory and an objective function for similarity-based hierarchical clustering of probabilistic partial orders and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Specifically, given elements $x \le y$ in the partial order, and their respective clusters $[x]$ and $[y]$, the theory yields an order relation $\le'$ on the clusters such that $[x]\le'[y]$. The theory provides a concise definition of order-preserving hierarchical clustering, and offers a classification theorem identifying the order-preserving trees (dendrograms). To determine the optimal order-preserving trees, we develop an objective function that frames the problem as a bi-objective optimisation, aiming to satisfy both the order relation and the similarity measure. We prove that the optimal trees under the objective are both order-preserving and exhibit high-quality hierarchical clustering. Since finding an optimal solution is NP-hard, we introduce a polynomial-time approximation algorithm and demonstrate that the method outperforms existing methods for order-preserving hierarchical clustering by a significant margin.</description>

      <title>Limit Profile for Projections of Random Walks on Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Establishing cutoff, an abrupt transition from "not mixed" to "well mixed", is a classical topic in the theory of mixing times for Markov chains. Interest has grown recently in determining not only the existence of cutoff and the order of its mixing time and window, but the exact shape, or profile, of the convergence inside the window. Classical techniques, such as coupling or $\ell_2$-bounds, are typically too crude to establish this and there has been a push to develop general techniques.
  We build upon this work, extending from conjugacy-invariant random walks on groups to certain projections. We exemplify our method by analysing the $k$-particle interchange process on the complete $n$-graph with $k \asymp n$. This is a projection of the random-transposition card shuffle, which corresponds to $k = n$, analysed by Teyssier.</description>

      <title>Permutation and Multi-permutation Codes Correcting Multiple Deletions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Permutation codes in the Ulam metric, which can correct multiple deletions, have been investigated extensively recently. In this work, we are interested in the maximum size of permutation codes in the Ulam metric and aim to design permutation codes that can correct multiple deletions with efficient decoding algorithms. We first present an improvement on the Gilbert--Varshamov bound of the maximum size of these permutation codes by analyzing the independence number of the auxiliary graph. The idea is widely used in various cases and our contribution in this section is enumerating the number of triangles in the auxiliary graph and showing that it is small enough. Next, we design permutation codes correcting multiple deletions with a decoding algorithm. In particular, the constructed permutation codes can correct $t$ deletions with at most $(3t-1) \log n+o(\log n)$ bits of redundancy where $n$ is the length of the code. Our construction is based on a new mapping which yields a new connection between permutation codes in the Hamming metric and permutation codes in various metrics. Furthermore, we construct permutation codes that correct multiple bursts of deletions using this new mapping. Finally, we extend the new mapping for multi-permutations and construct the best-known multi-permutation codes in Ulam metric.</description>

Abstract: This article addresses a combinatorial problem with applications to algebraic geometry. To a convex lattice polytope $P$ and each of its integer dilations $kP$ one may associate the barycenter of its lattice points. This sequence of $k$-quantized barycenters converge to the (classical) barycenter of the polytope considered as a convex body. A basic question arises: is there a complete asymptotic expansion for this sequence? If so, what are its terms? This article initiates the study of this question. First, we establish the existence of such an expansion as well as determine the first two terms. Second, for Delzant lattice polytopes we use toric algebra to determine all terms using mixed volumes of virtual rooftop polytopes, or alternatively in terms of higher Donaldson--Futaki invariants. Third, for reflexive polytopes we show the quantized barycenters are colinear to first order, and actually colinear in the case of polygons. The proofs use Ehrhart theory, convexity arguments, and toric algebra. As applications we derive the complete asymptotic expansion of the Fujita--Odaka stability thresholds $\delta_k$ on arbitrary polarizations on (possibly singular) toric varieties. In fact, we show they are rational functions of $k$ for sufficiently large $k$. This gives the first general result on Tian's stabilization problem for $\delta_k$-invariants for (possibly singular) toric Fanos: $\delta_k$ stabilize in $k$ if and only if they are all equal to $1$, and when smooth if and only if asymptotically Chow semistable. We also relate the asymptotic expansions to higher Donaldson--Futaki invariants of test configurations motivated by Ehrhart theory, and unify in passing previous results of Donaldson, Ono, Futaki, and Rubinstein--Tian--Zhang.</description>

      <title>Cauchy identities for staircase matrices</title>

Abstract: The celebrated Cauchy identity expresses the product of terms $(1 - x_i y_j)^{-1}$ for $(i,j)$ indexing entries of a rectangular $m\times n$-matrix as a sum over partitions $\lambda$ of products of Schur polynomials: $s_{\lambda}(x)s_{\lambda}(y)$. Algebraically, this identity comes from the decomposition of the symmetric algebra of the space of rectangular matrices, considered as a $\mathfrak{gl}_m$-$\mathfrak{gl}_n$-bi-module. We generalize the Cauchy decomposition by replacing rectangular matrices with arbitrary staircase-shaped matrices equipped with the left and right actions of the Borel upper-triangular subalgebras. For any given staircase shape $\mathsf{Y}$ we describe left and right "standard" filtrations on the symmetric algebra of the space of shape $\mathsf{Y}$ matrices. We show that the subquotients of these filtrations are tensor products of Demazure and opposite van der Kallen modules over the Borel subalgebras. On the level of characters, we derive three distinct expansions for the product $(1 - x_i y_j)^{-1}$ for $(i,j) \in \mathsf{Y}$. The first two expansions are sums of products of key polynomials $\kappa_\lambda(x)$ and (opposite) Demazure atoms $a^{\mu}(y)$. The third expansion is an alternating sum of products of key polynomials $\kappa_{\lambda}(x)\,\kappa^{\mu}(y)$.</description>

      <title>Relative Lonely Runner spectra</title>

Abstract: For a subtorus $T \subseteq (\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^n$, let $D(T)$ denote the $L^\infty$-distance from $T$ to the point $(1/2, \ldots, 1/2)$. For a subtorus $U \subseteq (\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^n$, define $\mathcal{S}_1(U)$, the Lonely Runner spectrum relative to $U$, to be the set of all values of $D(T)$ as $T$ ranges over the $1$-dimensional subtori of $U$ not contained in the union of the coordinate hyperplanes of $(\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^n$. The relative spectrum $\mathcal{S}_1((\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^n)$ is the ordinary Lonely Runner spectrum that has been studied previously.
  Giri and the second author recently showed that the relative spectra $\mathcal{S}_1(U)$ for $2$-dimensional subtori $U \subseteq (\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^n$ essentially govern the accumulation points of the Lonely Runner spectrum $\mathcal{S}_1((\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^n)$. In the present work, we prove that such relative spectra $\mathcal{S}_1(U)$ have a very rigid arithmetic structure, and that one can explicitly find a complete characterization of each such relative spectrum with a finite calculation; carrying out this calculation for a few specific examples sheds light on previous constructions in the literature on the Lonely Runner Problem.</description>
