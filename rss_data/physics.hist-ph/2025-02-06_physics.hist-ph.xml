      <title>Prigogine's temporalization of physics: two agnostic attitudes of physicsits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I aim to clarify the unconscious ideologies and attitudes held by physicists through Prigogine's work. Prigogine was an outstanding chemist and physicist who made significant contributions to the development of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. At the same time, he extended his ideas beyond physics into the humanities, engaging in an interdisciplinary exploration of scientific and philosophical thought. Due to this unique careers, Prigogine's reception has been deeply divided. However, rather than focusing on the controversies surrounding his work, this study highlights his intellectual endeavors, using them as a lens to examine the underlying worldview of modern physics. Through this analysis, I will uncover two distinct agnostic attitudes-one held by dynamicists and the other by Prigogine himself. Finally, drawing on Bergson's philosophy, I will explore Prigogine's vision of a new relationship between humans and nature, as well as his temopralization of time in broader context to extend their philosophy alive.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cosmology and the Age of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article I study how the problem of time of canonical approaches to quantum gravity affects the simple minisuperspace models used in quantum cosmology. I follow some authors who have argued that this issue makes the quantization of general relativity problematic to conclude that the same applies in the case of quantum cosmology. In particular, I argue that temporal structures are lost in quantization and that this is a problem, as they encode part of the empirical content of classical cosmology, such as the age of the universe.</description>
