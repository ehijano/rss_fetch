      <title>Piezoresistive PtSe$_2$ pressure sensors with reliable high sensitivity and their integration into CMOS ASIC substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membrane-based sensors are an important market for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Two-dimensional (2D) materials, with their low mass, are excellent candidates for suspended membranes to provide high sensitivity, small footprint sensors. The present work demonstrates pressure sensors employing large-scale-synthesized 2D platinum diselenide (PtSe${_2}$) films as piezoresistive membranes supported only by a thin polymer layer. We investigate three different synthesis methods with contrasting growth parameters and establish a reliable high yield fabrication process for suspended PtSe${_2}$/PMMA membranes across sealed cavities. The pressure sensors reproducibly display sensitivities above 6 x 10${^4}$ kPa. We show that the sensitivity clearly depends on the membrane diameter and the piezoresistive gauge factor of the PtSe${_2}$ film. Reducing the total device size by decreasing the number of membranes within a device leads to a significant increase in the area-normalized sensitivity. This allows the manufacturing of pressure sensors with high sensitivity but a much smaller device footprint than the current state-of-the-art MEMS technology. We further integrate PtSe${_2}$ pressure sensors with CMOS technology, improving the technological readiness of PtSe${_2}$-based MEMS and NEMS devices.</description>

      <title>Koopman analysis of combinatorial optimization problems with replica exchange Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems play crucial roles in real-world applications, and many studies from a physics perspective have contributed to specialized hardware for high-speed computation. However, some combinatorial optimization problems are easy to solve, and others are not. Hence, the qualification of the difficulty in problem-solving will be beneficial. In this paper, we employ the Koopman analysis for multiple time-series data from the replica exchange Monte Carlo method. After proposing a quantity that aggregates the information of the multiple time-series data, we performed numerical experiments. The results indicate a negative correlation between the proposed quantity and the ability of the solution search.</description>

      <title>Low-phase-noise surface acoustic wave oscillator using phononic crystal bandgap-edge mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-phase-noise microwave-frequency integrated oscillators provide compact solutions for various applications in signal processing, communications, and sensing. Surface acoustic waves (SAW), featuring orders-of-magnitude shorter wavelength than electromagnetic waves at the same frequency, enable integrated microwave-frequency systems with much smaller footprint on chip. SAW devices also allow higher quality (Q) factors than electronic components at room temperature. Here, we demonstrate a low-phase-noise gigahertz-frequency SAW oscillator on 128{\deg}Y-cut lithium niobate, where the SAW resonator occupies a footprint of 0.05 mm$^2$. Leveraging phononic crystal bandgap-edge modes to balance between Q factors and insertion losses, our 1-GHz SAW oscillator features a low phase noise of -132.5 dBc/Hz at a 10 kHz offset frequency and an overlapping Hadamard deviation of $6.5\times10^{-10}$ at an analysis time of 64 ms. The SAW resonator-based oscillator holds high potential in developing low-noise sensors and acousto-optic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Over 50 mA current in interdigitated diamond field effect transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents the bulk diamond field-effect transistor (FET) with the highest current value reported at this moment. The goal was to drastically increase the current of this type of device by increasing the total gate width thanks to an interdigitated architecture and homogeneous growth properties. We report the results obtained by fabricating and characterizing an interdigitated junction FET (JFET). The device develops a total gate width of 14.7 mm, with 24 paralleled fingers and a current higher than 50 mA at VDS = -15 V, VGS = 0 V, at 450 K and under illumination which is the highest value reported for a bulk diamond FET. Its specific ON-resistance and threshold voltage are respectively 608 m$\Omega$.cm${}^2$, 50 V. From Transfer length method (TLM) measurements we extract a resistivity of 3.6 m$\Omega$.cm for a heavily boron-doped (p++)-diamond layer and 1.52 $\Omega$.cm for a 2.1017 cm-3 p-doped diamond layer at 450 K. We measured the drain current versus gate voltage characteristics at high temperature showing that it is no longer the conduction channel resistance but the device access resistance that is predominant. This study indicates that it is possible to drastically improve the ON-state of FETs by using an interdigitated architecture, while using homogeneous large size diamond layers grown by CVD.</description>

      <title>Simplified EPFL GaN HEMT Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a simplified and design-oriented version of the EPFL HEMT model [1], focusing on the normalized transconductance-to-current characteristic (Gm/ID ). Relying on these figures, insights into GaN HEMT modeling in relation to technology offers a comprehensive understanding of the device behavior. Validation is achieved through measured transfer characteristics of GaN HEMTs fabricated at IMEC on a broad range of biases. This simplified approach should enable a simple and effective circuit design methodology with AlGaN/GaN HEMT heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Multi-Roller Structure Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Enhanced Water Wave Energy Harvesting and Energy Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave energy harvesting is critical for advancing the development and utilization of marine resources. In this study, we present a novel multi-roller structure triboelectric nanogenerator (MR-TENG) designed specifically for efficient water wave energy harvesting. The MR-TENG leverages a coupled multi-roller design to significantly enhance its energy harvesting capabilities. The triboelectric layers are composed of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) film and paper, with a grid copper electrode serving as the conductive element. Through an optimized energy output strategy, a single MR-TENG is capable of generating 602.045 {\mu}J of electrical energy within 100 s. The device achieves a short-circuit current (Isc) of approximately 2.06 {\mu}A and an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of around 166 V. We further investigate the impact of different connection modes, including parallel and series configurations, on the performance of MR-TENG arrays. Notably, the electrical energy produced by the MR-TENG array is sufficient to power 40 blue commercial light-emitting diodes (LEDs). This research not only introduces a versatile optimization approach and energy management strategy for roller-structured TENGs but also contributes significantly to the advancement of ocean-based TENG technology.</description>

      <title>Highly robust and efficient metal-free water cup solid-liquid triboelectric generator for mechanical energy harvesting and ethanol detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, low-frequency mechanical energy harvesters based on solid-liquid contact electrification have garnered widespread attention for their unique advantages in wear resistance, high charge transfer efficiency, and novel insights into electron-ion interactions at the solid-liquid interface, particularly in material identification. Hence, we designed an robust and efficient water cup triboelectric nanogenerator (WC-TENG) that only uses ordinary drinking water and plastic water cups as primary materials, achieving high-efficiency power output while eliminating the need for metal electrodes and effectively addressing the issue of corrosion in generator components. Experimental results indicate that, at an operating frequency of 2 Hz, the WC-TENG generates an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 249.71 V, a short-circuit current (Isc) of 4.21 uA, and a transferred charge (Qsc) of 188.85 nC. The WC-TENG demonstrates long-term stability and reliability, maintaining stable voltage output over 1500 s. Moreover, the WC-TENG maintains stable performance under high humidity conditions, and its output enhances with increasing temperature, underscoring its robustness and adaptability for diverse environmental applications. Furthermore, the introduction of ethanol disrupts the potential balance at the solid-liquid interface by impeding electron transfer and reducing the WC-TENG's electrical output, but as the ethanol volatilizes, the device gradually returns to its original potential state, demonstrating its potential as a selective ethanol sensor. This design not only advances the development of corrosion-resistant, high-performance energy harvesters but also opens up new possibilities for low-cost, sustainable, and environmentally adaptable sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Origin of the laser-induced picosecond spin current across magnetization compensation in ferrimagnetic GdCo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical manipulation of magnetism enabled by rare earth-transition metal ferrimagnets holds the promise of ultrafast, energy efficient spintronic technologies. This work investigates laser-induced picosecond spin currents generated by ferrimagnetic GdCo via terahertz emission spectroscopy. A suppression of the THz emission and spin current is observed at magnetization compensation when varying the temperature or alloy composition in the presence of a magnetic field. It is demonstrated that this is due to the formation of domains in the GdCo equilibrium magnetic configuration. Without an applied magnetic field, the picosecond spin current persists at the compensation point. The experimental findings support the model for THz spin current generation based on transport of hot spin-polarized electrons, which is dominated by the Co sublattice at room temperature. Only at low temperature a comparable contribution from Gd is detected but with slower dynamics. Finally, spectral analysis reveals a blueshift of the THz emission related to the formation of magnetic domains close to magnetization compensation.</description>

      <title>Bonding Hierarchy and Coordination Interaction Leading to High Thermoelectricity in Wide Bandgap TlAgI2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High thermoelectric properties are associated with the phonon-glass electron-crystal paradigm. Conventional wisdom suggests that the optimal bandgap of semiconductor to achieve the largest power factor should be between 6 and 10 kbT. To address challenges related to the bipolar effect and temperature limitations, we present findings on Zintl-type TlAgI2, which demonstrates an exceptionally low lattice thermal conductivity of 0.3 W m-1 K-1 at 300 K. The achieved figure of merit (ZT) for TlAgI2, featuring a 1.55 eV bandgap, reaches a value of 2.20 for p-type semiconductor. This remarkable ZT is attributed to the existence of extended antibonding states Ag-I in the valence band. Furthermore, the bonding hierarchy, influencing phonon anharmonicity, and coordination bonds, facilitating electron transfer between the ligand and the central metal ion, significantly contribute to electronic transport. This finding serves as a promising avenue for the development of high ZT materials with wide bandgaps at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <title>Thermo-electron accumulation in light and heavy water during MHz-burst laser ablation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-induced water ablation triggers various physical effects, including atom ionization, optical breakdown of the liquid, phase explosion, cavitation, and shockwave propagation. These effects can be further amplified in heavy water by deuterium-deuterium fusion reactions, which require extremely high energy levels. Laser pulses can be grouped in bursts to achieve the necessary energy within the ablation plasma plume. This study aims to compare the ablation plasma glow and thermal effects in light and heavy water under both single-pulse and burst-mode ultrashort laser irradiation. Notably, this research introduces the novel application of burst laser ablation in heavy water for the first time. The ablation was conducted beneath the water surface along a circular, laser-scanned trajectory, with two distinct ablation regimes: burst mode and single-pulse mode, utilizing lenses with varying focal lengths and different pulse durations. Absorption processes and plasma glow were monitored using visible and infrared detectors, a fast silicon detector, and a thermocouple.
  The study revealed that the burst regime in heavy water produced the most intense plasma glow when 1 ps laser pulses were used, with shorter pulses yielding less intense glow and the longest pulses yielding the least. Surprisingly, plasma glow at a lower initial power density of 2.6e13 W/cm2 was four times higher than at a higher power density of 8e13 W/cm2. These findings were compared with existing theories on plasma formation in water by ultrashort laser pulses. The observed increase in pulse-to-pulse plasma glow in burst mode was attributed to thermo-electron accumulation effects. The density of excited and hydrated electrons was calculated using both strong-field ionization and avalanche ionization models. Additionally, the influence of pulse parity on burst ablation glow in heavy water was discussed.</description>

      <title>Sensor fusion luminescence thermometry better together</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Luminescent thermometers are highly effective in niche applications such as nanothermometry, in vivo imaging, and extreme conditions like high electromagnetic fields, radiation, and under mechanical or chemical stress. Advancing measurement precision, temperature resolution, and extending the temperature range are the main problems in this rapidly evolving research field, crucial in the work of R&amp;D industry engineers and scientific researchers. Traditionally using single parameter for sensing leads to the sensor underperformance. Sensor fusion (SF), a well-established statistical tool used to enhance precision in autonomous vehicles, navigation systems, medical imaging, and wearable devices is here engineered for luminescent thermometry, by either fusing multiple sensor probes, or observing each temperature dependent feature as a separate sensor, resulting in always increased precision and extended usable temperature range. SF is a replacement and superior alternative to multiple linear regression models as it stands out for its versatility, enabling performance limits to be reached with any sensor probe material. It is compatible with both time-resolved and steady-state readouts, used independently or in combination, with single or multiple excitations. The benefits are illustrated using probes with Mn5+, Yb3+/Er3+/Ho3+, Sm2+, and Mn4+/Ho3+/Cr3+ activator ions.</description>

      <title>A Silicon Photonic Neural Network for Chromatic Dispersion Compensation in 20 Gbps PAM4 Signal at 125 km and Its Scalability up to 100 Gbps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A feed-forward photonic neural network (PNN) is tested for chromatic dispersion compensation in Intensity Modulation/Direct Detection optical links. The PNN is based on a sequence of linear and nonlinear transformations. The linear stage is constituted by an 8-tap time-delayed complex perceptron implemented on a Silicon-On-insulator platform and acting as a tunable optical filter. The nonlinear stage is provided by the square modulus of the electrical field applied at the end-of-line photodetector. The training maximizes the separation between the optical levels (i.e. the eye diagram aperture), with consequent reduction of the Bit Error Rate. Effective equalization is experimentally demonstrated for 20 Gbps 4-level Pulse Amplitude Modulated signal up to 125 km. An evolutionary algorithm and a gradient-based approach are tested for the training and then compared in terms of repeatability and convergence time. The optimal weights resulting from the training are interpreted in light of the theoretical transfer function of the optical fiber. Finally, a simulative study proves the scalability of the layout to larger bandwidths, up to 100 Gbps.</description>

      <title>Temperature shift of magnetic-field-dependent photoluminescence features of nitrogen-vacancy ensembles in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently significant attention has been paid to magnetic-field-dependent photoluminescence (PL) features of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. These features are used for microwave-free sensing and are indicative of the spin-bath properties in the diamond sample. Examinating the temperature dependence of the PL features allows to identify both temperature dependent and independent features, and to utilize them in diamond-based quantum sensing and dynamic nuclear polarization applications. Here, we study the thermal variability of many different features visible in a wide range of magnetic fields. To this end, we first discuss the origin of the features and tentatively assign the previously unidentified features to cross relaxation of NV center containing multi-spin systems. The experimental results are compared with theoretically predicted temperature shifts deduced from a combination of thermal expansion and electron-phonon interactions. A deeper insight into the thermal behavior of a wide array of the features may come with important consequences for various applications in high-precision NV thermometry, gyroscopes, solid-state clocks, and biomagnetic measurements.</description>

Abstract: Transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (TUS) holds promise for non-invasive neural modulation in treating neurological disorders. Most clinically relevant targets are deep within the brain (near or at its geometric center), surrounded by other sensitive regions that need to be spared clinical intervention. However, in TUS, increasing frequency with the goal of improving spatial resolution reduces the effective penetration depth. We show that by using a pair of 1 MHz, orthogonally arranged transducers we improve the spatial resolution afforded by each of the transducers individually, by nearly 40 fold, achieving a sub-cubic millimeter target volume of $0.24\ mm^3$. We show that orthogonally placed transducers generate highly localized standing waves with Acoustic Radiation Force (ARF) arranged into periodic regions of compression and tension near the target. We further present an extended capability of the orthogonal setup, which is to impart selective pressures--either positive or negative, but not both--on the target. Lastly, we share our preliminary findings that strain can arise from both particle motion and ARF with the former reaching its maximum value at the focus, and the latter remaining null at the focus and reaching its maximum around the focus.
  As the field is investigating the mechanism of interaction in TUS by way of elucidating the mapping between ultrasound parameters and neural response, orthogonal transducers expand our toolbox by making it possible to conduct these investigations at much finer spatial resolutions, with localized and directed (compression vs. tension) ARF and the capability of applying selective pressures at the target.</description>

      <title>On the Path to High-temperature Josephson Multi-junction Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report our progress in the high-temperature superconductor (HTS) Josephson junction fabrication process founded on using a focused helium ion beam damaging technique and discuss the expected device performance attainable with the HTS multi-junction device technology. Both the achievable high value of characteristic voltage $V_c=I_cR_N$ of Josephson junctions and the ability to design a large number of arbitrary located Josephson junctions allow narrowing the existing gap in design abilities for LTS and HTS circuits even with using a single YBCO film layer. A one-layer topology of active electrically small antenna is suggested and its voltage response characteristics are considered.</description>

      <title>Investigating Quantum Spin-Textures Using Universal MJ Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a pair of novel universal MJ spintronic models that precisely mirror the complex spin textures observed in spintronic materials. The spin-orbit coupled (SOC) Hamiltonians H_MJ1 and H_MJ2 reveal a range of novel and intriguing spin phenomena by modulating spin-orbit interactions. The Hamiltonian H_MJ1 reshapes the existing paradigm, providing a more robust and versatile framework than the Hamiltonian H_RD, with the potential to catalyze new advancements in the study of quantum materials. H_MJ1 encapsulates two distinct spin textures: a unidirectional, momentum-independent persistent spin texture (PST), and a bidirectional (partial) PST. In contrast Hamiltonian H_MJ2 portrays a spiral spin texture, drawing a conceptual link to the cosmological process of expansion and contraction, mirrored within a two-dimensional quantum framework. We also explore the fundamental aspects of earlier analytical models that underpin the construction of the present MJ spintronic model. The physical interpretations of these models are illustrated graphically, and the emerging spin phenomena resulting from complex SOC are elucidated using a simple vector model.</description>
