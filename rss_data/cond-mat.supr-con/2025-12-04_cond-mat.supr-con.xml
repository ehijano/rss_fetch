      <title>Short-Range Modulated Electron Lattice and d-Wave Superconductivity in Cuprates: A Phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau (GL) framework for high-$T_c$ cuprates in which a short-range modulation of the electronic charge density couples to a $d$-wave superconducting condensate. The resulting modulated electron lattice (MEL) state is distinct from long-range static charge density wave order: it is short range, partially phase coherent, and linked to superconducting coherence. A preferred wave vector $q^{\ast} \approx 0.3$ reciprocal lattice units along the Cu-O bond direction emerges from the interplay between a momentum-dependent susceptibility and bond-stretching phonons, consistent with neutron and x-ray data on YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ and related cuprates. The GL free energy contains coupled $d$-wave superconducting and charge sectors with parameters constrained by optimally doped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$. We identify an MEL enhancement window in doping, temperature, MEL correlation length, and disorder where a coherence linked modulation enhances the superfluid stiffness. Classical Monte Carlo simulations yield an in-plane stiffness enhancement of order ten percent, which we treat as a qualitative prediction to be tested by self-consistent Bogoliubov de Gennes calculations. The MEL framework yields falsifiable experimental signatures. For scanning tunneling spectroscopy in Bi-based cuprates we highlight two predictions: the Fourier-transformed local density of states should exhibit a $q^{\ast} \approx 0.3$ peak whose spectral weight sharpens as superconducting phase coherence develops below $T_c$, in contrast to static charge scenarios, and the local gap magnitude $\Delta(r)$ should correlate positively with the local MEL amplitude. The framework implies correlations between MEL correlation length, superfluid stiffness, disorder, and vortex pinning, and organizes cuprate observations into testable STM/STS predictions.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Tc in Oxide Superconductors: Double-Bridge Mechanism of High-Tc Superconductivity and Bose-Einstein Condensation of Cooper Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cuprate Hg0.8Tl0.2Ba2Ca2Cu3O8.33 exhibits the highest superconducting transition temperature Tc of 138K. Achieving superconductivity at even higher temperatures, up to room temperature, represents the ultimate dream of humanity. As temperature increases, Cooper pairs formed through weak electron-phonon coupling will be disintegrated by the thermal motion of electrons, severely limiting the enhancement of Tc. It is imperative to explore new strong-coupling pairing pictures and establish novel condensation mechanism of Cooper pairs at higher temperature. Based on our recently proposed groundbreaking idea of electron e- (hole h+) pairing bridged by oxygen O (metal M) atoms, namely, the eV-scale ionic-bond-driven atom-bridge (bridge-I) e--O-e- (h+-M-h+) strong-coupling itinerant Cooper pairing formed at pseudogap temperature T*&gt;Tc in ionic oxide superconductors, we further discover that there is an attractive interaction between two Cooper pairs induced by the bridge atom (bridge-II) located between them. It is this attraction mediated by the bridge-II atoms that promotes all the Cooper pairs within the CuO2 plane to hold together and enter the superconducting state at Tc finally. Moreover, according to the Bose-Einstein condensation theory, we find that Tc is inversely proportional to the effective mass m* of Cooper pairs, directly proportional to n2/3s (ns: the density of Cooper pairs), and linearly increases with the scattering length a&lt;0 due to attraction between two Cooper pairs. Therefore, according to our double-bridge mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity, increasing the attraction between Cooper pair and bridge-II atom, ensuring that ns takes the optimal value, and minimizing the effective mass of the Cooper pairs are the main approaches to enhancing Tc of ionic-bonded superconductors, which opens up a new avenue with clear direction for designing higher Tc superconductors.</description>

      <title>Experimental and Theoretical Revisit of Ca-H Superhydrides: Anharmonic Effects on Phase Stability and Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction of superconductivity above 200 K in CaH6 revolutionized research on hydrogen-rich superconductors, and subsequent experiments have verified this prediction, while unidentified peaks in XRD and the decrease in superconducting temperature upon decompression indicate that unresolved issues remain. In this work, we combine theory and experiment to construct an accurate temperature-pressure phase diagram of the Ca-H system and identify the stability ranges of the candidate superconducting phases by considering anharmonic effects. Our results demonstrate that type-I clathrate Ca8H46-delta structures become thermodynamically stable at 0 K when anharmonic effects are considered. Notably, we found that the previously predicted CaH6 phase achieves stability above 500 K, underscoring the significant role of temperature and anharmonic effects in stabilizing this intriguing high-pressure phase. Experimentally, we have successfully synthesized Ca8H46-delta phases at low temperatures, thereby validating our theoretical predictions. Our findings offer insights into the structure and superconducting mechanisms of hydrides.</description>

      <title>Magnetotransport and Carrier Dynamics in Quasi-One-Dimensional Antiferromagnet KMn$_6$Bi$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional materials $A$Mn$_6$Bi$_5$ ($A$ = Na, K, Rb, Cs) exhibit unique electronic behaviors such as antiferromagnetism, charge density waves, and pressure-induced superconductivity. Thus, they serve as a suitable model system to investigate emergent quantum phenomena produced by the interactions among spin, charge, and lattice. Here we report the magnetotransport properties of KMn$_6$Bi$_5$, revealing a cascade of temperature-dependent carrier dynamics. Below 5 K, the system, despite its anisotropic electronic structure, could be effectively described by an isotropic two-band model and exhibits a large, non-saturating magnetoresistance ($\propto B^{1.8}$). Upon warming, a crossover to a single-band regime occurs around 20 K, driven by the suppression of a hole pocket. Electron density recovers as antiferromagnetic gap openings gradually close from 25 to 70 K which is just below the N$\mathrm{\acute{e}}$el temperature. Within this temperature range, field-quenched spin fluctuations suppress magnetoresistance. Furthermore, we attribute the low-temperature resistivity upturn to the scaling behavior of magnetoresistance. These findings provide crucial insights into the interplay of dimensionality, magnetism, and electron correlations in quasi-one-dimensional magnetic semimetals.</description>

      <title>Proximity-induced superconductivity in magnetic topological insulator films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inducing superconducting correlations in magnetic topological insulators (MTIs) is emerging as a promising route toward the realization of topological superconductivity and Majorana modes. Here, we develop an analytical model for the proximity effect induced by an ordinary s-wave superconductor (SC) placed on top of a MTI thin film with finite thickness. Using a perturbative approach with respect to the electron tunneling between MTI and SC, we derive the leading-order correction to the anomalous Green's function and evaluate the position-dependent induced pairing as a function of all the system parameters. This framework allows us to resolve the spatial, spin, and momentum structure of the induced superconducting order parameter. In particular, we derive an explicit expression for the decay length of the pairing amplitude at the $k_x=k_y=0$ point, and show that increasing magnetization enhances the spin-polarized triplet components and the p-wave contributions of the anomalous Green's function. These findings highlight the interplay between topology, magnetism, and superconductivity in MTI films, providing analytical insight into the emergence of unconventional pairing symmetries relevant for the realization of Majorana modes in finite geometries.</description>

      <title>Highly Anisotropic Charge Dynamics and Spectral Weight Redistribution in the Trilayer Nickelate La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03806v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $ab$-plane and $c$-axis charge dynamics of La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ using optical spectroscopy. While a pronounced Drude profile, i.e. metallic response, is observed in the $ab$-plane optical conductivity $\sigma_{1}^{ab}(\omega)$, the $c$-axis optical spectra $\sigma_{1}^{c}(\omega)$ exhibit semiconducting behavior. The zero-frequency extrapolation of the optical conductivity $\sigma_{1}(\omega \rightarrow 0) \equiv 1/\rho_{\text{dc}}$ gives a resistivity anisotropy of $\rho_{c}/\rho_{ab} \simeq 366$ at 300~K for La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$, which is much larger than the values in iron-based superconductors but comparable to those in high-$T_{c}$ cuprates. The interband response is also highly anisotropic, showing salient orbital selectivity for light polarized in the $ab$ plane and along the $c$ axis. The interband-transition peaks in both $\sigma_{1}^{ab}(\omega)$ and $\sigma_{1}^{c}(\omega)$ are located at lower energies compared to density-functional-theory predictions, signifying considerable electronic correlations. By investigating the spectral weight transfer, we find that in the pristine phase, Coulomb correlations have a marked impact on the charge dynamics of \LNO, whereas in the density-wave state, a gap opens with the Ni-$d_{z^{2}}$ orbital being involved.</description>

      <title>Super-hard and superconducting boron clathrates in the prediction of U-B compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The binary metal borides provide a promising platform for searching unique materials with superconductivity and super-hardness under high pressure, owing to the distinctive bonding characters of boron. In this work, combined the first-principles calculations and crystal structure predictions, we predicted 4 exotic stoichiometries and 8 unique U-B compounds under high pressure. The predicted compounds have layered or caged structure units and 4 of them host high hardness under ambient pressure. By removal of the U atoms, we predicted three meta-stable boron clathrates at ambient pressure. Remarkably, the Vickers hardness of the predicted C2/m-B6 is estimated to be 49-53 GPa, and the C2/m-B12 is superconducting with the Tc value of 16.12 K. Our calculations enrich the phase diagram of binary metal borides and boron allotropes, providing insights for the future theoretical and experimental studies on unique materials.</description>

      <title>Visualization of vortex sheets and half quantum vortices in the chiral odd-parity superconductor UPt$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity is characterized by vanishing electrical resistance and magnetic flux expulsion. For conventional type II superconductors, the magnetic flux expulsion is incomplete in an applied magnetic field above a critical value and magnetic flux penetrates the bulk of the superconductor in discrete quantized magnetic flux tubes (vortices), each carrying a single quantum of flux (h/2e). Investigating the unconventional superconductor UPt$_{3}$ with a scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscope, we observed mobile half-quantum vortices together with one quantum vortices. Cooling the material under a higher magnetic field revealed the presence of lines of magnetic contrast resembling domain walls. These observations agree with theoretical predictions for chiral superconductivity with a two dimensional complex order-parameter with sheets of half-quantum vortices separating domains of opposite order-parameter chirality.</description>

      <title>Hybridized-Mode Parametric Amplifier in Kinetic-Inductance Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametric amplification is essential for quantum measurement, enabling the amplification of weak microwave signals with minimal added noise. While Josephson-junction-based amplifiers have become standard in superconducting quantum circuits, their magnetic sensitivity, limited saturation power, and sub-kelvin operating requirements motivate the development of alternative nonlinear platforms. Here we demonstrate a two-mode kinetic-inductance parametric amplifier based on a pair of capacitively coupled Kerr-nonlinear resonators fabricated from NbTiN and NbN thin films. The distributed Kerr nonlinearity of these materials enables nondegenerate four-wave-mixing amplification with gains approaching 40 dB, gain-bandwidth products up to 6.9 MHz, and 1-dB compression powers two to three orders of magnitude higher than those of state-of-the-art Josephson amplifiers. A coupled-mode theoretical model accurately captures the pump-induced modification of the hybridized modes and quantitatively reproduces the observed signal and idler responses. The NbN device exhibits a significantly larger Kerr coefficient and superior gain-bandwidth performance, highlighting the advantages of high-kinetic-inductance materials. Our results establish coupled kinetic-inductance resonators as a robust platform for broadband, high-power, and magnetically resilient quantum-limited amplification, offering a scalable route for advanced readout in superconducting qubits, spin ensembles, quantum dots, and other microwave-quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Predicting parameters of a model cuprate superconductor using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computational complexity of calculating phase diagrams for multi-parameter models significantly limits the ability to select parameters that correspond to experimental data. This work presents a machine learning method for solving the inverse problem - forecasting the parameters of a model Hamiltonian for a cuprate superconductor based on its phase diagram. A comparative study of three deep learning architectures was conducted: VGG, ResNet, and U-Net. The latter was adapted for regression tasks and demonstrated the best performance. Training the U-Net model was performed on an extensive dataset of phase diagrams calculated within the mean-field approximation, followed by validation on data obtained using a semi-classical heat bath algorithm for Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that the model accurately predicts all considered Hamiltonian parameters, and areas of low prediction accuracy correspond to regions of parametric insensitivity in the phase diagrams. This allows for the extraction of physically interpretable patterns and validation of the significance of parameters for the system. The results confirm the promising potential of applying machine learning to analyze complex physical models in condensed matter physics.</description>

Abstract: Several experimental observations of objects carrying fractional flux quanta in superconductors were recently reported. Here, we provide microscopic solutions for vortices carrying a variable fraction of magnetic flux quantum and domain walls in a three-band $s + is$ superconductor and investigate their properties. We obtain solutions in a fully self-consistent treatment of a microscopic three-band Bogoliubov-de-Gennes model. This demonstrates the characteristic patterns for the magnetic field distribution. The microscopic formalism allows for calculating tunneling conductance that may be used to distinguish fractional vortices from conventional single flux quanta vortices in Scanning Tunneling Microscopy.</description>

      <title>BCS states and D-wave condensates in the 2D Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider states of BCS form in the 2D Hubbard model which, starting from some arbitrary point in state space in the neighborhood of a Hartree-Fock ground state, are relaxed within that BCS ansatz to local minima of the energy. As in the Hartree-Fock approximation there are a vast number of local minima, nearly degenerate in energy. What is new, and unlike the conventional Hartree-Fock states, is that there is a region in parameter space where these local minima are clearly associated with d-wave condensates of the form $d_{x^2-y^2}$ in the underdoped region. There are, however, indications of $d_{xy}$ condensation in the overdoped region, at least in this approximation to the 2D Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Superexchanges and Charge Transfer in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_c$ above 40 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films represents a significant advance in the field of nickelate superconductor. Motivated by the experimental reports, here we study an 11-band $d-p$ Hubbard model with tight-binding parameters derived from \textit{ab initio} calculations, using large scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo and cellular dynamical mean-field theory. Our results reveal that the major superexchange couplings in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films can be substantially weaker than in the bulk material at 29.5 Gpa. Specifically, the out-of-plane antiferromagnetic correlation between Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals is reduced by about 27\% in film, while the in-plane magnetic correlations remain largely unaffected. We evaluate the corresponding antiferromagnetic coupling constants, $J_{\perp}$ and $J_{\parallel}$ using perturbation theory. With regard to charge transfer properties, we find that the biaxial compression in films reduces charge transfer gap. We also resolve the orbital distribution of doped holes and electrons among the in-plane (Ni$-d_{x^2-y^2}$ and O$-p_x/p_y$) and the out-of-plane (Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and O$-p_z$) orbitals, uncovering a pronounced particle-hole asymmetry. Theses findings lay a groundwork for the study of low-energy $t-J$ model of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films and provide key insights into the understanding of physical distinctions between the film and bulk bilayer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Spin-Depairing-Induced Exceptional Fermionic Superfluidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Hubbard model with spin depairing, which is a spin-resolved asymmetric hopping that nonreciprocally operates spins in the opposite direction. We find that spin depairing stabilizes a superfluid state unique to the NH system. This phase is characterized not only by a finite order parameter, but also by the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the momentum space - a feature that starkly contrasts with previously discussed NH fermionic superfluidity, where EPs are absent within the superfluid state and emerge only at the onset of the superfluid breakdown. We uncover the rich mechanism underlying this ``exceptional fermionic superfluidity'' by analyzing the interplay between EPs and the effective density of states of the complex energy dispersion. Furthermore, we reveal that the exceptional superfluid state breaks down induced by strong spin depairing on the cubic lattice, while it remains robust on the square lattice.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Optical Evidence of Coexisting Density Waves in Bilayer Nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy, we investigate the coexistence and competition of electronic orders in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Our results reveal two coexisting density waves that can be selectively manipulated with light. We directly identify a spin-density wave (SDW) with electronic nematicity emerging below $T_{\rm SDW}$ $\approx$ 140 K by measuring its spin dynamics, and discover a distinct, nonmagnetic charge order appearing below $T_{\rm DW}$ $\approx$ 115 K. The central finding is the demonstration of differential optical control: the charge order is fragile, completely suppressed by a pump fluence of approximately 40 $\mu$J/cm$^2$, while the SDW is remarkably robust, persisting to 200 $\mu$J/cm$^2$. This work establishes a clear hierarchy in the stability of competing electronic orders and provides a powerful method for disentangling their interplay in quantum materials.</description>
