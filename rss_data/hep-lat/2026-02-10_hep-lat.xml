      <title>Radiative decay of heavy-light mesons from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first systematic study of the radiative decays of charmed mesons using $2+1$-flavor clover fermion gauge ensembles generated by the CLQCD collaboration. One of the ensembles is at the physical pion mass, and one has a fine lattice spacing $a\sim 0.05 ~\text{fm}$. We determine the coupling constants to be $g_{D^{\ast+} D^+ \gamma} = -0.205(35)$ GeV$^{-1}$, $g_{D^{\ast0} D^0 \gamma} = 2.20(27)$ GeV$^{-1}$, and $g_{D_s^{\ast+} D_s^+ \gamma} = -0.125(21)$ GeV$^{-1}$, respectively. Compared with previous studies, our results demonstrate significant improvements in precision. In particular, we carefully estimate the systematic uncertainty arising from matrix element fits, momentum transfer extrapolations, and chiral and continuum limit extrapolations, which are included in the reported total uncertainties. These couplings yield the following predictions of decay widths: $\Gamma_{D^{\ast+} \rightarrow D^+ \gamma} = 0.255(87)$ keV, $\Gamma_{D^{\ast0} \rightarrow D^0 \gamma} = 29.4(7.2)$ keV, and $\Gamma_{D_s^{\ast+}\rightarrow D_s^+ \gamma} = 0.102(34)$ keV. This work establishes first-principles results of the charmed meson radiative transitions and provides inputs for understanding the structure and properties of heavy-light mesons.</description>

      <title>Forward-mode automatic differentiation for the tensor renormalization group and its relation to the impurity method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a forward-mode automatic differentiation (AD) framework for tensor renormalization group (TRG) methods. In this approach, evaluating the derivatives of the partition function up to order $k$ increases the matrix-multiplication cost by a factor of $(k+1)(k+2)/2$ compared to computing the free energy alone, while the memory footprint is only $k$ times that of the original calculation. In the limit where the derivatives of the SVD are neglected, we establish a theoretical correspondence between our forward-mode AD and conventional impurity methods. Numerically, we find that the proposed AD algorithm can calculate internal energy and specific heat significantly higher accuracy than the impurity method at comparable computational cost. We also provide a practical procedure to extract critical exponents from derivatives of the renormalized tensor in TRG calculations in both two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Search for the QCD Critical Point in High Energy Nuclear Collisions: A Status Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent results of net-proton multiplicity fluctuations from STAR experiment, aiming to locate the QCD critical point in high-energy nuclear collisions at RHIC. We show net-proton number cumulant and proton number factorial cumulant ratios up to fourth order using experimental data from RHIC BES-II Au+Au collisions in collider mode and fixed-target mode. The comparison is made between experimental data and non-critical model calculations from Lattice QCD, HRG, hydrodynamic simulations and transport model UrQMD. In addition, we discuss initial volume fluctuation effect, which plays significant role in fixed-target energies. Finally, an outlook on experimental research on the QCD critical point in future experiments will be presented.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless double beta decays of hyperons in covariant chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decays of spin-1/2 hyperons are investigated in a covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory framework, extended by a $\Delta L=2$ operator proportional to the Majorana neutrino mass, where $L$ denotes the lepton number. Within the light Majorana neutrino exchange mechanism, the decay amplitudes are found to emerge at the one-loop level, representing the long-range contribution. The extended-on-mass-shell scheme is employed to renormalize the one-loop amplitudes and restore consistent chiral power counting. Consequently, the differential decay rates for all accessible hyperon $0\nu\beta\beta$ channels are predicted and the corresponding branching ratios are more than 20 orders of magnitude smaller than the current experimental upper bounds. Interestingly, it is found that the leading contribution to hyperon $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay is actually from short-range counterterm operators, as required by the renormalization argument. Neutrinoless transition form factors are proposed to determine this leading contribution through future lattice QCD simulations.</description>

      <title>The axial-vector form factor of the nucleon in a finite box</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the axial-vector form factor of the nucleon in a finite box. Starting from the chiral Lagrangian with nucleon and Delta-isobar degrees of freedom, we address, at the one-loop level, the impact of two types of finite-volume effects. On the one hand, there are the implicit effects from the in-box values of the nucleon and Delta-isobar masses. On the other hand, there are the explicit effects caused by computing the in-box loop integrals with the values of the nucleon and Delta-isobar masses obtained in the infinite-volume limit. Selected numerical results are shown for three lattice ensembles. We show that the implicit effects dominate the in-box form factor. Our results are presented in terms of a set of basis functions that generalize the Passarino-Veltman reduction scheme to the finite-box case, such that only scalar loop integrals have to be performed. The techniques we developed are more generally relevant for lattice studies of hadronic quantities.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD Determination of the Collins-Soper Kernel in the Continuum and Physical Mass Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Collins-Soper (CS) kernel governs the rapidity evolution of transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) parton distributions, a cornerstone for QCD factorization and linking nucleon structure data across scales. Its nonperturbative behavior at large transverse separations ($b_{\perp}$) remains weakly constrained due to phenomenological model dependencies. We present a first-principles determination of the CS kernel at the continuum limit and physical pion mass from lattice QCD in the large-momentum effective theory framework. Using (2+1)-flavor configurations (lattice spacings $a \in[0.052, 0.105]$ fm, and pion mass $m_{\pi} \approx ( 136, 230, 300, 320)$ MeV), we simulating the nonlocal equal-time correlation function and extract the quasi-TMD wave functions. Taking into account systematic improvements including hypercubic smearing, nonperturbative renormalization, and a $b_{\perp}$-unexpanded matching kernel, we obtain the CS kernel at the continuum, chiral, and infinite-momentum limits. Our results are determined up to $b_{\perp} \sim 1$ fm, with controllable uncertainties, and agree with perturbative QCD at small $b_{\perp}$ and global TMD phenomenological extractions. We conduct a global analysis integrated with phenomenological fits and demonstrate the impact of our results on such fits. This work yields the most precise nonperturbative constraint on the CS kernel's long-distance behavior from Lattice QCD, which not only bridges Lattice QCD, perturbation theory, and nucleon structure experiments for TMD studies, but also boosts the utility of our constraint for future global TMD analyses.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Bound and Resonant Doubly-Bottom Tetraquark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first quantum-simulation study of bound and resonant doubly-bottom tetraquark states within a QCD-inspired chiral quark model. An effective four-quark Hamiltonian is mapped onto a 16-qubit register, encoding color, spin, and spatial degrees of freedom, and incorporating both meson-meson and diquark-antidiquark configurations with complete color bases. Using a variational quantum eigensolver, we identify bound and resonance states in the low-lying $S$-wave sector. Deeply bound states are found exclusively in the isoscalar $I(J^{P})=0(1^{+})$ channel, dominated by color-singlet meson-meson components with non-negligible hidden-color contributions. The resulting masses and binding energies are consistent with classical chiral quark model predictions, establishing quantum simulation as a viable framework for studying exotic multiquark states beyond the reach of conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Flowing Through Hilbert Space: Quantum-Enhanced Generative Models for Lattice Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling from high-dimensional and structured probability distributions is a fundamental challenge in computational physics, particularly in the context of lattice field theory (LFT), where generating field configurations efficiently is critical, yet computationally intensive. In this work, we apply a previously developed hybrid quantum-classical normalizing flow model to explore quantum-enhanced sampling in such regimes. Our approach embeds parameterized quantum circuits within a classical normalizing flow architecture, leveraging amplitude encoding and quantum entanglement to enhance expressivity in the generative process. The quantum circuit serves as a trainable transformation within the flow, while classical networks provide adaptive coupling and compensate for quantum hardware imperfections. This design enables efficient density estimation and sample generation, potentially reducing the resources required compared to purely classical methods. While LFT provides a representative and physically meaningful application for benchmarking, our focus is on improving the sampling efficiency of generative models through quantum components. This work contributes toward the development of quantum-enhanced generative modeling frameworks that address the sampling bottlenecks encountered in physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Goldstone bosons across thermal phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temperature has a significant effect on the properties of quantum field theories (QFTs) with a spontaneously broken symmetry, in particular on the massless Goldstone bosons that exist in the vacuum state. It has recently been shown using lattice calculations for a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ complex scalar field theory that the Goldstone mode persists even when the symmetry is restored above the critical temperature $T_{c}$, and has the properties of a screened excitation, a so-called thermoparticle. In this work, we continue the investigation of this theory by determining explicitly how the Goldstone mode evolves as the temperature is increased both below and above $T_{c}$. We find that the two phases of the theory are entirely characterised by the thermal dissipative effects experienced by the Goldstone mode, with the broken and symmetry-restored phases associated with weak and strong damping, respectively. These findings are consistent with the non-perturbative constraints imposed by spontaneous symmetry breaking, and provide a new way in which to characterise thermal phase transitions in QFTs.</description>

      <title>Resolving Quantum Criticality in the Honeycomb Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions driven by electronic correlations are central to understanding the physics of graphene and related two-dimensional materials. A paradigmatic example is the semimetal-to-Mott-insulator transition on the honeycomb lattice, governed by the Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality class, yet consensus on its critical exponents has remained elusive for over a decade due to severe finite-size effects and the absence of rigorous conformal bootstrap benchmarks. Here we try to resolve this long-standing controversy by performing projector determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations on lattices of unprecedented size, reaching 10,368 sites. By developing a novel projected submatrix update algorithm, we achieve a significant algorithmic speedup that enables us to access the thermodynamic limit with high precision. We observe that the fermion anomalous dimension and the correlation length exponent converge rapidly, while the boson anomalous dimension exhibits a systematic size dependence that we resolve via linear extrapolation. To validate our analysis, we perform parallel large-scale simulations of the spinless $t$-$V$ model on the honeycomb lattice, which belongs to the Gross-Neveu-Ising class. Our results for the $t$-$V$ model show agreement with conformal bootstrap predictions, thereby corroborating the robustness of our methodology. Our work provides state-of-the-art critical exponents for the honeycomb Hubbard model and establishes a systematic finite-size scaling workflow applicable to a broad class of strongly correlated quantum systems, paving the way for resolving other challenging fermionic quantum critical phenomena.</description>
