      <title>An Active Flux method for the Euler equations based on the exact acoustic evolution operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new Active Flux method for the multi-dimensional Euler equations is based on an additive operator splitting into acoustics and advection. The acoustic operator is solved in a locally linearized manner by using the exact evolution operator. The nonlinear advection operator is solved at third order accuracy using a new approximate evolution operator. To simplify the splitting, the new method uses primitive variables for the point values and for the reconstruction. In order to handle discontinuous solutions, a blended bound preserving limiting is used, that combines a priori and a posteriori approaches. The resulting method is able to resolve multi-dimensional Riemann problems as well as low Mach number flow, and has a large domain of stability.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Tubal Tensor Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developed in a series of seminal papers in the early 2010s, the tubal tensor framework provides a clean and effective algebraic setting for tensor computations, supporting matrix-mimetic features such as a tensor Singular Value Decomposition and Eckart-Young-like optimality results. It has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing inherently multilinear data arising in hyperspectral imaging, medical imaging, neural dynamics, scientific simulations, and more. At the heart of tubal tensor algebra lies a special tensor-tensor product: originally the t-product, later generalized into a full family of products via the $\star_M$-product. Though initially defined through the multiplication of a block-circulant unfolding of one tensor by a matricization of another, it was soon observed that the t-product can be interpreted as standard matrix multiplication where the scalars are tubes-i.e., real vectors twisted ``inward.'' Yet, a fundamental question remains: why is this the ``right'' way to define a tensor-tensor product in the tubal setting? In this paper, we show that the t-product and its $\star_M$ generalization arise naturally when viewing third-order tensors as matrices of tubes, together with a small set of desired algebraic properties. Furthermore, we prove that the $\star_M$-product is, in fact, the only way to define a tubal product satisfying these properties. Thus, while partly expository in nature - aimed at presenting the foundations of tubal tensor algebra in a cohesive and accessible way - this paper also addresses theoretical gaps in the tubal tensor framework, proves new results, and provides justification for the tubal tensor framework central constructions, thereby shedding new light on it.</description>

      <title>Minimizing the Arithmetic and Communication Complexity of Jacobi's Method for Eigenvalues and Singular Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze several versions of Jacobi's method for the symmetric eigenvalue problem. Our goal throughout is to reduce the asymptotic cost of the algorithm as much as possible, as measured by the number of arithmetic operations performed and associated (sequential or parallel) communication, i.e., the amount of data moved between slow and fast memory or between processors in a network. In producing rigorous complexity bounds, we allow our algorithms to be built on both classic $O(n^3)$ matrix multiplication and fast, Strassen-like $O(n^{\omega_0})$ alternatives. In the classical setting, we show that a blocked implementation of Jacobi's method attains the communication lower bound for $O(n^3)$ matrix multiplication (and is therefore expected to be communication optimal among $O(n^3)$ methods). In the fast setting, we demonstrate that a recursive version of blocked Jacobi can go even further, reaching essentially optimal complexity in both measures. We also discuss Jacobi-based SVD algorithms and a parallel version of block Jacobi, showing that analogous complexity bounds apply.</description>

      <title>Two self-starting single-solve third-order explicit integration algorithms for second-order nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The single-step explicit time integration methods have long been valuable for solving large-scale nonlinear structural dynamic problems, classified into single-solve and multi-sub-step approaches. However, no existing explicit single-solve methods achieve third-order accuracy. The paper addresses this gap by proposing two new third-order explicit algorithms developed within the framework of self-starting single-solve time integration algorithms, which incorporates 11 algorithmic parameters. The study reveals that fully explicit methods with single-solve cannot reach third-order accuracy for general dynamic problems. Consequently, two novel algorithms are proposed: Algorithm 1 is a fully explicit scheme that achieves third-order accuracy in displacement and velocity for undamped problems; Algorithm 2, which employs implicit treatment of velocity and achieves third-order accuracy for general dynamic problems. Across a suite of both linear and nonlinear benchmarks, the new algorithms consistently outperform existing single-solve explicit methods in accuracy. Their built-in numerical dissipation effectively filters out spurious high-frequency components, as demonstrated by two wave propagation problems. Finally, when applied to the realistic engineering problem, both of them deliver superior numerical precision at minimal computational cost.</description>

      <title>A randomized progressive iterative regularization method for data fitting problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate data fitting problems with random noises. A randomized progressive iterative regularization method is proposed. It works well for large-scale matrix computations and converges in expectation to the least-squares solution. Furthermore, we present an optimal estimation for the regularization parameter, which inspires the construction of self-consistent algorithms without prior information. The numerical results confirm the theoretical analysis and show the performance in curve and surface fittings.</description>

      <title>MatExPre: A matrix exponential preconditioner for the high-frequency Helmholtz equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present a new preconditioner, MatExPre, for the high-frequency Helmholtz equation by leveraging the properties of matrix exponentials. Our approach begins by reformulating the Helmholtz equation into a Schr\"{o}dinger-like equation and constructing a time-domain solver based on a fixed-point iteration. We then establish a rigorous connection between the time-domain solver and matrix exponential integrators, which enables us to derive algebraic preconditioners that rely solely on sparse matrix-vector products. Spectral analysis and a detailed numerical implementation strategy, including performance improvements achieved through complex shifting, are discussed. Finally, numerical experiments on 2D and large-scale 3D homogeneous and inhomogeneous models, including benchmark seismic examples, substantiate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is devoted to the convergence of a time-discrete numerical scheme of a semi-discretization model arising from biology, consisting of a chemotaxis equation coupled with a Galerkin approximation of Navier-Stokes system driven by transport noise in a three-dimensional bounded and convex domain. We propose a semi-implicit Euler numerical scheme approximating the infinite dimensional model, for which we study the well-posedness and derive some uniform estimates for the discrete variables</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Virtual Element Methods for the Sobolev Equation with Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential applications of virtual elements for solving the Sobolev equation with a convective term. A conforming virtual element method is employed for spatial discretization, while an implicit Euler scheme is used to approximate the time derivative. To establish the optimal rate of convergence, a novel intermediate projection operator is introduced. We discuss and analyze both the semi-discrete and fully discrete schemes, deriving optimal error estimates for both the energy norm and L2-norm. Several numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical findings and assess the computational efficiency of the proposed numerical methods.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Numerical Method for an Approximate Solution of the Beam Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a horizontal type method of lines numerical scheme for the unsteady Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. The problem is initially reformulated as a first order system of initial value problems and a suitable one-step difference scheme is used for the highest order temporal derivative which leads to a system of steady beam equations. Then resulted family of steady problems is solved iteratively by the finite element method with Hermite cubic basis functions. This iterative procedure leads to approximations for both the solution of the unsteady problem and its derivatives. All these approximations are compared with the exact ones to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. Moreover, the optimization of the mesh parameters is discussed for both steady and unsteady problems by logarithmic scale plot.</description>

      <title>Data-driven balanced truncation for second-order systems via the approximate Gramians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the data-driven balanced truncation (BT) method for second-order systems based on the measurements in the frequency domain. The basic idea is to approximate Gramians used the numerical quadrature rules, and establish the relationship between the main quantities in the procedure of BT with the sample data, which paves the way for the execution of BT in a nonintrusive manner. We construct the structure-preserving reduced models approximately based on the samples of second-order systems with proportional damping, and provide the detailed execution of the data-driven counterpart of BT in real-value arithmetic. The low-rank approximation to the solution of Sylvester equations is also introduced to speed up the process of the proposed approach when a large amount of samples involved in the modeling. The performance of our approach is illustrated in detail via two numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Invariant-region-preserving WENO schemes for one-dimensional multispecies kinematic flow models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multispecies kinematic flow models are defined by systems of N strongly coupled, nonlinear first-order conservation laws, where the solution is a vector of N partial volume fractions or densities. These models arise in various applications including multiclass vehicular traffic and sedimentation of polydisperse suspensions. The solution vector should take values in a set of physically relevant values (i.e., the components are nonnegative and sum up at most to a given maximum value). It is demonstrated that this set, the so-called invariant region, is preserved by numerical solutions produced by a new family of high-order finite volume numerical schemes adapted to this class of models. To achieve this property, and motivated by [X. Zhang, C.-W. Shu, On maximum-principle-satisfying high order schemes for scalar conservation laws, J. Comput. Phys. 229 (2010) 3091--3120], a pair of linear scaling limiters is applied to a high-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) polynomial reconstruction to obtain invariant-region-preserving (IRP) high-order polynomial reconstructions. These reconstructions are combined with a local Lax-Friedrichs (LLF) or Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL) numerical flux to obtain a high-order numerical scheme for the system of conservation laws. It is proved that this scheme satisfies an IRP property under a suitable Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition. The theoretical analysis is corroborated with numerical simulations for models of multiclass traffic flow and polydisperse sedimentation.</description>

      <title>Coupling models of resistive valves to muscle mechanics in cardiac fluid-structure interaction simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To accurately simulate all phases of the cardiac cycle, computational models of hemodynamics in heart chambers need to include a sufficiently faithful model of cardiac valves. This can be achieved efficiently through resistive methods, and the resistive immersed implicit surface (RIIS) model in particular [Fedele et al., BMMB, 2017]. However, the conventional RIIS model is not suited to fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations, since it neglects the reaction forces by which valves are attached to the cardiac walls, leading to models that are not consistent with Newton's laws. In this paper, we propose an improvement to RIIS to overcome this limitation, by adding distributed forces acting on the structure to model the attachment of valves to the cardiac walls. The modification has a minimal computational overhead thanks to an explicit numerical discretization scheme. Numerical experiments in both idealized and realistic settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modification in ensuring the physical consistency of the model, thus allowing to apply RIIS and other resistive valve models in the context of FSI simulations.</description>

      <title>On recovering the Radon-Nikodym derivative under the big data assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper is focused on the problem of recovering the Radon-Nikodym derivative under the big data assumption. To address the above problem, we design an algorithm that is a combination of the Nystr\"om subsampling and the standard Tikhonov regularization. The convergence rate of the corresponding algorithm is established both in the case when the Radon-Nikodym derivative belongs to RKHS and in the case when it does not. We prove that the proposed approach not only ensures the order of accuracy as algorithms based on the whole sample size, but also allows to achieve subquadratic computational costs in the number of observations.</description>

      <title>Identification of Differential Equations by Dynamics-Guided Weighted Weak Form with Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the identification of differential equations from data, significant progresses have been made with the weak/integral formulation. In this paper, we explore the direction of finding more efficient and robust test functions adaptively given the observed data. While this is a difficult task, we propose weighting a collection of localized test functions for better identification of differential equations from a single trajectory of noisy observations on the differential equation. We find that using high dynamic regions is effective in finding the equation as well as the coefficients, and propose a dynamics indicator per differential term and weight the weak form accordingly. For stable identification against noise, we further introduce a voting strategy to identify the active features from an ensemble of recovered results by selecting the features that frequently occur in different weighting of test functions. Systematic numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the robustness of our method.</description>

      <title>Block Alpha-Circulant Preconditioners for All-at-Once Diffusion-Based Covariance Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03947v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covariance matrices are central to data assimilation and inverse methods derived from statistical estimation theory. Previous work has considered the application of an all-at-once diffusion-based representation of a covariance matrix operator in order to exploit inherent parallellism in the underlying problem. In this paper, we provide practical methods to apply block $\alpha$-circulant preconditioners to the all-at-once system for the case where the main diffusion operation matrix cannot be readily diagonalized using a discrete Fourier transform. Our new framework applies the block $\alpha$-circulant preconditioner approximately by solving an inner block diagonal problem via a choice of inner iterative approaches. Our first method applies Chebyshev semi-iteration to a symmetric positive definite matrix, shifted by a complex scaling of the identity. We extend theoretical results for Chebyshev semi-iteration in the symmetric positive definite setting, to obtain computable bounds on the asymptotic convergence factor for each of the complex sub-problems. The second approach transforms the complex sub-problem into a (generalized) saddle point system with real coefficients. Numerical experiments reveal that in the case of unlimited computational resources, both methods can match the iteration counts of the `best-case' block $\alpha$-circulant preconditioner. We also provide a practical adaptation to the nested Chebyshev approach, which improves performance in the case of a limited computational budget. Using an appropriate choice of $\alpha$ our new approaches are robust and efficient in terms of outer iterations and matrix--vector products.</description>

Abstract: For a moving hypersurface in the flow of a nonautonomous ordinary differential equation in $n$-dimensional Euclidean spaces, the fluxing index of a passively-advected Lagrangian particle
  is the total number of times it crosses the moving hypersurface within a time interval. The problem of Lagrangian particle classification is to decompose the phase space into flux sets, equivalence classes of Lagrangian particles at the initial time. In the context of scalar conservation laws, the problem of Lagrangian flux calculation (LFC) is to find flux identities that relate the Eulerian flux of a scalar through the moving hypersurface, a spatiotemporal integral over the moving surface in a given time interval, to spatial integrals over donating regions
  at the initial time of the interval. In this work, we implicitly characterize flux sets via topological degrees, explicitly construct donating regions, prove the equivalence of flux sets and donating regions, and establish two flux identities; these analytical results constitute our solutions to the aforementioned problems. Based on a flux identity suitable for numerical calculation, we further proposed a new LFC algorithm, proved its convergence, and demonstrated its efficiency, good conditioning, and high-order accuracy by results of various numerical tests.</description>

      <title>A robust matrix-free approach for large-scale non-isothermal high-contrast viscosity Stokes flow on blended domains with applications to geophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a compressible Stokes problem in the quasi-stationary case coupled with a time dependent advection-diffusion equation with special emphasis on high viscosity contrast geophysical mantle convection applications. In space, we use a P2-P1 Taylor--Hood element which is generated by a blending approach to account for the non-planar domain boundary without compromising the stencil data structure of uniformly refined elements. In time, we apply an operator splitting approach for the temperature equation combining the BDF2 method for diffusion and a particle method for advection, resulting in an overall second order scheme. Within each time step, a stationary Stokes problem with a high viscosity contrast has to be solved for which we propose a matrix-free, robust and scalable iterative solver based on Uzawa type block preconditioners, polynomial Chebyshev smoothers and a BFBT type Schur complement approximation. Our implementation is using a hybrid hierarchical grid approach allowing for massively parallel, high resolution Earth convection simulations.</description>

      <title>A MUSCL-Hancock scheme for non-local conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a MUSCL-Hancock-type second-order scheme for the discretization of a general class of non-local conservation laws and present its convergence analysis. The main difficulty in designing a MUSCL-Hancock-type scheme for non-local equations lies in the discretization of the convolution term, which we carefully formulate to ensure second-order accuracy and facilitate rigorous convergence analysis. We derive several essential estimates including $\mathrm{L}^\infty,$ bounded variation ($\mathrm{BV}$) and $\mathrm{L}^1$- Lipschitz continuity in time, which together with the Kolmogorov's compactness theorem yield the convergence of the approximate solutions to a weak solution. Further, by incorporating a mesh-dependent modification in the slope limiter, we establish convergence to the entropy solution. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the theoretical results and to demonstrate the improved accuracy of the proposed scheme over its first-order counterpart.</description>

      <title>A fast and memoryless numerical method for solving fractional differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical solution of implicit and stiff differential equations by implicit numerical integrators has been largely investigated and there exist many excellent efficient codes available in the scientific community, as Radau5 (based on a Runge-Kutta collocation method at Radau points) and Dassl, based on backward differentiation formulas, among the others. When solving fractional ordinary differential equations (ODEs), the derivative operator is replaced by a non-local one and the fractional ODE is reformulated as a Volterra integral equation, to which these codes cannot be directly applied.
  This article is a follow-up of the article by the authors (Guglielmi and Hairer, SISC, 2025) for differential equations with distributed delays. The main idea is to approximate the fractional kernel $t^{\alpha -1}/ \Gamma (\alpha )$ ($\alpha &gt;0$) by a sum of exponential functions or by a sum of exponential functions multiplied by a monomial, and then to transform the fractional integral (of convolution type) into a set of ordinary differential equations. The augmented system is typically stiff and thus requires the use of an implicit method. It can have a very large dimension and requires a special treatment of the arising linear systems.
  The present work presents an algorithm for the construction of an approximation of the fractional kernel by a sum of exponential functions, and it shows how the arising linear systems in a stiff time integrator can be solved efficiently. It is explained how the code Radau5 can be used for solving fractional differential equations. Numerical experiments illustrate the accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed method. Driver examples are publicly available from the homepages of the authors.</description>

      <title>Rounding error analysis of randomized CholeskyQR2 for sparse matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on rounding error analysis of randomized CholeskyQR2 (RCholeskyQR2) for sparse matrices. We form RCholeskyQR2 with CholeskyQR2 and matrix sketching in order to accelerate CholeskyQR2 and improve its applicability by compressing the input matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$. In many real-world applications, the input matrix $X$ is always sparse. In this work, we follow the model of sparse matrices proposed in \cite{CSparse} and provide an improved rounding error analysis of RCholeskyQR2 for sparse matrices. We define a new matrix norm $\norm{\cdot}_{g}$ and use its properties in rounding error analysis. $\norm{\cdot}_{F}$ and its connections with rounding error analysis is also utilized in CholeskyQR for the first time. Our analysis is an improvement compared to that in \cite{CSparse, error}. We provide the corresponding sufficient conditions for different types of sparse matrices based on the existence of dense columns, together with error bounds of both orthogonality and residual. Numerical experiments demonstrate our findings and show the effectiveness of matrix sketching on CholeskyQR2.</description>

      <title>Guided modes of helical waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies guided transverse scalar modes propagating through helically coiled waveguides. Modeling the modes as solutions of the Helmholtz equation within the three-dimensional (3D) waveguide geometry, a propagation ansatz transforms the mode-finding problem into a 3D quadratic eigenproblem. Through an untwisting map, the problem is shown to be equivalent to a 3D quadratic eigenproblem on a straightened configuration. Next, exploiting the constant torsion and curvature of the Frenet frame of a circular helix, the 3D eigenproblem is further reduced to a two-dimensional (2D) eigenproblem on the waveguide cross section. All three eigenproblems are numerically treated. As expected, significant computational savings are realized in the 2D model. A few nontrivial numerical techniques are needed to make the computation of modes within the 3D geometry feasible. They are presented along with a procedure to effectively filter out unwanted non-propagating eigenfunctions. Computational results show that the geometric effect of coiling is to shift the localization of guided modes away from the coiling center. The variations in modes as coiling pitch is changed are reported considering the example of a coiled optical fiber.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a model to characterize how a diffusing population adapts under a time periodic selection, while its environment undergoes shifts and size changes, leading to significant differences with classical results on fixed domains. After studying the underlying periodic parabolic principal eigenelements, we address the extinction vs. persistence issue, taking into account the interplay between the moving habitat and periodic selection. Subsequently, we employ a space-time finite element approach, establish the well-posedness of the approximation scheme, and conduct numerical simulations to explore these dynamics.</description>

      <title>Inexact Projected Preconditioned Gradient Methods with Variable Metrics: General Convergence Theory via Lyapunov Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Projected gradient methods are widely used for constrained optimization. A key application is for partial differential equations (PDEs), where the objective functional represents physical energy and the linear constraints enforce conservation laws. However, computing the projections onto the constraint set generally requires solving large-scale ill-conditioned linear systems. A common strategy is to relax projection accuracy and apply preconditioners, which leads to the inexact preconditioned projected gradient descent (IPPGD) methods studied here. However, the theoretical analysis and the dynamic behavior of the IPPGD methods, along with an effective construction of the inexact projection operator itself, all remain largely unexplored. We propose a strategy for constructing the inexact projection operator and develop a gradient-type flow to model the IPPGD methods. Discretization of this flow not only recovers the original IPPGD method but also yields a potentially faster novel method. Furthermore, we apply Lyapunov analysis, designing a delicate Lyapunov function, to prove the exponential convergence at the continuous level and linear convergence at the discrete level. We then apply the proposed method to solve nonlinear PDEs and present numerical results.</description>

      <title>Impact of friction force and retrieval speed on in silico mechanical thrombectomies: a sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Mechanical Thrombectomy (MT) is a widely accepted first-line treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) and it has been studied using in vitro and in silico models. Thrombectomy outcomes have been performed for patient-specific cases using in silico models. However, until now, in vivo friction coefficients for stent-vessel, stent-clot, and clot-vessel interactions are unknown, but in vitro experiments have been attempted with significant standard deviations. These interactions and friction coefficients have been considered an important aspect of thrombectomy success. Objectives: In the current study, we explored the influence of variation in friction forces for stent-vessel, stent-clot, and clot-vessel interactions using virtual mechanical thrombectomy (VMT). We have performed three simulations for each interaction and varied friction coefficients around the standard deviation observed in the past in vitro studies. Results: (i) clot-vessel friction: higher friction leads to clot fragmentation and VMT failure. (ii) stent-clot friction: it is susceptible to VMT outcomes, with lower values showing the slippage of the clot while higher values lead to fragmentation. (iii) stent-vessel friction: higher friction shows compression of the stent in curved vessels and dislodgment of clot from stent retriever (SR) due to its compression, which leads to VMT failure. (iv) retrieval speed (RS): higher RS (&gt;30 mm/s) leads to significant stent compression and unrealistic behavior of the SR. Conclusions: Analysis of results proposes the necessity for calculating accurate friction factor values and their implementation into in silico models, due to their sensitivity towards thrombectomy outcomes. Such in silico models mimic in vivo thrombectomy more closely and can be used in mechanical thrombectomy planning, management, and decision-making.</description>

      <title>Solving Inverse Problems via Diffusion-Based Priors: An Approximation-Free Ensemble Sampling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03979v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have proven to be effective in modeling high-dimensional distributions, leading to their widespread adoption for representing complex priors in Bayesian inverse problems (BIPs). However, current DM-based posterior sampling methods proposed for solving common BIPs rely on heuristic approximations to the generative process. To exploit the generative capability of DMs and avoid the usage of such approximations, we propose an ensemble-based algorithm that performs posterior sampling without the use of heuristic approximations. Our algorithm is motivated by existing works that combine DM-based methods with the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method. By examining how the prior evolves through the diffusion process encoded by the pre-trained score function, we derive a modified partial differential equation (PDE) governing the evolution of the corresponding posterior distribution. This PDE includes a modified diffusion term and a reweighting term, which can be simulated via stochastic weighted particle methods. Theoretically, we prove that the error between the true posterior distribution can be bounded in terms of the training error of the pre-trained score function and the number of particles in the ensemble. Empirically, we validate our algorithm on several inverse problems in imaging to show that our method gives more accurate reconstructions compared to existing DM-based methods.</description>

      <title>On the robustness of Dirichlet-Neumann coupling schemes for fluid-structure-interaction problems with nearly-closed fluid domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partitioned methods for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) involve solving the structural and flow problems sequentially. These methods allow for separate settings for the fluid and solid subsystems and thus modularity, enabling reuse of advanced commercial and open-source software. Most partitioned FSI schemes apply a Dirichlet-Neumann (DN) split of the interface conditions. The DN scheme is adequate in a wide range of applications, but it is sensitive to the added-mass effect, and it is susceptible to the incompressibility dilemma, i.e. it completely fails for FSI problems with an incompressible fluid furnished with Dirichlet boundary conditions on the part of its boundary complementary to the interface. In this paper, we show that if the fluid is incompressible and the fluid domain is nearly-closed, i.e. it carries Dirichlet conditions except for a permeable part of the boundary carrying a Robin condition, then the DN partitioned approach is sensitive to the flow resistance at the permeable part, and convergence of the partitioned approach deteriorates as the flow resistance increases. The DN scheme then becomes unstable in the limit as the flow resistance passes to infinity. Based on a simple model problem, we show that in the nearly-closed case, the convergence rate of the DN partitioned method depends on a so-called added-damping effect. The analysis gives insights that can aid to improve robustness and efficiency of partitioned method for FSI problems with contact, e.g. valve applications. In addition, the results elucidate the incompressibility dilemma as a limit of the added-damping effect passing to infinity, and the corresponding challenges related to FSI problems with nearly closed fluid-domain configurations. Via numerical experiments, we consider the generalization of the results of the simple model problem to more complex nearly-closed FSI problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a simple yet efficient Lagrangian method for computing equilibrium prices in a mean-field game price-formation model. We prove that equilibrium prices are optimal in terms of a suitable criterion and derive a primal-dual gradient-based algorithm for computing them. One of the highlights of our computational framework is the efficient, simple, and flexible implementation of the algorithm using modern automatic differentiation techniques. Our implementation is modular and admits a seamless extension to high-dimensional settings with more complex dynamics, costs, and equilibrium conditions. Additionally, automatic differentiation enables a versatile algorithm that requires only coding the cost functions of agents. It automatically handles the gradients of the costs, thereby eliminating the need to manually form the adjoint equations.</description>

      <title>Physics-Constrained Flow Matching: Sampling Generative Models with Hard Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models have recently been applied to physical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), offering scalable simulation and uncertainty-aware inference. However, enforcing physical constraints, such as conservation laws (linear and nonlinear) and physical consistencies, remains challenging. Existing methods often rely on soft penalties or architectural biases that fail to guarantee hard constraints. In this work, we propose Physics-Constrained Flow Matching (PCFM), a zero-shot inference framework that enforces arbitrary nonlinear constraints in pretrained flow-based generative models. PCFM continuously guides the sampling process through physics-based corrections applied to intermediate solution states, while remaining aligned with the learned flow and satisfying physical constraints. Empirically, PCFM outperforms both unconstrained and constrained baselines on a range of PDEs, including those with shocks, discontinuities, and sharp features, while ensuring exact constraint satisfaction at the final solution. Our method provides a general framework for enforcing hard constraints in both scientific and general-purpose generative models, especially in applications where constraint satisfaction is essential.</description>

      <title>A filtered multilevel Monte Carlo method for estimating the expectation of cell-centered discretized random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) methods for estimating the expectation of discretized random fields. Specifically, we consider a setting in which the input and output vectors of numerical simulators have inconsistent dimensions across the multilevel hierarchy. This motivates the introduction of grid transfer operators borrowed from multigrid methods. By adapting mathematical tools from multigrid methods, we perform a theoretical spectral analysis of the MLMC estimator of the expectation of discretized random fields, in the specific case of linear, symmetric and circulant simulators. We then propose filtered MLMC (F-MLMC) estimators based on a filtering mechanism similar to the smoothing process of multigrid methods, and we show that the filtering operators improve the estimation of both the small- and large-scale components of the variance, resulting in a reduction of the total variance of the estimator. Next, the conclusions of the spectral analysis are experimentally verified with a one-dimensional illustration. Finally, the proposed F-MLMC estimator is applied to the problem of estimating the discretized variance field of a diffusion-based covariance operator, which amounts to estimating the expectation of a discretized random field. The numerical experiments support the conclusions of the theoretical analysis even with non-linear simulators, and demonstrate the improvements brought by the F-MLMC estimator compared to both a crude MC and an unfiltered MLMC estimator.</description>

      <title>Wavelet compressed, modified Hilbert transform in the space-time discretization of the heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a finite time interval $(0,T)$, we consider the multiresolution Galerkin discretization of a modified Hilbert transform $\mathcal H_T$ which arises in the space-time Galerkin discretization of the linear diffusion equation. To this end, we design spline-wavelet systems in $(0,T)$ consisting of piecewise polynomials of degree $\geq 1$ with sufficiently many vanishing moments which constitute Riesz bases in the Sobolev spaces $H^{s}_{0,}(0,T)$ and $H^{s}_{,0}(0,T)$. These bases provide stable multilevel splittings of the temporal discretization spaces into "increment" or "detail" spaces. Furthermore, they allow to optimally compress the nonlocal integrodifferential operators which appear in stable space-time variational formulations of initial-boundary value problems, such as the heat equation and the acoustic wave equation. We then obtain sparse space-time tensor-product spaces via algebraic tensor-products of the temporal multilevel discretizations with standard, hierarchic finite element spaces in the spatial domain (with standard Lagrangian FE bases). Hence, the construction of multiresolutions in the spatial domain is not necessary. An efficient multilevel preconditioner is proposed that solves the linear system of equations resulting from the sparse space-time Galerkin discretization with essentially linear complexity (in work and memory). A substantial reduction in the number of the degrees of freedom and CPU time (compared to time-marching discretizations) is demonstrated in numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Non-Conforming Structure Preserving Finite Element Method for Doubly Diffusive Flows on Bounded Lipschitz Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a stationary model of doubly diffusive flows with temperature-dependent viscosity on bounded Lipschitz domains in two and three dimensions. A new well-posedness and regularity analysis of weak solutions under minimal assumptions on domain geometry and data regularity are established. A fully non-conforming finite element method based on Crouzeix-Raviart elements, which ensures locally exactly divergence-free velocity fields is explored. Unlike previously proposed schemes, this discretisation enables to establish uniqueness of the discrete solutions. We prove the well-posedness of the discrete problem and derive pressure-robust a priori error estimates. An accuracy test is conducted to verify the theoretical error decay rates in flow, Stokes and Darcy regimes.</description>

      <title>Mixed precision iterative refinement for linear inverse problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the iterative refinement method applied to the solution of linear discrete inverse problems by considering its application to the Tikhonov problem in mixed precision. Previous works on mixed precision iterative refinement methods for the solution of symmetric positive definite linear systems and least-squares problems have shown regularization to be a key requirement when computing low precision factorizations. For problems that are naturally severely ill-posed, we formulate the iterates of iterative refinement in mixed precision as a filtered solution using the preconditioned Landweber method with a Tikhonov-type preconditioner. Through numerical examples simulating various mixed precision choices, we showcase the filtering properties of the method and the achievement of comparable or superior accuracy compared to results computed in double precision as well as another approximate method.</description>

      <title>On the computation of accurate initial conditions for linear higher-index differential-algebraic equations and its application in initial value solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contrast to regular ordinary differential equations, the problem of accurately setting initial conditions just emerges in the context of differential-algebraic equations where the dynamic degree of freedom of the system is smaller than the absolute dimension of the described process, and the actual lower-dimensional configuration space of the system is deeply implicit. For linear higher-index differential-algebraic equations, we develop an appropriate numerical method based on properties of canonical subspaces and on the so-called geometric reduction. Taking into account the fact that higher-index differential-algebraic equations lead to ill-posed problems in naturally given norms, we modify this approach to serve as transfer conditions from one time-window to the next in a time stepping procedure and combine it with window-wise overdetermined least-squares collocation to construct the first fully numerical solvers for higher-index initial-value problems.</description>

      <title>Compact finite-difference scheme for some Sobolev type equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to construct a stable, high-order compact finite difference method for solving Sobolev-type equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions in one-space dimension. Approximation of higher-order mixed derivatives in some specific Sobolev-type equations requires a bigger stencil information. One can approximate such derivatives on compact stencils, which are higher-order accurate and take less stencil information but are implicit and sparse. Spatial derivatives in this work are approximated using the sixth-order compact finite difference method (Compact6), while temporal derivatives are handled with the explicit forward Euler difference scheme. We examine the accuracy and convergence behavior of the proposed scheme. Using the von Neumann stability analysis, we establish $L_2-$stability theory for the linear case. We derive conditions under which fully discrete schemes are stable. Also, the amplification factor $\mathcal{C}(\theta)$ is analyzed to ensure the decay property over time. Real parts of $\mathcal{C}(\theta)$ lying on the negative real axis confirm the exponential decay of the solution. A series of numerical experiments were performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. These tests include both one dimensional and two-dimensional cases of cases of advection-free and advection-diffusion flows. They also cover applications to the equal width equation, such as the propagation of a single solitary wave, interactions between two and three solitary waves, undular bore formation, and the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony-Burgers equation.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the multi-dimensional semi-discrete Active Flux method using the Fourier transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The degrees of freedom of Active Flux are cell averages and point values along the cell boundaries. These latter are shared between neighbouring cells, which gives rise to a globally continuous reconstruction. The semi-discrete Active Flux method uses its degrees of freedom to obtain Finite Difference approxi\-mations to the spatial derivatives which are used in the point value update. The averages are updated using a quadrature of the flux and making use of the point values as quadrature points. The integration in time employs standard Runge-Kutta methods. We show that this generalization of the Active Flux method in two and three spatial dimensions is stationarity preserving for linear acoustics on Cartesian grids, and present an analysis of numerical diffusion and stability.</description>

      <title>Deterministic and randomized LU-Householder CholeskyQR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop LU-Householder CholeskyQR (LHC) for QR factorization of tall-skinny matrices. Similar to LU-CholeskyQR \cite{LUChol}, LHC does not require a sufficient condition of $\kappa_{2}(X)$ for the input tall-skinny matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$. This characteristic ensures the algorithm's reliability in the real-world applications, which is different from other CholeskyQR-type algorithms. To address the issue of numerical breakdown in Cholesky factorization of LU-CholeskyQR when the $L$-factor is ill-conditioned, LHC employs HouseholderQR to generate the upper-triangular factor alternatively. In order to accelerate LHC for tall-skinny matrices, we incorporate the latest sketching techniques to develop randomized versions of LHC, SLHC with single-sketching and SSLHC with multi-sketching. To ensure numerical stability, LHC2, SLHC3, and SSLHC3 are constructed with CholeskyQR(2) after the preconditioning steps. We provide rounding error analysis of these new algorithms. Numerical experiments demonstrate the better applicability of our new algorithms compared to LU-CholeskyQR2 while maintaining numerical stability. With the sketching technique, our randomized algorithms, SLHC3 and SSLHC3, show significant acceleration over LHC2 in our tests. Among them, SLHC3 with the Gaussian sketch can deal with more ill-conditioned $X$ with different $m$ and $n$ for $X$. SSLHC3 with multi-sketching is applicable when $\frac{m}{n}$ is large enough and is more efficient than SLHC3. Both of them are robust enough after numerous experiments.</description>

      <title>Model Reduction for Transport-Dominated Problems via Cross-Correlation Based Snapshot Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional linear approximation methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and the reduced basis method, are ill-suited for transport-dominated problems due to the slow decay of the Kolmogorov $n$-width, leading to inefficient and inaccurate reduced-order models. In this work, we propose a model reduction approach for transport-dominated problems by employing cross-correlation based snapshot registration to accelerate the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay, thereby enabling the construction of efficient and accurate reduced-order models using linear approximation methods. We propose a complete framework comprising offline-online stages for the development of reduced order models using the cross-correlation based snapshots registration. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using two test cases: 1D travelling waves and the higher-order methods benchmark test case, 2D isentropic convective vortex.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to examining the stability of Runge-Kutta methods for solving nonlinear Volterra delay-integro-differential-algebraic equations (DIDAEs) with constant delay. Hybrid numerical schemes combining Runge-Kutta methods and compound quadrature rules are analyzed for nonlinear DIDAEs. Criteria for ensuring the global and asymptotic stability of the proposed schemes are established. Several numerical examples are provided to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Level-set topology optimisation with unfitted finite elements and automatic shape differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop automatic shape differentiation techniques for unfitted discretisations and link these to recent advances in shape calculus for unfitted methods. We extend existing analytic shape calculus results to the case where the domain boundary intersects with the boundary of the background domain. We further show that we can recover these analytic derivatives to machine precision regardless of the mesh size using the developed automatic shape differentiation techniques, drastically reducing the burden associated with the analytic derivation of these quantities. In addition, we show that we can also recover the symmetric shape Hessian. We implement these techniques for both serial and distributed computing frameworks in the Julia package GridapTopOpt and the wider Gridap ecosystem. As part of this implementation we propose a novel graph-based approach for isolated volume detection. We demonstrate the applicability of the unfitted automatic shape differentiation framework and our implementation by considering the three-dimensional minimum compliance topology optimisation of a linear elastic wheel and of a linear elastic structure in a fluid-structure interaction problem with Stokes flow. The implementation is general and allows GridapTopOpt to solve a wider range of problems on unstructured meshes without analytic calculation of shape derivatives and avoiding issues that arise when material properties are smoothed at the domain boundary. The software is open source and available at https://github.com/zjwegert/GridapTopOpt.jl.</description>

      <title>Non-exchangeable evolutionary and mean field games and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A replicator dynamic for non-exchangeable agents in a continuous action space is formulated and its well-posedness is proven in a space of probability measures. The non-exchangeability allows for the analysis of evolutionary games involving agents with distinct (and possibly infinitely many) types. We also explicitly connect this replicator dynamic to a stationary mean field game, which determines the pairwise actions of the heterogeneous agents. Moreover, as a byproduct of our theoretical results, we show that a class of nonlinear voter models, recently the subject of increasing interest, called q-voter models, can be viewed as a replicator dynamic driven by a utility that is a power of the probability density. This implies that non-exchangeable and/or mean-field game formulations of these models can also be constructed. We also present computational examples of evolutionary and mean field game models using a finite difference method, focusing on tragedy of the commons and the q-voter model with non-exchangeable agents, of which are interesting cases from theoretical and computational perspectives.</description>
