      <title>Do Large Language Models Learn Human-Like Strategic Preferences?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate whether LLMs learn to make human-like preference judgements in strategic scenarios as compared with known empirical results. We show that Solar and Mistral exhibit stable value-based preference consistent with human in the prisoner's dilemma, including stake-size effect, and traveler's dilemma, including penalty-size effect. We establish a relationship between model size, value based preference, and superficiality. Finally, we find that models that tend to be less brittle were trained with sliding window attention. Additionally, we contribute a novel method for constructing preference relations from arbitrary LLMs and support for a hypothesis regarding human behavior in the traveler's dilemma.</description>

      <title>Facility Assignment with Fair Cost Sharing: Equilibrium and Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the one-dimensional facility assignment problem, m facilities and n agents are positioned along the real line. Each agent will be assigned to a single facility to receive service. Each facility incurs a building cost, which is shared equally among the agents utilizing it. Additionally, each agent independently bears a connection cost to access a facility. Thus, an agent's cost is the sum of the connection cost and her portion of the building cost. The social cost is the total cost of all agents. Notably, the optimal assignment that minimizes the social cost can be found in polynomial time. In this paper, we study the problem from two game-theoretical settings regarding the strategy space of agents and the rule the assignment. In both settings, agents act strategically to minimize their individual costs.
  In our first setting, the strategy space of agents is the set of facilities, granting agents the freedom to select any facility. Consequently, the self-formed assignment can exhibit instability, as agents may deviate to other facilities. We focus on the computation of an equilibrium assignment, where no agent has an incentive to unilaterally change her choice. We show that we can compute a pure Nash equilibrium in polynomial time.
  In our second setting, agents report their positions to a mechanism for assignment to facilities. The strategy space of agents becomes the set of all positions. Our interest lies in strategyproof mechanisms. It is essential to note that the preference induced by the agents' cost function is more complex as it depends on how other agents are assigned. We establish a strong lower bound against all strategyproof and anonymous mechanisms: none can achieve a bounded social cost approximation ratio. Nonetheless, we identify a class of non-trivial strategyproof mechanisms for any n and m that is unanimous and anonymous.</description>

      <title>Faster Game Solving via Hyperparameter Schedules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) family of algorithms consists of iterative algorithms for imperfect-information games. In two-player zero-sum games, the time average of the iterates converges to a Nash equilibrium. The state-of-the-art prior variants, Discounted CFR (DCFR) and Predictive CFR$^+$ (PCFR$^+$) are the fastest known algorithms for solving two-player zero-sum games in practice, both in the extensive-form setting and the normal-form setting. They enhance the convergence rate compared to vanilla CFR by applying discounted weights to early iterations in various ways, leveraging fixed weighting schemes. We introduce Hyperparameter Schedules (HSs), which are remarkably simple yet highly effective in expediting the rate of convergence. HS dynamically adjusts the hyperparameter governing the discounting scheme of CFR variants. HSs on top of DCFR or PCFR$^+$ is now the new state of the art in solving zero-sum games and yields orders-of-magnitude speed improvements. The new algorithms are also easy to implement because 1) they are small modifications to the existing ones in terms of code and 2) they require no game-specific tuning.</description>

      <title>Servers Placement Scheme Based on All-pay Auction Framework in Mobile Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task offloading plays a pivotal role in mobile edge computing, enabling terminal devices to enhance task execution efficiency and conserve energy. However, servers are reluctant to offer services without compensation. Currently, pricing mechanisms are commonly employed to incentivize servers to serve terminal devices, with servers earning revenue through payments from these devices. Given the rapid surge in terminal devices, determining the optimal number of servers placement for service providers (SPs) to maximize revenue is crucial. In this paper, we propose a server placement scheme based on an all-pay auction framework. Experimental simulations reveal that an optimal server-user ratio of approximately 25% maximizes SP profits.</description>

      <title>Centralization in Proof-of-Stake Blockchains: A Game-Theoretic Analysis of Bootstrapping Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proof-of-stake (PoS) has emerged as a natural alternative to the resource-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain, as was recently seen with the Ethereum Merge. PoS-based blockchains require an initial stake distribution among the participants. Typically, this initial stake distribution is called bootstrapping. This paper argues that existing bootstrapping protocols are prone to centralization. To address centralization due to bootstrapping, we propose a novel game $\Gamma_\textsf{bootstrap}$. Next, we define three conditions: (i) Individual Rationality (IR), (ii) Incentive Compatibility (IC), and (iii) $(\tau,\delta,\epsilon)-$ Decentralization that an \emph{ideal} bootstrapping protocol must satisfy. $(\tau,\delta,\epsilon)$ are certain parameters to quantify decentralization. Towards this, we propose a novel centralization metric, C-NORM, to measure centralization in a PoS System. We define a centralization game -- $\Gamma_\textsf{cent}$, to analyze the efficacy of centralization metrics. We show that C-NORM effectively captures centralization in the presence of strategic players capable of launching Sybil attacks. With C-NORM, we analyze popular bootstrapping protocols such as Airdrop and Proof-of-Burn (PoB) and prove that they do not satisfy IC and IR, respectively. Motivated by the Ethereum Merge, we study W2SB (a PoW-based bootstrapping protocol) and prove it is ideal. In addition, we conduct synthetic simulations to empirically validate that W2SB bootstrapped PoS is decentralized.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Game Theory-based Mobile Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the continuous advancement of network technology, various emerging complex networking optimization problems opened up a wide range of applications utilizating of game theory. However, since game theory is a mathematical framework, game theory-based solutions often require the experience and knowledge of human experts. Recently, the remarkable advantages exhibited by generative artificial intelligence (GAI) have gained widespread attention. In this article, we propose a novel GAI-enabled game theory solution that combines the powerful reasoning and generation capabilities of GAI to the design and optimization of mobile networking. Specifically, we first outline the game theory and key technologies of GAI, and then explore the advantages of combining GAI with game theory. Then, we briefly review the advantages and limitations of existing research and demonstrate the potential application values of GAI applied to game theory in mobile networking. Subsequently, we develop a game theory framework enabled by large language models (LLMs) to realize this combination, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through a case study in secured UAV networks. Finally, we provide several directions for future extensions.</description>

      <title>No-Regret Algorithms in non-Truthful Auctions with Budget and ROI Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advertisers increasingly use automated bidding to optimize their ad campaigns on online advertising platforms. Autobidding optimizes an advertiser's objective subject to various constraints, e.g. average ROI and budget constraints. In this paper, we study the problem of designing online autobidding algorithms to optimize value subject to ROI and budget constraints when the platform is running any mixture of first and second price auction.
  We consider the following stochastic setting: There is an item for sale in each of $T$ rounds. In each round, buyers submit bids and an auction is run to sell the item. We focus on one buyer, possibly with budget and ROI constraints. We assume that the buyer's value and the highest competing bid are drawn i.i.d. from some unknown (joint) distribution in each round. We design a low-regret bidding algorithm that satisfies the buyer's constraints. Our benchmark is the objective value achievable by the best possible Lipschitz function that maps values to bids, which is rich enough to best respond to many different correlation structures between value and highest competing bid. Our main result is an algorithm with full information feedback that guarantees a near-optimal $\tilde O(\sqrt T)$ regret with respect to the best Lipschitz function. Our result applies to a wide range of auctions, most notably any mixture of first and second price auctions (price is a convex combination of the first and second price). In addition, our result holds for both value-maximizing buyers and quasi-linear utility-maximizing buyers.
  We also study the bandit setting, where we show an $\Omega(T^{2/3})$ lower bound on the regret for first-price auctions, showing a large disparity between the full information and bandit settings. We also design an algorithm with $\tilde O(T^{3/4})$ regret, when the value distribution is known and is independent of the highest competing bid.</description>

      <title>Proof-of-Learning with Incentive Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most concurrent blockchain systems rely heavily on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanisms for decentralized consensus and security assurance. However, the substantial energy expenditure stemming from computationally intensive yet meaningless tasks has raised considerable concerns surrounding traditional PoW approaches, The PoS mechanism, while free of energy consumption, is subject to security and economic issues. Addressing these issues, the paradigm of Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) seeks to employ challenges of practical significance as PoW, thereby imbuing energy consumption with tangible value. While previous efforts in Proof of Learning (PoL) explored the utilization of deep learning model training SGD tasks as PoUW challenges, recent research has revealed its vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks and the theoretical hardness in crafting a byzantine-secure PoL mechanism. In this paper, we introduce the concept of incentive-security that incentivizes rational provers to behave honestly for their best interest, bypassing the existing hardness to design a PoL mechanism with computational efficiency, a provable incentive-security guarantee and controllable difficulty. Particularly, our work is secure against two attacks to the recent work of Jia et al. [2021], and also improves the computational overhead from $\Theta(1)$ to $O(\frac{\log E}{E})$. Furthermore, while most recent research assumes trusted problem providers and verifiers, our design also guarantees frontend incentive-security even when problem providers are untrusted, and verifier incentive-security that bypasses the Verifier's Dilemma. By incorporating ML training into blockchain consensus mechanisms with provable guarantees, our research not only proposes an eco-friendly solution to blockchain systems, but also provides a proposal for a completely decentralized computing power market in the new AI age.</description>

      <title>Competitive Retrieval: Going Beyond the Single Query</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous work on the competitive retrieval setting focused on a single-query setting: document authors manipulate their documents so as to improve their future ranking for a given query. We study a competitive setting where authors opt to improve their document's ranking for multiple queries. We use game theoretic analysis to prove that equilibrium does not necessarily exist. We then empirically show that it is more difficult for authors to improve their documents' rankings for multiple queries with a neural ranker than with a state-of-the-art feature-based ranker. We also present an effective approach for predicting the document most highly ranked in the next induced ranking.</description>

      <title>Complete Game Logic with Sabotage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Sabotage Game Logic ($\mathsf{GL_s}$), a simple and natural extension of Parikh's Game Logic with a single additional primitive, which allows players to lay traps for the opponent to avoid. $\mathsf{GL_s}$ can be used to model infinite sabotage games, in which players can change the rules during game play. In contrast to Game Logic, which is strictly less expressive, GLs is exactly as expressive as the modal $\mu$-calculus. This reveals a close connection between the entangled nested recursion inherent in modal fixpoint logics and adversarial dynamic rule changes characteristic for sabotage games. Additionally we present a natural Hilbert-style proof calculus for $\mathsf{GL_s}$ and prove completeness. The completeness of an extension of Parikh's calculus for Game Logic follows.</description>

      <title>Facility Location Games Beyond Single-Peakedness: the Entrance Fee Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.11282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The facility location game has been studied extensively in mechanism design. In the classical model, each agent's cost is solely determined by her distance to the nearest facility. In this paper, we introduce a novel model where each facility charges an entrance fee. Thus, the cost of each agent is determined by both the distance to the facility and the entrance fee of the facility. In our model, the entrance fee function is allowed to be an arbitrary function, causing agents' preferences may no longer be single-peaked anymore: This departure from the classical model introduces additional challenges. We systematically delve into the intricacies of the model, designing strategyproof mechanisms with favorable approximation ratios. Additionally, we complement these ratios with nearly-tight impossibility results. Specifically, for one-facility and two-facility games, we provide upper and lower bounds for the approximation ratios given by deterministic and randomized mechanisms with respect to utilitarian and egalitarian objectives.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Fair Division of Indivisible Items with Externalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity of fairly allocating a set of indivisible items under externalities. In this recently-proposed setting, in addition to the utility the agent gets from their bundle, they also receive utility from items allocated to other agents. We focus on the extended definitions of envy-freeness up to one item (EF1) and of envy-freeness up to any item (EFX), and we provide the landscape of their complexity for several different scenarios. We prove that it is NP-complete to decide whether there exists an EFX allocation, even when there are only three agents, or even when there are only six different values for the items. We complement these negative results by showing that when both the number of agents and the number of different values for items are bounded by a parameter the problem becomes fixed-parameter tractable. Furthermore, we prove that two-valued and binary-valued instances are equivalent and that EFX and EF1 allocations coincide for this class of instances. Finally, motivated from real-life scenarios, we focus on a class of structured valuation functions, which we term agent/item-correlated. We prove their equivalence to the ``standard'' setting without externalities. Therefore, all previous results for EF1 and EFX apply immediately for these valuations.</description>

      <title>Finite-horizon Approximations and Episodic Equilibrium for Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a finite-horizon approximation scheme and introduces episodic equilibrium as a solution concept for stochastic games (SGs), where agents strategize based on the current state and episode stage. The paper also establishes an upper bound on the approximation error that decays with the episode length for both discounted and time-averaged utilities. This approach bridges the gap in the analysis of finite and infinite-horizon SGs, and provides a unifying framework to address time-averaged and discounted utilities. To show the effectiveness of the scheme, the paper presents episodic, decentralized (i.e., payoff-based), and model-free learning dynamics proven to reach (near) episodic equilibrium in broad classes of SGs, including zero-sum, identical-interest and specific general-sum SGs with switching controllers for both time-averaged and discounted utilities.</description>

      <title>Learning Payment-Free Resource Allocation Mechanisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the design of mechanisms that allocate limited resources among self-interested agents using neural networks. Unlike the recent works that leverage machine learning for revenue maximization in auctions, we consider welfare maximization as the key objective in the payment-free setting. Without payment exchange, it is unclear how we can align agents' incentives to achieve the desired objectives of truthfulness and social welfare simultaneously, without resorting to approximations. Our work makes novel contributions by designing an approximate mechanism that desirably trade-off social welfare with truthfulness. Specifically, (i) we contribute a new end-to-end neural network architecture, ExS-Net, that accommodates the idea of "money-burning" for mechanism design without payments; (ii)~we provide a generalization bound that guarantees the mechanism performance when trained under finite samples; and (iii) we provide an experimental demonstration of the merits of the proposed mechanism.</description>

      <title>Information Elicitation in Agency Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid progress in scalable, commoditized tools for data collection and data processing has made it possible for firms and policymakers to employ ever more complex metrics as guides for decision-making. These developments have highlighted a prevailing challenge -- deciding *which* metrics to compute. In particular, a firm's ability to compute a wider range of existing metrics does not address the problem of *unknown unknowns*, which reflects informational limitations on the part of the firm. To guide the choice of metrics in the face of this informational problem, we turn to the evaluated agents themselves, who may have more information than a principal about how to measure outcomes effectively. We model this interaction as a simple agency game, where we ask: *When does an agent have an incentive to reveal the observability of a cost-correlated variable to the principal?* There are two effects: better information reduces the agent's information rents but also makes some projects go forward that otherwise would fail. We show that the agent prefers to reveal information that exposes a strong enough differentiation between high and low costs. Expanding the agent's action space to include the ability to *garble* their information, we show that the agent often prefers to garble over full revelation. Still, giving the agent the ability to garble can lead to higher total welfare. Our model has analogies with price discrimination, and we leverage some of these synergies to analyze total welfare.</description>

Abstract: Opinion spreading in a society decides the fate of elections, the success of products, and the impact of political or social movements. The model by Hegselmann and Krause is a well-known theoretical model to study such opinion formation processes in social networks. In contrast to many other theoretical models, it does not converge towards a situation where all agents agree on the same opinion. Instead, it assumes that people find an opinion reasonable if and only if it is close to their own. The system converges towards a stable situation where agents sharing the same opinion form a cluster, and agents in different clusters do not \mbox{influence each other.}
  We focus on the social variant of the Hegselmann-Krause model where agents are connected by a social network and their opinions evolve in an iterative process. When activated, an agent adopts the average of the opinions of its neighbors having a similar opinion. By this, the set of influencing neighbors of an agent may change over time. To the best of our knowledge, social Hegselmann-Krause systems with asynchronous opinion updates have only been studied with the complete graph as social network. We show that such opinion dynamics with random agent activation are guaranteed to converge for any social network. We provide an upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(n|E|^2 (\varepsilon/\delta)^2)$ on the expected number of opinion updates until convergence, where $|E|$ is the number of edges of the social network. For the complete social network we show a bound of $\mathcal{O}(n^3(n^2 + (\varepsilon/\delta)^2))$ that represents a major improvement over the previously best upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(n^9 (\varepsilon/\delta)^2)$. Our bounds are complemented by simulations that indicate asymptotically matching lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Achieving the Highest Possible Elo Rating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14567</link>

Abstract: Elo rating systems measure the approximate skill of each competitor in a game or sport. A competitor's rating increases when they win and decreases when they lose. Increasing one's rating can be difficult work; one must hone their skills and consistently beat the competition. Alternatively, with enough money you can rig the outcome of games to boost your rating. This paper poses a natural question for Elo rating systems: say you manage to get together $n$ people (including yourself) and acquire enough money to rig $k$ games. How high can you get your rating, asymptotically in $k$? In this setting, the people you gathered aren't very interested in the game, and will only play if you pay them to. This paper resolves the question for $n=2$ up to constant additive error, and provide close upper and lower bounds for all other $n$, including for $n$ growing arbitrarily with $k$. There is a phase transition at $n=k^{1/3}$: there is a huge increase in the highest possible Elo rating from $n=2$ to $n=k^{1/3}$, but (depending on the particular Elo system used) little-to-no increase for any higher $n$. Past the transition point $n&gt;k^{1/3}$, the highest possible Elo is at least $\Theta(k^{1/3})$. The corresponding upper bound depends on the particular system used, but for the standard Elo system, is $\Theta(k^{1/3}\log(k)^{1/3})$.</description>
