      <title>Error Analysis for Over-the-Air Federated Learning under Misaligned and Time-Varying Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an OFDM-based over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL) system, where multiple mobile devices, e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), transmit local machine learning (ML) models to a central parameter server (PS) for global model aggregation. The high mobility of local devices results in imperfect channel estimation, leading to a misalignment problem, i.e., the model parameters transmitted from different local devices do not arrive at the central PS simultaneously. Moreover, the mobility introduces time-varying uploading channels, which further complicates the aggregation process. All these factors collectively cause distortions in the OTA-FL training process which are underexplored. To quantify these effects, we first derive a closed-form expression for a single-round global model update in terms of these channel imperfections. We then extend our analysis to capture multiple rounds of global updates, yielding a bound on the accumulated error in OTA-FL. We validate our theoretical results via extensive numerical simulations, which corroborate our derived analysis.</description>

      <title>Dual-IRS Aided Near-/Hybrid-Field SWIPT: Passive Beamforming and Independent Antenna Power Splitting Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel dual-intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided interference-limited simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system with independent power splitting (PS), where each receiving antenna applies different PS factors to offer an advantageous trade-off between the useful information and harvested energy. We separately establish the near- and hybrid-field channel models for IRS-reflected links to evaluate the performance gain more precisely and practically. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem of maximizing the harvested power by jointly optimizing dual-IRS phase shifts, independent PS ratio, and receive beamforming vector in both near- and hybrid-field cases. In the near-field case, the alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the non-convex problem by applying the Lagrange duality method and the difference-of-convex (DC) programming. In the hybrid-field case, we first present an interesting result that the AP-IRS-user channel gains are invariant to the phase shifts of dual-IRS, which allows the optimization problem to be transformed into a convex one. Then, we derive the asymptotic performance of the combined channel gains in closed-form and analyze the characteristics of the dual-IRS. Numerical results validate our analysis and indicate the performance gains of the proposed scheme that dual-IRS-aided SWIPT with independent PS over other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Towards Automated EEG-Based Detection Using Deep Convolutional Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders. This disease requires reliable and efficient seizure detection methods. Electroencephalography (EEG) is the gold standard for seizure monitoring, but its manual analysis is a time-consuming task that requires expert knowledge. In addition, there are no well-defined features that allow fully automated analysis. Existing deep learning-based approaches struggle to achieve high sensitivity while maintaining a low false alarm rate per hour (FAR/h) and lack consistency in the optimal EEG input representation, whether in the time or frequency domain. To address these issues, we propose a Deep Convolutional Autoencoder (DCAE) to extract low-dimensional latent representations that preserve essential EEG signal features. The ability of the model to preserve relevant information was evaluated by comparing reconstruction errors based on both time series and frequency-domain representations. Several autoencoders with different loss functions based on time and frequency were trained and evaluated to determine their effectiveness in reconstructing EEG features. Our results show that the DCAE model taking both time series and frequency losses into account achieved the best reconstruction performance. This indicates that Deep Neural Networks with a single representation might not preserve the relevant signal properties. This work provides insight into how deep learning models process EEG data and examines whether frequency information is captured when time series signals are used as input.</description>

      <title>Removing motion artifacts from mechanomyographic signals: an innovative filtering method applied to human movement analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanomyography (MMG) is a promising tool for measuring muscle activity in the field but its sensitivity to motion artifacts limits its application. In this study, we proposed an adaptative filtering method for MMG accelerometers based on the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition, with adaptative noise and spectral fuzzy entropy, to isolate motions artefacts from the MMG signal in dynamic conditions. We compared our method with the traditional band-pass filtering technique, demonstrating better results concerning motion recomposition for deltoid and erector spinae muscles (R${}^2$ = 0.907 and 0.842). Thus, this innovative method allows the filtering of motion artifacts dynamically in the 5-20 Hz bandwidth, which is not achievable with traditional method. However, the interpretation of accelerometric MMG signals from the trunk and lower-limb muscles during walking or running should be approached with great caution as impact-related accelerations are still present, though their exact quantity still needs to be quantified.</description>

      <title>Weighted Bayesian Cram$\acute{\text{e}}$r-Rao Bound for Mixed-Resolution Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed-resolution architectures, combining high-resolution (analog) data with coarsely quantized (e.g., 1-bit) data, are widely employed in emerging communication and radar systems to reduce hardware costs and power consumption. However, the use of coarsely quantized data introduces non-trivial tradeoffs in parameter estimation tasks. In this paper, we investigate the derivation of lower bounds for such systems. In particular, we develop the weighted Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound (WBCRB) for the mixed-resolution setting with a general weight function. We demonstrate the special cases of: (i) the classical BCRB; (ii) the WBCRB that is based on the Bayesian Fisher information matrix (BFIM)-Inverse weighting; and (iii) the Aharon-Tabrikian tightest WBCRB with an optimal weight function. Based on the developed WBCRB, we propose a new method to approximate the mean-squared-error (MSE) by partitioning the estimation problem into two regions: (a) where the 1-bit quantized data is informative; and (b) where it is saturated. We apply region-specific WBCRB approximations in these regions to achieve an accurate composite MSE estimate. We derive the bounds and MSE approximation for the linear Gaussian orthonormal (LGO) model, which is commonly used in practical signal processing applications. Our simulation results demonstrate the use of the proposed bounds and approximation method in the LGO model with a scalar unknown parameter. It is shown that the WBCRB outperforms the BCRB, where the BFIM-Inverse weighting version approaches the optimal WBCRB. Moreover, it is shown that the WBCRB-based MSE approximation is tighter and accurately predicts the non-monotonic behavior of the MSE in the presence of quantization errors.</description>

      <title>Breaking Barriers in Health Monitoring: Multi-Scenario Vital Sign Detection Using Mm-Wave MIMO FMCW Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the deployment of mm-wave Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar for vital sign detection across multiple scenarios. We focus on overcoming the limitations of traditional sensing methods by enhancing signal processing techniques to capture subtle physiological changes effectively. Our study introduces novel adaptations of the Prony and MUSIC algorithms tailored for real-time heart and respiration rate monitoring, significantly advancing the accuracy and reliability of non-contact vital sign monitoring using radar technologies. Notably, these algorithms demonstrate a robust ability to suppress noise and harmonic interference. For instance, the mean absolute errors (MAE) for MUSIC and Prony in heart rate detection are 1.8 and 0.81, respectively, while for respiration rate, the MAEs are 1.01 and 0.8, respectively. These results underscore the potential of FMCW radar as a reliable, non-invasive solution for continuous vital sign monitoring in healthcare settings, particularly in clinical and emergency scenarios where traditional contact-based monitoring is impractical.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symplectic geometry mode decomposition (SGMD) is a powerful method for decomposing time series, which is based on the diagonal averaging principle (DAP) inherited from the singular spectrum analysis (SSA). Although the authors of SGMD method generalized the form of the trajectory matrix in SSA, the DAP is not updated simultaneously. In this work, we pointed out the limitations of the SGMD method and fixed the bugs with the pulling back theorem for computing the given component of time series from the corresponding component of trajectory matrix.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Automatic Modulation Recognition With a Reconstruction-Driven Vision Transformer Under Limited Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised, self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust, discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only 15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and label-efficient solution for AMR.</description>

Abstract: K-pop's global success is fueled by its dynamic performances and vibrant fan engagement. Inspired by K-pop fan culture, we propose a methodology for automatically extracting live vocals from performances. We use a combination of source separation, cross-correlation, and amplitude scaling to automatically remove pre-recorded vocals and instrumentals from a live performance. Our preliminary work introduces the task of live vocal separation and provides a foundation for future research in this topic.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Segmentation of EEG for Machine Learning Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling continuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals for machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The current naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited biological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals. We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine learning EEG analysis.
  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG method has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying it to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG machine learning pipeline for seizure detection.
  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and requires fewer segments.
  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG can be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to improve performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation for signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard preprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.</description>

Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography with fully integrated microfluidics and electronics is presented for the first time in a CMOS chip. Chambers and electrodes are fabricated in the interconnect layers of a 65 nm CMOS chip through post-processing, enabling picoliter-volumes to be processed and imaged. Tomography maps are reconstructed by reading out voltages from a 16-element electrode array and processing the data off-chip, and sources of variation in reconstruction are discussed. The EIT system presented in this work serves as a proof-of-concept towards using CMOS as a platform for co-integrated microfluidics and electronics.</description>

      <title>Achieving Optimal Performance-Cost Trade-Off in Hierarchical Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell-free (CF) massive MIMO offers uniform service via distributed access points (APs), which impose high deployment costs. A novel design called hierarchical cell-free (HCF) addresses this problem by replacing some APs with a central base station, thereby lowering the costs of fronthaul network (wireless sites and fiber cables) while preserving performance. To identify the optimal uplink configuration in HCF massive MIMO, this paper provides the first comprehensive analysis, benchmarking it against cellular and CF systems. We develop a unified analytical framework for spectral efficiency that supports arbitrary combining schemes and introduce a novel hierarchical combining approach tailored to HCF two-tier architecture. Through analysis and evaluation of user fairness, system capacity, fronthaul requirements, and computational complexity, this paper identifies that HCF using centralized zero-forcing combining achieves the optimal balance between performance and cost-efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper seeks to determine the most efficient uplink technique for cell-free massive MIMO systems. Despite offering great advances, existing works suffer from fragmented methodologies and inconsistent assumptions (e.g., single- vs. multi-antenna access points, ideal vs. spatially correlated channels). To address these limitations, we: (1) establish a unified analytical framework compatible with centralized/distributed processing and diverse combining schemes; (2) develop a universal optimization strategy for max-min power control; and (3) conduct a holistic study among four critical metrics: worst-case user spectral efficiency (fairness), system capacity, fronthaul signaling, and computational complexity. Through analyses and evaluation, this work ultimately identifies the optimal uplink technique for practical cell-free deployments.</description>

      <title>Scaling Fabric-Based Piezoresistive Sensor Arrays for Whole-Body Tactile Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling tactile sensing for robust whole-body manipulation is a significant challenge, often limited by wiring complexity, data throughput, and system reliability. This paper presents a complete architecture designed to overcome these barriers. Our approach pairs open-source, fabric-based sensors with custom readout electronics that reduce signal crosstalk to less than 3.3% through hardware-based mitigation. Critically, we introduce a novel, daisy-chained SPI bus topology that avoids the practical limitations of common wireless protocols and the prohibitive wiring complexity of USB hub-based systems. This architecture streams synchronized data from over 8,000 taxels across 1 square meter of sensing area at update rates exceeding 50 FPS, confirming its suitability for real-time control. We validate the system's efficacy in a whole-body grasping task where, without feedback, the robot's open-loop trajectory results in an uncontrolled application of force that slowly crushes a deformable cardboard box. With real-time tactile feedback, the robot transforms this motion into a gentle, stable grasp, successfully manipulating the object without causing structural damage. This work provides a robust and well-characterized platform to enable future research in advanced whole-body control and physical human-robot interaction.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming and Antenna Position Optimization for IRS-Aided Multi-User Movable Antenna Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and movable antenna (MA) technologies have been proposed to enhance wireless communications by creating favorable channel conditions. This paper investigates the joint beamforming and antenna position optimization for MA-enabled IRS (MA-IRS)-aided multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) communication systems, where the MA-IRS is deployed to aid the communication between the MA-enabled base station (BS) and user equipment (UE). In contrast to conventional fixed position antenna (FPA)-enabled IRS (FPA-IRS), the positions of the reflecting elements of the MA-IRS can be controlled to enhances the wireless channel. To verify the system's effectiveness and optimize its performance, we formulate a sum-rate maximization problem with a minimum rate threshold constraint for the MU-MISO communication. To tackle the non-convex problem, a product Riemannian manifold optimization (PRMO) method is proposed for the joint optimization of the beamforming and MA positions. Specifically, a product Riemannian manifold space (PRMS) is constructed and the corresponding Riemannian gradient is derived for updating the variables, and the Riemannian exact penalty (REP) method and a Riemannian Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (RBFGS) algorithm is exploited to obtain a feasible solution over the PRMS. Simulation results demonstrate that compared with the conventional FPA-IRS-aided communications, the reflecting elements of the MA-IRS can move to the positions with higher channel gain, thus enhancing the system performance. Furthermore, it is shown that optimizing the positions of the reflecting elements brings higher performance gain than controlling the phase shifts of the IRS, and integrating MA with IRS leads to higher performance gains compared to integrating MA with BS.</description>

      <title>Statistical Model and Estimation Method for Ranging a Moving Ship Using a Single Acoustic Receiver in Shallow Water</title>

Abstract: Passive acoustics is a versatile tool for maritime situational awareness, enabling applications such as source detection and localization, marine mammal tracking, and geoacoustic inversion. This study focuses on estimating the range between an acoustic receiver and a transiting ship in an acoustically range-independent shallow water environment. Here, acoustic propagation can be modeled by a set of modes that are determined by the shallow water waveguide and seabed characteristics. These modes are dispersive, with phase and group velocities varying with frequency, and their interference produces striation patterns that depend on range and frequency in single-hydrophone spectrograms. These striation patterns can often be characterized by the waveguide invariant (WI), a single parameter describing the waveguide's properties. This paper presents a statistical model and corresponding WI-based range estimation approach using a single hydrophone, leveraging broadband and tonal sounds from a transiting ship. Using data from the Seabed Characterization Experiment 2017 (SBCEX17), the method was evaluated on two commercial ships under different environmental conditions and frequency bands. Range estimation errors remained below 4 % up to 62 km in the best case, with robust performance demonstrated in the 40-60 Hz band.</description>

      <title>A critical note on the sideband peak count-index technique: failure for nonlinear damage characterization of impacted CFRP plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is widely accepted, that nonlinear elastodynamic methods are superior to linear methods in detecting early stages of material deterioration. A number of recently developed methods are reported to be particularly sensitive to nonlinearities and thus appropriate to indicate early damage. We applied systematically one of the methods, the sideband peak count index (SPC-I), to a series of increasingly damaged carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) plates. Our data leads to different conclusions. The SPC-I values are influenced by (usually undocumented) variations in the index calculation procedure, which is not acceptable for a robust method. Moreover, the behavior of the index when the ultrasound amplitude is varied contradicts material nonlinearity as a direct and significant contributor to the index value. To clarify the apparent contradiction of our results with the previously published statements, it is recommended that (a) our data are re-evaluated by independent researchers and (b) the experiments already published are repeated or (if sufficient data is availThe paper has been updated for submission to NDT&amp;E.able) also re-evaluated.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Gradient Descent Optimization for Mitigating Hardware Imperfections in RIS Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ongoing discussions about the future of wireless communications are reaching a turning point as standardization activities for the sixth generation of mobile networks (6G) become more mature. New technologies must now face renewed scrutiny by the industry and academia in order to be ready for deployment in the near future. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) gained attention as a promising solution for improving the propagation conditions of signal transmission in general. The RIS is a planar array of tunable resonant elements designed to dynamically and precisely manipulate the reflection of incident electromagnetic waves. However, the physical structure of the RIS and its components may be subject to practical limitations and imperfections. It is imperative that the hardware imperfections (HWIs) associated with the RIS be analyzed, so that it remains a feasible technology from a practical standpoint. Moreover, solutions for mitigating the HWIs must be considered, as is discussed in this work. More specifically, we introduce a gradient descent optimization for mitigating HWIs in RIS-aided wideband communication systems. Numerical results show that the proposed optimization is able to compensate for HWIs such as the phase-shift noise (PSN) and RIS surface deformations.</description>

      <title>Code-Weight Sphere Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) demand high-performance error-correcting codes and decoders in the finite blocklength regime. This letter introduces a novel two-stage near-maximum likelihood (near-ML) decoding framework applicable to any linear block code. Our approach first employs a low-complexity initial decoder. If this initial stage fails a cyclic redundancy check, it triggers a second stage: the proposed code-weight sphere decoding (WSD). WSD iteratively refines the codeword estimate by exploring a localized sphere of candidates constructed from pre-computed low-weight codewords. This strategy adaptively minimizes computational overhead at high signal-to-noise ratios while achieving near-ML performance, especially for low-rate codes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our two-stage decoder provides an excellent trade-off between decoding reliability and complexity, establishing it as a promising solution for next-generation URLLC systems.</description>

      <title>Unscented Kalman Filter with a Nonlinear Propagation Model for Navigation Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10082v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unscented Kalman filter is a nonlinear estimation algorithm commonly used in navigation applications. The prediction of the mean and covariance matrix is crucial to the stable behavior of the filter. This prediction is done by propagating the sigma points according to the dynamic model at hand. In this paper, we introduce an innovative method to propagate the sigma points according to the nonlinear dynamic model of the navigation error state vector. This improves the filter accuracy and navigation performance. We demonstrate the benefits of our proposed approach using real sensor data recorded by an autonomous underwater vehicle during several scenarios.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form BER Analysis for Uplink NOMA with Dynamic SIC Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper, for the first time, presents a closed-form error performance analysis of uplink power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) with dynamic successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding, where the decoding order is adapted to the instantaneous channel conditions. We first develop an analytical framework that characterizes how dynamic ordering affects error probabilities in uplink PD-NOMA systems. For a two-user system over independent and non-identically distributed Rayleigh fading channels, we derive closed-form probability density functions (PDFs) of ordered channel gains and the corresponding unconditional pairwise error probabilities (PEPs). To address the mathematical complexity of characterizing ordered channel distributions, we employ a Gaussian fitting to approximate truncated distributions while maintaining analytical tractability. Finally, we extend the bit error rate analysis for various $M$-quadrature amplitude modulation schemes (QAM) in both homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate that dynamic SIC eliminates the error floor issue observed in fixed-order SIC, achieving significantly improved performance in high signal-to-noise ratio regions. Our findings also highlight that larger power differences are essential for higher-order modulations, offering concrete guidance for practical uplink PD-NOMA deployment.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of IEEE 802.11bn with Coordinated TDMA on Real-Time Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wi-Fi plays a crucial role in connecting electronic devices and providing communication services in everyday life. Recently, there has been a growing demand for services that require low-latency communication, such as real-time applications. The latest amendments to Wi-Fi, IEEE 802.11bn, are being developed to address these demands with technologies such as the multiple access point coordination (MAPC). In this paper, we demonstrate that coordinated TDMA (Co-TDMA), one of the MAPC techniques, effectively reduces the latency of transmitting time-sensitive traffic. In particular, we focus on worst-case latency and jitter, which are key metrics for evaluating the performance of real-time applications. We first introduce a Co-TDMA scheduling strategy. We then investigate how this scheduling strategy impacts latency under varying levels of network congestion and traffic volume characteristics. Finally, we validate our findings through system-level simulations. Our simulation results demonstrate that Co-TDMA effectively mitigates jitter and worst-case latency for low-latency traffic, with the latter exhibiting an improvement of approximately 24%.</description>
