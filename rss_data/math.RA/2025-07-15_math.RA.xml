      <title>Constructing Superregular Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superregular matrices, i.e., matrices where all square submatrices are non-singular, have a wide range of applications in communications. A superregular block matrix is a broader concept where all full block submatrices, with the appropriate size, are non-singular. In this work we propose a construction of block superregular matrices based on the Kronecker product of superregular matrices with non-singular matrices. Furthermore, we propose two constructions of superregular matrices via other smaller superregular matrices over smaller fields.</description>

      <title>Nilpotent BCK-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recall the derived subalgebra of a BCK-algebra, and use this to define the derived ideal. Using the derived ideal, we show that the category of commutative BCK-algebras is a reflective subcategory of the category of BCK-algebras. After this, we introduce central series and define a notion of nilpotence for BCK-algebras and prove some properties of nilpotence. In particular, for any variety of BCK-algebras, the sub-class of nilpotent algebras is a sub-pseudovariety, though in general not a variety. We also show that the class of BCK-algebras of nilpotence class at most $c$ is a sub-quasivariety of all BCK-algebras, and is a variety if and only if $c=1$. We close by showing that every finite BCK-algebra is nilpotent.</description>

      <title>The Network Satisfaction Problem for Relation Algebras with at most 4 Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Andr\'eka and Maddux classified the relation algebras with at most 3 atoms, and in particular they showed that all of them are representable. Hirsch and Cristiani showed that the network satisfaction problem (NSP) for each of these algebras is in P or NP-hard. There are relation algebras with 4 atoms that are not representable, and there are many results in the literature about representations and non-representability of relation algebras with at most 4 atoms. We extend the result of Hirsch and Cristiani to relation algebras with at most 4 atoms: the NSP is always either in P or NP-hard. To this end, we construct universal, fully universal, or even normal representations for these algebras, whenever possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce compatible cleft extensions of abelian categories, and we prove that if $(\mathcal{B},\mathcal{A}, e,i,l)$ is a compatible cleft extension, then both the functor $l$ and the left adjoint of $i$ preserve Gorenstein projective objects. Moreover, we give some necessary conditions for an object of $\mathcal{A}$ to be Gorenstein projective, and we show that these necessary conditions are also sufficient in some special case. As applications, we unify some known results on the description of Gorenstein projective modules over triangular matrix rings, Morita context rings with zero homomorphisms and $\theta$-extensions.</description>

Abstract: We give the graded anti-pre-Lie algebraic structures on the Witt algebra $\mathcal W$ by the classification of certain indecomposable weight representations of $\mathcal W$.

      <description>arXiv:2507.09396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let S denote a Steiner triple system on an n-element set. An orientation of S is an assignment of a cyclic ordering to each of the triples in S. From an oriented Steiner triple system, one can define an anticommutative bilinear operation on Rn resembling the cross product. We call this bilinear operation a Steiner product. We classify the oriented Steiner triple systems on sets of size 7 and 9 and investigate the dynamics of their associated Steiner products.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new class of generalized inverses with weights, which represent a natural extension of EP (Moore-Penrose) and *-DMP (Drazin-Moore-Penrose) elements in a Banach *-algebra. This paper presents various characteristics of weighted EP elements. Moreover, we characterize the weighted EP element through the core-EP decomposition and a polar-like property. Finally, we explore weighted *-DMP elements and uncover several new properties of *-DMP elements.</description>

Abstract: In previous works, the author described an associative algebra whose $A_\infty$-module categories encode the Heegaard Floer Dehn surgery formulas. In this article, we describe the Koszul dual of this algebra. We construct dualizing bimodules, and prove several equivalences of categories. The constructions of this paper have applications to computational problems involving the link surgery formula.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by a recent work of Y.

      <title>Multi-scale representation of integer sets: application to prime numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a multi-scale analysis method for studying arithmetic properties of integer sets, such as primality. Our approach organizes information through a hierarchy of nested sequences, where each level enables a hierarchical expression of the studied property by examining patterns at varying levels of granularity. To illustrate the method, we apply it to prime numbers. While this does not claim any new breakthroughs on this classical problem, the approach allows for analysis of the studied property across large integer sequences and reveals characteristics observable at different scales. By limiting ourselves to the case of prime numbers, we build sequences with values in {0, ..., 255}, which have the advantage of simplifying the reading, at different scales, of the encoded property. We free ourselves from the numerous digits of large integers by replacing them with small integers between 0 and 255. We have also highlighted, at different scales, histograms composed of at most 256 values. We have observed that for a sufficiently large interval, they all share a same invariant shape, which can be viewed as a characteristic of prime numbers. Each value in the histogram represents the count of a subset of prime numbers. We have proposed an estimation for each value in the histogram and at all scales. We hope that the proposed framework will be useful for investigating arithmetic properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the notions of $L_{\infty}$-, $P_{\infty}$-, and $S_{\infty}$-algebras (including "shifted" versions) in the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}$-graded setting. We also consider thick (microformal) morphisms and show how they work in such graded context.
  In particular, we show that a "shifted $S_{\infty}$-thick morphism" (which we introduce here) induces an $L_{\infty}$-morphism of shifted $S_{\infty}$-structures. The same holds for "shifted $P_{\infty}$-thick morphisms" and shifted $P_{\infty}$-structures, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma\in \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ be a finite subgroup. We introduce a class of projective noncommutative surfaces $\mathbb{P}^2_I$, indexed by a set of irreducible $\Gamma$-representations. Extending the action of $\Gamma$ from $\mathbb{C}^2$ to $\mathbb{P}^2$, we show that these surfaces generalise both $[\mathbb{P}^2/\Gamma]$ and $\mathbb{P}^2/\Gamma$. We prove that isomorphism classes of framed torsion-free sheaves on any $\mathbb{P}^2_I$ carry a canonical bijection to the closed points of appropriate Nakajima quiver varieties. In particular, we provide geometric interpretations for a class of Nakajima quiver varieties using noncommutative geometry. Our results partially generalise several previous results on such quiver varieties.</description>

      <title>Frobenius-Schur Indicators of Dual Fusion Categories and Semisimple Partially Dualized Quasi-Hopf Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frobenius-Schur indicators (or indicators for short) of objects in pivotal monoidal categories were defined and formulated by Ng and Schauenburg in 2007. In this paper, we introduce and study an analogous formula for indicators in the dual category $\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{M}^\ast$ to a spherical fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ (with respect to an indecomposable semisimple module category $\mathcal{M}$) over $\mathbb{C}$. Our main theorem is a relation between indicators of specific objects in $\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{M}^\ast$ and $\mathcal{C}$. As consequences: 1) We obtain equalities on the indicators between certain representations and the exponents of a semisimple complex Hopf algebra as well as its left partially dualized quasi-Hopf algebra; 2) We deduce formulas on indicators of certain modules over some particular semisimple Hopf algebras - bismash products and quantum doubles; 3) We show that for each semisimple left partially dualized quasi-Hopf algebra, its exponent and Frobenius-Schur exponent are identical.</description>

      <title>$2$-representation infinite algebras from non-abelian subgroups of $\operatorname{SL}_3$. Part I: Extensions of abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G \leq \operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ be a non-trivial finite group, acting on $R = \mathbb{C}[x_1, x_2, x_3]$. The resulting skew-group algebra $R \ast G$ is $3$-Calabi-Yau, and can sometimes be endowed with the structure of a $3$-preprojective algebra. However, not every such $R \ast G$ admits such a structure. The finite subgroups of $\operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ are classified into types (A) to (L). We consider the groups $G$ of types (C) and (D) and determine for each such group whether the algebra $R \ast G$ admits a $3$-preprojective structure. We show that the algebra $R \ast G$ admits a $3$-preprojective structure if and only if $9 \mid |G|$. Our proof is constructive and yields a description of the involved $2$-representation infinite algebras. This is based on the semi-direct decomposition $G \simeq N \rtimes K$ for an abelian group $N$, and we show that the existence of a $3$-preprojective structure on $R \ast G$ is essentially determined by the existence of one on $R \ast N$. This provides new classes of $2$-representation infinite algebras, and we discuss some $2$-Auslander-Platzeck-Reiten tilts. Along the way, we give a detailed description of the involved groups and their McKay quivers by iteratively applying skew-group constructions.</description>

      <title>A matrix criterion and algorithmic approach for the Peterson hit problem: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18392v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Peterson hit problem in algebraic topology is to explicitly determine the dimension of the quotient space $Q\mathcal P_k = \mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathcal A}\mathcal P_k$ in positive degrees, where $\mathcal{P}_k$ denotes the polynomial algebra in $k$ variables over the field $\mathbb{F}_2$, considered as an unstable module over the Steenrod algebra $\mathcal{A}$. Current approaches to this problem still rely heavily on manual computations, which are highly prone to errors due to the intricate nature of the underlying calculations. To date, no efficient algorithm implemented in any computer algebra system has been made publicly available to tackle this problem in a systematic manner.
  Motivated by the above, in this work, which is considered as Part I of our project, we first establish a criterion based entirely on linear algebra for determining whether a given homogeneous polynomial is "hit". Accordingly, we describe the dimensions of the hit spaces. This leads to a practical and reliable computational method for determining the dimension of $Q\mathcal{P}_k$ for arbitrary $k$ and any positive degrees, with the support of a computer algebra system. We then give a concrete implementation of the obtained results as novel algorithms in \textsc{SageMath}. As an application, our algorithm demonstrates that the manually computed result presented in the recent work of Sum and Tai [15] for the dimension of $Q\mathcal{P}_5$ in degree $2^{6}$ is not correct. Furthermore, our algorithm determines that $\dim(Q\mathcal{P}_5)_{2^{7}} = 1985,$ which falls within the range $1984 \leq \dim(Q\mathcal{P}_5)_{2^{7}} \leq 1990$ as estimated in [15].</description>
