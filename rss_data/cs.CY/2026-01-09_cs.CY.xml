      <title>Generative Teaching via Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalability of high-quality online education is hindered by the high costs and slow cycles of labor-intensive manual content creation. Despite advancements in video generation, current approaches often fail to ensure pedagogical structure and precise control due to their pixel-level, black-box nature. In this paper, we propose Generative Teaching, a novel paradigm that transitions educators from manual creators to high-level directors, allowing them to focus on pedagogical intent while autonomous agents handle the execution. To realize this vision, we introduce TeachMaster, a multi-agent framework that leverages code as an intermediate semantic medium. Unlike traditional video generation methods, TeachMaster orchestrates a collaborative team of agents--spanning planning, design, and rendering--to automate the production of interpretable, editable, and curriculum-ready educational videos. Experiments validate that TeachMaster significantly boosts production efficiency without compromising structural coherence or visual fidelity, providing a robust solution for scalable education.</description>

      <title>Computable Gap Assessment of Artificial Intelligence Governance in Children's Centres:Evidence-Mechanism-Governance-Indicator Modelling of UNICEF's Guidance on AI and Children 3.0 Based on the Graph-GAP Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tackles practical challenges in governing child centered artificial intelligence: policy texts state principles and requirements but often lack reproducible evidence anchors, explicit causal pathways, executable governance toolchains, and computable audit metrics. We propose Graph-GAP, a methodology that decomposes requirements from authoritative policy texts into a four layer graph of evidence, mechanism, governance, and indicator, and that computes two metrics, GAP score and mitigation readiness, to identify governance gaps and prioritise actions. Using the UNICEF Innocenti Guidance on AI and Children 3.0 as primary material, we define reproducible extraction units, coding manuals, graph patterns, scoring scales, and consistency checks, and we demonstrate exemplar gap profiles and governance priority matrices for ten requirements. Results suggest that compared with privacy and data protection, requirements related to child well being and development, explainability and accountability, and cross agency implementation and resource allocation are more prone to indicator gaps and mechanism gaps. We recommend translating requirements into auditable closed loop governance that integrates child rights impact assessments, continuous monitoring metrics, and grievance redress procedures. At the coding level, we introduce a multi algorithm review aggregation revision workflow that runs rule based encoders, statistical or machine learning evaluators, and large model evaluators with diverse prompt configurations as parallel coders. Each extraction unit outputs evidence, mechanism, governance, and indicator labels plus readiness scores with evidence anchors. Reliability, stability, and uncertainty are assessed using Krippendorff alpha, weighted kappa, intraclass correlation, and bootstrap confidence intervals.</description>

      <title>Attachment Styles and AI Chatbot Interactions Among College Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of large language model (LLM)-based AI chatbots among college students has increased rapidly, yet little is known about how individual psychological attributes shape students' interaction patterns with these technologies. This qualitative study explored how college students with different attachment styles describe their interactions with ChatGPT. Using semi-structured interviews with seven undergraduate students and grounded theory analysis, we identified three main themes: (1) AI as a low-risk emotional space, where participants across attachment styles valued the non-judgmental and low-stakes nature of AI interactions; (2) attachment-congruent patterns of AI engagement, where securely attached students integrated AI as a supplementary tool within their existing support systems, while avoidantly attached students used AI to buffer vulnerability and maintain interpersonal boundaries; and (3) the paradox of AI intimacy, capturing the tension between students' willingness to disclose personal information to AI while simultaneously recognizing its limitations as a relational partner. These findings suggest that attachment orientations play an important role in shaping how students experience and interpret their interactions with AI chatbots, extending attachment theory to the domain of human-AI interaction.</description>

      <title>The Artificial Intelligence Value Chain: A Critical Appraisal. [Spanish Version]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The artificial intelligence value chain is one of the main concepts underpinning the European legislation on the subject, especially the Artificial Intelligence Act. It is an economic concept that has become a legal one. i.e., a concept of legal governance, due to its continued use in policy documents and legal texts. This article (i) analyses its significance and function within the framework of the regulatory strategy established by recent EU programs (the Compass for Competitiveness, the Action Plan, Apply AI Strategy, and the Digital Omnibus on AI), (ii) identifies its limitations, and (iii) advances the theoretical construction of value chains that capture intangible dimensions that are not directly monetizable (such as language, culture, and, especially, ethical and legal values) but have a significant impact on the social environment. It also briefly compares three different legal frameworks for the regulation of AI (EU, Commonwealth and USA). It proposes at the end a specific framework for the analysis of the ethical and legal AI value chain to preserve democratic values and foster the digital implementation of the rule of law.</description>

      <title>AgentTutor: Empowering Personalized Learning with Multi-Turn Interactive Teaching in Intelligent Education Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large-scale language models (LLMs) has shown their potential to transform intelligent education systems (IESs) through automated teaching and learning support applications. However, current IESs often rely on single-turn static question-answering, which fails to assess learners' cognitive levels, cannot adjust teaching strategies based on real-time feedback, and is limited to providing simple one-off responses. To address these issues, we introduce AgentTutor, a multi-turn interactive intelligent education system to empower personalized learning. It features an LLM-powered generative multi-agent system and a learner-specific personalized learning profile environment that dynamically optimizes and delivers teaching strategies based on learners' learning status, personalized goals, learning preferences, and multimodal study materials. It includes five key modules: curriculum decomposition, learner assessment, dynamic strategy, teaching reflection, and knowledge &amp; experience memory. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, AgentTutor significantly enhances learners' performance while demonstrating strong effectiveness in multi-turn interactions and competitiveness in teaching quality among other baselines.</description>

      <title>Beyond Interaction Effects: Two Logics for Studying Population Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When sociologists and other social scientist ask whether the return to college differs by race and gender, they face a choice between two fundamentally different modes of inquiry. Traditional interaction models follow deductive logic: the researcher specifies which variables moderate effects and tests these hypotheses. Machine learning methods follow inductive logic: algorithms search across vast combinatorial spaces to discover patterns of heterogeneity. This article develops a framework for navigating between these approaches. We show that the choice between deduction and induction reflects a tradeoff between interpretability and flexibility, and we demonstrate through simulation when each approach excels. Our framework is particularly relevant for inequality research, where understanding how treatment effects vary across intersecting social subpopulation is substantively central.</description>

      <title>Can Consumer Chatbots Reason? A Student-Led Field Experiment Embedded in an "AI-for-All" Undergraduate Course</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Claims about whether large language model (LLM) chatbots "reason" are typically debated using curated benchmarks and laboratory-style evaluation protocols. This paper offers a complementary perspective: a student-led field experiment embedded as a midterm project in UNIV 182 (AI4All) at George Mason University, a Mason Core course designed for undergraduates across disciplines with no expected prior STEM exposure. Student teams designed their own reasoning tasks, ran them on widely used consumer chatbots representative of current capabilities, and evaluated both (i) answer correctness and (ii) the validity of the chatbot's stated reasoning (for example, cases where an answer is correct but the explanation is not, or vice versa). Across eight teams that reported standardized scores, students contributed 80 original reasoning prompts spanning six categories: pattern completion, transformation rules, spatial/visual reasoning, quantitative reasoning, relational/logic reasoning, and analogical reasoning. These prompts yielded 320 model responses plus follow-up explanations. Aggregating team-level results, OpenAI GPT-5 and Claude 4.5 achieved the highest mean answer accuracy (86.2% and 83.8%), followed by Grok 4 (82.5%) and Perplexity (73.1%); explanation validity showed a similar ordering (81.2%, 80.0%, 77.5%, 66.2%). Qualitatively, teams converged on a consistent error signature: strong performance on short, structured math and pattern items but reduced reliability on spatial/visual reasoning and multi-step transformations, with frequent "sound right but reason wrong" explanations. The assignment's primary contribution is pedagogical: it operationalizes AI literacy as experimental practice (prompt design, measurement, rater disagreement, and interpretability/grounding) while producing a reusable, student-generated corpus of reasoning probes grounded in authentic end-user interaction.</description>

      <title>Automated Reproducibility Has a Problem Statement Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background. Reproducibility is essential to the scientific method, but reproduction is often a laborious task. Recent works have attempted to automate this process and relieve researchers of this workload. However, due to varying definitions of reproducibility, a clear problem statement is missing. Objectives. Create a generalisable problem statement, applicable to any empirical study. We hypothesise that we can represent any empirical study using a structure based on the scientific method and that this representation can be automatically extracted from any publication, and captures the essence of the study. Methods. We apply our definition of reproducibility as a problem statement for the automatisation of reproducibility by automatically extracting the hypotheses, experiments and interpretations of 20 studies and assess the quality based on assessments by the original authors of each study. Results. We create a dataset representing the reproducibility problem, consisting of the representation of 20 studies. The majority of author feedback is positive, for all parts of the representation. In a few cases, our method failed to capture all elements of the study. We also find room for improvement at capturing specific details, such as results of experiments. Conclusions. We conclude that our formulation of the problem is able to capture the concept of reproducibility in empirical AI studies across a wide range of subfields. Authors of original publications generally agree that the produced structure is representative of their work; we believe improvements can be achieved by applying our findings to create a more structured and fine-grained output in future work.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Social Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI for Social Impact (AI4SI) has achieved compelling results in public health, conservation, and security, yet scaling these successes remains difficult due to a persistent deployment bottleneck. We characterize this bottleneck through three coupled gaps: observational scarcity resulting from limited or unreliable data; policy synthesis challenges involving combinatorial decisions and nonstationarity; and the friction of human-AI alignment when incorporating tacit expert knowledge and dynamic constraints. We argue that Generative AI offers a unified pathway to bridge these gaps. LLM agents assist in human-AI alignment by translating natural-language guidance into executable objectives and constraints for downstream planners, while diffusion models generate realistic synthetic data and support uncertainty-aware modeling to improve policy robustness and transfer across deployments. Together, these tools enable scalable, adaptable, and human-aligned AI systems for resource optimization in high-stakes settings.</description>

      <title>Technological Transitions and the Limits of Inference in Adaptive Educational Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contemporary educational systems, academic performance indicators play a central role in institutional evaluation and in the interpretation of student trajectories. However, under conditions of rapid technological change, the inferential validity of such indicators becomes increasingly fragile. This article examines how, in adaptive educational systems, statistically correct inferences may nevertheless become systematically misleading when structural conditions change. Adopting a theory-informed interpretive approach, the paper conceptualises technological transitions as exogenous structural perturbations that reconfigure incentives, constraints, and participation strategies, without necessarily implying a deterioration of underlying student capabilities. Drawing on prior empirical evidence for illustrative purposes, the analysis identifies recurring patterns of inferential instability, including level shifts, trend reconfigurations, and increased heterogeneity across cohorts. The argument integrates insights from complex adaptive systems theory, the sociology of quantification, and measurement theory to show how strategic behavioural adaptation can decouple the meaning of performance metrics from the constructs they are intended to represent. The paper concludes by emphasising the need for inferential caution when interpreting educational metrics in contexts of structural and technological transformation.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Trends in Pre University Preparation. A Cohort Evaluation Using Introductory Mathematics and Physics Courses (1980-2019)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition from secondary to higher education represents a critical point in academic trajectories, particularly in programmes with a strong emphasis on basic sciences. Across different higher education systems, introductory Mathematics and Physics courses consistently concentrate high rates of early failure and attrition, yet most available evidence relies on cross-sectional analyses or limited time spans. This study presents a longitudinal evaluation of pre-university preparation based on early academic outcomes in Mathematics and Physics, conceptualised as "sensor" courses of initial academic demands. Using complete administrative records from a large public university in Argentina, the analysis covers entry cohorts from 1980 to 2019 with census-level coverage and a population-based approach. Pre-university preparation is operationally defined as cohort-level compatibility between students' prior educational background and the functional demands of introductory university coursework, observed through first-attempt outcomes. For each cohort and by type of secondary school (public or private), we estimate the probability of course approval, the probability of non-attempt (enrolment without evaluative participation), and the public-private success gap. The results reveal consistent long-term patterns: a gradual decline in early approval probabilities, a sustained increase in non-attempt behaviour, and the persistence of moderate but stable public-private gaps. These findings point to structural changes in the articulation between secondary education and higher education rather than short-term fluctuations or individual-level effects. The study contributes to the international literature on educational evaluation by providing rare long-horizon longitudinal evidence from an Ibero-American context.</description>

      <title>Convenience vs. Control: A Qualitative Study of Youth Privacy with Smart Voice Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart voice assistants (SVAs) are embedded in the daily lives of youth, yet their privacy controls often remain opaque and difficult to manage. Through five semi-structured focus groups (N=26) with young Canadians (ages 16-24), we investigate how perceived privacy risks (PPR) and benefits (PPBf) intersect with algorithmic transparency and trust (ATT) and privacy self-efficacy (PSE) to shape privacy-protective behaviors (PPB). Our analysis reveals that policy overload, fragmented settings, and unclear data retention undermine self-efficacy and discourage protective actions. Conversely, simple transparency cues were associated with greater confidence without diminishing the utility of hands-free tasks and entertainment. We synthesize these findings into a qualitative model in which transparency friction erodes PSE, which in turn weakens PPB. From this model, we derive actionable design guidance for SVAs, including a unified privacy hub, plain-language "data nutrition" labels, clear retention defaults, and device-conditional micro-tutorials. This work foregrounds youth perspectives and offers a path for SVA governance and design that empowers young digital citizens while preserving convenience.</description>

      <title>Balancing Usability and Compliance in AI Smart Devices: A Privacy-by-Design Audit of Google Home, Alexa, and Siri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the privacy and usability of AI-enabled smart devices commonly used by youth, focusing on Google Home Mini, Amazon Alexa, and Apple Siri. While these devices provide convenience and efficiency, they also raise privacy and transparency concerns due to their always-listening design and complex data management processes. The study proposes and applies a combined framework of Heuristic Evaluation, Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) Compliance Assessment, and Youth-Centered Usability Testing to assess whether these devices align with Privacy-by-Design principles and support meaningful user control. Results show that Google Home achieved the highest usability score, while Siri scored highest in regulatory compliance, indicating a trade-off between user convenience and privacy protection. Alexa demonstrated clearer task navigation but weaker transparency in data retention. Findings suggest that although youth may feel capable of managing their data, their privacy self-efficacy remains limited by technical design, complex settings, and unclear data policies. The paper concludes that enhancing transparency, embedding privacy guidance during onboarding, and improving policy alignment are critical steps toward ensuring that smart devices are both usable and compliant with privacy standards that protect young users.</description>

      <title>Understanding Gaming the System by Analyzing Self-Regulated Learning in Think-Aloud Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In digital learning systems, gaming the system refers to occasions when students attempt to succeed in an educational task by systematically taking advantage of system features rather than engaging meaningfully with the content. Often viewed as a form of behavioral disengagement, gaming the system is negatively associated with short- and long-term learning outcomes. However, little research has explored this phenomenon beyond its behavioral representation, leaving questions such as whether students are cognitively disengaged or whether they engage in different self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies when gaming largely unanswered. This study employs a mixed-methods approach to examine students' cognitive engagement and SRL processes during gaming versus non-gaming periods, using utterance length and SRL codes inferred from think-aloud protocols collected while students interacted with an intelligent tutoring system for chemistry. We found that gaming does not simply reflect a lack of cognitive effort; during gaming, students often produced longer utterances, were more likely to engage in processing information and realizing errors, but less likely to engage in planning, and exhibited reactive rather than proactive self-regulatory strategies. These findings provide empirical evidence supporting the interpretation that gaming may represent a maladaptive form of SRL. With this understanding, future work can address gaming and its negative impacts by designing systems that target maladaptive self-regulation to promote better learning.</description>

      <title>The unsuitability of existing regulations to reach sustainable AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the European Union's emerging regulatory landscape - focusing on the AI Act, corporate sustainability reporting and due diligence regimes (CSRD and CSDDD), and data center regulation - to assess whether it can effectively govern AI's environmental footprint. We argue that, despite incremental progress, current approaches remain ill-suited to correcting the market failures underpinning AI-related energy use, water consumption, and material demand. Key shortcomings include narrow disclosure requirements, excessive reliance on voluntary standards, weak enforcement mechanisms, and a structural disconnect between AI-specific impacts and broader sustainability laws. The analysis situates these regulatory gaps within a wider ecosystem of academic research, civil society advocacy, standard-setting, and industry initiatives, highlighting risks of regulatory capture and greenwashing. Building on this diagnosis, the paper advances strategic recommendations for the COP30 Action Agenda, calling for binding transparency obligations, harmonized international standards for lifecycle assessment, stricter governance of data center expansion, and meaningful public participation in AI infrastructure decisions.</description>

      <title>Safe in the Future, Dangerous in the Past: Dissecting Temporal and Linguistic Vulnerabilities in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24556v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into critical global infrastructure, the assumption that safety alignment transfers zero-shot from English to other languages remains a dangerous blind spot. This study presents a systematic audit of three state of the art models (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5 Opus) using HausaSafety, a novel adversarial dataset grounded in West African threat scenarios (e.g., Yahoo-Yahoo fraud, Dane gun manufacturing). Employing a 2 x 4 factorial design across 1,440 evaluations, we tested the non-linear interaction between language (English vs. Hausa) and temporal framing. Our results challenge the narrative of the multilingual safety gap. Instead of a simple degradation in low-resource settings, we identified a complex interference mechanism in which safety is determined by the intersection of variables. Although the models exhibited a reverse linguistic vulnerability with Claude 4.5 Opus proving significantly safer in Hausa (45.0%) than in English (36.7%) due to uncertainty-driven refusal, they suffered catastrophic failures in temporal reasoning. We report a profound Temporal Asymmetry, where past-tense framing bypassed defenses (15.6% safe) while future-tense scenarios triggered hyper-conservative refusals (57.2% safe). The magnitude of this volatility is illustrated by a 9.2x disparity between the safest and most vulnerable configurations, proving that safety is not a fixed property but a context-dependent state. We conclude that current models rely on superficial heuristics rather than robust semantic understanding, creating Safety Pockets that leave Global South users exposed to localized harms. We propose Invariant Alignment as a necessary paradigm shift to ensure safety stability across linguistic and temporal shifts.</description>

      <title>Collective Narrative Grounding: Community-Coordinated Data Contributions to Improve Local AI Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) question-answering systems often fail on community-specific queries, creating "knowledge blind spots" that marginalize local voices and reinforce epistemic injustice. We present Collective Narrative Grounding, a participatory protocol that transforms community stories into structured narrative units and integrates them into AI systems under community governance. Learning from three participatory mapping workshops with N=24 community members, we designed elicitation methods and a schema that retain narrative richness while enabling entity, time, and place extraction, validation, and provenance control. To scope the problem, we audit a county-level benchmark of 14,782 local information QA pairs, where factual gaps, cultural misunderstandings, geographic confusions, and temporal misalignments account for 76.7% of errors. On a participatory QA set derived from our workshops, a state-of-the-art LLM answered fewer than 21% of questions correctly without added context, underscoring the need for local grounding. The missing facts often appear in the collected narratives, suggesting a direct path to closing the dominant error modes for narrative items. Beyond the protocol and pilot, we articulate key design tensions, such as representation and power, governance and control, and privacy and consent, providing concrete requirements for retrieval-first, provenance-visible, locally governed QA systems. Together, our taxonomy, protocol, and participatory evaluation offer a rigorous foundation for building community-grounded AI that better answers local questions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Admission Inquiry Responses with Fine-Tuned Models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: University admissions offices face the significant challenge of managing high volumes of inquiries efficiently while maintaining response quality, which critically impacts prospective students' perceptions. This paper addresses the issues of response time and information accuracy by proposing an AI system integrating a fine-tuned language model with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). While RAG effectively retrieves relevant information from large datasets, its performance in narrow, complex domains like university admissions can be limited without adaptation, potentially leading to contextually inadequate responses due to the intricate rules and specific details involved. To overcome this, we fine-tuned the model on a curated dataset specific to admissions processes, enhancing its ability to interpret RAG-provided data accurately and generate domain-relevant outputs. This hybrid approach leverages RAG's ability to access up-to-date information and fine-tuning's capacity to embed nuanced domain understanding. We further explored optimization strategies for the response generation logic, experimenting with settings to balance response quality and speed, aiming for consistently high-quality outputs that meet the specific requirements of admissions communications.</description>

      <title>Social Engineering Attacks: A Systemisation of Knowledge on People Against Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our systematisation of knowledge on Social Engineering Attacks (SEAs), identifies the human, organisational, and adversarial dimensions of cyber threats. It addresses the growing risks posed by SEAs, highly relevant in the context physical cyber places, such as travellers at airports and residents in smart cities, and synthesizes findings from peer reviewed studies, industry and government reports to inform effective countermeasures that can be embedded into future smart city strategies. SEAs increasingly sidestep technical controls by weaponising leaked personal data and behavioural cues, an urgency underscored by the Optus, Medibank and now Qantas (2025) mega breaches that placed millions of personal records in criminals' hands. Our review surfaces three critical dimensions: (i) human factors of knowledge, abilities and behaviours (KAB) (ii) organisational culture and informal norms that shape those behaviours and (iii) attacker motivations, techniques and return on investment calculations. Our contributions are threefold: (1) TriLayer Systematisation: to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to unify KAB metrics, cultural drivers and attacker economics into a single analytical lens, enabling practitioners to see how vulnerabilities, norms and threat incentives coevolve. (2) Risk Weighted HAISQ Meta analysis: By normalising and ranking HAISQ scores across recent field studies, we reveal persistent high risk clusters (Internet and Social Media use) and propose impact weightings that make the instrument predictive rather than descriptive. (3) Adaptive 'Segment and Simulate' Training Blueprint: Building on clustering evidence, we outline a differentiated programme that matches low, medium, high risk user cohorts to experiential learning packages including phishing simulations, gamified challenges and realtime feedback thereby aligning effort with measured exposure.</description>

      <title>AI Agents as Policymakers in Simulated Epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI agents are increasingly deployed as quasi-autonomous systems for specialized tasks, yet their potential as computational models of decision-making remains underexplored. We develop a generative AI agent to study repetitive policy decisions during an epidemic, embedding the agent, prompted to act as a city mayor, within a simulated SEIR environment. Each week, the agent receives updated epidemiological information, evaluates the evolving situation, and sets business restriction levels. The agent is equipped with a dynamic memory that weights past events by recency and is evaluated in both single- and ensemble-agent settings across environments of varying complexity. Across scenarios, the agent exhibits human-like reactive behavior, tightening restrictions in response to rising cases and relaxing them as risk declines. Crucially, providing the agent with brief systems-level knowledge of epidemic dynamics, highlighting feedbacks between disease spread and behavioral responses, substantially improves decision quality and stability. The results illustrate how theory-informed prompting can shape emergent policy behavior in AI agents. These findings demonstrate that generative AI agents, when situated in structured environments and guided by minimal domain theory, can serve as powerful computational models for studying decision-making and policy design in complex social systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build, deploy, and evaluate Paper Skygest, a custom personalized social feed for scientific content posted by a user's network on Bluesky and the AT Protocol. We leverage a new capability on emerging decentralized social media platforms: the ability for anyone to build and deploy feeds for other users, to use just as they would a native platform-built feed. To our knowledge, Paper Skygest is the first and largest such continuously deployed personalized social media feed by academics, with over 50,000 weekly uses by over 1,000 daily active users, all organically acquired. First, we quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate Paper Skygest usage, showing that it has sustained usage and satisfies users; we further show adoption of Paper Skygest increases a user's interactions with posts about research, and how interaction rates change as a function of post order. Second, we share our full code and describe our system architecture, to support other academics in building and deploying such feeds sustainably. Third, we overview the potential of custom feeds such as Paper Skygest for studying algorithm designs, building for user agency, and running recommender system experiments with organic users without partnering with a centralized platform.</description>

      <title>Privacy at Scale in Networked Healthcare</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digitized, networked healthcare promises earlier detection, precision therapeutics, and continuous care; yet, it also expands the surface for privacy loss and compliance risk. We argue for a shift from siloed, application-specific protections to privacy-by-design at scale, centered on decision-theoretic differential privacy (DP) across the full healthcare data lifecycle; network-aware privacy accounting for interdependence in people, sensors, and organizations; and compliance-as-code tooling that lets health systems share evidence while demonstrating regulatory due care. We synthesize the privacy-enhancing technology (PET) landscape in health (federated analytics, DP, cryptographic computation), identify practice gaps, and outline a deployable agenda involving privacy-budget ledgers, a control plane to coordinate PET components across sites, shared testbeds, and PET literacy, to make lawful, trustworthy sharing the default. We illustrate with use cases (multi-site trials, genomics, disease surveillance, mHealth) and highlight distributed inference as a workhorse for multi-institution learning under explicit privacy budgets.</description>

      <title>Accommodation and Epistemic Vigilance: A Pragmatic Account of Why LLMs Fail to Challenge Harmful Beliefs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently fail to challenge users' harmful beliefs in domains ranging from medical advice to social reasoning. We argue that these failures can be understood and addressed pragmatically as consequences of LLMs defaulting to accommodating users' assumptions and exhibiting insufficient epistemic vigilance. We show that social and linguistic factors known to influence accommodation in humans (at-issueness, linguistic encoding, and source reliability) similarly affect accommodation in LLMs, explaining performance differences across three safety benchmarks that test models' ability to challenge harmful beliefs, spanning misinformation (Cancer-Myth, SAGE-Eval) and sycophancy (ELEPHANT). We further show that simple pragmatic interventions, such as adding the phrase "wait a minute", significantly improve performance on these benchmarks while preserving low false-positive rates. Our results highlight the importance of considering pragmatics for evaluating LLM behavior and improving LLM safety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed energy trading and carbon asset management involve high-frequency, small-value settlements with strong audit requirements. Fully on-chain designs incur excessive cost, while purely off-chain approaches lack verifiable consistency. This paper presents a hybrid on-chain and off-chain settlement framework that anchors settlement commitments and key constraints on-chain and links off-chain records through deterministic digests and replayable auditing. Experiments under publicly constrained workloads show that the framework significantly reduces on-chain execution and storage cost while preserving audit trustworthiness.</description>

      <title>Automatic Classifiers Underdetect Emotions Expressed by Men</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of automatic sentiment and emotion classifiers makes it important to ensure that these tools perform reliably across different populations. Yet their reliability is typically assessed using benchmarks that rely on third-party annotators rather than the individuals experiencing the emotions themselves, potentially concealing systematic biases. In this paper, we use a unique, large-scale dataset of more than one million self-annotated posts and a pre-registered research design to investigate gender biases in emotion detection across 414 combinations of models and emotion-related classes. We find that across different types of automatic classifiers and various underlying emotions, error rates are consistently higher for texts authored by men compared to those authored by women. We quantify how this bias could affect results in downstream applications and show that current machine learning tools, including large language models, should be applied with caution when the gender composition of a sample is not known or variable. Our findings demonstrate that sentiment analysis is not yet a solved problem, especially in ensuring equitable model behaviour across demographic groups.</description>

      <title>Homeostasis Under Technological Transition: How High-Friction Universities Adapt Through Early Filtering Rather Than Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universities are widely expected to respond to technological transitions through rapid reconfiguration of programme demand and curricular supply. Using four decades of longitudinal administrative cohorts (1980-2019) from a large public university, we examine whether technological change is translated into observable shifts in programme hierarchy, or instead absorbed by institutional mechanisms that preserve structural stability. We show that programme rankings by entrant volume remain remarkably stable over time, while the translation of technological transitions into enrolment composition occurs with substantial delay. Short-run adjustment appears primarily in early persistence dynamics: attrition reacts sooner than choice, and "growth" in entrants can coexist with declining early survival - producing false winners in which expansion is decoupled from persistence. Macroeconomic volatility amplifies attrition and compresses between-programme differences, masking technological signals that would otherwise be interpreted as preference shifts. To explain why stability dominates responsiveness, we situate these patterns within nationally regulated constraints governing engineering education - minimum total hours and mandated practice intensity - which materially limit the speed of curricular adaptation (Ministerio de Educacion, 2021; Ley de Educacion Superior, 1995). National system metrics further support the plausibility of a high-friction equilibrium in which large inflows coexist with standardised outputs (Secretaria de Politicas Universitarias [SPU], 2022). These findings suggest that apparent rigidity is not an anomaly but the predictable outcome of a system optimised for stability over responsiveness.</description>

Abstract: Learning Analytics (LA) is nowadays ubiquitous in many educational systems, providing the ability to collect and analyze student data in order to understand and optimize learning and the environments in which it occurs. On the other hand, the collection of data requires to comply with the growing demand regarding privacy legislation. In this paper, we use the Student Expectation of Learning Analytics Questionnaire (SELAQ) to analyze the expectations and confidence of students from different faculties regarding the processing of their data for Learning Analytics purposes. This allows us to identify four clusters of students through clustering algorithms: Enthusiasts, Realists, Cautious and Indifferents. This structured analysis provides valuable insights into the acceptance and criticism of Learning Analytics among students.</description>

      <title>Measuring and Fostering Peace through Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We used machine learning and artificial intelligence: 1) to measure levels of peace in countries from news and social media and 2) to develop on-line tools that promote peace by helping users better understand their own media diet. For news media, we used neural networks to measure levels of peace from text embeddings of on-line news sources. The model, trained on one news media dataset also showed high accuracy when used to analyze a different news dataset. For social media, such as YouTube, we developed other models to measure levels of social dimensions important in peace using word level (GoEmotions) and context level (Large Language Model) methods. To promote peace, we note that 71% of people 20-40 years old daily view most of their news through short videos on social media. Content creators of these videos are biased towards creating videos with emotional activation, making you angry to engage you, to increase clicks. We developed and tested a Chrome extension, MirrorMirror, which provides real-time feedback to YouTube viewers about the peacefulness of the media they are watching. Our long term goal is for MirrorMirror to evolve into an open-source tool for content creators, journalists, researchers, platforms, and individual users to better understand the tone of their media creation and consumption and its effects on viewers. Moving beyond simple engagement metrics, we hope to encourage more respectful, nuanced, and informative communication.</description>

      <title>Digital Homunculi and Institutional Design: Breaking Through the Experimentation Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Democracy research faces a longstanding experimentation bottleneck. Potential institutional innovations remain untested because human-subject studies are slow, expensive, and ethically fraught. This paper argues that digital homunculi, that is, GenAI-powered agents role-playing humans in diverse institutional settings, could offer a way to break through the bottleneck. In contrast to the legacy agent-based modeling, building complexity from transparent simple rules, the digital homunculi methodology aims to extract latent human behavioral knowledge from opaque large language models. To this ends, it designs multi-agent interactions as elicitation devices to trigger in LLMs human-like behavior that can be recorded as synthetic data. However, the validity of synthetic data remains an open question. Success requires that accurate, coherent, transferable models of humans ('little humans' - homunculi) already lurk within GenAI's inscrutable matrices and can be lured out via the social simulation role-play exercise. At the same time, to the extent these attempts are successful, they promise to completely transform the political economy of institutional research from scarcity to abundance. To help mitigate the number of challenges along the way to such success, I propose concrete validation strategies including behavioral back-testing via knowledge cutoffs, and outline infrastructure requirements for rigorous evaluation. The stakes are high: legacy democratic institutions develop at much slower pace than the surrounding technological landscape. If they falter, we lack a repository of tested backup alternatives. Breaking through the experimentation bottleneck must be a priority and digital homunculi may be quickly maturing into a methodology capable of achieving this feat.</description>

      <title>AI red-teaming is a sociotechnical problem: on values, labor, and harms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As generative AI technologies find more and more real-world applications, the importance of testing their performance and safety seems paramount. "Red-teaming" has quickly become the primary approach to test AI models--prioritized by AI companies, and enshrined in AI policy and regulation. Members of red teams act as adversaries, probing AI systems to test their safety mechanisms and uncover vulnerabilities. Yet we know far too little about this work or its implications. This essay calls for collaboration between computer scientists and social scientists to study the sociotechnical systems surrounding AI technologies, including the work of red-teaming, to avoid repeating the mistakes of the recent past. We highlight the importance of understanding the values and assumptions behind red-teaming, the labor arrangements involved, and the psychological impacts on red-teamers, drawing insights from the lessons learned around the work of content moderation.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Responsible AI Systems: Building Societal Trust through Domain Definition, Trustworthy AI Design, Auditability, Accountability, and Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Responsible Artificial Intelligence (RAI) addresses the ethical and regulatory challenges of deploying AI systems in high-risk scenarios. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for the design of an RAI system (RAIS) that integrates five key dimensions: domain definition, trustworthy AI design, auditability, accountability, and governance. Unlike prior work that treats these components in isolation, our proposal emphasizes their inter-dependencies and iterative feedback loops, enabling proactive and reactive accountability throughout the AI lifecycle. Beyond presenting the framework, we synthesize recent developments in global AI governance and analyze limitations in existing principles-based approaches, highlighting fragmentation, implementation gaps, and the need for participatory governance. The paper also identifies critical challenges and research directions for the RAIS framework, including sector-specific adaptation and operationalization, to support certification, post-deployment monitoring, and risk-based auditing. By bridging technical design and institutional responsibility, this work offers a practical blueprint for embedding responsibility throughout the AI lifecycle, enabling transparent, ethically aligned, and legally compliant AI-based systems.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Impact of Student Gaming Behaviors on Learner Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The expansion of large-scale online education platforms has made vast amounts of student interaction data available for knowledge tracing (KT). KT models estimate students' concept mastery from interaction data, but their performance is sensitive to input data quality. Gaming behaviors, such as excessive hint use, may misrepresent students' knowledge and undermine model reliability. However, systematic investigations of how different types of gaming behaviors affect KT remain scarce, and existing studies rely on costly manual analysis that does not capture behavioral diversity. In this study, we conceptualize gaming behaviors as a form of data poisoning, defined as the deliberate submission of incorrect or misleading interaction data to corrupt a model's learning process. We design Data Poisoning Attacks (DPAs) to simulate diverse gaming patterns and systematically evaluate their impact on KT model performance. Moreover, drawing on advances in DPA detection, we explore unsupervised approaches to enhance the generalizability of gaming behavior detection. We find that KT models' performance tends to decrease especially in response to random guess behaviors. Our findings provide insights into the vulnerabilities of KT models and highlight the potential of adversarial methods for improving the robustness of learning analytics systems.</description>

      <title>AppellateGen: A Benchmark for Appellate Legal Judgment Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Legal judgment generation is a critical task in legal intelligence. However, existing research in legal judgment generation has predominantly focused on first-instance trials, relying on static fact-to-verdict mappings while neglecting the dialectical nature of appellate (second-instance) review. To address this, we introduce AppellateGen, a benchmark for second-instance legal judgment generation comprising 7,351 case pairs. The task requires models to draft legally binding judgments by reasoning over the initial verdict and evidentiary updates, thereby modeling the causal dependency between trial stages. We further propose a judicial Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)-based Legal Multi-Agent System (SLMAS) to simulate judicial workflows, which decomposes the generation process into discrete stages of issue identification, retrieval, and drafting. Experimental results indicate that while SLMAS improves logical consistency, the complexity of appellate reasoning remains a substantial challenge for current LLMs. The dataset and code are publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AppellateGen-5763.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Learning from Judgment: Representation Learning for Open Response Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open-ended responses are central to learning, yet automated scoring often conflates what students wrote with how teachers grade. We present an analytics-first framework that separates content signals from rater tendencies, making judgments visible and auditable via analytics. Using de-identified ASSISTments mathematics responses, we model teacher histories as dynamic priors and represent text with sentence embeddings. We apply centroid normalization and response-problem embedding differences, and explicitly model teacher effects with priors to reduce problem- and teacher-related confounds. Temporally-validated linear models quantify the contributions of each signal, and model disagreements surface observations for qualitative inspection. Results show that teacher priors heavily influence grade predictions; the strongest results arise when priors are combined with content embeddings (AUC~0.815), while content-only models remain above chance but substantially weaker (AUC~0.626). Adjusting for rater effects sharpens the selection of features derived from content representations, retaining more informative embedding dimensions and revealing cases where semantic evidence supports understanding as opposed to surface-level differences in how students respond. The contribution presents a practical pipeline that transforms embeddings from mere features into learning analytics for reflection, enabling teachers and researchers to examine where grading practices align (or conflict) with evidence of student reasoning and learning.</description>
