      <title>Bridging the Gap between Reactivity, Contraction and Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the concept of reactivity for a nonlinear discrete-time system and generalizes this concept to the case of the p-iteration system, p &gt; 1. We introduce a definition of reactivity for nonlinear discrete-time systems based on a general weighted norm. Stability conditions of the first iteration system based on the reactivity of p-iteration system, p &gt; 1 are provided for both linear-time varying systems and nonlinear maps. We provide examples of stability analysis of linear time-varying, and synchronization of chaotic maps using reactivity. We discuss the connection between reactivity and well-established stability criteria, contraction, and finite-time Lyapunov exponents. For the case of a linearized system about a given trajectory and the study of the local stability of the synchronous solution for networks of coupled maps, the reactivity of the p-iteration system coincides with the finite-time Lyapunov exponent, with this time being equal to p. In the limit of infinite p, the reactivity becomes the maximum Lyapunov exponent, which allows us to bridge the gap between the master stability function approach and the contraction theory approach to study the stability of the synchronous solution for networks.</description>

      <title>On the structure of the Birkhoff-irregular set for some subshifts of finite type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the set of irregular points for a class of topologically mixing subshifts of finite type. It is well known that despite the irregular set having zero measure for every invariant measure, it has full topological entropy and full Hausdorff dimension. We establish that for these systems the irregular set is not only abundant in terms of its dimensional properties, but also contains uncountably many pairwise disjoint subsets, each with full entropy and dimension. This results deepens our understanding of the complexity of irregular points in dynamical systems, highlighting their intricate structure and suggesting avenues for further explorations in related areas.</description>

      <title>Morse decomposition of scalar differential equations with state-dependent delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider state-dependent delay differential equations of the form $$\dot{x}(t) = f(x(t), x(t - r(x_t))),$$ where $f$ is continuously differentiable and fulfills a negative feedback condition in the delayed term. Under suitable conditions on $r$ and $f$, we construct a Morse decomposition of the global attractor, giving some insight into the global dynamics. The so-called Morse sets in the decomposition are closely related to the level sets of an integer valued Lyapunov function that counts the number of sign changes along solutions on intervals of length of the delay. This generalizes former results for constant delay. We also give two major types of state-dependent delays for which our results apply.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an Anosov flow on a closed 3-manifold, we are interested in the problem of whether or not making non-trivial Fried surgeries along a finite set of periodic orbits can produce a flow equivalent to itself. We show that for some suspension Anosov flows, there exist infinitely many pairs of periodic orbits satisfying this property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a connection between percolation on the Cayley graphs of a group and the dynamical diversity of cellular automata on that group. Specifically, we demonstrate that Gilman's dichotomy between equicontinuity and sensitivity with respect to Bernoulli measures holds on a finitely generated group if and only if the group has a trivial percolation threshold. Consequently, we show that a countable group satisfies Gilman's dichotomy if and only if it is locally virtually cyclic.</description>

      <title>A Martingale-Free Introduction to Conditional Gaussian Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Conditional Gaussian Nonlinear System (CGNS) is a broad class of nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. Given the trajectories for a subset of state variables, the remaining follow a Gaussian distribution. Despite the conditionally linear structure, the CGNS exhibits strong nonlinearity, thus capturing many non-Gaussian characteristics observed in nature through its joint and marginal distributions. Desirably, it enjoys closed analytic formulae for the time evolution of its conditional Gaussian statistics, which facilitate the study of data assimilation and other related topics. In this paper, we develop a martingale-free approach to improve the understanding of CGNSs. This methodology provides a tractable approach to proving the time evolution of the conditional statistics by deriving results through time discretization schemes, with the continuous-time regime obtained via a formal limiting process as the discretization time-step vanishes. This discretized approach further allows for developing analytic formulae for optimal posterior sampling of unobserved state variables with correlated noise. These tools are particularly valuable for studying extreme events and intermittency and apply to high-dimensional systems. Moreover, the approach improves the understanding of different sampling methods in characterizing uncertainty. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through a physics-constrained, triad-interaction climate model with cubic nonlinearity and state-dependent cross-interacting noise.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the relationship between dynamical symmetries, Cartan symmetries, and dynamical similarities in contact mechanics. Using an alternative decomposition of vector fields, we provide a characterization of those symmetries and a new description in terms of tensor densities. Additionally, we show that, in certain cases, this construction enables the recovery of integrals of motion.</description>

      <title>A kneading map of chaotic switching oscillations in a Kerr cavity with two interacting light fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical systems that combine nonlinearity with coupling between various subsystems offer a flexible platform for observing a diverse range of nonlinear dynamics. Furthermore, engineering tolerances are such that the subsystems can be identical to within a fraction of the wavelength of light; hence, such coupled systems inherently have a natural symmetry that can lead to either delocalization or symmetry breaking. We consider here an optical Kerr cavity that supports two interacting electric fields, generated by two symmetric input beams. Mathematically, this system is modeled by a four-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant vector field with the strength and detuning of the input light as control parameters. Previous research has shown that complex switching dynamics are observed both experimentally and numerically across a wide range of parameter values. Here, we show that particular switching patterns are created at specific global bifurcations through either delocalization or symmetry breaking of a chaotic attractor. We find that the system exhibits infinitely many of these global bifurcations, which are organized by $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant codimension-two Belyakov transitions. We investigate these switching dynamics by means of the continuation of global bifurcations in combination with the computation of kneading invariants and Lyapunov exponents. In this way, we provide a comprehensive picture of the interplay between different switching patterns of periodic orbits and chaotic attractors.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a finitely generated group, and let $\mu$ be a nondegenerate, finitely supported probability measure on $\Gamma$. We show that every co-compact $\Gamma$ action on a locally compact Hausdorff space admits a nonzero $\mu$-stationary Radon measure. The main ingredient of the proof is a stationary analogue of Tarski's theorem: we show that for every nonempty subset $A \subseteq \Gamma$ there is a $\mu$-stationary, finitely additive measure on $\Gamma$ that assigns unit mass to $A$.</description>

      <title>Basic offspring number and robust feedback design for the biological control of vectors by sterile insect release technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is a promising control method against insect pests and insect vectors. It consists in releasing males previously sterilized in laboratory, in order to reduce or eliminate a specific wild population. We study in this paper the implementation by feedback control of SIT-based elimination campaign of Aedes mosquitoes. We provide state-feedback and output-feedback control laws and establish their convergence, as well as their robustness properties. In this design procedure, a pivotal role is played by the average number of secondary female insects produced by a single female insect, called basic offspring number, and by the use of properties of monotone systems. Illustrative simulations are provided.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamics in spiking neural networks: A systematic review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to review recent research on the collective behaviour of excitatory and inhibitory (E-I) spiking neural networks. The research methodology used is Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) procedures, comprising three primary stages: an initial search for literature in the SCOPUS database, a screening process based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, and a review of the selected literatures. Out of 491 documents from 2014 to 2024, 6 research papers are qualified for review. Four distinct dynamical states have been identified: synchrony, irregular behaviour, stationary state, and oscillatory dynamics. Our review findings suggest that the collective dynamics of E-I spiking neurons stem from the interaction of intrinsic neuronal characteristics, balance mechanisms, and the type of external stimuli. Additionally, the widespread use of Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neurons in the literature highlights its significance as a robust candidate for exploring collective behaviours in large-scale neuronal networks.</description>

      <title>Learning Macroscopic Dynamics from Partial Microscopic Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Macroscopic observables of a system are of keen interest in real applications such as the design of novel materials. Current methods rely on microscopic trajectory simulations, where the forces on all microscopic coordinates need to be computed or measured. However, this can be computationally prohibitive for realistic systems. In this paper, we propose a method to learn macroscopic dynamics requiring only force computations on a subset of the microscopic coordinates. Our method relies on a sparsity assumption: the force on each microscopic coordinate relies only on a small number of other coordinates. The main idea of our approach is to map the training procedure on the macroscopic coordinates back to the microscopic coordinates, on which partial force computations can be used as stochastic estimation to update model parameters. We provide a theoretical justification of this under suitable conditions. We demonstrate the accuracy, force computation efficiency, and robustness of our method on learning macroscopic closure models from a variety of microscopic systems, including those modeled by partial differential equations or molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

Abstract: We show that for $1$ separated subsets of $\R^{2}$, the natural Marstrand type slicing statements are false with the counting dimension that was used earlier by Moreira and Lima and variants of which were introduced earlier in different contexts. We construct a $1$ separated subset $E$ of the plane which has counting dimension $1$, while for a positive Lebesgue measure parameter set of tubes of width $1$, the intersection of the tube with the set $E$ has counting dimension $1$. This is in contrast to the behavior of such sets with the mass dimension where the slicing theorems hold true.</description>

Abstract: A classical problem in smooth dynamical systems is known as smooth realization problem. It asks if given a compact manifold $M$, one can construct a volume preserving diffeomorphism with prescribed ergodic properties. We study the decay of correlations for certain dynamical systems with non-uniformly hyperbolic attractors, which natural invariant measure is not the volume, but the SRB measure. The system $g$ that we consider is produced by applying the slow-down procedure to a uniformly hyperbolic diffeomorphism $f$ with an attractor. Under certain assumptions on the map $f$ and the slow-down neighborhood, we show that the map $g$ admits polynomial upper and lower bounds on correlations with respect to its SRB measure and the class of H\"older continuous potentials. Our results apply to the Smale-Williams solenoid, as well as its sufficiently small perturbations.</description>

      <title>Continuation of Periodic Orbits in Conservative Hybrid Dynamical Systems and its Application to Mechanical Systems with Impulsive Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06502v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In autonomous differential equations where a single first integral is present, periodic orbits are well-known to belong to one-parameter families, parameterized by the first integral's values. This paper shows that this characteristic extends to a broader class of conservative hybrid dynamical systems (cHDSs). We study periodic orbits of a cHDS, introducing the concept of a hybrid first integral to characterize conservation in these systems. Additionally, our work presents a methodology that utilizes numerical continuation methods to generate these periodic orbits, building upon the concept of normal periodic orbits introduced by Sepulchre and MacKay (1997). We specifically compare state-based and time-based implementations of an cHDS as an important application detail in generating periodic orbits. Furthermore, we showcase the continuation process using exemplary conservative mechanical systems with impulsive dynamics.</description>

      <title>Koopman-Based Learning of Infinitesimal Generators without Operator Logarithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Koopman operator has gained significant attention in recent years for its ability to verify evolutionary properties of continuous-time nonlinear systems by lifting state variables into an infinite-dimensional linear vector space. The challenge remains in providing estimations for transitional properties pertaining to the system's vector fields based on discrete-time observations. To retrieve such infinitesimal system transition information, leveraging the structure of Koopman operator learning, current literature focuses on developing techniques free of time derivatives through the use of the Koopman operator logarithm. However, the soundness of these methods has so far been demonstrated only for maintaining effectiveness within a restrictive function space, together with knowledge of the operator spectrum properties. To better adapt to the practical applications in learning and control of unknown systems, we propose a logarithm-free technique for learning the infinitesimal generator without disrupting the Koopman operator learning framework. This approach claims compatibility with other system verification tools using the same set of training data. We provide numerical examples to demonstrate its effectiveness in applications of system identification and stability prediction.</description>

      <title>A Power Tower Control: A New Sliding Mode Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A control based power tower function at order 2 is proposed in this paper. This leads to a new sliding mode control, which allows employing backstepping technique that combines both guaranteed and finite time convergence. The proposed control is applied to a double integrator subject to perturbation $d$. Both guaranteed and finite convergence are ensured by the controller when $d$ is considered constant and bounded, without knowing its upper bound. For the case, when $d$ is variable and bounded with its upper bound known, only a finite time convergence is obtained. Simulation results are given to show the well founded of the proposed novel control.</description>

      <title>Entropy bounds for Glass networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that chaotic Glass networks (a class of piecewise-linear Ordinary Differential Equations) are good candidates for the design of true random number generators. A Glass network design has the advantage of involving only standard Boolean logic gates. Furthermore, an already chaotic (deterministic) system combined with random ``jitter'' due to thermal noise can be used to generate random bit sequences in a more robust way than noisy limit-cycle oscillators. Since the goal is to generate bit sequences with as large a positive entropy as possible, it is desirable to have a theoretical method to assess the irregularity of a large class of networks. We develop a procedure here to calculate good upper bounds on the entropy of a Glass network, by means of symbolic representations of the continuous dynamics. Our method improves on a result by Farcot (2006), and allows in principle for an arbitrary level of precision by refinements of the estimate, and we show that in the limiting case, these estimates converge to the true entropy of the symbolic system corresponding to the continuous dynamics. As a check on the method, we demonstrate for an example network that our upper bound after only a few refinement steps is very close to the entropy estimated from a long numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Efficient pseudometrics for data-driven comparisons of nonlinear dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18681v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computationally efficient solutions for pseudometrics quantifying deviation from topological conjugacy between dynamical systems are presented. Deviation from conjugacy is quantified in a Pareto optimal sense that accounts for spectral properties of Koopman operators as well as trajectory geometry. Theoretical justification is provided for computing such pseudometrics in Koopman eigenfunction space rather than observable space. Furthermore, it is shown that theoretical consistency with topological conjugacy can be maintained when restricting the search for optimal transformations between systems to the unitary group. Therefore the pseudometrics are based on analytical solutions for unitary transformations in Koopman eigenfunction space. Geometric considerations for the deviation from conjugacy Pareto optimality problem are used to develop scalar pseudometrics that account for all possible optimal solutions given just two Pareto points. The approach is demonstrated on two example problems; the first being a simple benchmarking problem and the second an engineering example comparing the dynamics of morphological computation of biological nonlinear muscle actuators to simplified mad-made (including bioinspired) approaches. The benefits of considering operator and trajectory geometry based dissimilarity measures in a unified and consistent formalism is demonstrated. Overall, the deviation from conjugacy pseudometrics provide practical advantages in terms of efficiency and scalability, while maintaining theoretical consistency.</description>

      <title>Identifying Equivalent Training Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Study of the nonlinear evolution deep neural network (DNN) parameters undergo during training has uncovered regimes of distinct dynamical behavior. While a detailed understanding of these phenomena has the potential to advance improvements in training efficiency and robustness, the lack of methods for identifying when DNN models have equivalent dynamics limits the insight that can be gained from prior work. Topological conjugacy, a notion from dynamical systems theory, provides a precise definition of dynamical equivalence, offering a possible route to address this need. However, topological conjugacies have historically been challenging to compute. By leveraging advances in Koopman operator theory, we develop a framework for identifying conjugate and non-conjugate training dynamics. To validate our approach, we demonstrate that comparing Koopman eigenvalues can correctly identify a known equivalence between online mirror descent and online gradient descent. We then utilize our approach to: (a) identify non-conjugate training dynamics between shallow and wide fully connected neural networks; (b) characterize the early phase of training dynamics in convolutional neural networks; (c) uncover non-conjugate training dynamics in Transformers that do and do not undergo grokking. Our results, across a range of DNN architectures, illustrate the flexibility of our framework and highlight its potential for shedding new light on training dynamics.</description>

      <title>A dispersive effective equation for transverse propagation of planar shallow water waves over periodic bathymetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of shallow water waves propagating over bathymetry that varies periodically in one direction and is constant in the other. Plane waves traveling along the constant direction are known to evolve into solitary waves, due to an effective dispersion. We apply multiple-scale perturbation theory to derive an effective constant-coefficient system of Boussinesq-type equations that not only accurately describe these waves but also predict their full two-dimensional shape in some detail. Numerical experiments confirm the good agreement between the effective equations and the variable-bathymetry shallow water equations.</description>

      <title>Unconditional stability of a recurrent neural circuit implementing divisive normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stability in recurrent neural models poses a significant challenge, particularly in developing biologically plausible neurodynamical models that can be seamlessly trained. Traditional cortical circuit models are notoriously difficult to train due to expansive nonlinearities in the dynamical system, leading to an optimization problem with nonlinear stability constraints that are difficult to impose. Conversely, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) excel in tasks involving sequential data but lack biological plausibility and interpretability. In this work, we address these challenges by linking dynamic divisive normalization (DN) to the stability of ORGaNICs, a biologically plausible recurrent cortical circuit model that dynamically achieves DN and that has been shown to simulate a wide range of neurophysiological phenomena. By using the indirect method of Lyapunov, we prove the remarkable property of unconditional local stability for an arbitrary-dimensional ORGaNICs circuit when the recurrent weight matrix is the identity. We thus connect ORGaNICs to a system of coupled damped harmonic oscillators, which enables us to derive the circuit's energy function, providing a normative principle of what the circuit, and individual neurons, aim to accomplish. Further, for a generic recurrent weight matrix, we prove the stability of the 2D model and demonstrate empirically that stability holds in higher dimensions. Finally, we show that ORGaNICs can be trained by backpropagation through time without gradient clipping/scaling, thanks to its intrinsic stability property and adaptive time constants, which address the problems of exploding, vanishing, and oscillating gradients. By evaluating the model's performance on RNN benchmarks, we find that ORGaNICs outperform alternative neurodynamical models on static image classification tasks and perform comparably to LSTMs on sequential tasks.</description>

      <title>Rapidly Rotating Wall-Mode Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly rotating limit, we derive a balanced set of reduced equations governing the strongly nonlinear development of the convective wall-mode instability in the interior of a general container. The model illustrates that wall-mode convection is a multiscale phenomenon where the dynamics of the bulk interior diagnostically determine the small-scale dynamics within Stewartson boundary layers at the sidewalls. The sidewall boundary layers feedback on the interior via a nonlinear lateral heat-flux boundary condition, providing a closed system. Outside the asymptotically thin boundary layer, the convective modes connect to a dynamical interior that maintains scales set by the domain geometry. In many ways, the final system of equations resembles boundary-forced planetary geostrophic baroclinic dynamics coupled with barotropic quasi-geostrophic vorticity. The reduced system contains the results from previous linear instability theory but captured in an elementary fashion, providing a new avenue for investigating wall-mode convection in the strongly nonlinear regime. We also derive the dominant Ekman-flux correction to the onset Rayleigh number for large Taylor number, Ra ~ 31.8 Ta^(1/2) - 4.43 Ta^(5/12) for no-slip boundaries. We demonstrate some of the reduced model's nonlinear dynamics with numerical simulations in a cylindrical container.</description>

      <title>GoRINNs: Godunov-Riemann Informed Neural Networks for Learning Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present GoRINNs: numerical analysis-informed neural networks for the solution of inverse problems of non-linear systems of conservation laws. GoRINNs are based on high-resolution Godunov schemes for the solution of the Riemann problem in hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). In contrast to other existing machine learning methods that learn the numerical fluxes of conservative Finite Volume methods, GoRINNs learn the physical flux function per se. Due to their structure, GoRINNs provide interpretable, conservative schemes, that learn the solution operator on the basis of approximate Riemann solvers that satisfy the Rankine-Hugoniot condition. The performance of GoRINNs is assessed via four benchmark problems, namely the Burgers', the Shallow Water, the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards and the Payne-Whitham traffic flow models. The solution profiles of these PDEs exhibit shock waves, rarefactions and/or contact discontinuities at finite times. We demonstrate that GoRINNs provide a very high accuracy both in the smooth and discontinuous regions.</description>
