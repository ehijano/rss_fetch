      <title>Robustness of the 2-Choices Dynamics to Node Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many applications, it becomes necessary for a set of distributed network nodes to agree on a common value or opinion as quickly as possible and with minimal communication overhead. The classical 2-choices rule is a well-known distributed algorithm designed to achieve this goal. Under this rule, each node in a network updates its opinion at random instants by sampling two neighbours uniformly at random and then adopting the common opinion held by these neighbours if they agree. For a sufficiently well-connected network of $n$ nodes and two initial opinions, this simple rule results in the network being absorbed in a consensus state in $O(\log n)$ time (with high probability) and the consensus is obtained on the opinion held by the majority of nodes initially.
  In this paper, we study the robustness of this algorithm to node failures. In particular, we assume that with a constant probability $\alpha$, a node may fail to update according to the 2-choices rule and erroneously adopt any one of the two opinions uniformly at random. This is a strong form of failure under which the network can no longer be absorbed in a consensus state. However, we show that as long as the error probability $\alpha$ is less than a threshold value, the network is able to retain the majority support of the initially prevailing opinion for an exponentially long time ($\Omega(\poly(\exp(n)))$). In contrast, when the error probability is above a threshold value, we show that any opinion quickly ($O(\log n)$ time) loses its majority support and the network reaches a state where (nearly) an equal proportion of nodes support each opinion. We establish the above phase transition in the dynamics for both complete graphs and expander graphs with sufficiently large spectral gaps and sufficiently homogeneous degrees. Our analysis combines spectral graph theory with Markov chain mixing and hitting time analyses.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein-p Central Limit Theorem Rates: From Local Dependence to Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite-time central limit theorem (CLT) rates play a central role in modern machine learning (ML). In this paper, we study CLT rates for multivariate dependent data in Wasserstein-$p$ ($\mathcal W_p$) distance, for general $p\ge 1$. We focus on two fundamental dependence structures that commonly arise in ML: locally dependent sequences and geometrically ergodic Markov chains. In both settings, we establish the \textit{first optimal} $\mathcal O(n^{-1/2})$ rate in $\mathcal W_1$, as well as the first $\mathcal W_p$ ($p\ge 2$) CLT rates under mild moment assumptions, substantially improving the best previously known bounds in these dependent-data regimes. As an application of our optimal $\mathcal W_1$ rate for locally dependent sequences, we further obtain the first optimal $\mathcal W_1$--CLT rate for multivariate $U$-statistics.
  On the technical side, we derive a tractable auxiliary bound for $\mathcal W_1$ Gaussian approximation errors that is well suited to studying dependent data. For Markov chains, we further prove that the regeneration time of the split chain associated with a geometrically ergodic chain has a geometric tail without assuming strong aperiodicity or other restrictive conditions. These tools may be of independent interests and enable our optimal $\mathcal W_1$ rates and underpin our $\mathcal W_p$ ($p\ge 2$) results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish two-sided weighted integrability estimates, often referred to as a norm equivalence result, for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with locally Lipschitz coefficients. As a key ingredient in our approach, we also derive an SDE satisfied by the inverse stochastic flow under reduced regularity assumptions in the globally Lipschitz setting.</description>

      <title>Quantitative weak propagation of chaos for McKean--Vlasov branching diffusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study in this paper the weak propagation of chaos for McKean--Vlasov diffusions with branching, whose induced marginal measures are nonnegative finite measures but not necessary probability measures. The flow of marginal measures satisfies a non-linear Fokker--Planck equation, along which we provide a functional It\^o's formula. We then consider a functional of the terminal marginal measure of the branching process, whose conditional value is solution to a Kolmogorov backward master equation. By using It\^o's formula and based on the estimates of second-order linear and intrinsic functional derivatives of the value function, we finally derive a quantitative weak convergence rate for the empirical measures of the branching diffusion processes with finite population.</description>

      <title>A Sharp Universality Dichotomy for the Free Energy of Spherical Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the free energy for pure and mixed spherical $p$-spin models with i.i.d.\ disorder. In the mixed case, each $p$-interaction layer is assumed either to have regularly varying tails with exponent $\alpha_p$ or to satisfy a finite $2p$-th moment condition.
  For the pure spherical $p$-spin model with regularly varying disorder of tail index $\alpha$, we introduce a tail-adapted normalization that interpolates between the classical Gaussian scaling and the extreme-value scale, and we prove a sharp universality dichotomy for the quenched free energy. In the subcritical regime $\alpha&lt;2p$, the thermodynamics is driven by finitely many extremal couplings and the free energy converges to a non-degenerate random limit described by the NIM (non-intersecting monomial) model, depending only on extreme-order statistics. At the critical exponent $\alpha=2p$, we obtain a random one-dimensional TAP-type variational formula capturing the coexistence of an extremal spike and a universal Gaussian bulk on spherical slices. In the supercritical regime $\alpha&gt;2p$ (more generally, under a finite $2p$-th moment assumption), the free energy is universal and agrees with the deterministic Crisanti--Sommers/Parisi value of the corresponding Gaussian model, as established in [Sawhney-Sellke'24].
  We then extend the subcritical and critical results to mixed spherical models in which each $p$-layer is either heavy-tailed with $\alpha_p\le 2p$ or has finite $2p$-th moment. In particular, we derive a TAP-type variational representation for the mixed model, yielding a unified universality classification of the quenched free energy across tail exponents and mixtures.</description>

      <title>The Radial Spanning Tree is straight in all dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Radial Spanning Tree (RST) in dimension $d\geq2$ is a random geometric graph constructed on a homogeneous Poisson point process $\mathcal N$ in $\mathbb R^d$ augmented by the origin, with edges connecting each $x\in\mathcal N$ to the nearest point $y\in\mathcal N\cup\{0\}$ that lies closer to $0$ than $x$, with respect to the Euclidean distance. By construction, it forms almost surely a tree rooted at $0$. The RST was introduced in 2007 by Baccelli and Bordenave, who investigated straightness, a deterministic property introduced by Howard and Newman in 2001, to derive information about the asymptotic directions of infinite branches. They proved that the RST is almost surely straight in dimension $2$, which directly implies that all infinite branches are asymptotically directed, every possibility is attained, and directions reached by multiple infinite branches form a dense subset. However, their approach relies crucially on planarity, preventing any straightforward extension to higher dimensions. In this paper, we close this gap by proving that the RST is almost surely \emph{straight} in any dimension, thereby obtaining the same consequences for the behavior of infinite branches. Our approach resolves the key barriers in the study of the RST, notably those posed by the complex dependency structure combined with the radial nature of the model, and especially beyond the planar setting. It relies on tools developed for the analysis of the Directed Spanning Forest, a closely related model, including recent progress by the author in 2025. Specifically, a key contribution of this work is the construction of a suitable renewal-type decomposition of RST paths. Leveraging this decomposition together with classical concentration inequalities, we show that RST paths cannot deviate far from straight lines and derive straightness.</description>

      <title>Gamma Hedging without Rough Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how the robustness of gamma hedging can be understood without using rough-path theory. Instead, we use the concepts of $p^{th}$ variation along a partition sequence and Taylor's theorem directly, rather than defining an integral and proving a version of It\^o's lemma. The same approach allows classical results on delta-hedging to be proved without defining an integral and without the need to define the concept of self-financing in continuous time. We show that the approach can also be applied to barrier options and Asian options</description>

      <title>Upper moderate deviation probabilities for the maximum of a branching random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider $M_n$ the maximal position at generation $n$ of a supercritical branching random walk. A\"id\'ekon (2013) obtained and described the convergence in law, as time $n$ goes to infinity, of $M_n-m_n$, where $m_n$ is an explicit function. Equivalently, he identified the limit of $\mathbb{P}(M_n &gt; m_n + x)$, for any $x \in \mathbb{R}$. More recently, Luo (2025) gave an asymptotic equivalent for the upper large deviation probability, that is $\mathbb{P}(M_n &gt; m_n + xn)$, for $x &gt; 0$. In this work, we study an intermediate regime, called upper moderate deviation. We obtain, under close-to-optimal integrability conditions, an asymptotic equivalent for $\mathbb{P}(M_n &gt; m_n + x_n)$, where $x_n$ is such that $x_n \to \infty$ and $x_n = O(\sqrt{n})$. Our proof is based on a strategy due to Bramson, Ding, and Zeitouni (2016). As a byproduct, we obtain information about the typical behavior of particles contributing to such deviations. Finally, we apply our main result to show the convergence in law of the centered maximum of a two-speed branching random walk in the mean regime and describe its limit.</description>

      <title>Simple repair policies and decompositions for semi-coherent systems with simultaneous failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider semi-coherent binary systems that are subject to simultaneous failures of its components. These are systems whose components can be either working or failed; the system can also be working or failed depending on the state of the components; and repairing a component cannot cause the system to fail. We consider that one or more components can fail simultaneously, allowing us to model external shocks and disasters. For this, we use the L\'evy-frailty Marshall-Olkin (LFMO) multivariate distribution to model the failure times of the components. We aim to answer in which states of the system we should repair the components. This is a challenging question, as the number of repair policies grows super-exponentially in the number of components. To tackle this, we propose a simple family of repair policies, which we call $r$-out-of-$n$:R repair policies, where one repairs all failed components when the system fails or when there are $r$ or more failed components. Our main contribution is that we derive exact and simple expressions for key performance-evaluation quantities of the system operating under our proposed repair policies. That is, we give explicit expressions for the mean time-to-failure of the system, mean time-to-repair, probability of system-failure before repair, and component- and system-repair rate. We also give expressions for the expected cost and long-term average cost, when there are components' and system repair cost. The only relevant parameters involved in the derived expressions are the structural signature of the system, and the Laplace exponent associated to the LFMO distribution.</description>

      <title>Short-time statistics of extinction and blowup in reaction kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04924v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the statistics of extinction and blowup times in well-mixed systems of stochastically reacting particles. We focus on the short-time tail, $T \to 0$, of the extinction- or blowup-time distribution $\mathcal{P}_m(T)$, where $m$ is the number of particles at $t=0$. This tail often exhibits an essential singularity at $T=0$, and we show that the singularity is captured by a time-dependent WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation applied directly to the master equation. This approximation, however, leaves undetermined a large pre-exponential factor. Here we show how to calculate this factor by applying a leading- and a subleading-order WKB approximation to the Laplace-transformed backward master equation. Accurate asymptotic results can be obtained when this WKB solution can be matched to another approximate solution (the ``inner" solution), valid for not too large $m$. We demonstrate and verify this method on three examples of reactions which are also solvable without approximations.</description>

      <title>Level 2.5 large deviations and uncertainty relations for non-Markov self-interacting dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the general problem of formulating the dynamical large deviations of non-Markovian systems in a closed form. Specifically, we consider a broad class of ``self-interacting'' jump processes whose dynamics depends on the past through a functional of a state-dependent empirical observable. Exploiting a natural separation of timescales, we obtain the exact (so-called ``level 2.5'') large deviation joint statistics of the empirical measure over configurations and of the empirical flux of transitions. As an application of this general framework, we derive explicit general bounds on the fluctuations of trajectory observables, generalising to the non-Markovian case both thermodynamic and kinetic uncertainty relations. We illustrate our theory with simple examples, and discuss potential applications of these results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, sharp matrix concentration inequalities~\cite{BBvH23,BvH24} were developed using the theory of free probability. In this work, we design polynomial time deterministic algorithms to construct outcomes that satisfy the guarantees of these inequalities. As direct consequences, we obtain polynomial time deterministic algorithms for the matrix Spencer problem~\cite{BJM23} and for constructing near-Ramanujan graphs. Our proofs show that the concepts and techniques in free probability are useful not only for mathematical analyses but also for efficient computations.</description>

      <title>Kantorovich Distance via Spanning Trees: Properties and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study optimal transport between probability measures supported on the same finite metric space, where the ground cost is a distance induced by a weighted connected graph. Building on recent work showing that the resulting Kantorovich distance can be expressed as a minimization problem over the set of spanning trees of this underlying graph, we investigate the implications of this reformulation on the construction of an optimal transport plan and a dual potential based on the solution of such an optimization problem. In this setting, we derive an explicit formula for the Kantorovich potential in terms of the imbalanced cumulative mass (a generalization of the cumulative distribution in R) along an optimal spanning tree solving such a minimization problem, under a weak non-degeneracy condition on the pair of measures that guarantees the uniqueness of a dual potential. Our second contribution establishes the existence of an optimal transport plan that can be computed efficiently by a dynamic programming procedure once an optimal spanning tree is known. Finally, we propose a stochastic algorithm based on simulated annealing on the space of spanning trees to compute such an optimal spanning tree. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results and demonstrate the practical relevance of the proposed approach for optimal transport on finite metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Sampling via Stochastic Interpolants by Langevin-based Velocity and Initialization Estimation in Flow ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for sampling from unnormalized Boltzmann densities based on a probability-flow ordinary differential equation (ODE) derived from linear stochastic interpolants. The key innovation of our approach is the use of a sequence of Langevin samplers to enable efficient simulation of the flow. Specifically, these Langevin samplers are employed (i) to generate samples from the interpolant distribution at intermediate times and (ii) to construct, starting from these intermediate times, a robust estimator of the velocity field governing the flow ODE. For both applications of the Langevin diffusions, we establish convergence guarantees. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method on challenging multimodal distributions across a range of dimensions, as well as its effectiveness in Bayesian inference tasks.</description>

      <title>Beta-coalescents when sample size is large</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sweepstakes reproduction refers to a highly skewed individual recruitment success without involving natural selection and may apply to individuals in broadcast spawning populations characterised by Type III survivorship. We consider an extension of the model of sweepstakes reproduction for a haploid panmictic population of constant size $N$; the extension also works as an alternative to the Wright-Fisher model. Our model incorporates an upper bound on the random number of potential offspring (juveniles) produced by a given individual. Depending on how the bound behaves relative to the total population size, we obtain the Kingman coalescent, an incomplete Beta-coalescent, or the (complete) Beta-coalescent. We argue that applying such an upper bound is biologically reasonable. Moreover, we estimate the error of the coalescent approximation. The error estimates reveal that convergence can be slow, and small sample size can be sufficient to invalidate convergence, for example if the stated bound is of the form $N/\log N$. We use simulations to investigate the effect of increasing sample size on the site-frequency spectrum. When the limit is a Beta-coalescent, the site frequency spectrum will be as predicted by the limiting tree even though the full coalescent tree may deviate from the limiting one. When in the domain of attraction of the Kingman coalescent the effect of increasing sample size depends on the effective population size as has been noted in the case of the Wright-Fisher model. Conditioning on the population ancestry (the random ancestral relations of the entire population at all times) may have little effect on the site-frequency spectrum for the models considered here (as evidenced by simulation results).</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of the Ising free energy on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ferromagnetic Ising model on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $\mathbb{G}(n,m)$ with bounded average degree $d=2m/n$. Specifically, we determine the limiting distribution of $\log Z_{\mathbb{G}(n,m)}(\beta,B)$, where $Z_{\mathbb{G}(n,m)}(\beta,B)$ is the partition function at inverse temperature $\beta&gt;0$ and external field $B\geq0$.
  If either $B&gt;0$, or $B=0$, $d&gt;1$ and $\beta&gt;\operatorname{ath}(1/d)$ the limiting distribution is a Gaussian whose variance is of order $\Theta(n)$ and is described by a family of stochastic fixed point problems that encode the root magnetisation of two correlated Galton-Watson trees. By contrast, if $B=0$ and either $d\leq1$ or $\beta&lt;\operatorname{ath}(1/d)$ the limiting distribution is an infinite sum of independent random variables and has bounded variance.</description>

      <title>Differentiating through Stochastic Differential Equations: A Primer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems are essential to model various phenomena in physics, finance, economics, and are also of current interest in machine learning. A central modeling task is investigating parameter sensitivity, whether tuning atmospheric coefficients, computing financial Greeks, or optimizing neural networks. These sensitivities are mathematically expressed as derivatives of an objective function with respect to parameters of interest and are rarely available analytically, necessitating numerical methods for approximating them. While the literature for differentiation of deterministic systems is well-covered, the treatment of stochastic systems, such as stochastic differential equations (SDEs), in most curricula is less comprehensive than the subtleties arising from the interplay of noise and discretization require.
  This paper provides a primer on numerical differentiation of SDEs organized as a two-tale narrative. Tale 1 demonstrates differentiating through discretized SDEs, known the discretize-optimize approach, is reliable for both It\^{o} and Stratonovich calculus. Tale 2 examines the optimize-discretize approach, investigating the continuous limit of backward equations from Tale 1 corresponding to the desired gradients. Our aim is to equip readers with a clear guide on the numerical differentiation of SDEs: computing gradients correctly in both It\^{o} and Stratonovich settings, understanding when discretize-optimize and optimize-discretize agree or diverge, and developing intuition for reasoning about stochastic differentiation beyond the cases explicitly covered.</description>

      <title>Stochastic search with space-dependent diffusivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The canonical model of stochastic search tracks a randomly diffusing "searcher" until it finds a "target." Owing to its many applications across science and engineering, this perennially popular problem has been thoroughly investigated in a variety of models. However, aside from some exactly solvable one-dimensional examples, very little is known if the searcher diffusivity varies in space. For such space-dependent or "heterogeneous" diffusion, one must specify the interpretation of the multiplicative noise, which is termed the It\^{o}-Stratonovich dilemma. In this paper, we investigate how stochastic search with space-dependent diffusivity depends on this interpretation. We obtain general formulas for the probability distribution and all the moments of the stochastic search time and the so-called splitting probabilities assuming that the targets are small or weakly reactive. These asymptotic results are valid for general space-dependent diffusivities in general domains in any space dimension with targets of general shape which may be in the interior or on the boundary of the domain. We illustrate our theory with stochastic simulations. Our analysis predicts that stochastic search can depend strongly and counterintuitively on the multiplicative noise interpretation.</description>

      <title>Majority-Logic Decoding of Binary Locally Recoverable Codes: A Probabilistic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Locally repairable codes (LRCs) were originally introduced to enable efficient recovery from erasures in distributed storage systems by accessing only a small number of other symbols. While their structural properties-such as bounds and constructions-have been extensively studied, the performance of LRCs under random erasures and errors has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we study the error- and erasure-correction performance of binary linear LRCs under majority-logic decoding (MLD). Focusing on LRCs with fixed locality and varying availability, we derive explicit upper bounds on the probability of decoding failure over the memoryless Binary Erasure Channel (BEC) and Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). Our analysis characterizes the behavior of the bit-error rate (BER) and block-error rate (BLER) as functions of the locality and availability parameters. We show that, under mild growth conditions on the availability, the block decoding failure probability vanishes asymptotically, and that majority-logic decoding can successfully correct virtually all of error and erasure patterns of weight linear in the blocklength. The results reveal a substantial gap between worst-case guarantees and typical performance under stochastic channel models.</description>

      <title>On the free energy of vector spin glasses with non-convex interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The limit free energy of spin-glass models with convex interactions can be represented as a variational problem involving an explicit functional. Models with non-convex interactions are much less well-understood, and simple variational formulas involving the same functional are known to be invalid in general. We show here that a slightly weaker property of the limit free energy does extend to non-convex models. Indeed, under the assumption that the limit free energy exists, we show that this limit can always be represented as a critical value of the said functional. Up to a small perturbation of the parameters defining the model, we also show that any subsequential limit of the law of the overlap matrix is a critical point of this functional. We believe that these results capture the fundamental conclusions of the non-rigorous replica method.</description>

Abstract: We prove dynamical local limits for the singular numbers of $p$-adic random matrix products at both the bulk and edge. The limit object which we construct, the reflecting Poisson sea, may thus be viewed as a $p$-adic analogue of line ensembles appearing in classical random matrix theory. However, in contrast to those it is a discrete space Poisson-type particle system with only local reflection interactions and no obvious determinantal structure. The limits hold for any $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z}_p)$-invariant matrix distributions under weak universality hypotheses, with no spatial rescaling.</description>

      <title>Exponential twist of probability measures: drift correction in term of a generalized gradient. Complete version</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the exponential twist, i.e. a path-integral exponential change of measure, of a Markovian reference probability measure $\P$. This type of transformation naturally appears in variational representation formulae originating from the theory of large deviations and can be interpreted in some cases, as the solution of a specific stochastic control problem. Under a very general Markovian assumption on $\P$, we fully characterize the exponential twist probability measure as the solution of a martingale problem and prove that it inherits the Markov property of the reference measure. The ''generator'' of the martingale problem shows a drift depending on a {\it generalized gradient} of some suitable {\it value function} $v$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider uniformly random strictly upper-triangular matrices in $\operatorname{Mat}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$. For such a matrix $A_n$, we show that $n-\operatorname{rank}(A_n) \approx \log_q n$ as $n \to \infty$, and find that the fluctuations around this limit are finite-order and given by explicit $\mathbb{Z}$-valued random variables. More generally, we consider the random partition whose parts are the sizes of the nilpotent Jordan blocks of $A_n$: its $k$ largest parts (rows) were previously shown by Borodin to have jointly Gaussian fluctuations as $N \to \infty$, and its columns correspond to differences $\operatorname{rank}(A_n^{i-1}) - \operatorname{rank}(A_n^i)$. We show the fluctuations of the columns converge jointly to a discrete random point configuration $\mathcal{L}_{t,\chi}$ introduced in arXiv:2310.12275. The proofs use an explicit integral formula for the probabilities at finite $N$, obtained by de-Poissonizing a corresponding one in arXiv:2310.12275, which is amenable to asymptotic analysis.</description>

      <title>The Mixed Birth-death/death-Birth Moran Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study evolutionary dynamics on graphs in which each step consists of one birth and one death, also known as the Moran processes. There are two types of individuals: residents with fitness $1$ and mutants with fitness $r$. Two standard update rules are used in the literature. In Birth-death (Bd), a vertex is chosen to reproduce proportional to fitness, and one of its neighbors is selected uniformly at random to be replaced by the offspring. In death-Birth (dB), a vertex is chosen uniformly to die, and then one of its neighbors is chosen, proportional to fitness, to place an offspring into the vacancy. We formalize and study a unified model, the $\lambda$-mixed Moran process, in which each step is independently a Bd step with probability $\lambda \in [0,1]$ and a dB step otherwise. We analyze this mixed process for undirected, connected graphs. As an interesting special case, we show at $\lambda=1/2$, for any graph that the fixation probability when $r=1$ with a single mutant initially on the graph is exactly $1/n$, and also at $\lambda=1/2$ that the absorption time for any $r$ is $O_r(n^4)$. We also show results for graphs that are "almost regular," in a manner defined in the paper. We use this to show that for suitable random graphs from $G \sim G(n,p)$ and fixed $r&gt;1$, with high probability over the choice of graph, the absorption time is $O_r(n^4)$, the fixation probability is $\Omega_r(n^{-2})$, and we can approximate the fixation probability in polynomial time. Another special case is when the graph has only two distinct degree values $\{d_1, d_2\}$ with $d_1 \leq d_2$. For those graphs, we give exact formulas for fixation probabilities when $r = 1$ and any $\lambda$, and establish an absorption time of $O_r(n^4 \alpha^4)$ for all $\lambda$, where $\alpha = d_2 / d_1$. We also provide explicit formulas for the star and cycle under any $r$ or $\lambda$.</description>

Abstract: This work extends the studies on the minimum and extremal process of a supercritical branching random walk outside the boundary case which cannot be reduced to the boundary case. We study here the situation where the log-generating function explodes at $1$ and the random walk associated to the spine possesses a stretched exponential tail with exponent $b\in(0,\frac12)$. Under suitable conditions, we confirm the conjecture of Barral, Hu and Madaule [Bernoulli 24(2) 2018 801-841], and obtain the weak convergence for the minimum and the extremal process. We also establish an a.s. infimum result over all infinity rays of this system.</description>

Abstract: We show almost sure wellposedness of mild solution to the cubic nonlinear wave equation in a weighted Besov space over $\mathbb R^2$. To achieve this, we show that any weak limit of $\phi^4$ measures on increasing tori is invariant under the equation. We review and slightly simplify the periodic theory and the construction of the weak limit measure, and then use finite speed of propagation to reduce the infinite-volume case to the previous setup. Our argument also gives a weaker invariance result on the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in the same setting.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Sawin and Wood (arXiv:math/2210.06279) proved a formula for the distribution of a random abelian group $G$ in terms of its $H$-moments $\mathbb{E} [\#\operatorname{Sur}(G,H)]$. We show that properties of Macdonald polynomials yield an alternate proof.</description>

      <title>Berry-Esseen theorems for the asymptotic normality of incomplete U-statistics with Bernoulli sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05394v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a resurgence of interest in incomplete U-statistics that only sum over a subset of kernel evaluations, due to their computational efficiency and asymptotic normality which can be leveraged to quantify the uncertainty of ensemble predictions in machine learning. In this paper, we study the weak convergences to normality of one such construction, the incomplete U-statistic with Bernoulli sampling, under three different regimes on the relative sizes of the raw sample and the computational budget. Under minimalistic moment assumptions, we establish accompanying Berry-Esseen bounds with the natural rates that characterize the accuracy of these normal approximations. The key ingredients in our proofs include a variable censoring technique and a methodology for establishing Berry-Esseen bounds for the so-called Studentized nonlinear statistics recently formalized in the Stein's method literature, as well as an exponential lower tail bound for non-negative kernel U-statistics.</description>

      <title>Sequential Eigenvalue Statistics for Change-Point Detection in Covariance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Testing for change points in sequences of covariance matrices is an important and equally challenging problem in statistical methodology with applications in various fields. Motivated by the observation that even in cases where the ratio between dimension and sample size is as small as $0.05$, tests based on a fixed-dimension asymptotics do not keep their preassigned level, we propose to derive critical values of test statistics using an asymptotic regime where the dimension diverges at the same rate as the sample size.
  This paper introduces a novel and well-founded statistical methodology for detecting change points in a sequence of moderately dimensional covariance matrices. Our approach utilizes a min-type statistic based on a sequential process of likelihood ratio statistics. This is used to construct a test for the hypothesis of the existence of a change point with a corresponding estimator for its location. We provide theoretical guarantees by thoroughly analyzing the asymptotic properties of the sequential process of likelihood ratio statistics. In particular, we prove weak convergence towards a Gaussian process under the null hypothesis of no change. To identify the challenging dependency structure between consecutive test statistics, we employ tools from random matrix theory and stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>On the phase diagram of the multiscale mean-field spin-glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the phase diagram of a Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model where the couplings are forced to thermalize at different time scales. Besides being a challenging generalization of the SK model, such settings may arise naturally in physics whenever part of the many degrees of freedom of a system relaxes to equilibrium considerably faster than the others. For this model we compute the asymptotic value of the second moment of the overlap distribution. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous sufficient condition for an annealed solution to hold, identifying a high temperature, or weak coupling, region. In addition, we also prove that for sufficiently strong couplings the solution must present a number of replica symmetry breaking levels at least equal to the number of time scales already present in the multiscale model. Finally, we give a sufficient condition for the existence of gaps in the support of the functional order parameters.</description>

      <title>Groups with pairings, Hall modules, and Hall-Littlewood polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We relate the combinatorics of Hall-Littlewood polynomials to that of abelian $p$-groups with alternating or Hermitian perfect pairings. Our main result is an analogue of the classical relationship between the Hall algebra of abelian $p$-groups (without pairings) and Hall-Littlewood polynomials. Specifically, we define a module over the classical Hall algebra with basis indexed by groups with pairings, and explicitly relate its structure constants to Hall-Littlewood polynomials at different values of the parameter $t$. We also show certain expectation formulas with respect to Cohen-Lenstra type measures on groups with pairings. In the alternating case this gives a new and simpler proof of previous results of Delaunay-Jouhet.</description>

      <title>A new measure of dependence: Integrated $R^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18146v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel measure of dependence that captures the extent to which a random variable $Y$ is determined by a random vector $X$. The measure equals zero precisely when $Y$ and $X$ are independent, and it attains one exactly when $Y$ is almost surely a measurable function of $X$. We further extend this framework to define a measure of conditional dependence between $Y$ and $X$ given $Z$. We propose a simple and interpretable estimator with computational complexity comparable to classical correlation coefficients, including those of Pearson, Spearman, and Chatterjee. Leveraging this dependence measure, we develop a tuning-free, model-agnostic variable selection procedure and establish its consistency under appropriate sparsity conditions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets highlight the strong empirical performance of our methodology and demonstrate substantial gains over existing approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the divergence of Kleinian groups $\Gamma$ and the recurrence of simple random walks on the Schreier graph associated with $\Gamma$. In particular, we show that if $\Gamma$ is a subgroup of a lattice and is of divergence type, then the Schreier graph is recurrent. Our approach builds connections among the growth rate of the $\Gamma$-orbit, the volume growth rate of the quotient manifolds, and the growth rate of the Schreier graph. Using the connections, we construct abundant Kleinian groups of divergence type.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic Properties of Several Generalized-Constant Sequences, with Implications for $\Gamma^{\left(n\right)}\left(1\right)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01849v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $\gamma=0.577215...$, nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, $\delta=0.596347...$, is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that at least one of them is transcendental. The two constants are related by a well-known equation of Hardy, equivalent to $\gamma+\delta/e=\mathrm{Ein}(1)$, which recently has been generalized to $\gamma^{(n)}+\delta^{(n)}/e=\eta^{(n)}$, $n\ge0$ for sequences of constants $\gamma^{(n)}$, $\delta^{(n)}$, and $\eta^{(n)}$ (given respectively by raw, conditional, and partial moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution). Investigating the $\gamma^{(n)}$ through recurrence relations (where $\gamma^{(0)}=1$ and $\gamma^{(1)}=\gamma$), we find that at least one of the pair {$\gamma,\gamma^{(2)}$} and at least two of each set {$\gamma,\gamma^{(n)},\gamma^{(n+1)},\ldots,\gamma^{(2n)}$}, for $2\leq n\leq26$, are transcendental, with analogous results for the sequence $\Gamma^{(n)}(1)=\left(-1\right)^{n}\gamma^{\left(n\right)}$. We then show, via a theorem of Shidlovskii, that the $\eta^{(n)}$ are algebraically independent, and therefore transcendental, for all $n\ge0$, implying that at least one of each pair, {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}/e$} and {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}$}, and at least two of the triple {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}/e,\delta^{(n)}$}, are transcendental for all $n\ge1$. Further analysis of the $\gamma^{(n)}$ and $\eta^{(n)}$ reveals that the values $\delta^{(n)}/e$ are transcendental infinitely often with positive asymptotic density. Finally, we provide parallel results for the sequences $\tilde{\delta}^{(n)}$ and $\tilde{\eta}^{(n)}$ satisfying the "non-alternating analogue" equation $\gamma^{(n)}+\tilde{\delta}^{(n)}/e=\tilde{\eta}^{(n)}$.</description>

      <title>Uniform measure attractors of the distribution-dependent 2D stochastic Navier-Stokes equations driven by nonlinear noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the uniform measure attractors of the distribution-dependent nonautonomous 2D stochastic Navier-Stokes equations driven by nonlinear noise and subject to almost periodic external forcing. Owing to the distribution-dependent structure and the almost periodicity of the external forcing, the resulting solution process becomes an inhomogeneous Markov process, presenting significant analytical challenges. To overcome these difficulties, we propose sufficient conditions on the time-dependent external forcing and distribution-dependent nonlinear terms, and develop novel analytical estimates. As a result, we establish the existence and uniqueness of uniform measure attractors for the system. Notably, the joint continuity of the family of processes is achieved without relying on the Feller property of $\{P^{(g,h)}{(\tau,t)}\}_{\tau\leq t}$.</description>
