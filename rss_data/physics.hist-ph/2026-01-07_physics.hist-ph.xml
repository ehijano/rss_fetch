      <title>How Alice, long before her time, derived the principles of quantum mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This philosophical dialogue explores the idea that the foundational principles of quantum mechanics need not be interpreted as describing a new physics, but may instead arise from the logical necessity of formalising the act of measurement within a coherent algebraic framework. By pushing this perspective to its extreme, the dialogue argues that the core structures of quantum mechanics can be derived independently of any specifically quantum properties of atomic particles, and can be formulated within an otherwise classical theory once limitations of observability and measurement context are taken seriously.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Causation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assembly theory (AT) introduces a concept of causation as a material property, constitutive of a metrology of evolution and selection. The physical scale for causation is quantified with the assembly index, defined as the minimum number of steps necessary for a distinguishable object to exist, where steps are assembled recursively. Observing countable copies of high assembly index objects indicates that a mechanism to produce them is persistent, such that the object's environment builds a memory that traps causation within a contingent chain. Copy number and assembly index underlie the standardized metrology for detecting causation (assembly index), and evidence of contingency (copy number). Together, these allow the precise definition of a selective threshold in assembly space, understood as the set of all causal possibilities. This threshold demarcates life (and its derivative agential, intelligent and technological forms) as structures with persistent copies beyond the threshold. In introducing a fundamental concept of material causation to explain and measure life, AT represents a departure from prior theories of causation, such as interventional ones, which have so far proven incompatible with fundamental physics. We discuss how AT's concept of causation provides the foundation for a theory of physics where novelty, contingency and the potential for open-endedness are fundamental, and determinism is emergent along assembled lineages.</description>
