      <title>High-Fidelity Optical Monitoring of Laser Powder Bed Fusion via Aperture Division Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qualification of high-performance metal components produced by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) must identify process-induced porous defects that reduce ductility and nucleate fatigue cracking. Detecting such defects via optical monitoring of LPBF provides a path towards in-process quality control without downstream testing such as by computed tomography. However, integration of in-process sensing with LPBF is hampered by geometric and optical complications and, as a result, it has yet to be proven that the finest pores that limit component fatigue life can be resolved via in situ data. We present aperture division multiplexing (ADM) as a method for simultaneously focusing the process laser and providing unobstructed optical access for high-fidelity process monitoring using a common optic. Construction of an ADM optic of achieving imaging at 50 micron spatial resolution in the mid-wave infrared is described, and this optic is demonstrated on a production-representative LPBF testbed. High-speed infrared video data are correlated to micro-CT measurement of pores as fine as 4.3 microns, through multiple process signatures, establishing the promise of ADM for qualification of LPBF component fatigue performance.</description>

      <title>SimPhony: A Device-Circuit-Architecture Cross-Layer Modeling and Simulation Framework for Heterogeneous Electronic-Photonic AI System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic-photonic integrated circuits (EPICs) offer transformative potential for next-generation high-performance AI but require interdisciplinary advances across devices, circuits, architecture, and design automation. The complexity of hybrid systems makes it challenging even for domain experts to understand distinct behaviors and interactions across design stack. The lack of a flexible, accurate, fast, and easy-to-use EPIC AI system simulation framework significantly limits the exploration of hardware innovations and system evaluations on common benchmarks. To address this gap, we propose SimPhony, a cross-layer modeling and simulation framework for heterogeneous electronic-photonic AI systems. SimPhony offers a platform that enables (1) generic, extensible hardware topology representation that supports heterogeneous multi-core architectures with diverse photonic tensor core designs; (2) optics-specific dataflow modeling with unique multi-dimensional parallelism and reuse beyond spatial/temporal dimensions; (3) data-aware energy modeling with realistic device responses, layout-aware area estimation, link budget analysis, and bandwidth-adaptive memory modeling; and (4) seamless integration with model training framework for hardware/software co-simulation. By providing a unified, versatile, and high-fidelity simulation platform, SimPhony enables researchers to innovate and evaluate EPIC AI hardware across multiple domains, facilitating the next leap in emerging AI hardware. We open-source our codes at https://github.com/ScopeX-ASU/SimPhony</description>

      <title>3D-architected gratings for polarization-sensitive, nature-inspired structural color</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural coloration, a color-generation mechanism often found in nature, arises from light-matter interactions such as diffraction, interference and scattering, with micro- and nanostructured elements. Herein, we systematically study anisotropic, 3D-architected grating structures with polarization-tunable optical properties, inspired by the vivid blue of Morpho butterfly wings. Using two-photon lithography, we fabricate multilayered gratings, varying parameters such as height (through scanning speed and laser power), periodicity, and number of layers. In transmission, significant color transitions from blue to brown were identified when varying structural parameters and incident light polarization conditions (azimuthal angle and ellipticity). Based on thin film diffraction efficiency theory in the Raman-Nath regime, optical characterization results are analytically explained, evaluating the impact of each parameter variation. Overall, these findings contribute to technological implementations of polarization-sensitive, 3D-architected gratings for structural color applications.</description>

      <title>Generating optical angular momentum through wavefront curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in the understanding of optical angular momentum have resulted in many demonstrations of unusual optical phenomena, such as optical beams with orbital angular momentum and transverse spinning light. Here we detail novel contributions to spin and orbital angular momentum generated by the gradient of wavefront curvature that becomes relevant in strongly focused beams of light. While circularly polarized beams are shown to develop helicity-dependent transverse spin, a linearly polarized Gaussian beam produces longitudinal spin and orbital angular momenta in the focal region, even if lacking both of these before focusing. Analytical treatment of a nonparaxial electromagnetic field, validated with vectorial diffraction modelling, shows that the terms related to higher orders of a paraxial parameter are responsible for the appearance of non-trivial angular momenta. The obtained dependences relate these quantities to the gradient of the wavefront curvature, showing how it can be used as a novel degree of freedom for applications in optical manipulation and light-matter interactions at subwavelength scales, enabling angular momentum transfer even from a simple Gaussian beam with linear polarization.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Supersonic Jet and Shock Wave with High-Resolution Quantitative Schlieren Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced optical configuration for a single-pass quantitative Schlieren imaging system that achieves an optical resolution of approximately 4.6 micrometers. The modified setup decouples sensitivity from resolution, enabling independent optimization of these critical parameters. Using this high-resolution system, we conduct quantitative analyses of supersonic jets emitted from sub-millimeter nozzles into the atmosphere and investigate shock waves induced by knife blades interacting with these jets in a vacuum environment. The fine resolution allows for detailed visualization of shock wave structures and accurate measurement of density gradients. We demonstrate the system's effectiveness by examining the density gradient profile along the shock diamonds and mapping density profiles across shock waves. These density profiles are analyzed for their relevance in laser-plasma applications, including laser wakefield acceleration and the Analog Black Hole Evaporation via Laser (AnaBHEL) experiment. Our findings indicate that this system can help determine key parameters such as peak density, plateau length, and shock wave thickness-essential for optimizing electron acceleration and achieving specific plasma density profiles. This high-resolution quantitative Schlieren imaging technique thus serves as a valuable tool for exploring complex fluid dynamics and supporting advancements in laser-plasma physics research.</description>

      <title>Low-Contrast BIC Metasurfaces with Quality Factors Exceeding 100,000</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric metasurfaces operating at quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBICs) can achieve exceptionally high radiative quality ($\textit{Q}$) factors by introducing small asymmetries into their unit cells. However, fabrication imperfections often impose major limitations on the experimentally observed $\textit{Q}$ factors. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate BIC metasurfaces with a record-high $\textit{Q}$ factor of 101,486 under normal excitation of light in the telecom wavelength range achieved by employing low-contrast silicon pairs. Our findings show that such ultrahigh-$\textit{Q}$ factors can be attained by leveraging both the high radiative $\textit{Q}$ factors of higher-order qBIC modes and reduced scattering losses in shallow-etched designs. Additionally, we demonstrate stable sub-picometer-level wavelength fluctuations in water, with a limit of detection of $10^{-5}$ for environmental refractive index changes. The proposed approach can be extended to BIC metasurfaces with many other configurations and operating wavelengths for ultrahigh-$\textit{Q}$ applications in both fundamental physics and advanced devices.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of the Spin-Hall effect of tightly focused linearly polarized light through a stratified medium in optical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical Spin-Hall effect originates from the interaction between the spin angular momentum (SAM) and extrinsic orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, leading to mutual interrelations between the polarization and trajectory of light in case of non-paraxial fields. Here, we extensively study the SHE and the resultant Spin-Hall shifts (SHS) in optical tweezers (OT) by varying the numerical aperture of objective lenses, and the refractive index (RI) stratification of the trapping medium. Indeed, we obtain much larger values of the SHS for particular combinations of NA and stratification compared to the sub-wavelength orders typically reported. We also observe that the longitudinal component of the spin angular momentum (SAM) density - which is responsible for the spin of birefringent particles in optical tweezers - changes more-or-less monotonically with the lens numerical aperture, except around values of the latter where the angle subtended by the focused light equals the critical angle for a particular RI interface. Our results may find applications in designing experiments for tuning the SHS and SAM induced due to SOI to generate exotic optomechanics of trapped particles in optical tweezers.</description>

      <title>Inverse-Designed Tapers for Compact Conversion Between Single-Mode and Wide Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waveguide tapers are critical components for leveraging the benefits of both single-mode and wide waveguides. Adiabatic tapers are typically hundreds of microns in length, dramatically limiting density and scalability. We reenvision the taper design process in an inverse-design paradigm, introducing the novel L-taper. We present a novel approach to inverse-designed tapers where the input and output waveguides are rotated 90 degrees with respect to each other. The resultant design has an order-of-magnitude smaller footprint, and the design process is compatible with a variety of fabrication processes. We demonstrate an L-taper designed on 220 nm silicon-on-insulator that converts a 0.5 micron waveguide to a 12 micron waveguide with -0.38 dB transmission and 40 nm 1-dB bandwidth. The footprint is 16 micron by 6 micron, representing a 12x smaller footprint than a linear taper with the same transmission.</description>

      <title>Platinum Black for stray-light mitigation on high-aspect-ratio micromechanical cantilever</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscopic devices are widely used in optomechanical experiments at the cutting-edge of precision experimental physics. Such devices often need to have high electrical conductivity but low reflectivity at optical wavelengths, which can be competing requirements for many commonly available coatings. In this manuscript, we present a technique to electroplate platinum with a highly convoluted surface on a $475\,\mathrm{\mu m } \, \times 500\,\mathrm{\mu m } \, \times 10\,\mathrm{\mu m }$ Silicon/Gold cantilever, preserving its electrical conductivity but reducing its reflectivity in the $0.3 - 1\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ range by a factor of $100$ or greater. The fact that the deposition can be done post-fabrication without damaging delicate structures makes this technique of interest to a potentially large range of experimental applications.</description>

      <title>Engineering spectro-temporal light states with physics-trained deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency synthesis and spectro-temporal control of optical wave packets are central to ultrafast science, with supercontinuum (SC) generation standing as one remarkable example. Through passive manipulation, femtosecond (fs) pulses from nJ-level lasers can be transformed into octave-spanning spectra, supporting few-cycle pulse outputs when coupled with external pulse compressors. While strategies such as machine learning have been applied to control the SC's central wavelength and bandwidth, their success has been limited by the nonlinearities and strong sensitivity to measurement noise. Here, we propose and demonstrate how a physics-trained convolutional neural network (P-CNN) can circumvent such challenges, showing few-fold speedups over the direct approaches. We highlight three key advancements enabled by the P-CNN approach: (i) on-demand control over spectral features of SC, (ii) direct generation of sub-3-cycle pulses from the highly nonlinear fiber, and (iii) the production of high-order solitons, capturing distinct "breather" dynamics in both spectral and temporal domains. This approach heralds a new era of arbitrary spectro-temporal state engineering, with transformative implications for ultrafast and quantum science.</description>

      <title>Non-Bloch self-energy of dissipative interacting fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect describes the phenomenon of exponential localization of single-particle eigenstates near the boundary of the system. We explore its generalization to the many-body regime by investigating interacting fermions in open quantum systems. Therein, the elementary excitations from the ``vacuum'' (steady state) are given by two types of dissipative quasi-particles composed of single-fermion operators. We perturbatively calculate the self-energy of these quasi-particles in the presence of interactions, and utilize the non-Bloch band theory to develop an exact integral formula, which is further simplified by imposing complex momentum conservation. The formula allows calculating the Liouvillian gap modified by interactions with high precision, as demonstrated by comparison to numerical results. Furthermore, our results show that interactions can even enhance the non-reciprocity of fermion hoppings, contrary to the conventional viewpoint from the Pauli exclusion principle. Our formulation provides a quantitative tool for investigating dissipative interacting fermions with non-Hermitian skin effect, and generalizes the Fermi liquid theory to open quantum systems in the context of diagrammatic perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Robust coherent dynamics of homogeneously limited anisotropic excitons in two-dimensional layered ReS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of in-plane anisotropic excitons in two-dimensional layered semiconductors enables state-of-the-art nanophotonic applications. A fundamental yet unknown parameter of these quasiparticles is the coherence time (T_2 ), which governs the quantum dephasing timescale, over which the coherent superposition of excitons can be maintained and manipulated. Here, we report the direct measurement of T_2 within the sub-picosecond range, along with multiple population decay timescales (T_1 ) at resonance for anisotropic excitons in pristine layered rhenium disulfide (ReS2). We observe a notable weak dependence on layer thickness for T_2 , and a quasi-independence for T_1 . The excitonic coherence in few-layer ReS2 exhibits exceptional robustness against optical density and temperature compared to other two-dimensional semiconductors, enabling quantum features even at room temperature. No photon echo fingerprints were observed in pristine ReS2, highlighting the homogeneous character of the anisotropic excitonic transitions and a particularly low level of disorder in exfoliated flakes. Lastly, our results for mono- to bulk-like ReS2 support a direct gap band structure regardless their layer thickness, addressing the ongoing discussion about its nature.</description>

      <title>Smartphone tristimulus colorimetry for skin-tone analysis at common pulse oximetry anatomical sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significance: Smartphones hold great potential in point-of-care settings due to their accessibility and computational capabilities. This is critical as clinicians increasingly seek to quantify skin-tone, a characteristic which has been shown to impact the accuracy of pulse oximetry readings, particularly for dark skin tones, and hence, disproportionately affect patient outcomes. Aim: This study presents a smartphone-based imaging technique for determining individual typology angle (ITA) and compares these results to those obtained using an industry-standard tristimulus colorimeter, particularly for the finger, a common site for pulse oximetry measurements. Approach: We employ a smartphone-based imaging method to extract ITA values from four volunteers with diverse skin-tones. The study provides recommendations for minimizing errors caused by ambient light scattering, which can affect skin-tone readings. Results: The smartphone-based ITA (SITA) measurements with camera flash disabled and minimal ambient lighting correlates well with the industry-standard colorimeter without the need for auxiliary adapters and complex calibration. The method presented enables wide-field ITA mapping for skin-tone quantification that is accessible to clinicians. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that smartphone-based imaging provides an effective alternative for assessing skin-tone in clinical settings. The reduced complexity of the approach presented makes it highly accessible to the clinical community and others interested in carrying out pulse oximetry across a diversity of skin-tones in a manner that standardizes skin-tone assessment.</description>

      <title>Formation of nonlinear modes in one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattices with a mobility edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of steady states in one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates of repulsively interacting ultracold atoms loaded into a quasiperiodic potential created by two incommensurate periodic lattices. We study the transformations between linear and nonlinear modes and describe the general patterns that govern the birth of nonlinear modes emerging in spectral gaps near band edges. We show that nonlinear modes in a symmetric potential undergo both symmetry-breaking pitchfork bifurcations and saddle-node bifurcations, mimicking the prototypical behaviors of symmetric and asymmetric double-well potentials. The properties of the nonlinear modes differ for bifurcations occurring below and above the mobility edge. In the generic case, when the quasiperiodic potential consists of two incommensurate lattices with a nonzero phase shift between them, the formation of localized modes in the spectral gaps occurs through a cascade of saddle-node bifurcations. Because of the analogy between the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, our results can also be applied to optical modes guided by quasiperiodic photonic lattices.</description>

      <title>Independent Optical Frequency Combs Powered 546 km Field Test of Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owing to its repeater-like rate-loss scaling, twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) has repeatedly exhibited in laboratory its superiority for secure communication over record fiber lengths. Field trials pose a new set of challenges however, which must be addressed before the technology's roll-out into real-world. Here, we verify in field the viability of using independent optical frequency combs -- installed at sites separated by a straight-line distance of 300~km -- to achieve a versatile TF-QKD setup that has no need for optical frequency dissemination and thus enables an open and network-friendly fiber configuration. Over 546 and 603 km symmetric links, we record a finite-size secure key rate (SKR) of 0.53~bit/s and an asymptotic SKR of 0.12 bit/s, respectively. Of practical importance, the setup is demonstrated to support 44~km fiber asymmetry in the 452 km link. Our work marks an important step towards incorporation of long-haul fiber links into large quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Tunable Nanostructuring for van der Waals Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) materials are becoming increasingly popular in scientific and industrial applications because of their unique mixture of record electronic, optical, and mechanical properties. However, nanostructuring of vdW materials is still in its infancy and strongly depends on the specific vdW crystal. As a result, the universal self-assembled technology of vdW materials nanostructuring opens vast technological prospects. This work demonstrates an express and universal synthesis method of vdW nanoparticles with well-defined geometry using femtosecond laser ablation and fragmentation. The disarming simplicity of the technique allows us to create nanoparticles from over 50 vdW precursor materials covering transition metal chalcogenides, MXenes, and other vdW materials. Obtained nanoparticles manifest perfectly defined crystalline structures and diverse shapes, from nanospheres to nanocubes and nanotetrahedrons. Thus, our work provides a new paradigm for vdW nanostructuring with a vast potential of tunability for size, shape, and materials specific to the particular application.</description>

      <title>Photon drag at the junction between metal and 2d semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon drag represents a mechanism of photocurrent generation wherein the electromagnetic (EM) field momentum is transferred directly to the charge carriers. It is believed to be small by the virtue of low photon momentum compared to the typical momenta of the charge carriers. Here, we show that photon drag becomes particularly strong at the junctions between metals and 2d materials, wherein highly non-uniform local EM fields are generated upon diffraction. To this end, we combine an exact theory of diffraction at 'metal-2d material' junctions with microscopic transport theory of photon drag, and derive the functional dependences of the respective photovoltage on the parameters of EM field and 2d system. The voltage responsivity appears inversely proportional to the electromagnetic frequency $\omega$, the sheet density of charge, and a dimensionless momentum transfer coefficient $\alpha$ which depends only on 2d conductivity in units of light speed $\eta = 2\pi \sigma/c$ and light polarization. For $p$-polarized incident light, the momentum transfer coefficient appears finite even for vanishingly small 2d conductivity $\eta$, which is a consequence of dynamic lightning rod effect. For $s$-polarized incident light, the momentum transfer coefficient scales as $\eta \ln \eta^{-1}$, which stems from long-range dipole radiation of a linear junction. A simple estimate shows that the ratio of thermoelectric and photon drag photovoltages at the junction for $p$-polarization is roughly $\omega\tau_\varepsilon$, where $\tau_\varepsilon$ is the energy relaxation time, while for $s$-polarization the photon drag always dominates over the thermoelectric effect.</description>

      <title>Thermal emission of hydrogenated amorphous silicon microspheres in the mid-infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogenated amorphous silicon microspheres feature a pronounced phononic peak around 2000 cm-1 when they are thermally excited by means of a blue laser. This phononic signature corresponds to vibrational modes of silicon-hydrogen bonds and its emitted light can be coupled to Mie modes defined by the spherical cavity. The signal is apparently quite stable at moderate excitation intensities although there appeared some signs pointing to hydrides bonds reconfiguration and even hydrogen emission. Above a certain excitation threshold, a phase change from amorphous to poly-crystalline silicon occurs that preserves the good structural quality of the microspheres.</description>

      <title>Influence of Spatial Dispersion in the Topological Edge States of Magnetized Plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional Chern insulators are two-dimensional periodic structures that support unidirectional edge states at the boundary, while the wave propagation in the bulk regions is forbidden. The number of unidirectional edge states is governed by the gap Chern number, a topological invariant that depends on the global properties of the system over the entire wavevector space. This concept can also be extended to systems with a continuous translational symmetry provided they satisfy a regularization condition for large wavenumbers. Here, we discuss how the spatial dispersion, notably the high-spatial frequency behavior of the material response, critically influences the topological properties, and consequently, the net number of unidirectional edge states. In particular, we show that seemingly small perturbations of a local magnetized plasma can lead to distinct Chern phases and, consequently, markedly different edge state dispersions.</description>

      <title>A Digital and Compact High-Precision Locking System for Pulse Laser Repetition Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach that employs error amplification and ADC-based dual-mixer time-difference (ADC-based-DMTD) technique for high-precision locking of laser repetition frequency with compact size. This electronic system consists of two main components: a digitized error amplification module (EAM) and an FPGA-based digital frequency locking module (DFLM). The EAM mainly integrates a configurable frequency generator (CFG), a configurable frequency multiplier (CFM) and a mixer to process the laser pulses and a high-stability reference source (e.g., an atomic clock), enabling high-precision locking of pulse lasers operating at different repetition frequencies. By employing frequency multiplication and mixing, the EAM amplifies the laser's frequency error and performs frequency down-conversion, enhancing measurement sensitivity and reducing the hardware requirements of the back-end. The DFLM receives the EAM outputs by using an ADC-based-DMTD method to precisely measure frequency errors, then the digital proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller provides feedback to achieve accurate frequency locking. Initial testing with a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) demonstrated excellent locking performance, achieving an Allan deviation of $9.58 \times 10^{-14}$ at 10 seconds and a standard deviation (STD) of 7.7 \textmu Hz root mean square (RMS) after locking, marking a five-order-of-magnitude stability enhancement. In laboratory experiments with a custom-built femtosecond fiber laser, the system achieved robust locking of the repetition frequency, with a stability improvement from $1.51 \times 10^{-7}$ to $1.12 \times 10^{-12}$ at a 10-second gate time and an STD of 0.43 mHz RMS after locking.</description>

      <title>Variational MineGAN: A Data-efficient Knowledge Transfer Architecture for Generative AI-assisted Design of Nanophotonic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging the power of deep learning to design nanophotonic devices has been an area of active research in recent times, with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) being a popular choice alongside autoencoder-based methods. However, both approaches typically require large datasets and significant computational resources, which can outweigh the advantages of saving time and effort. While GANs trained on smaller datasets can experience challenges such as unstable training and mode collapse, fine-tuning pre-trained GANs on these limited datasets often introduces additional problems, such as overfitting and lack of flexibility. This limits the model's ability to generalize, reducing its overall effectiveness. In this study, we present Variational MineGAN, an enhanced version of MineGAN that is less susceptible to overfitting while leveraging pre-trained GANs. This approach ensures a more robust sampling process, improving the model's generalization ability while transferring knowledge to domains with limited data. Experimental results demonstrate a lower Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score of 52.14, along with an increased Inception Score (IS) of 3.59 compared to prior methods. This implies better quality design images, which allow for the exploration of highly efficient designs with desired spectral responses and improved learning of nonlinear relationships between the latent space and the corresponding designs.</description>

      <title>Optical Tweezers with AC Dielectric Levitation: A Powerful Approach to Microparticle Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical tweezers, with their high precision, dynamic control, and non-invasiveness, are increasingly important in scientific research and applications at the micro and nano scales. However, manipulation by optical tweezers is challenged by adsorption forces, including van der Waals forces, capillary forces, and electrostatic forces, which are present between micro- and nano-objects. Due to the inherent limitations of optical forces imposed by laser power, these adsorption forces are difficult to overcome. Inspired by maglev trains, we propose a multiphysics coupling method that combines dielectrophoretic and optical gradient forces to achieve broad applicability and low-damage micro-nanoscale particle manipulation. We developed a device that introduces electric fields to detach objects from hard substrates using alternating current (AC) dielectric levitation before manipulation with optical tweezers. We utilized micron-sized polystyrene (PS) microspheres as objects and elucidated the levitation mechanism through finite element simulation. For larger particles, such as a 100 {\mu}m PS microparticle and a 200 {\mu}m micro-gear, AC dielectric levitation enabled manipulation by optical tweezers. Also, the better viability of three kinds of cells displayed the low bio-damage of the proposed method. Given its broad applicability and biocompatibility, AC dielectric levitation technology significantly expands the capabilities of optical tweezers, allowing for the manipulation of larger particles and cells. This advancement addresses the limitations of optical tweezers in handling large-scale particles and enhances their versatility in various applications.</description>

      <title>Topologically invisible defects in chiral mirror lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the hallmark of topological insulators is having conductivity properties that are unaffected by the possible presence of defects. In this work, we go beyond backscattering immunity and obtain topological invisibility across defects or disorder. Using a combination of chiral and mirror symmetry, the transmission coefficient is guaranteed to be unity. Importantly, but no phase shift is induced making the defect completely invisible. Many lattices possess the chiral-mirror symmetry, and we choose to demonstrate the principle on an hexagonal lattice model with Kekule distortion displaying topological edge waves, and we show analytically and numerically that the transmission across symmetry preserving defects is unity. We then realize this lattice in an acoustic system, and confirm the invisibility with numerical experiments. We foresee that the versatility of our model will trigger new experiments to observe topological invisibility in various wave systems, such as photonics, cold atoms or elastic waves.</description>

      <title>Identifying gap-closings in open non-Hermitian systems by Biorthogonal Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate gap-closings in one- and two-dimensional tight-binding models with two bands, containing non-Hermitian hopping terms, and open boundary conditions (OBCs) imposed along one direction. We compare the bulk OBC spectra with the periodic boundary condition (PBC) spectra, pointing out that they do not coincide, which is an intrinsic characteristic of non-Hermitian systems. The non-Hermiticity, thus, results in the failure of the familiar notions of bulk-boundary correspondence found for Hermitian systems. This necessitates the search for topological invariants which can characterize gap-closings in open non-Hermitian systems correctly and unambiguously. We elucidate the behaviour of two possible candidates applicable for one-dimensional slices - (1) the sum of winding numbers for the two bands defined on a generalized Brillouin zone and (2) the biorthogonal polarization (BP). While the former shows jumps/discontinuities for some of the non-Hermitian systems studied here, at points when an edge mode enters the bulk states and becomes delocalized, it does not maintain quantized values in a given topological phase. On the contrary, BP shows jumps at phase transitions, and takes the quantized value of one or zero, which corresponds to whether an actual edge mode exists or whether that mode is delocalized and absorbed within the bulk (not being an edge mode anymore).</description>

      <title>Quantum cryptographic protocols with dual messaging system via 2D alternate quantum walk of a genuine single-photon entangled state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A single-photon entangled state (or single-particle entangled state (SPES) in general) can offer a more secure way of encoding and processing quantum information than their multi-photon (or multi-particle) counterparts. The SPES generated via a 2D alternate quantum-walk setup from initially separable states can be either 3-way or 2-way entangled. This letter shows that the generated genuine three-way and nonlocal two-way SPES can be used as cryptographic keys to securely encode two distinct messages simultaneously. We detail the message encryption-decryption steps and show the resilience of the 3-way and 2-way SPES-based cryptographic protocols against eavesdropper attacks like intercept-and-resend and man-in-the-middle. We also detail the experimental realization of these protocols using a single photon, with the three degrees of freedom being OAM, path, and polarization. We have proved that the protocols have unconditional security for quantum communication tasks. The ability to simultaneously encode two distinct messages using the generated SPES showcases the versatility and efficiency of the proposed cryptographic protocol. This capability could significantly improve the throughput of quantum communication systems.</description>
