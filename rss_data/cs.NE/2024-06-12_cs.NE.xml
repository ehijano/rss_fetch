      <title>GridPE: Unifying Positional Encoding in Transformers with a Grid Cell-Inspired Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding spatial location and relationships is a fundamental capability for modern artificial intelligence systems. Insights from human spatial cognition provide valuable guidance in this domain. Recent neuroscientific discoveries have highlighted the role of grid cells as a fundamental neural component for spatial representation, including distance computation, path integration, and scale discernment. In this paper, we introduce a novel positional encoding scheme inspired by Fourier analysis and the latest findings in computational neuroscience regarding grid cells. Assuming that grid cells encode spatial position through a summation of Fourier basis functions, we demonstrate the translational invariance of the grid representation during inner product calculations. Additionally, we derive an optimal grid scale ratio for multi-dimensional Euclidean spaces based on principles of biological efficiency. Utilizing these computational principles, we have developed a **Grid**-cell inspired **Positional Encoding** technique, termed **GridPE**, for encoding locations within high-dimensional spaces. We integrated GridPE into the Pyramid Vision Transformer architecture. Our theoretical analysis shows that GridPE provides a unifying framework for positional encoding in arbitrary high-dimensional spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that GridPE significantly enhances the performance of transformers, underscoring the importance of incorporating neuroscientific insights into the design of artificial intelligence systems.</description>

      <title>SparrowSNN: A Hardware/software Co-design for Energy Efficient ECG Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Given its high risk and often asymptomatic nature, real-time continuous monitoring is essential. Unlike traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), spiking neural networks (SNNs) are well-known for their energy efficiency, making them ideal for wearable devices and energy-constrained edge computing platforms. However, current energy measurement of SNN implementations for detecting heart diseases typically rely on empirical values, often overlooking hardware overhead. Additionally, the integer and fire activations in SNNs require multiple memory accesses and repeated computations, which can further compromise energy efficiency. In this paper, we propose sparrowSNN, a redesign of the standard SNN workflow from a hardware perspective, and present a dedicated ASIC design for SNNs, optimized for ultra-low power wearable devices used in heartbeat classification. Using the MIT-BIH dataset, our SNN achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.29% for SNNs, with energy consumption of 31.39nJ per inference and power usage of 6.1uW, making sparrowSNN the highest accuracy with the lowest energy use among comparable systems. We also compare the energy-to-accuracy trade-offs between SNNs and quantized ANNs, offering recommendations on insights on how best to use SNNs.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Emergent Symbolic Reasoning Abilities of Llama Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance in a wide range of tasks, even if they are often trained with the only objective of chatting fluently with users. Among other skills, LLMs show emergent abilities in mathematical reasoning benchmarks, which can be elicited with appropriate prompting methods. In this work, we systematically investigate the capabilities and limitations of popular open-source LLMs on different symbolic reasoning tasks. We evaluate three models of the Llama 2 family on two datasets that require solving mathematical formulas of varying degrees of difficulty. We test a generalist LLM (Llama 2 Chat) as well as two fine-tuned versions of Llama 2 (MAmmoTH and MetaMath) specifically designed to tackle mathematical problems. We observe that both increasing the scale of the model and fine-tuning it on relevant tasks lead to significant performance gains. Furthermore, using fine-grained evaluation measures, we find that such performance gains are mostly observed with mathematical formulas of low complexity, which nevertheless often remain challenging even for the largest fine-tuned models.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Meta-features Used for Automated Selection of Algorithms for Black-box Single-objective Continuous Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The selection of the most appropriate algorithm to solve a given problem instance, known as algorithm selection, is driven by the potential to capitalize on the complementary performance of different algorithms across sets of problem instances. However, determining the optimal algorithm for an unseen problem instance has been shown to be a challenging task, which has garnered significant attention from researchers in recent years. In this survey, we conduct an overview of the key contributions to algorithm selection in the field of single-objective continuous black-box optimization. We present ongoing work in representation learning of meta-features for optimization problem instances, algorithm instances, and their interactions. We also study machine learning models for automated algorithm selection, configuration, and performance prediction. Through this analysis, we identify gaps in the state of the art, based on which we present ideas for further development of meta-feature representations.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Continuous PDE Forecasting using Equivariant Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Conditional Neural Fields (NeFs) have emerged as a powerful modelling paradigm for PDEs, by learning solutions as flows in the latent space of the Conditional NeF. Although benefiting from favourable properties of NeFs such as grid-agnosticity and space-time-continuous dynamics modelling, this approach limits the ability to impose known constraints of the PDE on the solutions -- e.g. symmetries or boundary conditions -- in favour of modelling flexibility. Instead, we propose a space-time continuous NeF-based solving framework that - by preserving geometric information in the latent space - respects known symmetries of the PDE. We show that modelling solutions as flows of pointclouds over the group of interest $G$ improves generalization and data-efficiency. We validated that our framework readily generalizes to unseen spatial and temporal locations, as well as geometric transformations of the initial conditions - where other NeF-based PDE forecasting methods fail - and improve over baselines in a number of challenging geometries.</description>

      <title>SpikePipe: Accelerated Training of Spiking Neural Networks via Inter-Layer Pipelining and Multiprocessor Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained popularity due to their high energy efficiency. Prior works have proposed various methods for training SNNs, including backpropagation-based methods. Training SNNs is computationally expensive compared to their conventional counterparts and would benefit from multiprocessor hardware acceleration. This is the first paper to propose inter-layer pipelining to accelerate training in SNNs using systolic array-based processors and multiprocessor scheduling. The impact of training using delayed gradients is observed using three networks training on different datasets, showing no degradation for small networks and &lt; 10% degradation for large networks. The mapping of various training tasks of the SNN onto systolic arrays is formulated, and the proposed scheduling method is evaluated on the three networks. The results are compared against standard pipelining algorithms. The results show that the proposed method achieves an average speedup of 1.6X compared to standard pipelining algorithms, with an upwards of 2X improvement in some cases. The incurred communication overhead due to the proposed method is less than 0.5% of the total required communication of training.</description>

      <title>Efficient 3D Molecular Generation with Flow Matching and Scale Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models for 3D drug design have gained prominence recently for their potential to design ligands directly within protein pockets. Current approaches, however, often suffer from very slow sampling times or generate molecules with poor chemical validity. Addressing these limitations, we propose Semla, a scalable E(3)-equivariant message passing architecture. We further introduce a molecular generation model, MolFlow, which is trained using flow matching along with scale optimal transport, a novel extension of equivariant optimal transport. Our model produces state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets with just 100 sampling steps. Crucially, MolFlow samples high quality molecules with as few as 20 steps, corresponding to a two order-of-magnitude speed-up compared to state-of-the-art, without sacrificing performance. Furthermore, we highlight limitations of current evaluation methods for 3D generation and propose new benchmark metrics for unconditional molecular generators. Finally, using these new metrics, we compare our model's ability to generate high quality samples against current approaches and further demonstrate MolFlow's strong performance.</description>

Abstract: We explored the mathematical foundations of Recurrent Neural Networks ($\mathtt{RNN}$s) and three fundamental procedures: temporal rescaling, discretisation and linearisation. These techniques provide essential tools for characterizing $\mathtt{RNN}$s behaviour, enabling insights into temporal dynamics, practical computational implementation, and linear approximations for analysis. We discuss the flexible order of application of these procedures, emphasizing their significance in modelling and analyzing $\mathtt{RNN}$s for neuroscience and machine learning applications. We explicitly describe here under what conditions these procedures can be interchangeable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Applications in robotics or other size-, weight- and power-constrained autonomous systems at the edge often require real-time and low-energy solutions to large optimization problems. Event-based and memory-integrated neuromorphic architectures promise to solve such optimization problems with superior energy efficiency and performance compared to conventional von Neumann architectures. Here, we present a method to solve convex continuous optimization problems with quadratic cost functions and linear constraints on Intel's scalable neuromorphic research chip Loihi 2. When applied to model predictive control (MPC) problems for the quadruped robotic platform ANYmal, this method achieves over two orders of magnitude reduction in combined energy-delay product compared to the state-of-the-art solver, OSQP, on (edge) CPUs and GPUs with solution times under ten milliseconds for various problem sizes. These results demonstrate the benefit of non-von-Neumann architectures for robotic control applications.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Algorithms Simulating Molecular Evolution: A New Field Proposal</title>

Abstract: The genetic blueprint for the essential functions of life is encoded in DNA, which is translated into proteins -- the engines driving most of our metabolic processes. Recent advancements in genome sequencing have unveiled a vast diversity of protein families, but compared to the massive search space of all possible amino acid sequences, the set of known functional families is minimal. One could say nature has a limited protein "vocabulary." The major question for computational biologists, therefore, is whether this vocabulary can be expanded to include useful proteins that went extinct long ago, or maybe never evolved in the first place. We outline a computational approach to solving this problem. By merging evolutionary algorithms, machine learning (ML), and bioinformatics, we can facilitate the development of completely novel proteins which have never existed before. We envision this work forming a new sub-field of computational evolution we dub evolutionary algorithms simulating molecular evolution (EASME).</description>

      <title>Near-Tight Runtime Guarantees for Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in the field of mathematical runtime analysis of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), the performance of MOEAs on discrete many-objective problems is little understood. In particular, the few existing bounds for the SEMO, global SEMO, and SMS-EMOA algorithms on classic benchmarks are all roughly quadratic in the size of the Pareto front. In this work, we prove near-tight runtime guarantees for these three algorithms on the four most common benchmark problems OneMinMax, CountingOnesCountingZeros, LeadingOnesTrailingZeros, and OneJumpZeroJump, and this for arbitrary numbers of objectives. Our bounds depend only linearly on the Pareto front size, showing that these MOEAs on these benchmarks cope much better with many objectives than what previous works suggested. Our bounds are tight apart from small polynomial factors in the number of objectives and length of bitstrings. This is the first time that such tight bounds are proven for many-objective uses of these MOEAs. While it is known that such results cannot hold for the NSGA-II, we do show that our bounds, via a recent structural result, transfer to the NSGA-III algorithm.</description>

      <title>Active Dendrites Enable Efficient Continual Learning in Time-To-First-Spike Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the human brain efficiently adapts to new tasks from a continuous stream of information, neural network models struggle to learn from sequential information without catastrophically forgetting previously learned tasks. This limitation presents a significant hurdle in deploying edge devices in real-world scenarios where information is presented in an inherently sequential manner. Active dendrites of pyramidal neurons play an important role in the brain ability to learn new tasks incrementally. By exploiting key properties of time-to-first-spike encoding and leveraging its high sparsity, we present a novel spiking neural network model enhanced with active dendrites. Our model can efficiently mitigate catastrophic forgetting in temporally-encoded SNNs, which we demonstrate with an end-of-training accuracy across tasks of 88.3% on the test set using the Split MNIST dataset. Furthermore, we provide a novel digital hardware architecture that paves the way for real-world deployment in edge devices. Using a Xilinx Zynq-7020 SoC FPGA, we demonstrate a 100-% match with our quantized software model, achieving an average inference time of 37.3 ms and an 80.0% accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel method for merging the weights of multiple pre-trained neural networks using a genetic algorithm called MeGA. Traditional techniques, such as weight averaging and ensemble methods, often fail to fully harness the capabilities of pre-trained networks. Our approach leverages a genetic algorithm with tournament selection, crossover, and mutation to optimize weight combinations, creating a more effective fusion. This technique allows the merged model to inherit advantageous features from both parent models, resulting in enhanced accuracy and robustness. Through experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset, we demonstrate that our genetic algorithm-based weight merging method improves test accuracy compared to individual models and conventional methods. This approach provides a scalable solution for integrating multiple pre-trained networks across various deep learning applications.

      <description>arXiv:2309.12437v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital MemComputing machines (DMMs), which employ nonlinear dynamical systems with memory (time non-locality), have proven to be a robust and scalable unconventional computing approach for solving a wide variety of combinatorial optimization problems. However, most of the research so far has focused on the numerical simulations of the equations of motion of DMMs. This inevitably subjects time to discretization, which brings its own (numerical) issues that would be otherwise absent in actual physical systems operating in continuous time. Although hardware realizations of DMMs have been previously suggested, their implementation would require materials and devices that are not so easy to integrate with traditional electronics. Addressing this, our study introduces a novel hardware design for DMMs, utilizing readily available electronic components. This approach not only significantly boosts computational speed compared to current models but also exhibits remarkable robustness against additive noise. Crucially, it circumvents the limitations imposed by numerical noise, ensuring enhanced stability and reliability during extended operations. This paves a new path for tackling increasingly complex problems, leveraging the inherent advantages of DMMs in a more practical and accessible framework.</description>

      <title>Text Injection for Neural Contextual Biasing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural contextual biasing effectively improves automatic speech recognition (ASR) for crucial phrases within a speaker's context, particularly those that are infrequent in the training data. This work proposes contextual text injection (CTI) to enhance contextual ASR. CTI leverages not only the paired speech-text data, but also a much larger corpus of unpaired text to optimize the ASR model and its biasing component. Unpaired text is converted into speech-like representations and used to guide the model's attention towards relevant bias phrases. Moreover, we introduce a contextual text-injected (CTI) minimum word error rate (MWER) training, which minimizes the expected WER caused by contextual biasing when unpaired text is injected into the model. Experiments show that CTI with 100 billion text sentences can achieve up to 43.3% relative WER reduction from a strong neural biasing model. CTI-MWER provides a further relative improvement of 23.5%.</description>
