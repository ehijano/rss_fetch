      <title>Emergence of $R^4$-terms in M-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been recently suggested that the strong Emergence Proposal is realized in equi-dimensional M-theory limits by integrating out all light towers of states with a typical mass scale not larger than the species scale, i.e the eleventh dimensional Planck mass. Within the BPS sector, these are transverse $M2$- and $M5$-branes, that can be wrapped and particle-like, carrying Kaluza-Klein momentum along the compact directions. We provide additional evidence for this picture by revisiting and investigating further the computation of $R^4$-interactions in M-theory \`a la Green-Gutperle-Vanhove. A central aspect is a novel UV-regularization of Schwinger-like integrals, whose actual meaning and power we clarify by first applying it to string perturbation theory. We consider then toroidal compactifications of M-theory and provide evidence that integrating out all light towers of states via Schwinger-like integrals thus regularized yields the complete result for $R^4$-interactions. In particular, this includes terms that are tree-level, one-loop and space-time instanton corrections from the weakly coupled point of view. Finally, we comment on the conceptual difference of our approach to earlier closely related work by Kiritsis-Pioline and Obers-Pioline, and conjecture a correspondence between two types of constrained Eisenstein series.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Entropy for M-theory on the Quintic Threefold via F-theoretic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscopic black hole entropy calculations in string theory usually proceeds through identifying them as wrapped strings in one higher dimension. For M-theory on elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds this proceeds via its relation to F-theory in one higher dimension. Here we show how this method can be extended to M-theory on non-elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds such as the quintic via conifold transition to elliptic threefolds. This leads to the computation of the black hole entropy through elliptic genera of the strings. However the Cardy formula for the computation of the black hole entropy of these strings fails because the relevant momentum excitations on the string are much smaller than the central charge of the strings. We show how the black hole attractor entropy formula leads to predicting corrections to the Cardy formula in this regime.</description>

      <title>Tensionless Strings in a Kalb-Ramond Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate tensionless (or null) bosonic string theory with a Kalb-Ramond background turned on. In analogy with the tensile case, we find that the Kalb-Ramond field has a non-trivial effect on the spectrum only when the theory is compactified on an (\left(S^1\right)^{\otimes d}) background with (d\geq 2). We discuss the effect of this background field on the tensionless spectrum constructed on three known consistent null string vacua. We elucidate further on the intriguing fate of duality symmetries in these classes of string theories when the background field is turned on.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the work of [1], we consider six- and seven-dimensional gauged supergravity coupled to a vector multiplet on an ansatz of $AdS_{4,5}\times{M}_2$, respectively, where $M_2$ is a two-dimensional surface with a Killing vector. We construct equivariantly closed forms from spinor bilinears of Killing spinors. From the integration of equivariantly closed forms via the Berline-Vergne-Atiyah-Bott fixed point formula, we derive the gravitational blocks which were previously conjectured. For the construction of equivariantly closed forms, we formulate six- and seven-dimensional gauged supergravity in the very special geometry.</description>

      <title>Timelike Entanglement Entropy and Phase Transitions in non-Conformal Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a holographic formalism for a timelike entanglement entropy in non-conformal theories. This pseudoentropy is a complex-valued measure of information, which, in holographic non-conformal theories, receives contributions from a set of spacelike surfaces and a finite timelike bulk surface with mirror symmetry. We suggest a method of merging the surfaces so that the boundary length of the subregion is exclusively specified by holography. We show that in confining theories, the surfaces can be merged in the bulk at the infrared tip of the geometry and are homologous to the boundary region. The timelike entanglement entropy receives its imaginary and real contributions from the timelike and the spacelike surfaces, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate that in confining theories, there exists a critical length within which a connected non-trivial surface can exist, and the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy is non-zero. Therefore, the timelike entanglement entropy exhibits unique behavior in confining theories, making it a probe of confinement and phase transitions. Finally, we discuss the entanglement entropy in Euclidean spacetime in confining theories and the effect of a simple analytical continuation from a spacelike subsystem to a timelike one.</description>

      <title>Universal Bound on Effective Central Charge and Its Saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective central charge (denoted by $c_{\text{eff}}$) is a measure of entanglement through a conformal interface, while the transmission coefficient (encoded in the coefficient $c_{LR}$ of the two-point function of the energy-momentum tensor across the interface) is a measure of energy transmission through the interface. It has been pointed out that these two are generally different. In this article, we propose the inequalities, $0 \leq c_{LR} \leq c_{\text{eff}} \leq \min (c_L,c_R)$. They have the simple but important implication that the amount of energy transmission can never exceed the amount of information transmission. We verify them using the AdS/CFT correspondence and in examples beyond holography. We also show that these inequalities are sharp by constructing a class of interfaces that saturate them.</description>

      <title>The Schwarzian from gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuum of holographic dual gravitational charges is recovered out of the discrete spectrum of $U(N)$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM on $\mathbb{R}\times S^3\,$. In such a limit, the free energy of the free gauge theory is computed up to logarithmic contributions and exponentially suppressed contributions. Assuming the supergravity dual prediction to correctly capture strong-coupling results in field theory, the answer is bound to encode a complete low-temperature expansion of the Gibbons-Hawking gravitational on-shell action, valid well beyond the vicinity of supersymmetric black hole solutions. The formula recovers the long awaited Schwarzian contribution at low enough temperatures. The computed mass-gap matches the conjectured strong-coupling result obtained by Boruch, Heydeman, Iliesiu and Turiaci in supergravity. The emergent reparameterizations, broken by the Schwarzian, correspond to redefinitions of the relevant cutoff scale. Observations are made regarding the existence of $\frac{1}{8}$-BPS black holes and how this is in tension with BPS inequalities. The RG-flow procedure leading to these results opens the way to understanding the emergence of chaos in gauge theories and its relation to non-extremal and non-supersymmetric black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Braiding Fibonacci anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fibonacci anyons provide the simplest possible model of non-Abelian fusion rules: [1] x [1] = [0] + [1]. We propose a conformal field theory construction of topological quantum registers based on Fibonacci anyons realized as quasiparticle excitations in the Z_3 parafermion fractional quantum Hall state. To this end, the results of Ardonne and Schoutens for the correlation function of n = 4 Fibonacci fields are extended to the case of arbitrary n (and 3 r electrons). Special attention is paid to the braiding properties of the obtained correlators. We explain in details the construction of a monodromy representation of the Artin braid group acting on n-point conformal blocks of Fibonacci anyons. For low n (up to n = 8), the matrices of braid group generators are displayed explicitly. A simple recursion formula makes it possible to extend without efforts the construction to any n. Finally, we construct N qubit computational spaces in terms of conformal blocks of 2N + 2 Fibonacci anyons.</description>

      <title>Realizations and star-product of doubly $\kappa$-deformed Yang models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Yang algebra was proposed a long time ago as a generalization of the Snyder algebra to the case of curved background spacetime. It includes as subalgebras both the Snyder and the de Sitter algebras and can therefore be viewed as a model of noncommutative curved spacetime. A peculiarity with respect to standard models of noncommutative geometry is that it includes translation and Lorentz generators, so that the definition of a Hopf algebra and the physical interpretation of the variables conjugated to the primary ones is not trivial. In this paper we consider the realizations of the Yang algebra and its $\kappa$-deformed generalization on an extended phase space and in this way we are able to define a Hopf structure and a twist.</description>

Abstract: We study the integrability and the Bethe/Gauge correspondence of the Generalized Calogero-Moser system proposed by Berntson, Langmann and Lenells which we call the elliptic quadruple Calogero-Moser system (eqCM). We write down the Dunkl operators which give commuting Hamiltonians of the quantum integrable system. We identify the gauge theory in correspondence is a supergroup version of the gauge origami, from which we construct the transfer matrix of the eqCM system.</description>

      <title>A nonperturbative test of nucleation calculations for strong phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nucleation rate computations are of broad importance in particle physics and cosmology. Perturbative calculations are often used to compute the nucleation rate $\Gamma$, but these are incomplete. We perform nonperturbative lattice simulations of nucleation in a scalar field theory with a tree-level barrier, computing a final result extrapolated to the thermodynamic and continuum limits. Although the system in question should be well-described by a complete one-loop perturbative calculation, we find only qualitative agreement with the full perturbative result, with a 20% discrepancy in $|\log \Gamma|$. Our result motivates further testing of the current nucleation paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider 1+1 field generalization of the elliptic Calogero-Moser model. It is shown that the Lax connection satisfies the classical non-ultralocal $r$-matrix structure of Maillet type. Next, we consider 1+1 field analogue of the spin Calogero-Moser model and its multipole (or multispin) extension. Finally, we discuss the field analogue of the classical IRF-Vertex correspondence, which relates utralocal and non-ultralocal $r$-matrix structures.</description>

      <title>Massive celestial amplitudes and celestial amplitudes beyond four points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute scalar three-point celestial amplitudes involving two and three massive scalars. The three-point coefficient of celestial amplitudes with two massive scalars contains a hypergeometric function, and the one with three massive scalars can be represented as a triple Mellin-Barnes integral. Using these three-point celestial amplitudes, we investigate the conformal block expansions of five- and six-point scalar celestial amplitudes in the comb channel. We observe the presence of two-particle operators in the conformal block expansion of five-point celestial amplitudes, which confirms the previous analysis by taking multi-collinear limit. Moreover, we find that there are new three-particle operators in the conformal block expansion of six-point celestial amplitudes. Based on these findings, we conjecture that exchanges of $n$-particle operators can be observed by considering the comb channel conformal block expansion of $(n+3)$-point massless celestial amplitudes. Finally, we show that a new series of operators appears when turning on the mass of the first incoming particle. The leading operator in this series can be interpreted as a two-particle exchange in the OPE of one massive and one massless scalars.</description>

      <title>Critical spin chains and loop models with $U(n)$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting with the Ising model, statistical models with global symmetries provide fruitful approaches to interesting physical systems, for example percolation or polymers. These include the $O(n)$ model (symmetry group $O(n)$) and the Potts model (symmetry group $S_Q$). Both models make sense for $n,Q\in \mathbb{C}$ and not just $n,Q\in \mathbb{N}$, and both give rise to a conformal field theory in the critical limit.
  Here, we study similar models based on the unitary group $U(n)$. We focus on the two-dimensional case, where the models can be described either as gases of non-intersecting orientable loops, or as alternating spin chains. This allows us to determine their spectra either by computing a twisted torus partition function, or by studying representations of the walled Brauer algebra.
  In the critical limit, our models give rise to a CFT with global $U(n)$ symmetry, which exists for any $n\in\mathbb{C}$. Its spectrum is similar to those of the $O(n)$ and Potts CFTs, but a bit simpler. We conjecture that the $O(n)$ CFT is a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold of the $U(n)$ CFT, where $\mathbb{Z}_2$ acts as complex conjugation.</description>

      <title>Interplay between the Lyapunov exponents and phase transitions of charged AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relationship between the standard or extended thermodynamic phase structure of various AdS black holes and the Lyapunov exponents associated with the null and time-like geodesics. We consider dyonic, Bardeen, Gauss-Bonnet, and Lorentz-symmetry breaking massive gravity black holes and calculate the Lyapunov exponents of massless and massive particles in unstable circular geodesics close to the black hole. We find that the thermal profile of the Lyapunov exponents exhibits distinct behaviour in the small and large black hole phases and can encompass certain aspects of the van der Waals type small/large black hole phase transition. We further analyse the properties of Lyapunov exponents as an order parameter and find that its critical exponent is $1/2$, near the critical point for all black holes considered here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to encode the radiative degrees of freedom in $4$-dimensional asymptotically AdS spacetimes, using the boundary Cotton and stress tensors. Background radiation leads to a reduction of the asymptotic symmetry group, in contrast to asymptotically flat spacetimes, where a non-vanishing news tensor does not restrict the asymptotic symmetries. Null gauges, such as $\Lambda$-BMS, provide a framework for AdS spacetimes that include radiation in the flat limit. We use this to check that the flat limit of the radiative data matches the expected definition in intrinsically asymptotically flat spacetimes. We further dimensionally reduce our construction to the celestial sphere, and show how the $2$-dimensional celestial currents can be extracted from the $3$-dimensional boundary data.</description>

      <title>Nambu-Goto equation from three-dimensional gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the solutions of three-dimensional gravity obtained by gluing two copies of a spacetime across a junction constituted of a tensile string are in one-to-one correspondence with the solutions of the Nambu-Goto equation in the same spacetime up to a finite number of rigid deformations. The non-linear Nambu-Goto equation satisfied by the average of the embedding coordinates of the junction emerges directly from the junction conditions along with the rigid deformations and corrections due to the tension. Therefore, the equivalence principle generalizes non-trivially to the string. Our results are valid both in three-dimensional flat and AdS spacetimes. In the context of AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence, our setup could be used to describe a class of interfaces in the conformal field theory featuring relative time reparametrization at the interface which encodes the solution of the Nambu-Goto equation corresponding to the bulk junction.</description>

      <title>Modularity for $\mathcal{W}$-algebras and affine Springer fibres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a bijection between admissible representations for an affine Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ at boundary admissible levels and $\mathbb{C}^\times$ fixed points in homogeneous elliptic affine Springer fibres for the Langlands dual affine Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}^\vee$. Using this bijection, we relate the modularity of the characters of admissible representations to Cherednik's Verlinde algebra construction coming from double affine Hecke algebras. Finally, we show that the expected behaviors of simple modules under quantized Drinfeld-Sokolov reductions are compatible with the reductions from affine Springer fibres to affine Spaltenstein varieties. This yields (modulo some conjectures) a similar bijection for irreducible representations of $\mathcal{W}$-algebras, as well as an interpretation for their modularity properties.</description>

      <title>Negative-energy and tachyonic solutions in the Weinberg-Tucker-Hammer equation for spin 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We considered Weinberg-like equations in the article [1] in order to construct the Feynman-Dyson propagator for the spin-1 particles. This construction is based on the concept of the Weinberg field as a system of four field functions differing by parity and by dual transformations. We also analyzed the recent controversy in the definitions of the Feynman-Dyson propagator for the field operator containing the S=1/2 self/anti-self charge conjugate states in the papers by D. Ahluwalia et al and by W. Rodrigues Jr. et al. The solution to this mathematical controversy is obvious. I proposed the necessary doubling of the Fock Space (as in the Barut and Ziino works), thus extending the corresponding Clifford Algebra. Meanwhile, the N. Debergh et al article considered our old ideas of doubling the Dirac equation, and other forms of T- and PT-conjugation [5]. Both algebraic equation Det (\hat p - m) =0 and Det (\hat p + m) =0 for u- and v- 4-spinors have solutions with p_0= \pm E_p =\pm \sqrt{{\bf p}^2 +m^2}. The same is true for higher-spin equations (or they may even have more complicated dispersion relations). Meanwhile, every book considers the equality p_0=E_p for both u- and v- spinors of the (1/2,0)\oplus (0,1/2)) representation only, thus applying the Dirac-Feynman-Stueckelberg procedure for elimination of negative-energy solutions. It seems, that it is imposible to consider the relativistic quantum mechanics appropriately without negative energies, tachyons and appropriate forms of the discrete symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the standard 1+1d $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ cluster model has a non-invertible global symmetry, described by the fusion category Rep(D$_8$). Therefore, the cluster state is not only a $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase, but also a non-invertible SPT phase. We further find two new commuting Pauli Hamiltonians for the other two Rep(D$_8$) SPT phases on a tensor product Hilbert space of qubits, matching the classification in field theory and mathematics. We identify the edge modes and the local projective algebras at the interfaces between these non-invertible SPT phases. Finally, we show that there does not exist a symmetric entangler that maps between these distinct SPT states.</description>

      <title>Inconsistency of modified gravity in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that there is a fundamental flaw in the application of modified gravity theories in cosmology, taking $f(R)$ gravity as a paradigmatic example. This theory contains a scalar degree of freedom that couples to the matter stress-energy tensor but not to gravitational energy. However, when applied to cosmology this theory is unable to distinguish between gravitational and non-gravitational energy. Hence the cosmological version of the theory does not coincide with its own macroscopic average, and we show that this leads to order-one discrepancies. We argue that the same inconsistency is common to many other modified gravity theories with extra degrees of freedom. Our results put into question whether these theories can make sense as the cosmological average of a fundamental theory, hence challenging their physical significance.</description>

      <title>Electrical conductivity of hot relativistic plasma in a strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ first-principles quantum field theoretical methods to investigate the longitudinal and transverse electrical conductivities of a strongly magnetized hot QED plasma at the leading order in coupling. The analysis utilized the fermion damping rate in the Landau-level representation obtained recently. In the relativistic regime, both conductivities exhibit a scaling behavior given by $\sigma_{\parallel,\perp} = T \tilde{\sigma}_{\parallel,\perp}$, where $\tilde{\sigma}_{\parallel,\perp}$ are functions of the dimensionless ratio $|eB|/T^2$ (here $T$ denotes the temperature and $B$ the magnetic field). As $|eB|/T^2$ increases, both conductivities initially decrease, reach minima, and then exhibit growths when the lowest Landau level dominates. However, the mechanisms for the transverse and longitudinal conductivities differ significantly, leading to a strong suppression of the former in comparison to the latter. Additionally, we extend our analysis to a magnetized quark-gluon plasma, although the approximation's validity breaks down in QCD at strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Numerical relativity surrogate models for exotic compact objects: the case of head-on mergers of equal-mass Proca stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present several high-accuracy surrogate models for gravitational-wave signals from equal-mass head-on mergers of Proca stars, computed through the Newman-Penrose scalar $\psi_4$. We also discuss the current state of the model extensions to mergers of Proca stars with different masses, and the particular challenges that these present. The models are divided in two main categories: two-stage and monolithic. In the two-stage models, a dimensional reduction algorithm is applied to embed the data in a reduced feature space, which is then interpolated in terms of the physical parameters. For the monolithic models, a single neural network is trained to predict the waveform from the input physical parameter. Our model displays mismatches below $10^{-3}$ with respect to the original numerical waveforms. Finally, we demonstrate the usage of our model in full Bayesian parameter inference through the accurate recovery of numerical relativity signals injected in zero-noise, together with the analysis of GW190521. For the latter, we observe excellent agreement with existing results that make use of full numerical relativity.</description>

      <title>Breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy in strong lensing mass modeling with weak lensing observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubble constant ($H_0$), a crucial parameter in cosmology, quantifies the expansion rate of the universe so its precise measurement is important to understand the fundamental dynamics of our evolving universe. One of the major limitations of measuring $H_0$ using time-delay cosmography is the presence of the mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD) in the lens mass modeling. We propose and quantitatively assess the use of galaxy-galaxy shear measurements to break the MSD in the strong lensing mass modeling. We use stacked galaxy-galaxy lensing profiles and corresponding covariance matrices from Huang et al. (2022) to constrain the MSD in lens mass modeling with a highly flexible mass profile. Our analyses show that if ideally all galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey can be used to constrain the MSD, we can achieve $\sim 10\%$ precision on the MSD constraint. We forecast that galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements from LSST-like surveys can in general constrain the MSD with $\sim 1-3\%$ precision. Furthermore, if we push weak lensing measurements to a lower angular scale of $\sim 0.04$ $\rm Mpc$, a survey like LSST can provide $\sim 1\%$ precision on the MSD constraint, enabling a measurement of $H_0$ at the $1\%$ level. We demonstrate that galaxy-galaxy weak lensing can robustly constrain the MSD independent of stellar kinematics of the deflector, with wide-field survey data alone.</description>

Abstract: This note addresses the effects of long-ranged and/or retarded interactions on the bosonic collective modes in the so-called 'strange metals'. Recently, there have been conflicting reports on the very existence of such stable collective excitations and their properties. Extending a number of approaches that were previously used in the analyses of the standard Fermi liquid one finds evidence for, both, conventional and novel behaviors of the non-Fermi-liquid counterparts of the zero-, shear-, and other 'sounds'.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss Riemannian geometry of one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator. Its wavefunction is a holomorphic section of the complex line bundle $L_{\sf{v}}$ over the phase space $\mathbb{R}^2$. We show that the energy eigenfunctions $\psi_n$ with $n\ge 1$, corresponding to the energy levels $E_n$, are complex coordinates on orbifolds $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}_n$ embedded into $L_{\sf{v}}$, where $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is the cyclic group of order $n$. In fact, $\psi_n (t,z)$ is a standing wave on $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}_n$, where $z$ is a complex coordinate on the phase space $\mathbb{R}^2\cong\mathbb{C}$. Oscillators are characterized by two quantum charges $(q_l^{}, q_{\sf{v}})=(n,1)$, where $q_l^{}=n$ is the winding number for the group U(1) acting on $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}_n$ and $q_{\sf{v}}^{}=1$ is the winding number for the U(1)-rotations on fibres of the bundle $L_{\sf{v}}\to\mathbb{R}^2$, and $E_n=\hbar\omega(q_l^{}+\frac{1}{2} q_{\sf{v}}).$ We also discuss ``antioscillators" with opposite quantum charges and the same positive energy.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we extend the Hartle-Thorne formalism for anisotropic pressure condition in Rastall gravity. As an implication, Tolman-Oppeneimer-Volkoff equation in anisotropic form is modified. The equations in anisotropic Hartle-Thorne formalism are also modified due to the appearance of $\lambda$, i.e. a constant that quantifies the deviation of Rastall gravity from general relativity. However, our results do not cover $\kappa\lambda=1/4$ and $\lambda=1/6$, since both would mathematically give singularity in the calculation.</description>

      <title>BOSS Constraints on Massive Particles during Inflation: The Cosmological Collider in Action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive particles leave imprints on primordial non-Gaussianity via couplings to the inflaton, even despite their exponential dilution during inflation: practically, the Universe acts as a Cosmological Collider. We present the first dedicated search for spin-zero particles using BOSS redshift-space galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum multipoles, as well as Planck CMB non-Gaussianity data. We demonstrate that some Cosmological Collider models are well approximated by the standard equilateral and orthogonal parametrization; assuming negligible inflaton self-interactions, this facilitates us translating Planck non-Gaussianity constraints into bounds on Collider models. Many models have signatures that are not degenerate with equilateral and orthogonal non-Gaussianity and thus require dedicated searches. Here, we constrain such models using BOSS three-dimensional redshift-space galaxy clustering data, focusing on spin-zero particles in the principal series and constraining their couplings to the inflaton at varying speed and mass, marginalizing over the unknown inflaton self-interactions. This is made possible through an improvement in Cosmological Bootstrap techniques and the combination of perturbation theory and halo occupation distribution models for galaxy clustering. Our work sets the standard for inflationary spectroscopy with cosmological observations, providing the ultimate link between physics on the largest and smallest scales.</description>

Abstract: In this article we analyze the role of an external electric field, in the weak field approximation, on $\pi$-$\pi$ scattering lengths. The discussion is presented in the frame of the linear sigma model. To achieve this, we take into account all one-loop corrections in the $s$, $t$, and $u$ channels associated with the insertion of a Schwinger propagator for charged pions, focusing on the region characterized by small values of the electric field. Furthermore, one of the novelties of our work is the explicit calculation of box diagrams, which were previously overlooked in discussions regarding magnetic corrections. It turns out that the electric field corrections have an opposite effect with respect to magnetic corrections calculated previously in the literature.</description>

Abstract: The study of entanglement in gauge theories is expected to provide insights into many fundamental phenomena, including confinement. However, calculations of quantities related to entanglement in gauge theories are limited by ambiguities that stem from the non-factorizability of the Hilbert space. In this work we study lattice gauge theories that admit a dual description in terms of spin models, for which the replica trick and R\'enyi entropies are well defined. In the first part of this work, we explicitly perform the duality transformation in a replica geometry, deriving the structure of a replica space for a gauge theory. Then, in the second part, we calculate, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, the entropic c-function of the $\Z_2$ gauge theory in three spacetime dimension, exploiting its dual description in terms of the three-dimensional Ising model.</description>

      <title>Impact of The Newly Revised Gravitational Redshift of X-ray Burster GS 1826-24 on The Equation of State of Supradense Neutron-Rich Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thanks to the recent advancement in producing rare isotopes and measuring their masses with unprecedented precision, the updated nuclear masses around the waiting-point nucleus $^{64}$Ge in the rapid-proton capture process have led to a significant revision of the surface gravitational redshift of the neutron star (NS) in GS 1826-24 by re-fitting its X-ray burst light curve ({\it X. Zhou et al., Nature Physics {\bf 19}, 1091 (2023)}) using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). The resulting NS compactness $\xi$ is between 0.244 and 0.342 at 95\% confidence level and its upper boundary is significantly smaller than the maximum $\xi$ previously known. Incorporating this new data within a comprehensive Bayesian statistical framework, we investigate its impact on the Equation of State (EOS) of supradense neutron-rich matter and the required spin frequency for GW190814's minor $m_2$ with mass $2.59\pm 0.05$M$_{\odot}$ to be a rotationally stable pulsar. We found that the EOS of high-density symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) has to be softened significantly while the symmetry energy at supersaturation densities stiffened compared to our prior knowledge from earlier analyses using data from both astrophysical observations and terrestrial nuclear experiments. In particular, the skewness $J_0$ characterizing the stiffness of high-density SNM decreases significantly, while the slope $L$, curvature $K_{\rm{sym}}$, and skewness $J_{\rm{sym}}$ of nuclear symmetry energy all increase appreciably compared to their fiducial values. We also found that the most probable spin rate for the $m_2$ to be a stable pulsar is very close to its mass-shedding limit once the revised redshift data from GS 1826-24 is considered, making the $m_2$ unlikely the most massive NS observed so far.</description>

Abstract: We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for order-2 $CP$ ($CP2$) symmetry in $N$-Higgs-doublet potentials for $N&gt;2$. The conditions, which are formulated as relations between vectors that transform under the adjoint representation of $\mathsf{SU}(N)$ under a change of doublet basis, are representation theoretical in nature. Making use of Lie algebra and representation theory we devise an efficient, computable algorithm which may be applied to decide whether or not a given numerical potential is $CP2$ invariant.</description>

Abstract: Neutrino propagation in the Galactic magnetic field is considered. To describe neutrino flavour and spin oscillations on the galactic scale baselines an approach using wave packets is developed. Evolution equations for the neutrino wave packets in a uniform and non-uniform magnetic field are derived. Analytical expressions for neutrino flavour and spin oscillations probabilities accounting for damping due to wave packet separation are obtained for the case of uniform magnetic field. It is shown that for oscillations on magnetic frequencies $\omega_i^B = \mu_i B_\perp$ the coherence lengths that characterizes the damping scale is proportional to the cube of neutrino average momentum $p_0^3$. Probabilities of flavour and spin oscillations are calculated numerically for neutrino interacting with the non-uniform Galactic magnetic field. Flavour compositions of high-energy neutrino flux coming from the Galactic centre are calculated accounting for neutrino interaction with the magnetic field. It is shown that for neutrino magnetic moments $\sim 10^{-13} \mu_B$ and larger these flavour compositions significantly differ from ones predicted by the vacuum neutrino oscillations scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the maximal Bell violation for a generic qubit-qudit system, obtaining easily computable expressions in arbitrary qudit dimension. This work generalizes the well-known Horodeckis's result for a qubit-qubit system. We also give simple lower and upper bounds on that violation and study the possibility of improving the amount of Bell-violation by embedding the qudit Hilbert space in one of larger dimension. The results are illustrated with a family of density matrices in the context of a qubit-qutrit system.</description>

      <title>Solution to the cosmological constant problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I propose an observationally and theoretically consistent resolution of the cosmological constant problem: $\Lambda$ is a counterterm - with a running coupling - that balances the monopole celestial sky average of the kinetic energy of expansion of inhomogeneously distributed `small' cosmic voids. No other dark energy source is required. This solution relies on the first investigation of void statistics in cosmological simulations in full general relativity (arXiv:2403.15134). Results are consistent with parameters of the Timescape model of cosmological backreaction. Crucially, dynamical spatial curvature arises as time-varying spatial gradients of the kinetic spatial curvature, and depends directly on the void volume fraction. Its monopole average generates the cosmological term. This result potentially resolves the Hubble tension and offers new approaches to tackling other tensions and anomalies.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the integrability of the boundary state arising from the subdeterminant operators in the alternating SU(4) spin chain in ABJM theory. Our findings show that the resulting matrix product states are only integrable for two special giant gravitons, including the maximal giant graviton. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to more general boundary states.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Islands from Hilbert Space Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.17004v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a mechanism to generate entanglement islands in quantum systems from a purely quantum information perspective. More explicitly we show that, if we impose certain constraints on a quantum system by projecting out certain states in the Hilbert space, it is possible that for all the states remaining in the reduced Hilbert space, there exits subsets $I_a$ whose states are encoded in the states of another subset $\mathcal{R}_a$. Then the subsets $\{I_a\}$ are just the entanglement islands of the corresponding subsets $\{\mathcal{R}_a\}$. We call such a system self-encoded, and find that the entanglement entropy in such systems should be calculated by a new island formula. We give a comparison between our new island formula and island formula in gravitational theories. Inspired by our mechanism, we propose a simulation of the AdS/BCFT correspondence and the island phases in this context via a holographic CFT$_2$ with a special Weyl transformation.</description>

      <title>On the Proof of Chiral Symmetry Breaking from Anomaly Matching in QCD-like Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We critically reconsider the argument based on 't Hooft anomaly matching that aims at proving chiral symmetry breaking in 4d QCD-like theories with $N_c&gt;2$ colors and $N_f$ flavors. The main line of reasoning relies on a property of the solutions of the anomaly matching and persistent mass equations called $N_f$-independence. In previous works, the validity of $N_f$-independence was assumed based on qualitative arguments, but it was never proven rigorously. We provide a detailed proof and clarify under which (dynamical) conditions it holds. Our results are valid for a generic spectrum of massless composite fermions including baryons and exotics.</description>

Abstract: The classification of emergent spinor fields according to modified bilinear covariants is scrutinized, in spacetimes with nontrivial topology, which induce inequivalent spin structures. Extended Clifford algebras, constructed by equipping the underlying spacetime with an extended bilinear form with additional terms coming from the nontrivial topology, naturally yield emergent extended algebraic spinor fields and their subsequent extended bilinear covariants, which are contrasted to the classical spinor classification. An unexpected duality between the standard and the exotic spinor field classes is therefore established, showing that a complementary fusion process among the spinor field classes sets in, when extended Clifford bundles are addressed in multiply-connected spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: We present an explicit formula for the Stokes automorphism acting on the topological string partition function. When written in terms of the dual partition function, our formula implies that flat coordinates in topological string theory transform as quantum periods, and according to the Delabaere-Dillinger-Pham formula. We first show how the formula follows from the non-linear Stokes phenomenon of the Painlev\'e I equation, together with the connection between its $\tau$-function and topological strings on elliptic curves. Then, we show that this formula is also a consequence of a recent conjecture on the resurgent structure of the topological string, based on the holomorphic anomaly equations, and it is in fact valid for arbitrary Calabi-Yau threefolds.</description>

      <title>Correlation function of flavored fermion in holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13357v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the gauge-gravity duality, we investigate the correlation function of flavored fermion in the \mathrm{D}_{p}/\mathrm{D}_{p+4} model as top-down approaches of holographic QCD for p=4,3. The bulk spinor, as the source of the flavored fermion in QCD, is identified to the worldvolume fermion on the flavor \mathrm{D}_{p+4}-branes and the standard form of its action can be therefore obtained by the T-duality rules in string theory. Keeping this in hand, we afterwards generalize the prescription for two-point correlation function in AdS/CFT dictionary into general D-brane backgrounds and apply it to the case of p=4,3, i.e. the D4/D8 and D3/D7 approach respectively. Resultantly, our numerical calculation with the bubble background always displays discrete peaks in the correlation functions which imply the bound states created by the flavored fermions as the confinement in QCD. With the black brane background, the onshell condition illustrated by the correlation function covers basically the dispersion curves of fermion obtained by the hard thermal loop approximation in the hot medium. Finally, we interpret the flavored fermions in the bubble background as baryons by taking into account a baryon vertex, then find the two-point correlation function is able to fit the lowest baryon spectrum. In this sense, we conclude remarkably that our top-down approach in this work could reveal the fundamental properties of QCD both in the confined and deconfined phase.</description>

      <title>3-point function of currents for holographic cosmology and monopole non-Gaussianities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present the calculation of the three-point function in momentum space of currents for a $SO(3)$ global symmetry, in a three-dimensional toy model within phenomenological holographic cosmology. Since the two-point function gives, via electric-magnetic duality, the resolution of the cosmological monopole problem, the three-point function is related to the monopole non-Gaussianities. We check that the final result is UV and IR finite and satisfies the transverse Ward identities and consider the $k_1\ll k_2,k_3$ case, relevant for cosmology. We also show that the two-loop result for the 3-point function is completely independent of the explicit form of the potential, meaning that, like the solution to the monopole problem, also the non-Gaussianities are universal within the phenomenological holographic cosmology.</description>

      <title>Universal IR Holography, Scalar Fluctuations and Glueball spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07823v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the d'Alembertian operator with a possible mass term in the AdS soliton and more general confining gravity dual backrounds admits infinitely many different spectra. These can be interpreted as different theories in the infrared and correspond to multitrace deformations of either the Dirichlet or the Neumann theory. We prove that all these fluctuations are normalizable and provide examples of their spectra. Therefore, the AdS soliton can be interpreted as giving a holographic RG flow between an universal UV theory at the AdS boundary and these infinitely many possibilities in the IR, obtained by deformations. The massive spectrum of the double trace deformation in $AdS_5$ allows the matching of the large-$N$ glueball masses of lattice $QCD_3$; the ratio of the ground states of the $2^{++}$ and $0^{++}$ channels are in full agreement with the lattice prediction. When considering $AdS_7$ and the 4-dimensional pure glue theory, a remarkably general picture emerges, where we can write formulas for the fluctuations that are in agreement with ones from holographic high-energy scattering and from AdS/CFT with IR and UV cut-off. We point out that this log branch in the IR in $D$-dimensions can be seen as the usual logarithmic branch of scalar fields saturating the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound in a conformally rescaled metric, with $AdS_{D-1}\times S^1$ asymptotics.</description>

Abstract: We prove the Strominger-Thompson quantum Bousso bound in the infinite class of conformal vacua in semiclassical JT gravity, with postive or negative cosmological constant. The Bousso-Fisher-Leichenauer-Wall quantum Bousso bound follows from an analogous derivation, requiring only initial quantum non-expansion. In this process, we show that the quantity ${2\pi k^{\mu}k^{\nu}&lt;:T_{\mu\nu}:&gt;-S''-\frac{6}{c}(S')^2}$ vanishes in any vacuum state, entailing a stronger version of Wall's quantum null energy condition. We derive an entropy formula in the presence of a generic class of two reflecting boundaries, in order to apply our argument to the half reduction model of de Sitter JT gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive gravitational backgrounds that are asymptotically Anti-de Sitter, have a regular black hole horizon and which deep in the interior exhibit mixmaster chaotic dynamics. The solutions are obtained by coupling gravity with a negative cosmological constant to three massive vector fields, within an Ansatz that reduces to ordinary differential equations. At late interior times the equations are identical to those analysed in depth by Misner and by Belinskii-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz fifty years ago. We review and extend known classical and semiclassical results on the interior chaos, formulated as both a dynamical system of `Kasner eras' and as a hyperbolic billiards problem. The volume of the universe collapses doubly-exponentially over each Kasner era. A remarkable feature is the emergence of a conserved energy, and hence a `time-independent' Hamiltonian, at asymptotically late interior times. A quantisation of this Hamiltonian exhibits arithmetic chaos associated with the principal congruence subgroup $\Gamma(2)$ of the modular group. We compute a large number of eigenvalues numerically to obtain the spectral form factor. While the spectral statistics is anomalous for a chaotic system, the eigenfunctions themselves display random matrix behaviour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using spread complexity and spread entropy, we study non-unitary quantum dynamics. For non-hermitian Hamiltonians, we extend the bi-Lanczos construction for the Krylov basis to the Schr\"odinger picture. Moreover, we implement an algorithm adapted to complex symmetric Hamiltonians. This reduces the computational memory requirements by half compared to the bi-Lanczos construction. We apply this construction to the one-dimensional tight-binding Hamiltonian subject to repeated measurements at fixed small time intervals, resulting in effective non-unitary dynamics. We find that the spread complexity initially grows with time, followed by an extended decay period and saturation. The choice of initial state determines the saturation value of complexity and entropy. In analogy to measurement-induced phase transitions, we consider a quench between hermitian and non-hermitian Hamiltonian evolution induced by turning on regular measurements at different frequencies. We find that as a function of the measurement frequency, the time at which the spread complexity starts growing increases. This time asymptotes to infinity when the time gap between measurements is taken to zero, indicating the onset of the quantum Zeno effect, according to which measurements impede time evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the complexity equals volume proposal for planar black holes in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime in 2+1 dimensions, with an end of the world (ETW) brane behind the horizon. We allow for the possibility of intrinsic gravitational dynamics in the form of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity to be localized on the brane. We compute the asymptotic rate of change of volume complexity analytically and obtain the full time dependence using numerical techniques. We find that the inclusion of JT gravity on the brane leads to interesting effects on time dependence of holographic complexity. We identify the region in parameter space (the brane location and the JT coupling) for which the rate of change of complexity violates the Lloyd bound. In an equivalent description of the model in terms of an asymptotically AdS wormhole, we connect the violation of the Lloyd bound to the violation of a suitable energy condition in the bulk that we introduce. We also compare the Lloyd bound constraints to previously derived constraints on the bulk parameters in this model that are based on bounds on entanglement growth in the dual CFT state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The universal eigenvalue distribution characterizing the Gram matrix of semiclassical ensembles of black hole microstates is recognized as the Marchenko-Pastur distribution, which plays a prominent role as the universal limit distribution in a large class of random matrix and vector models. It is proposed that this distribution also universally determines the energy spectral density of black holes, which allows to construct a Krylov space for the time evolution of typical black hole states and calculate their state complexity. It is checked that the state complexity growth at late times saturates Lloyd's bound. Some implications of the proposed spectral density for the generation of Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We explore non-equilibrium processes in two-dimensional conformal field theories (2d CFTs) due to the growth of operators induced by inhomogeneous and homogeneous Hamiltonians by investigating the time dependence of the partition function, energy density, and entanglement entropy. The non-equilibrium processes considered in this paper are constructed out of the Lorentzian and Euclidean time evolution governed by different Hamiltonians. We explore the effect of the time ordering on entanglement dynamics so that we find that in a free boson CFT and RCFTs, this time ordering does not affect the entanglement entropy, while in the holographic CFTs, it does. Our main finding is that in the holographic CFTs, the non-unitary time evolution induced by the inhomogeneous Hamiltonian can retain the initial state information longer than in the unitary time evolution.</description>

      <title>Estimating truncation effects of quantum bosonic systems using sampling algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To simulate bosons on a qubit- or qudit-based quantum computer, one has to regularize the theory by truncating infinite-dimensional local Hilbert spaces to finite dimensions. In the search for practical quantum applications, it is important to know how big the truncation errors can be. In general, it is not easy to estimate errors unless we have a good quantum computer. In this paper, we show that traditional sampling methods on classical devices, specifically Markov Chain Monte Carlo, can address this issue for a rather generic class of bosonic systems with a reasonable amount of computational resources available today. As a demonstration, we apply this idea to the scalar field theory on a two-dimensional lattice, with a size that goes beyond what is achievable using exact diagonalization methods. This method can be used to estimate the resources needed for realistic quantum simulations of bosonic theories, and also, to check the validity of the results of the corresponding quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Drag force and heavy quark potential in a rotating background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explored the gravity dual of a rotating quark-gluon plasma by transforming the boundary coordinates of the large black hole limit of Schwarchild-$\text{AdS}_5$ metric. The Euler-Lagrange equation of the Nambu-Goto action and its solution become more complex than those without rotation. For small angular velocity, we obtained an analytical form of the drag force acting on a quark moving in the direction of the rotation axis and found it stronger than that without rotation. We also calculated the heavy quark potential under the same approximation. For the quarkonium symmetric with respect to the rotation axis, the depth of the potential is reduced by the rotation. For the quarkonium oriented in parallel to the rotation axis, the binding force is weakened and the force range becomes longer. We also compared our holographic formulation with others in the literature.</description>

      <title>Thin-shell gravastar in a noncommutative BTZ geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we build a thin-shell gravastar model within a noncommutative BTZ geometry. For this, we consider a noncommutative BTZ metric in the inner region and a geometry associated with a BTZ solution in the outer region, joined by the generalized join technique. After investigating the inner spacetime, surface and outer spacetime, we observe that there is a surface energy density and surface pressure, such as to make gravastar stable. This effect persists even when the cosmological constant is zero. Besides, we found a bound for the noncommutativity parameter. In addition, we examine the thermodynamics of the noncommutative BTZ black hole in Schwarzschildtype form in three-dimensional spacetime. We also check the stability condition by calculating the specific heat capacity.</description>

      <title>Lattice Regularization of Reduced K\"{a}hler-Dirac Fermions and Connections to Chiral Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how a path integral for reduced K\"{a}hler-Dirac fermions suffers from a phase ambiguity associated with the fermion measure that is an analog of the measure problem seen for chiral fermions. However, unlike the case of chiral symmetry, a doubler free lattice action exists which is invariant under the corresponding onsite symmetry. This allows for a clear diagnosis and solution to the problem using mirror fermions resulting in a unique gauge invariant measure. By introducing an appropriate set of Yukawa interactions which are consistent with 't Hooft anomaly cancellation we conjecture the mirrors can be decoupled from low energy physics. Moreover, the minimal such K\"{a}hler-Dirac mirror model yields a light sector which corresponds, in the flat space continuum limit, to the Pati-Salam GUT model.</description>

      <title>A gamma ray study of Galactic PeVatron candidates LHAASO J1825-1236 and J1839-0545</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies by LHAASO have shown the presence of high-luminosity PeVatrons in our Galaxy. We examine two notable sources, each consisting of two pulsars, detected by LHAASO. We study gamma and cosmic-ray emissions from these surrounding pulsars. We simulated particle propagation throughout the Galaxy using the GALPROP software, accounting for emission from energy losses due to spin-down. As a result, we present the particle spectra generated during this propagation phase along with the corresponding gamma-ray emission. Furthermore, we used the Gammapy software to perform gamma-ray measurements from these sources in anticipation of future analyses to be carried out with the CTA observatory, which is now under development. The findings suggest that CTA may have the capability to detect these sources and show that the data can be explained by gamma rays coming from a leptonic model.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Multipoles in Five Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define gravitational mass and current multipoles for five-dimensional, stationary, and asymptotically flat vacuum metrics. We do this by generalizing Thorne's asymptotically Cartesian and mass-centered (ACMC) coordinate formalism to five dimensions, and prove that the multipoles defined in this way are unambiguously well-defined. Further, these two towers of multipole tensors, in the case of biaxial symmetry, reduce to a tower of mass multipoles $M_\ell$, and two separate towers of current or angular momentum multipoles $S^{(1)}_\ell, S^{(2)}_\ell$. We apply our formalism to a few examples, in particular Myers-Perry black holes, black rings, and smooth multicentered geometries.</description>

      <title>Observational signatures of Rotating compact objects in Plasma space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the characteristics of shadows cast by the Kerr black hole in the presence of plasma and compared them to those of a rotating wormhole in a uniform plasma space-time for an observer at infinity. Interestingly, for the same uniform plasma density, the apparent shadow size of the rotating wormhole is always greater than that of the Kerr black hole. To further distinguish the two compact objects we studied the deflection angle and did a comparative study in the presence of the uniform and non-uniform plasma profiles. The goal of this whole exercise is to deepen our understanding of the observational phenomena of these astrophysical objects. The analysis reveals the importance of specific plasma distribution profiles, the impact of plasma on the shadow diameter, and the behavior of deflection angles in different plasma scenarios. We have calculated constraints on the plasma parameters by considering observational data and employing analytical formulations. Our work therefore provides valuable insights into the behavior of light rays near compact objects in plasma space-time.</description>

      <title>Action of the axial $U(1)$ non-invertible symmetry on the 't~Hooft line operator: A lattice gauge theory study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how the symmetry operator of the axial $U(1)$ non-invertible symmetry acts on the 't~Hooft line operator in the $U(1)$ gauge theory by employing the modified Villain-type lattice formulation. We model the axial anomaly by a compact scalar boson, the ``QED axion''. For the gauge invariance, the simple 't~Hooft line operator, which is defined by a line integral of the dual $U(1)$ gauge potential, must be ``dressed'' by the scalar and $U(1)$ gauge fields. A careful consideration on the basis of the anomalous Ward--Takahashi identity containing the 't~Hooft operator with the dressing factor and a precise definition of the symmetry operator on the lattice shows that the symmetry operator leaves no effect when it sweeps out a 't~Hooft loop operator. This result appears inequivalent with the phenomenon concluded in the continuum theory. The same result is obtained for the axion string operator.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Spatially Varying Cosmological Constant Induced by Field Fluctuations in Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in our universe have sparked controversy. In this study, we explore the hypothesis that some of these black holes may have seeded from the direct collapse of dark energy domains with density significantly higher than the surrounding regions. The mechanism of the origin of such domains relies on the inflationary evolution of a scalar field acting in D dimensions, which is associated with the cosmological constant in our four-dimensional spacetime manifold. Inner space quantum fluctuations of the field during inflation are responsible for the spatial variations of the dark energy density in our space. This finding holds particular significance, especially considering recent evidence from pulsar timing array observations, which supports the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background consisting of SMBH mergers.</description>
