      <title>Precise Antigen-Antibody Structure Predictions Enhance Antibody Development with HelixFold-Multimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of antigen-antibody structures is essential for advancing immunology and therapeutic development, as it helps elucidate molecular interactions that underlie immune responses. Despite recent progress with deep learning models like AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold, accurately modeling antigen-antibody complexes remains a challenge due to their unique evolutionary characteristics. HelixFold-Multimer, a specialized model developed for this purpose, builds on the framework of AlphaFold-Multimer and demonstrates improved precision for antigen-antibody structures. HelixFold-Multimer not only surpasses other models in accuracy but also provides essential insights into antibody development, enabling more precise identification of binding sites, improved interaction prediction, and enhanced design of therapeutic antibodies. These advances underscore HelixFold-Multimer's potential in supporting antibody research and therapeutic innovation.</description>

      <title>Denture reinforcement via topology optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a computational design method that optimizes the reinforcement of dentures and increases the stiffness of dentures. Our approach optimally places reinforcement in the denture, which modern multi-material three-dimensional printers could implement. The study focuses on reducing denture displacement by identifying regions that require reinforcement (E-glass material) with the help of topology optimization. Our method is applied to a three-dimensional complete lower jaw denture. We compare the displacement results of a non-reinforced denture and a reinforced denture that has two materials. The comparison results indicate that there is a decrease in the displacement in the reinforced denture. Considering node-based displacement distribution, the reinforcement reduces the displacement magnitudes in the reinforced denture compared to the non-reinforced denture. The study guides dental technicians on where to automatically place reinforcement in the fabrication process, helping them save time and reduce material usage.</description>

      <title>Robust Aggregation of Electric Vehicle Flexiblity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of characterizing the aggregate flexibility in populations of electric vehicles (EVs) with uncertain charging requirements. Extending upon prior results that provide exact characterizations of aggregate flexibility in populations of electric vehicle (EVs), we adapt the framework to encompass more general charging requirements. In doing so we give a characterization of the exact aggregate flexibility as a generalized polymatroid. Furthermore, this paper advances these aggregation methodologies to address the case in which charging requirements are uncertain. In this extended framework, requirements are instead sampled from a specified distribution. In particular, we construct robust aggregate flexibility sets, sets of aggregate charging profiles over which we can provide probabilistic guarantees that actual realized populations will be able to track. By leveraging measure concentration results that establish powerful finite sample guarantees, we are able to give tight bounds on these robust flexibility sets, even in low sample regimes that are well suited for aggregating small populations of EVs. We detail explicit methods of calculating these sets. Finally, we provide numerical results that validate our results and case studies that demonstrate the applicability of the theory developed herein.</description>
