      <title>Binary Outcome Models with Extreme Covariates: Estimation and Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel semiparametric method to study the effects of extreme events on binary outcomes and subsequently forecast future outcomes. Our approach, based on Bayes' theorem and regularly varying (RV) functions, facilitates a Pareto approximation in the tail without imposing parametric assumptions beyond the tail. We analyze cross-sectional as well as static and dynamic panel data models, incorporate additional covariates, and accommodate the unobserved unit-specific tail thickness and RV functions in panel data. We establish consistency and asymptotic normality of our tail estimator, and show that our objective function converges to that of a panel Logit regression on tail observations with the log extreme covariate as a regressor, thereby simplifying implementation. The empirical application assesses whether small banks become riskier when local housing prices sharply decline, a crucial channel in the 2007--2008 financial crisis.</description>

      <title>Conditional Triple Difference-in-Differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triple difference-in-differences (TDID) designs are widely used in empirical research to estimate causal effects. In practice, most implementations rely on a specification with controls. However, we show that such approaches introduce bias due to differences in covariate distributions across groups. To address this issue, we propose a re-weighted estimator that correctly identifies a causal estimand of interest by aligning covariate distributions across groups. For estimation, we develop a double-robust approach, for which an accompanying R package is provided.</description>

      <title>Optimal Salaries of Researchers with Motivational Emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of scientific policy and science management, this study examines the system of nonuniform wage distribution for researchers. A nonlinear mathematical model of optimal remuneration for scientific workers has been developed, considering key and additive aspects of scientific activity: basic qualifications, research productivity, collaborative projects, skill enhancement, distinctions, and international collaborations. Unlike traditional linear schemes, the proposed approach is based on exponential and logarithmic dependencies, allowing for the consideration of saturation effects and preventing artificial wage growth due to mechanical increases in scientific productivity indicators.
  The study includes detailed calculations of optimal, minimum, and maximum wages, demonstrating a fair distribution of remuneration on the basis of researcher productivity. A linear increase in publication activity or grant funding should not lead to uncontrolled salary growth, thus avoiding distortions in the motivational system. The results of this study can be used to reform and modernize the wage system for researchers in Kazakhstan and other countries, as well as to optimize grant-based science funding mechanisms. The proposed methodology fosters scientific motivation, long-term productivity, and the internationalization of research while also promoting self-actualization and ultimately forming an adequate and authentic reward system for the research community.
  Specifically, in resource-limited scientific systems, science policy should focus on the qualitative development of individual researchers rather than quantitative expansion (e.g., increasing the number of scientists). This can be achieved through the productive progress of their motivation and self-actualization.</description>

      <title>Efficient Estimation of Structural Models via Sieves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.13488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a class of sieve-based efficient estimators for structural models (SEES), which approximate the solution using a linear combination of basis functions and impose equilibrium conditions as a penalty to determine the best-fitting coefficients. Our estimators avoid the need to repeatedly solve the model, apply to a broad class of models, and are consistent, asymptotically normal, and asymptotically efficient. Moreover, they solve unconstrained optimization problems with fewer unknowns and offer convenient standard error calculations. As an illustration, we apply our method to an entry game between Walmart and Kmart.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Representations for Sequential Decisions, Adaptive Experiments, and Batched Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop asymptotic approximations that can be applied to sequential estimation and inference problems, adaptive randomized controlled trials, and related settings. In batched adaptive settings where the decision at one stage can affect the observation of variables in later stages, our asymptotic representation characterizes all limit distributions attainable through a joint choice of an adaptive design rule and statistics applied to the adaptively generated data. This facilitates local power analysis of tests, comparison of adaptive treatments rules, and other analyses of batchwise sequential statistical decision rules.</description>

      <title>Correcting invalid regression discontinuity designs with multiple time period data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regression Discontinuity (RD) designs rely on the continuity of potential outcome means at the cutoff, but this assumption often fails when other treatments or policies are implemented at this cutoff. We characterize the bias in sharp and fuzzy RD designs due to violations of continuity, and develop a general identification framework that leverages multiple time periods to estimate local effects on the (un)treated. We extend the framework to settings with carry-over effects and time-varying running variables, highlighting additional assumptions needed for valid causal inference. We propose an estimation framework that extends the conventional and bias-corrected single-period local linear regression framework to multiple periods and different sampling schemes, and study its finite-sample performance in simulations. Finally, we revisit a prior study on fiscal rules in Italy to illustrate the practical utility of our approach.</description>
