      <title>Existentially closed models and locally zero-dimensional toposes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of an existentially closed model is generalised to a property of geometric morphisms between toposes. We show that important properties of existentially closed models extend to existentially closed geometric morphisms, such as the fact that every model admits a homomorphism to an existentially closed one. Other properties do not generalise: classically, there are two equivalent definitions of an existentially closed model, but this equivalence breaks down for the generalised notion. We study the interaction of these two conditions on the topos-theoretic level, and characterise the classifying topos of the e.c. geometric morphisms when the conditions coincide.</description>

      <title>Non-linear microlocal cut-off functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To any conic closed set of a cotangent bundle, one can associate 4 functors on the category of sheaves, which are called non-linear microlocal cut-off functors. Here we explain their relation with the microlocal cut-off functor defined by Kashiwara and Schapira, and prove a microlocal cut-off lemma for non-linear microlocal cut-off functors, adapting inputs from symplectic geometry. We also prove two K\"unneth formulas and a functor classification result for categories of sheaves with microsupport conditions.</description>

      <title>Spectral sequences via linear presheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study homotopy theory of the category of spectral sequences with respect to the class of weak equivalences given by maps which are quasi-isomorphisms on a fixed page. We introduce the category of extended spectral sequences and show that this is bicomplete by analysis of a certain linear presheaf category modelled on discs. We endow the category of extended spectral sequences with various model category structures, restricting to give the almost Brown category structures on spectral sequences of our earlier work. One of these has the property that spectral sequences is a homotopically full subcategory. By results of Meier, this exhibits the category of spectral sequences as a fibrant object in the Barwick-Kan model structure on relative categories, that is, it gives a model for an infinity category of spectral sequences. We also use the presheaf approach to define two d\'ecalage functors on spectral sequences, left and right adjoint to a shift functor, thereby clarifying prior use of the term d\'ecalage in connection with spectral sequences.</description>

      <title>Approximation properties of torsion classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We clarify some results of Bagaria and Magidor \cite{MR3152715} about the relationship between large cardinals and torsion classes of abelian groups, and prove that (1) the Maximum Deconstructibility principle introduced in \cite{Cox_MaxDecon} requires large cardinals; it sits, implication-wise, between Vop\v{e}nka's Principle and the existence of an $\omega_1$-strongly compact cardinal. (2) While deconstructibility of a class of modules always implies the precovering property by \cite{MR2822215}, the concepts are (consistently) non-equivalent, even for classes of abelian groups closed under extensions, homomorphic images, and colimits.</description>

      <title>The Euler Characteristic of Finite Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We associate a rational number $\chi(\mathcal{A})$ to every category $\mathcal{A}$ whose object and morphism sets are finite. We show that the assignment $\chi$ is additive under disjoint union and it preserves products. Hence we consider $\chi$ as an Euler measure on a family of categories where this assignment also obeys a version of the inclusion--exclusion principle.</description>
