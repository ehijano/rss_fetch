      <title>Non-Fermi liquids from subsystem symmetry breaking in van der Waals multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous breaking of subsystem symmetry in a stack of two-dimensional Fermi liquid metals, each maintaining a subsystem number conservation symmetry, driven by interlayer exciton condensation. The resulting Goldstone modes in this broken symmetry phase couple to the quasiparticle current perpendicular to the layers. This coupling, which remains non-zero for small momentum transfers, leads to the emergence of a three-dimensional anisotropic marginal Fermi liquid state when the number of layers is sufficiently large. We propose a possible experimental realization of this phenomenon in two-dimensional multilayer van der Waals heterostructures. Using self-consistent mean-field calculations, we characterize the subsystem symmetry-broken metallic state and examine the effects of fluctuations on its physical properties within the random phase approximation. We find that these fluctuations produce additional logarithmic enhancements to the specific heat at low temperature, specifically $C\sim T (\log(1/T))^2$.</description>

      <title>Spin-liquid-based topological qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological quantum computation relies on control of non-Abelian anyons for inherently fault-tolerant storage and processing of quantum information. By now, blueprints for topological qubits are well developed for electrically active topological superconductor and fractional quantum Hall platforms. We leverage recent insights into the creation and detection of non-Abelian anyons in electrically insulating spin systems to propose topological qubit architectures based on quantum spin liquids. We present two types of prototype designs that enable the requisite control in a potentially scalable framework: one invokes spin liquids integrated into magnetic tunnel junction arrays, the other uses semiconductor-spin liquid hybrids. We further identify various protocols for interrogating spin-liquid-based topological qubits, both to validate the underlying principles of topological quantum computation and to establish gates required for universal quantum computation. These results provide long-term direction for experimental investigation of Kitaev materials and potentially other solid-state spin liquid hosts.</description>

      <title>Anyon polarons as a window into the competing phases of the Kitaev honeycomb model under a Zeeman field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the spectra of anyon quasiparticles in all three super-selection sectors of the Kitaev model (i.e., visons, fermions and bosons), perturbed by a Zeeman field away from its exactly solvable limit, to gain insights on the competition of its non-abelian spin-liquid with other nearby phases, such as the mysterious intermediate state observed in the antiferromagnetic model. Both for the ferro- and antiferro-magnetic models we find that the fermions and visons become gapless at nearly identical critical Zeeman couplings. In the ferromagnetic model this is consistent with a direct transition into a polarized state. In the anti-ferromagnetic model this implies that previous theories of the intermediate phase viewed as a spin liquid with a different fermion Chern number are inadequate, as they presume that the vison gap does not close. In the antiferromagnetic model we also find that a bosonic quasiparticle becomes gapless at nearly the same critical field as the fermions and visons. This boson carries the quantum numbers of an anti-ferromagnetic order parameter, suggesting that the intermediate phase has spontaneously broken symmetry with this order.</description>

      <title>From $G_2$ to $SO(8)$: Emergence and reminiscence of supersymmetry and triality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a (1+1)-dimension continuum model of 4-component fermions incorporating the exceptional Lie group symmetry $G_2$. Four gapped and five gapless phases are identified via the one-loop renormalization group analysis. The gapped phases are controlled by four different stable $SO(8)$ Gross-Neveu fixed points, among which three exhibit an emergent triality, while the rest one possesses the self-triality, i.e., invariant under the triality mapping. The gapless phases include three $SO(7)$ critical ones, a $G_2$ critical one, and a Luttinger liquid. Three $SO(7)$ critical phases correspond to different $SO(7)$ Gross-Neveu fixed points connected by the triality relation similar to the gapped SO(8) case. The $G_2$ critical phase is controlled by an unstable fixed point described by a direct product of the Ising and tricritical Ising conformal field theories with the central charges $c=\frac{1}{2}$ and $c=\frac{7}{10}$, respectively, while the latter one is known to possess spacetime supersymmetry. In the lattice realization with a Hubbard-type interaction, the triality is broken into the duality between two $SO(7)$ symmetries and the supersymmetric $G_2$ critical phase exhibits the degeneracy between bosonic and fermionic states, which are reminiscences of the continuum model.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Vacuum-Induced Chiral Spin Liquids in Kagome Lattices: Tuning and Probing Topological Quantum Phases via Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phases in frustrated quantum magnetic systems have captivated researchers for decades, with the chiral spin liquid (CSL) standing out as one of the most compelling examples. Featured by long-range entanglement, topological order, and exotic fractional excitations, the CSL has inspired extensive exploration for practical realizations. In this work, we demonstrate that CSLs can emerge in a kagome lattice driven by vacuum quantum fluctuations within a single-mode chiral cavity. The chiral cavity imprints quantum fluctuations with time-reversal symmetry breaking, fostering chiral interactions among electrons and stabilizing a robust CSL phase without external laser excitation. Moreover, we identify experimentally accessible observables -- such as average photon number and transport properties -- that reveal connections between photon dynamics and the emergent chiral order. Our findings establish a novel pathway for creating, controlling, and probing topological and symmetry-breaking quantum phases in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Accurate Electron-phonon Interactions from Advanced Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is key for understanding many properties of materials such as superconductivity and electric resistivity. Although first principles density-functional-theory (DFT) based EPC calculations are used widely, their efficacy is limited by the accuracy and efficiency of the underlying exchange-correlation functionals. These limitations become exacerbated in complex $d$- and $f$-electron materials, where beyond-DFT approaches and empirical corrections, such as the Hubbard $U$, are commonly invoked. Here, using the examples of CoO and NiO, we show how the efficient r2scan density functional correctly captures strong EPC effects in transition-metal oxides without requiring the introduction of empirical parameters. We also demonstrate the ability of r2scan to accurately model phonon-mediated superconducting properties of the main group compounds (e.g., MgB$_2$), with improved electronic bands and phonon dispersions over those of traditional density functionals. Our study provides a pathway for extending the scope of accurate first principles modeling of electron-phonon interactions to encompass complex $d$-electron materials.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Hidden Ferroaxial Density Wave as the Origin of the Axial Higgs Mode in RTe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of an axial amplitude (Higgs) mode in the long-studied charge density wave (CDW) systems GdTe$_3$ and LaTe$_3$ suggests a heretofore unidentified hidden order. A theoretical study proposed that the axial Higgs results from a hidden ferroaxial component of the CDW, which could arise from non-trivial orbital texture. Here, we report extensive experimental studies on ErTe$_3$ and HoTe$_3$ that possess a high-temperature CDW similar to other RTe$_3$ (R = rare earth), along with an additional low-temperature CDW with an orthogonal ordering vector. Combining Raman spectroscopy with large-angle convergent beam electron diffraction (LACBED), rotational anisotropy second-harmonic generation (RA-SHG), and muon-spin relaxation ($\mu$SR), we provide unambiguous evidence that the high-temperature CDW breaks translation, rotation, and all vertical and diagonal mirror symmetries, but not time-reversal or inversion. In contrast, the low-temperature CDW only additionally breaks translation symmetry. Simultaneously, Raman scattering shows the high-temperature CDW produces an axial Higgs mode while the low-temperature mode is scalar. The weak monoclinic structural distortion and clear axial response in Raman and SHG are consistent with a ferroaxial phase in \ch{RTe3} driven by coupled orbital and charge orders. Thus, our study provides a new standard for uncovering unconventional orders and confirms the power of Higgs modes to reveal them.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field control over the axialness of Higgs modes in charge-density wave compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how symmetry-breaking processes generate order out of disorder is among the most fundamental problems of nature. The scalar Higgs mode - a massive (quasi-) particle - is a key ingredient in these processes and emerges with the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry. Its related exotic and elusive axial counterpart, a Boson with vector character, can be stabilized through the simultaneous breaking of multiple continuous symmetries. Here, we employ a magnetic field to tune the recently discovered axial Higgs-type charge-density wave amplitude modes in rare-earth tritellurides. We demonstrate a proportionality between the axial Higgs component and the applied field, and a 90$^{\circ}$ phase shift upon changing the direction of the B-field. This indicates that the axial character is directly related to magnetic degrees of freedom. Our approach opens up an in-situ control over the axialness of emergent Higgs modes.</description>

      <title>Hidden quantum correlations in the ground states of quasiclassical spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frustrated spin models may lead to the formation of both classical non-collinear spin structures and unique quantum phases including highly entangled quantum spin liquids. Here, we study the entanglement and spatial quantum correlations in linear spin-wave theory around a classical spin-spiral ground state. We find that the entanglement between pairs of sites is short-ranged, and is completely absent in certain cases. In contrast, the entanglement hidden in multi-site clusters is peaked close to phase transitions and shows an asymptotic behavior modulated by the period of the magnetic structure. These findings motivate further exploring the connection in the entanglement properties of fully quantum and of quasiclassical spin models.</description>

      <title>High-Temperature Phase Separation and Charge-Magnon Liquid in Kinetic Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding mechanisms of quantum ordering in strongly correlated systems remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics, with implications for designing novel quantum materials. Here, we investigate kinetic antiferromagnetism on a triangular lattice under an applied magnetic field, where spin-polarons emerge as charge-magnon bound states with mutual attraction. Using large-scale diagrammatic Monte Carlo simulations, we show that this interaction drives high-temperature phase separation into charge- and magnon-rich regions, bordered by polarised Mott insulating voids. Spectral function analysis reveals a substantial energy correction from magnon interactions, indicating that these carrier-rich regions form a strongly bound charge-magnon liquid. These findings shed new light on recent experiments on MoTe2/WSe2 moir\'e bilayers, underscoring kinetic magnetism as a unique pathway for strong inter-carrier attraction and high-temperature quantum ordering, with potential applications in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Chaotic-Integrable Transition for Disordered Orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have drawn connections between the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and the multi-orbit Hatsugei-Kohmoto model, emphasizing their similarities and differences regarding chaotic behaviors. The features of the spectral form factor, such as the dip-ramp-plateau structure and the adjacent gap ratio, indicate chaos in the disordered orbital Hatsugei-Kohmoto model. One significant conclusion is that the plateau value of the out-of-time-order correlator, whether in the Hatsugei-Kohmoto model, Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with two- or four-body interactions, or a disorder-free Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, does not effectively differentiate between integrable and chaotic phases in many-body systems. This observation suggests a limitation in using out-of-time-order correlator plateau values as a diagnostic tool for chaos. Our exploration of these ideas provides a deeper understanding of how chaos arises in non-Fermi liquid systems and the tools we use to study it. It opens the door to further questions, particularly about whether there are more effective ways to distinguish between chaotic and integrable phases in these complex systems.</description>

      <title>Bulk Crystal Growth and Single-Crystal-to-Single-Crystal Phase Transitions in the Averievite CsClCu5V2O10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-two-dimensional averievites with triangle-kagome-triangle trilayers are of interest due to their rich structural and magnetic transitions and strong spin frustration that are expected to host quantum spin liquid ground state with suitable substitution or doping. Herein, we report growth of bulk single crystals of averievite CsClCu5V2O10 with dimensions of several millimeters on edge in order to (1) address the open question whether the room temperature crystal structure is P-3m1, P-3, P21/c or else, (2) to elucidate the nature of phase transitions, and (3) to study direction-dependent physical properties. Single-crystal-to-single-crystal structural transitions at ~305 K and ~127 K were observed in the averievite CsClCu5V2O10 single crystals. The nature of the transition at ~305 K, which was reported as P-3m1-P21/c transition, was found to be a structural transition from high temperature P-3m1 to low temperature P-3 by combining variable temperature synchrotron X-ray single crystal and high-resolution powder diffraction. In-plane and out-of-plane magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements confirm a first-order transition at 305 K, a structural transition at 127 K and an antiferromagnetic transition at 24 K. These averievites are thus ideal model systems for a deeper understanding of structural transitions and magnetism.</description>

      <title>UOTe: Kondo-interacting topological antiferromagnet in a van der Waals lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the initial discovery of two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials, significant effort has been made to incorporate the three properties of magnetism, band structure topology, and strong electron correlations $-$ to leverage emergent quantum phenomena and expand their potential applications. However, the discovery of a single vdW material that intrinsically hosts all three ingredients has remained an outstanding challenge. Here we report the discovery of a Kondo-interacting topological antiferromagnet in the vdW 5$f$ electron system UOTe. It has a high antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition temperature of 150 K, with a unique AFM configuration that breaks the combined parity and time reversal ($PT$) symmetry in an even number of layers while maintaining zero net magnetic moment. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements reveal Dirac bands near the Fermi level, which combined with our theoretical calculations demonstrate UOTe as an AFM Dirac semimetal. Within the AFM order, we observed the presence of the Kondo interaction, as evidenced by the emergence of a 5$f$ flat band near the Fermi level below 100 K and hybridization between the Kondo band and the Dirac band. Our density functional theory calculations in its bilayer form predict UOTe as a rare example of a fully-compensated AFM Chern insulator.</description>

      <title>Dielectric losses in metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) in the self-consistent Hartree-Fock (HF) basis is often used for describing complex many-body effects in material science applications. Its exact solution on the real-frequency axis at finite temperature for polarization using the diagrammatic Monte Carlo method [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{109}, 045152, (2024)] captures effects of multiple Coulomb scattering of a single particle-hole excitation, but does not account for multiple pair excitations important for studying dielectric loses in metals at frequencies comparable to the plasmon mode. In this paper we report technical developments which allow one to efficiently compute the dielectric response in a wide frequency range from zero to a few Fermi energies without systematic bias at finite $T$. By applying it to the homogeneous electron gas we demonstrate how at small momenta the gap in the spectral density between the electron-hole and plasmon excitations, existing within the HF-BSE approach, is filled with two particle-hole excitations and is completely washed out already at temperature $T \sim \varepsilon_F/10$.</description>

      <title>Fractional Chern mosaic in supermoir\'e graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the realization of a fractional Chern mosaic: a state characterized by a spatially varying topological order. This state is enabled by a separation of length scales that emerges when three graphene sheets are sequentially rotated by a small twist angle. The resulting structure features not only conventional moir\'e lattices, but also a much larger supermoir\'e lattice. We demonstrate that a fractional Chern mosaic arises when electron correlations induce fractionalization locally on the moir\'e scale, while the pattern of fractionalization varies at the supermoir\'e scale.</description>

      <title>The $J_1$-$J_2$ spin chain and the $O(3)$ non-linear sigma model at $\theta = \pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are two competing pictures for how the $O(3)$ non-linear sigma model (NLSM) with a topological theta term renormalises to the $\mathfrak{\hat{su}}(2)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model. In the Affleck-Haldane picture, an `extension field' parametrises the correlated fluctuations of the couplings and extends the target space from $S^2$ to $S^3$; recently, however, Zirnbauer has advanced a competing picture where the extension field is frozen out and the infrared theory is more naturally thought of as a compact free boson dual to $\mathfrak{\hat{su}}(2)_1$. We show that the $J_1$-$J_2$ spin chain evinces a phase transition between these pictures -- corresponding to whether the dimer field that parametrises local singlet order is part of a joint $O(4)$ N\'eel-singlet order parameter or appears as a separate gapped mode. For the $O(3)$ NLSM itself, this analysis supports the Zirnbauer picture.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field suppression of tomographic electron transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Degenerate two-dimensional electron liquids are theoretically established to possess two vastly distinct collisional electron mean free paths, where even-parity deformations of the Fermi surface are hydrodynamic with a short collisional mean free path but odd-parity deformations remain near ballistic (known as the "tomographic" transport regime). Predicted signatures of this regime rely on the scaling of observables with temperature or device dimension, both of which are difficult to establish with certainty. Here, we consider magnetotransport in a minimal model of tomographic electrons and show that even a small magnetic field suppresses tomographic transport signatures and thus acts as a sensitive and unique probe of this regime. Fundamentally, the magnetic field breaks time-reversal invariance, which is a prerequisite for the odd-even parity effect in the collisional relaxation. We analyze in detail the scaling of the transverse conductivity, which has been linked to small-channel conductance of interaction-dominated electrons, and show that a tomographic scaling regime at intermediate wavenumbers is quickly suppressed with magnetic field to a hydrodynamic or collisionless form. We confirm that the suppression occurs at relatively small magnetic fields when the cyclotron radius is comparable to the ballistic mean free path of the dominant odd-parity mode. This occurs at a much smaller magnetic field than the magnetic field strength required to suppress hydrodynamic electron transport, which suggests an experimental protocol to extract the odd-parity mean free path.</description>

      <title>Universal Moir\'e-Model-Building Method without Fitting: Application to Twisted MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive method to construct analytical continuum models for moir\'e systems directly from first-principle calculations without any parameter fitting. The core idea of this method is to interpret the terms in the continuum model as a basis, allowing us to determine model parameters as coefficients of this basis through Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. We apply our method to twisted MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ with twist angles ranging from 2.13$^\circ$ to 3.89$^\circ$, producing continuum models that exhibit excellent agreement with both energy bands and wavefunctions obtained from first-principles calculations. We further propose a strategy to integrate out the higher-energy degrees of freedom to reduce the number of the parameters in the model without sacrificing the accuracy for low-energy bands. Our findings reveal that decreasing twist angles typically need an increasing number of harmonics in the moir\'e potentials to accurately replicate first-principles results. We provide parameter values for all derived continuum models, facilitating further robust many-body calculations. Our approach is general and applicable to any commensurate moir\'e materials accessible by first-principles calculations.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Atomic-Scale Inhomogeneity in Superconducting Cuprate NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1990, the Millis, Monien, and Pines (MMP) model and its improvement, the Zha, Barzykin, and Pines (ZBP) model in 1996, emerged as a realistic explanation of the cuprate NMR. These two models assume a single electronic component, translational symmetry, and that the electrons simultaneously have aspects of localized antiferromagnetic (AF) spins and delocalized Cu $d_{x^2-y^2}$ band states. NMR experiments were routinely fit to these models in the 1990s and early 2000s until they finally failed as NMR experiments developed further. It appears that cuprate theorists have given up on explaining the NMR and the NMR data is forgotten. Here, we assume a two-component model of electrons where the electrons reside in two regions, one metallic with delocalized band states, and the other antiferromagnetic with localized spins. This model breaks translational symmetry. We show that the normal state spin relaxation for the planar Cu, O, and Y atoms in $\mathrm{YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\delta}}$ and their Knight shifts are explained by this two-component model. The temperature dependence of the Cu spin relaxation rate anisotropy in the superconducting state is also explained qualitatively.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale mapping of superconductivity in the incoherent CDW mosaic phase of a transition metal dichalcogenide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of superconductivity in the octahedrally coordinated (1T) phase of TaS2 is preceded by the intriguing loss of long-range order in the charge density wave (CDW). Such decoherence, attainable by different methods, results in the formation of nm-sized coherent CDW domains bound by a two-dimensional network of domain walls (DW) - mosaic phase -, which has been proposed as the spatial origin of the superconductivity. Here, we report the atomic-scale characterization of the superconducting state of 1T-TaSSe, a model 1T compound exhibiting the CDW mosaic phase. We use high-resolution scanning tunneling spectroscopy and Andreev spectroscopy to probe the microscopic nature of the superconducting state in unambiguous connection with the electronic structure of the mosaic phase. Spatially resolved conductance maps at the Fermi level at the onset of superconductivity reveal that the density of states is mostly localized on the CDW domains compared to the domain walls, which suggests their dominant role in the formation of superconductivity. This scenario is confirmed within the superconducting dome at 340 mK, where superconductivity is fully developed, and the subtle spatial inhomogeneity of the superconducting gap remains unlinked to the domain wall network. Our results provide key new insights into the fundamental interplay between superconductivity and CDW in these relevant strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Latent Haldane Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latent symmetries, which materialize after performing isospectral reductions, have recently been shown to be instrumental in revealing novel topological phases in one-dimensional systems, among many other applications. In this work, we explore how to construct a family of seemingly complicated two-dimensional models that result in energy-dependent Haldane models upon performing an isospectral reduction. In these models, we find energy-dependent latent Semenoff masses without introducing a staggered on-site potential. In addition, energy-dependent latent Haldane masses also emerge in decorated lattices with nearest-neighbor complex hoppings. Using the Haldane model's properties, we then predict the location of the topological gaps in the aforementioned family of models and construct phase diagrams to determine where the topological phases lie in parameter space. This idea yielded, for instance, useful insights in the case of a modified version of $\alpha$-graphyne and hexagonal plaquettes with additional decorations, where the gap-closing energies can be calculated using the ISR to predict topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Electronic Correlations in the Ruddlesden-Popper Nickelates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on optical studies of the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates La$_{n+1}$Ni$_{n}$O$_{3n+1}$ with $n = 2$ (La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$), $n = 3$ (La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$) and $n = \infty$ (LaNiO$_{3}$). As the number of the NiO$_{6}$ octahedra layers $n$ grows, the ratio of the kinetic energy determined from the experimental optical conductivity and that from band theory $K_{\text{exp}}/K_{\text{band}}$ increases, suggesting a reduction of electronic correlations. While the strong electronic correlations in the bilayer La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ place it on the verge of the Mott insulating phase, the trilayer La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ and infinite-layer LaNiO$_{3}$ exhibit moderate electronic correlations, falling into the regime of correlated metals. The evolution of the electronic correlations in La$_{n+1}$Ni$_{n}$O$_{3n+1}$ is likely to be dominated by the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbital. Our results provide important information for understanding the superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Induced Superconductivity in Pr4Ni3O10 Single Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) of nickelates has potential similarities with cuprate superconductors, which may provide unique perspectives on the mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity. Up to now, most of high-pressure experiments concentrated on the lanthanum-related RP phase. Therefore, the discovery of new superconducting nickelate compounds is highly desired to explore the generality of pressure-induced superconductivity in RP nickelates. Here, we grow high-quality Pr4Ni3O10 single crystal with an optical floating zone furnace under high oxygen pressure and conduct high-pressure transport measurements with various pressure transmitting mediums. The density wave in Pr4Ni3O10 single crystal was suppressed by pressure, accompanying the arising of superconducting state beyond 10 GPa. The maximum and unsaturated Tc of 39 K is obtained within our research pressure. Although zero resistivity was not achieved in our experiments, the pressure and temperature-dependent diamagnetism along with the systematic evolution of resistivity with applied magnetic field, corroborate the superconductivity in Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals. Our findings provide a new platform for the investigation of the relationship among structural evolution, magnetism, correlation, and superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate atom-resolved detection of itinerant bosonic $^{23}$Na and fermionic $^6$Li quantum gases, enabling the direct in situ measurement of interparticle correlations. In contrast to prior work on lattice-trapped gases, here we realize microscopy of quantum gases in the continuum. We reveal Bose-Einstein condensation with single-atom resolution, measure the enhancement of two-particle $g^{(2)}$ correlations of thermal bosons, and observe the suppression of $g^{(2)}$ for fermions; the Fermi or exchange hole. For strongly interacting Fermi gases confined to two dimensions, we directly observe non-local fermion pairs in the BEC-BCS crossover. We obtain the pairing gap, the pair size, and the short-range contact directly from the pair correlations. In situ thermometry is enabled via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Our technique opens the door to the atom-resolved study of strongly correlated quantum gases of bosons, fermions, and their mixtures.</description>

Abstract: We show that the ground state of a weakly charged two-dimensional electron-hole fluid in a strong magnetic field is a broken translational symmetry state with interpenetrating lattices of localized vortices and antivortices in the electron-hole-pair field. The vortices and antivortices carry fractional charges of equal sign but unequal magnitude and have a honeycomb lattice structure that contrasts with the triangular lattices of superconducting electron-electron-pair vortex lattices. We predict that increasing charge density and weakening magnetic fields drive vortex delocalization transitions signaled experimentally by abrupt increases in counterflow transport resistance.</description>

Abstract: Two legged skewed spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ ladders are frustrated and exhibit exotic quantum phases in ground state due to strong quantum fluctuations and competing spin exchanges. Here, we study ground state properties of a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg model on 3/4, 3/5 and 5/5 skewed ladders in the presence of a Zeeman magnetic field, $B$, using exact diagonalization and the density matrix renormalization group method. We note the existence of plateaus at $m =$ 1/3 and 2/3 for 3/4 skewed ladder, at $m =$ 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 for 3/5 skewed ladder, and at $m =$ 0, 1/3, and 2/3 for 5/5 skewed ladder, where $m$ is the ratio of the observed magnetization ($M$) to the saturated magnetization (${M_\mathrm{max}}$). The plateau state is always a gapped state and the plateau width depends on the gap in the system. Surprisingly, the 3/4 and 5/5 skewed ladders show interesting quadrupolar or n-type spin nematic phases below the 1/3$^{rd}$ plateau, i.e, at very low magnetic fields. These two systems are unique as they host both a plateau and a quadrupolar phase at low magnetic fields. The linear variation of pitch angle of the spin with magnetization and behavior of binding energy of magnon pairs as function of magnetic field are also calculated in both the systems. We also study the contribution of the binding energy to two magnon condensate.</description>

Abstract: We study two related universal anomalies of the spectral function of cuprates, so called waterfall and high-energy kink features, by a combined cellular dynamical mean-field theory and angle-resolved photoemission study for the oxychloride Na$_x$Ca$_{2-x}$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$ (Na-CCOC). Tracing their origin back to an interplay of spin-polaron and local correlation effects both in undoped and hole-doped (Na-)CCOC, we establish them as a universal crossover between regions differing in the momentum dependence of the coupling and not necessarily in the related quasiparticles' energies. The proposed scenario extends to doping levels coinciding with the cuprate's superconducting dome and motivates further investigations of the fate of spin-polarons in the superconducting phase.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on the longitudinal magneto-thermal transport in a paramagnetic effective spin-1/2 magnetic insulator CsYbSe$_2$, by introducing a minimal model requiring only Zeeman splitting and magnetoelastic coupling. We use it to argue that hybridized excitations -- formed from acoustic phonons and localized spin-flip-excitations across the Zeeman gap of the crystal electric field ground doublet -- are responsible for a non-monotonic field dependence of longitudinal thermal conductivity. Beyond highlighting a starring role for phonons, our results raise the prospect of universal magneto-thermal transport phenomena in paramagnetic insulators that originate from simple features shared across many systems.</description>

      <title>Determinant- and Derivative-Free Quantum Monte Carlo Within the Stochastic Representation of Wavefunctions</title>

Abstract: Describing the ground states of continuous, real-space quantum many-body systems, like atoms and molecules, is a significant computational challenge with applications throughout the physical sciences. Recent progress was made by variational methods based on machine learning (ML) ansatzes. However, since these approaches are based on energy minimization, ansatzes must be twice differentiable. This (a) precludes the use of many powerful classes of ML models; and (b) makes the enforcement of bosonic, fermionic, and other symmetries costly. Furthermore, (c) the optimization procedure is often unstable unless it is done by imaginary time propagation, which is often impractically expensive in modern ML models with many parameters. The stochastic representation of wavefunctions (SRW), introduced in Nat Commun 14, 3601 (2023), is a recent approach to overcoming (c). SRW enables imaginary time propagation at scale, and makes some headway towards the solution of problem (b), but remains limited by problem (a). Here, we argue that combining SRW with path integral techniques leads to a new formulation that overcomes all three problems simultaneously. As a demonstration, we apply the approach to generalized ``Hooke's atoms'': interacting particles in harmonic wells. We benchmark our results against state-of-the-art data where possible, and use it to investigate the crossover between the Fermi liquid and the Wigner molecule within closed-shell systems. Our results shed new light on the competition between interaction-driven symmetry breaking and kinetic-energy-driven delocalization.</description>

      <title>Orbital selective order and $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Potts nematicity from a non-Fermi liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by systems where a high temperature non-Fermi liquid gives way to low temperature $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Potts nematic order, we studied a three-orbital Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model in the large-$N$ limit. In the single-site limit, this model exhibits a spontaneous orbital-selective transition which preserves average particle-hole symmetry, with two orbitals becoming insulators while the third orbital remains a non-Fermi liquid down to zero temperature. We extend this study to lattice models of three-orbital SYK dots, exploring uniform symmetry broken states on the triangular and cubic lattices. At high temperature, these lattice models exhibit an isotropic non-Fermi liquid metal phase. On the three-dimensional (3D) cubic lattice, the low temperature uniform $\mathbb{Z}_3$ nematic state corresponds to an orbital selective layered state which preserves particle-hole symmetry at small hopping and spontaneously breaks the particle-hole symmetry at large hopping. Over a wide range of temperature, the transport in this layered state shows metallic in-plane resistivity but insulating out-of-plane resistivity. On the 2D triangular lattice, the low temperature state with uniform orbital order is also a correlated $\mathbb{Z}_3$ nematic with orbital-selective transport but it remains metallic in both principal directions. We discuss a Landau theory with $\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock terms which captures salient features of the phase diagram and nematic order in all these models. We also present results on the approximate wavevector dependent orbital susceptibility of the isotropic non-Fermi liquid states.</description>

Abstract: We study the Kondo lattice model of multipolar magnetic moments interacting with conduction electrons on a triangular lattice. Bond-dependent electron hoppings induce a compass-like anisotropy in the effective Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction between multipolar moments. This unique anisotropy stabilizes multipolar skyrmion crystals at zero magnetic field. In a unit cell, the skyrmion fractionalizes into meron composites subject to the conservation of total topological charge. Diverse multipolar phases in the phase diagram give rise to novel spontaneous Hall response of conduction electrons.</description>

      <title>Flat-plane based double-counting free and parameter free many-body DFT+U</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Burgess et al. have recently introduced the BLOR corrective exchange-correlation functional that is, by construction, the unique simplified rotationally-invariant DFT+U functional that enforces the flat-plane condition separately on each effective orbital of a localized subspace. Detached from the Hubbard model, functionals of this type are both double-counting correction free and, when optimized in situ using appropriate error quantifiers, effectively parameter free. In this work, the extension of the BLOR functional to address many-body errors (mBLOR) is derived. The mBLOR functional is built to enforce the flat-plane condition on the entire subspace, rather than on each orbital individually. In this way inter-orbital errors are corrected on the same footing as the single-particle ones. Focusing on exact test cases with strong inter-orbital interactions, the BLOR and mBLOR functionals were benchmarked against contemporary DFT+U functionals using the total energy extensivity condition on stretched homo-nuclear p-block dimers that represent various self-interaction and static-correlation error regimes. The BLOR functional outperformed all other DFT+$U$ functionals tested, which often act to increase total-energy errors, yet it still yielded large errors in some systems. mBLOR instead yielded low energy errors across all four strongly-correlated dimers, while being constructed using only semi-local approximation ingredients. As mBLOR would not otherwise introduce a band-gap correction in the manner that is a desirable feature of DFT+U, we developed a cost-free technique to reintroduce it automatically by moving the functional's unusual explicit derivative discontinuity into the potential. With this in place, mBLOR is the only known DFT$+U$ functional that opens the bandgap of stretched neutral homo-nuclear dimers without the aid of unphysical spin-symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Chiral superconductivity from parent Chern band and its non-Abelian generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a minimal model starting from a parent Chern band with quartic dispersion that can describe the spin-valley polarized electrons in rhombohedral tetra-layer graphene. The interplay between repulsive and attractive interactions on top of that parent Chern band is studied. We conduct standard self-consistent mean-field calculations, and find a rich phase diagram that consists of metal, quantum anomalous Hall crystal, chiral topological superconductor, as well as trivial gapped Bose-Einstein condensate. In particular, there exists a topological phase transition from the chiral superconductor to the Bose-Einstein condensate at zero temperature. Motivated by the recent experimental and theoretical studies of composite Fermi liquid in rhombohedral stacked multi-layer graphene, we further generalize the physical electron model to its composite fermion counterpart based on a field theory analysis. The chiral superconductor phase of the composite fermion becomes the non-Abelian Moore-Read quantum Hall phase. We argue that a chiral (pseudo-)spin liquid phase can emerge in the vicinity of this Moore-Read quantum Hall phase. Our work suggests rhombohedral multi-layer graphene as a potential platform for rich correlated topological phases.</description>

      <title>Opening the Black Box Inside Grover's Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grover's algorithm is a primary algorithm offered as evidence that quantum computers can provide an advantage over classical computers. It involves an "oracle" specified for a given application whose structure is not part of the formal scaling of the quadratic speedup guaranteed by the algorithm. Grover's algorithm also requires exponentially many calls to the quantum oracle to succeed (about $\sqrt{2^n}$ calls for $n$ qubits), raising the question of its implementation on both noisy and error-corrected quantum computers. In this work, we construct a quantum-inspired algorithm, executable on a classical computer, that performs Grover's task in a linear number of calls to (simulations of) the oracle - an exponentially smaller number than Grover's algorithm - and demonstrate this algorithm explicitly for Boolean satisfiability problems. The complexity of our algorithm depends on the cost to simulate the oracle once which may or may not be exponential. Indeed, Grover's algorithm does not have an a priori quantum speedup as soon as one is given access to the "source code" of the oracle. Our findings illustrate this point explicitly as our algorithm exploits the structure of the quantum circuit used to program the quantum computer to speed up the search. There remain problems where Grover's algorithm would provide an asymptotic speedup if it could be run accurately for large enough sizes. Our quantum-inspired algorithm provides lower bounds, in terms of circuit complexity, for quantum hardware to beat classical approaches for these problems. These estimates, combined with the unfavorable scaling of the success probability of Grover's algorithm - which in the presence of noise decays as a double exponential in the number of qubits - makes a practical speedup unrealistic even under extremely optimistic assumptions of the evolution of both hardware quality and availability.</description>

Abstract: Dissipation is a ubiquitous phenomenon that affects the fate of chaotic quantum many-body dynamics. Here, we show that chaos can be robust against dissipation but can also assist and anomalously enhance relaxation. We compute exactly the dissipative form factor of a generic Floquet quantum circuit with arbitrary on-site dissipation modeled by quantum channels and find that, for long enough times, the system always relaxes with two distinctive regimes characterized by the presence or absence of gap-closing. While the system can sustain a robust ramp for a long (but finite) time interval in the gap-closing regime, relaxation is ``assisted'' by quantum chaos in the regime where the gap remains nonzero. In the latter regime, we prove that, if the thermodynamic limit is taken first, the gap does not close even in the dissipationless limit. We complement our analytical findings with numerical results for quantum qubit circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15097v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carry out a systematic study of the electronic and magnetic structure of the ambient-pressure bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Employing the hybrid exchange-correlation functional, we show that the exchange-correlation pushes the bonding $d_{z^2}$ bands below the Fermi level to be fully occupied. The calculated Fermi surfaces and the correlation normalized band structure match well with the experimental findings at ambient pressure. Moreover, the electronic susceptibility calculated for this new band structure features nesting-induced peaks near the wave vector $Q=(\pi/2, \pi/2)$, suggesting a possible density wave instability in agreement with recent experiments. Through a mean field study and DFT+U calculation introducing a Hubbard U interaction within conventional density functional theory, we confirm the spin-charge intertwined double stripe order is the magnetic ground state. Our results provide a faithful description for the low-pressure La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium Chiral Magnetic Effect from simulations on Euclidean lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The status of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) response in full Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) has been controversial so far, with previous lattice QCD studies indicating either its strong suppression or vanishing in thermal equilibrium state. We introduce the Euclidean-time correlator of axial charge and electric current as an observable that can be used to study the finite out-of-equilibrium CME response in first-principle lattice QCD simulations with background magnetic field. This observable directly reflects the fact that in the background magnetic field, a state with nonzero axial charge features nonzero electric current. For free fermions, the axial-vector correlator only receives contributions from the Lowest Landau Level, and exhibits a linear dependence on both magnetic field and temperature with a universal coefficient. With an appropriate regularization, non-vanishing axial-vector correlator is compatible with the vanishing of the CME current in thermal equilibrium state with nonzero chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$. We demonstrate that the real-time counterpart of the Euclidean-time axial-vector correlator is intimately related to the real-time form of the axial anomaly equation, which strongly limits possible corrections in full QCD. We present numerical results for the Euclidean-time axial-vector correlator in $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory with $N_f = 2$ light quark flavours, demonstrating reasonable agreement with free fermion result on both sides of the chiral crossover. The proposed methodology should help to answer the question whether the QCD corrections might be responsible for non-observation of CME in heavy-ion collision experiments such as the RHIC isobar run.</description>

Abstract: Periodically driven (Floquet) systems have attracted growing attention due to the emergence of intriguing phenomena that are absent in equilibrium physics. In this letter, we identify a new class of Floquet criticality characterized by nontrivial topology. For generic driven Majorana fermion chains with chiral symmetry, we analytically demonstrate that Floquet driving can enrich the transition point, resulting in topologically distinct quantum critical lines that are absent in undriven systems. Furthermore, we provide an intuitive physical explanation for the underlying mechanism of the nontrivial topology at Floquet criticality and generalize our results to higher dimensions. This work not only extends the scope of topological physics in Floquet systems but also deepens our understanding of gapless topological phases of matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Hall conductance and its non-abelian and higher-dimensional analogs are obstructions to promoting a symmetry of a state to a gauge symmetry. To do this, we define a local Lie algebra over a Grothendieck site as a pre-cosheaf of Lie algebras with additional properties and propose that a gauge symmetry should be described by such an object. We show that infinitesimal symmetries of a gapped state of a quantum spin system form a local Lie algebra over a site of semilinear sets and use it to construct topological invariants of the state. Our construction applies to lattice systems on arbitrary asymptotically conical subsets of a Euclidean space including those which cannot be studied using field theory.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric behavior of breathing kagom\'{e} monolayers of $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{(Cl, Br, I)}_8$ from first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply density functional theory to explore the magnetoelectric (ME) properties of two-dimensional $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{(Cl,Br,I)}_8$. These compounds have recently been proposed to exhibit coupled ferroelectric and ferromagnetic order leading to a switchable anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE). Using both spin-spiral and self-consistent spin-orbit coupled calculations, we predict an in-plane $120^\circ$ cycloid of trimerized spins as the ground state for $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{Cl}_8$. For $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{Br}_8$ and $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{I}_8$ we find long period incommensurate helical order. We calculate a number of magnetic properties such as the exchange constants, orbital magnetization, and Weiss temperatures. It is then shown that, despite having both broken inversion and time-reversal symmetry, the proposed AVHE and linear ME response are forbidden by the presence of helical order in the ground state. In addition, the computed switching trajectory demonstrates that it is unlikely that the polar state of the monolayers can be switched with a homogeneous electric field due to an unusual equation of state of the out-of-plane dipole moment. Nevertheless, we highlight that in the presence of a strong electric field, the trimerized spins in $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{Cl}_8$ will exhibit a magnetic phase transition from the $120^\circ$ cycloid to out-of-plane ferromagnetic order, which restores the symmetry required for both AVHE and linear ME effects.</description>
