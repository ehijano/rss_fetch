      <title>Invisible Hydrodynamic Tweezers Based on Near-Zero Index Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating particles, such as cells and tissues, in a flowing liquid environment is crucial for life science research. Traditional contactless tweezers, although widely used for single-cell manipulation, face several challenges. These include potential damage to the target, restriction to static environments, complex excitation setups, and interference outside the target area. To address these issues, we propose an ``invisible hydrodynamic tweezer'' utilizing near-zero index hydrodynamic metamaterials. This metamaterial-based device creates an equipotential resistance zone, effectively immobilizing particles in flowing fluids without disturbing the external flow field and without causing damage to the targets. Unlike traditional active control methods, our tweezer passively captures and releases particles by adjusting the flow channel, eliminating the need for continuous and stable excitation devices, thereby significantly simplifying the setup complexity. Furthermore, these tweezers can be modularly designed in different sizes to flexibly accommodate various application needs. Simulations and experimental validations demonstrated the non-interfering, stable trapping, and precise movement capabilities of these tweezers. This proposed technique holds significant potential for applications in biomedicine, microfluidics, and environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>Predicting Non-Ideal Effects from the Diaphragm Opening Process in Shock Tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shock tubes are instrumental in studying high-temperature kinetics and simulating high-speed flows. They swiftly elevate the thermodynamic conditions of test gases, making them ideal for examining rapid chemical reactions and generating high-enthalpy flows for aerodynamic research. However, non-ideal effects, stemming from factors like diaphragm opening processes and viscous effects, can significantly influence thermodynamic conditions behind the shock wave. This study investigates the impact of various diaphragm opening patterns on the shock parameters near the driven section end-wall. Experiments were conducted using helium and argon as driver and driven gases, respectively, at pressures ranging from 1.32 to 2.09 bar and temperatures from 1073 to 2126 K behind the reflected shock. High-speed imaging captured different diaphragm rupture profiles, classified into four distinct types based on their dynamics. Results indicate that the initial stages of diaphragm opening, including the rate and profile of opening, play crucial roles in resulting incident shock Mach number and test time. A sigmoid function was employed to fit the diaphragm opening profiles, allowing for accurate categorization and analysis. New correlations were developed to predict the incident shock attenuation rate and post-shock pressure rise, incorporating parameters such as diaphragm opening time, rupture profile constants, and normalized experimental Mach number. The results emphasize the importance of considering diaphragm rupture dynamics in shock tube experiments to achieve accurate predictions of shock parameters.</description>

      <title>Computing the multimodal stochastic dynamics of a nanobeam in a viscous fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic dynamics of small elastic objects in fluid are central to many important and emerging technologies. It is now possible to measure and use the higher modes of motion of elastic structures when driven by Brownian motion alone. Although theoretical descriptions exist for idealized conditions, computing the stochastic multimodal dynamics for the complex conditions of experiment is very challenging. We show that this is possible using deterministic finite element calculations with the fluctuation dissipation theorem by exploring the multimodal stochastic dynamics of a doubly-clamped nanobeam. We use a very general, and flexible, finite-element computational approach to quantify the stochastic dynamics of multiple modes simultaneously using only a single deterministic simulation. We include the experimentally relevant features of an intrinsic tension in the beam and the influence of a nearby rigid boundary on the dynamics through viscous fluid interactions. We quantify the stochastic dynamics of the first eleven flexural modes of the beam when immersed in air or water. We compare the numerical results with theory, where possible, and find excellent agreement. We quantify the limitations of the computational approach and describe its range of applicability. These results pave the way for computational studies of the stochastic dynamics of complex 3D elastic structures in a viscous fluid where theoretical descriptions are not available.</description>

      <title>Operator learning regularization for macroscopic permeability prediction in dual-scale flow problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid composites moulding is an important manufacturing technology for fibre reinforced composites, due to its cost-effectiveness. Challenges lie in the optimisation of the process due to the lack of understanding of key characteristic of textile fabrics - permeability. The problem of computing the permeability coefficient can be modelled as the well-known Stokes-Brinkman equation, which introduces a heterogeneous parameter $\beta$ distinguishing macropore regions and fibre-bundle regions. In the present work, we train a Fourier neural operator to learn the nonlinear map from the heterogeneous coefficient $\beta$ to the velocity field $u$, and recover the corresponding macroscopic permeability $K$. This is a challenging inverse problem since both the input and output fields span several order of magnitudes, we introduce different regularization techniques for the loss function and perform a quantitative comparison between them.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis of Cavitation Dynamics on Free Ogee Spillways Using the Volume of Fluid (VOF) Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating complex hydraulic conditions, particularly two-phase flows over spillway chutes, can be achieved with high accuracy using three-dimensional numerical models. This study investigates the potential for vacuum generation and cavitation phenomena on the Aghchai Dam service spillway through numerical simulations conducted in Flow-3D. The analysis focuses on two specific flow rates, 4400 and 1065 cubic meters per second, as determined by experimental data. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) method is employed to accurately calculate the free surface flow. Simulation results at a discharge rate of 4400 cubic meters per second indicate a high likelihood of cavitation at critical locations, including the ogee curve and the angle transition in the chute channel. These areas require specific mitigation measures to prevent cavitation-induced damage. In contrast, at the lower flow rate of 1065 cubic meters per second, the risk of cavitation is minimal due to reduced flow velocity and the absence of flow separation from the bed. The numerical findings align closely with empirical observations, demonstrating the reliability of the simulation approach in predicting cavitation behavior.</description>

      <title>A one-dimensional mixing model to investigate the impact of Ablative Rayleigh-Taylor Instability on compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a one-dimensional mixing model to investigate the impact of Ablative Rayleigh-Taylor Instability (ARTI) on compression, addressing the limitations of high-dimensional simulations. In this model, the scale of the mixed region is predicted using an ablative buoyancy drag model and the mass-weighted average field distributions in the direction of acceleration are obtained by interpolating between the initial and final isothermal molecule mixing states based on the mixing extent, defined by the percentage of maximum specific turbulent kinetic energy and a free multiplier f, which varies from chunk mixing (0) to atomic mixing (1). After validation through two-dimensional simulations, the model is integrated into a Lagrangian framework and applied to spherical implosion scenarios. The results indicate that the compression of the inflight shell is diminished, leading to a reduced time interval between the convergence of the main shock and stagnation, potentially providing a measurable signal in single-shot experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Mesoscale Convective System (MCS) is a collection of thunderstorms that function as a system, representing a widely discussed phenomenon in both the natural sciences and visual effects industries, and embodying the untamed forces of nature.In this paper, we present the first interactive, physically inspired mesoscale thunderstorms simulation model that integrates Grabowski-style cloud microphysics with atmospheric electrification processes. Our model simulates thunderclouds development and lightning flashes within a unified meteorological framework, providing a realistic and interactive approach for graphical applications. By incorporating key physical principles, it effectively links cloud formation, electrification, and lightning generation. The simulation also encompasses various thunderstorm types and their corresponding lightning activities.</description>

      <title>An AMReX-based Compressible Reacting Flow Solver for High-speed Reacting Flows relevant to Hypersonic Propulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive framework for the efficient implementation of finite-volume-based reacting flow solvers, specifically tailored for high speed propulsion applications. Using the exascale computing project (ECP) based AMReX framework, a compressible flow solver for handling high-speed reacting flows is developed. This work is complementary to the existing PeleC solver, emphasizing specific applications that include confined shock-containing flows, stationary and moving shocks and detonations. The framework begins with a detailed exposition of the numerical methods employed, emphasizing their application to complex geometries and their effectiveness in ensuring accurate and stable numerical simulations. Subsequently, an in-depth analysis evaluates the solver's performance across canonical and practical geometries, with particular focus on computational cost and efficiency. The solver's scalability and robustness are demonstrated through practical test cases, including flow path simulations of scramjet engines and detailed analysis of various detonation phenomena.</description>

      <title>Centre mode instability of a dilute particle-laden swirling jet in a swirl flow combustor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear stability of a locally parallel annular swirling jet laden with particles in a swirl flow combustor is considered. At low Stokes numbers, the eigenspectra of the particle-laden jet with uniform particle concentration shows three unstable modes namely centre, sinuous and varicose modes. As the Stokes number is increased to unity, the growth rates of the centre and shear layer modes reduces compared to that of the unladen swirling jet. The magnitude of the velocity eigenmodes peaks in the vortex core and decays radially outward. The variation in particle concentration occurs mostly in the vortex core and almost none in the shear layer. The strength of flow reversal at the jet centreline is given by the backflow parameter. An increase in the backflow parameter increases the growth rate of the centre mode. Non-uniformity in the base-state particle concentration is introduced using a Gaussian function varying in the radial direction and a reduction in the growth rate of the centre mode is seen compared to the uniform particle concentration profile. When the location of the peak of the base-state particle concentration profile is inside the vortex core, the centre modes are stable. Linearized vorticity budget analysis reveals that this is accompanied by a decrease in the net generation of perturbation vorticity in the axial direction and increased radial and azimuthal perturbation vorticity.</description>

      <title>Mean Mesh Adaptation for Efficient CFD Simulations with Operating Conditions Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When numerically solving partial differential equations, for a given problem and operating condition, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) has proven its efficiency to automatically build a discretization achieving a prescribed accuracy at low cost. However, with continuously varying operating conditions, such as those encountered in uncertainty quantification, adapting a mesh for each evaluated condition becomes complex and computationally expensive. To enable more effective error and cost control, this work introduces a novel approach to mesh adaptation. The method consists in building a unique adapted mesh that aims at minimizing the average error for a continuous set operating conditions. In the proposed implementation, this unique mesh is built iteratively, informed by an estimate of the local average error over a reduced set of sample conditions. The effectiveness and performance of the method are demonstrated on a one-dimensional Burgers equation and a two-dimensional Euler scramjet shocked flow configurations.</description>

      <title>Compression-thinning behavior of bubble suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rheology of bubble suspensions is critical for the prediction and control of bubbly flows in a wide range of industrial processes. It is well-known that the bubble suspension exhibits a shear-thinning behavior due to the bubble shape deformation under pure shear, but how the shear rheology response to dilatation remains unexplored. Here, we report a compression-thinning behavior that the bubble suspension exhibits a decreasing shear viscosity upon compressing. This peculiar rheological behavior is microscopically due to that a shrinking bubble surface effectively weakens the flow resistance of the surrounding liquid. We theoretically propose a constitutive equation for dilute bubble suspensions considering both shear and dilatation effects, and demonstrate that the contribution of dilatation effect on the shear viscosity can be significant at a changing pressure.</description>

      <title>Study on Dynamic Solidification of Digital Droplets and Random Behaviors during the Recalescence Process in a Spiral-shaped Milli-reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we designed a spiral-shaped milli-reactor with a T-junction microchannel to generate digital droplets for studying and observing the digital freezing process of droplets. During the study of the recalescence and solidification processes of digital droplets dynamically moving in microchannels, we found that although the digital generation of droplets in our channel aligns well with the literature, achieving the digitalization of the droplet freezing process is very challenging. Even the initial phase of freezing (the recalescence process) exhibits significant randomness. A key feature of the randomness in the freezing process is the nucleation position of droplets within the channel, which significantly impacts the digital characteristics and hinders digital freezing. During the investigation of freezing randomness, we identified five distinct nucleation profiles, which largely determine the evolution of the freezing front and the duration of the recalescence phase. However, upon studying the motion velocity of the freezing front, we found that these velocities are temperature-dependent. This aligns with the results of our phase-field simulations and experimental findings, indicating that the release of latent heat during the recalescence process is stable. Additionally, the randomness in freezing may also stem from the deformation of droplets during the solidification process. In this study, we identified two distinct solidification modes during the freezing phase: one initiating from the droplet's head or tail and the other starting from the middle, with the latter causing significant droplet deformation. Through statistical analysis, we further explored the influence of flow rate variation on the digital clustering of droplet freezing and discovered flow rate parameters that optimize freezing digitalization.</description>

      <title>Twisted terahertz radiation generation using Laguerre-Gaussian laser pulse propagating in axially magnetized plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present analytical and simulation study of twisted terahertz (THz) radiation generation via propagation of a circularly polarized Laguerre Gaussian (LG) laser pulse in homogeneous plasma embedded in an axial magnetic field. Analytical formulation is based on perturbation technique and quasistatic approximation. Longitudinal and transverse wakefields generated via laser plasma interactions are evaluated using Lorentz force and Maxwells equations in the mildly nonlinear regime. It is observed that two linearly polarized twisted terahertz (THz) radiation beams are generated in mutually perpendicular planes. Superposition of the two beams result in a single linearly polarized twisted THz radiation beam with modified amplitude and polarization direction. Three dimensional (3D) particle in cell (PIC) simulations are performed for this configuration using FBPIC code. Graphical comparison of amplitude of the resultant THz beam obtained via analytical and simulation studies is presented.</description>

      <title>Intermittent turbulent gusts lift eagles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence grounds aircraft and combating it in flight requires energy, yet volant wildlife fly effortlessly even on windy days. The nature of the interactions between soaring birds and transient turbulent gusts is not clear, especially when compared with our understanding of flight in larger and steadier airflows during thermal or dynamic soaring. We show that soaring golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) experienced short upward accelerations indicative of preferential engagement with strong and intermittent turbulent updrafts. The vertical accelerations reflect changes in lift that were as large as 25 standard deviations from the mean, or more than three times the acceleration of gravity, and so large as not to be consistent with gust mitigation or avoidance. These extreme events occurred in short bursts that mimic movement with turbulent vortices. The burst statistics and their symmetries approach those of turbulence toward longer timescales. On the shortest timescales, the bursts break the symmetry of small-scale turbulence in favor of upward accelerations that are more intermittent than turbulence. We introduce a simple nonlinear model that predicts the scale at which symmetry breaks and the stronger intermittency on the smaller scales. These findings suggest a ratcheting mechanism on turbulent gusts and constitute the first quantitative evidence in favor of turbulent gust harvesting by wildlife. An implications is that turbulence is so strong and pervasive as to make unsteady and nonlinear aerodynamics an intrinsic and beneficial aspect of both flapping and soaring flight in the atmospheric boundary layer - one that we need to incorporate in our understanding of the energetics of flight.</description>

      <title>The Well: a Large-Scale Collection of Diverse Physics Simulations for Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning based surrogate models offer researchers powerful tools for accelerating simulation-based workflows. However, as standard datasets in this space often cover small classes of physical behavior, it can be difficult to evaluate the efficacy of new approaches. To address this gap, we introduce the Well: a large-scale collection of datasets containing numerical simulations of a wide variety of spatiotemporal physical systems. The Well draws from domain experts and numerical software developers to provide 15TB of data across 16 datasets covering diverse domains such as biological systems, fluid dynamics, acoustic scattering, as well as magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of extra-galactic fluids or supernova explosions. These datasets can be used individually or as part of a broader benchmark suite. To facilitate usage of the Well, we provide a unified PyTorch interface for training and evaluating models. We demonstrate the function of this library by introducing example baselines that highlight the new challenges posed by the complex dynamics of the Well. The code and data is available at https://github.com/PolymathicAI/the_well.</description>

      <title>Proper Latent Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the proper latent decomposition (PLD) as a generalization of the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) on manifolds. PLD is a nonlinear reduced-order modeling technique for compressing high-dimensional data into nonlinear coordinates. First, we compute a reduced set of intrinsic coordinates (latent space) to accurately describe a flow with fewer degrees of freedom than the numerical discretization. The latent space, which is geometrically a manifold, is inferred by an autoencoder. Second, we leverage tools from differential geometry to develop numerical methods for operating directly on the latent space; namely, a metric-constrained Eikonal solver for distance computations. With this proposed numerical framework, we propose an algorithm to perform PLD on the manifold. Third, we demonstrate results for a laminar flow case and the turbulent Kolmogorov flow. For the laminar flow case, we are able to identify a semi-analytical expression for the solution of Navier-Stokes; in the Kolmogorov flow case, we are able to identify a dominant mode that exhibits physical structures, which are compared with POD. This work opens opportunities for analyzing autoencoders and latent spaces, nonlinear reduced-order modeling and scientific insights into the structure of high-dimensional data.</description>

      <title>On global existence and large-time behaviour of weak solutions to the compressible barotropic Navier--Stokes Equations on $\mathbb{T}^2$ with density-dependent bulk viscosity: beyond the Va\u{\i}gant--Kazhikhov regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the compressible barotropic Navier--Stokes equations for a $\gamma$-law gas with density-dependent bulk viscosity coefficient $\lambda=\lambda(\rho)=\rho^\beta$ on the two-dimensional periodic domain $\mathbb{T}^2$. The global existence of weak solutions with initial density bounded away from zero and infinity for $\beta&gt;3$, $\gamma&gt;1$ has been established by Va\u{\i}gant--Kazhikhov [Sib. Math. J. 36 (1995), 1283--1316]. When $\gamma=\beta&gt;3$, the large-time behaviour of the weak solutions and, in particular, the absence of formation of vacuum and concentration of density as $t \to \infty$, has been proved by Perepelitsa [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 39 (2007/08), 1344--1365]. Huang--Li [J. Math. Pures Appl. 106 (2016), 123--154] extended these results by establishing the global existence of weak solutions and large-time behaviour under the assumptions $\beta &gt;3/2$, $1&lt; \gamma&lt;4\beta-3$, and that the initial density stays away from infinity (but may contain vacuum).
  Improving upon the works listed above, we prove that in the regime of parameters as in Huang--Li, namely that $\beta &gt;3/2$ and $1&lt; \gamma&lt;4\beta-3$, if the density has no vacuum or concentration at $t=0$, then it stays uniformly away from zero and infinity at all later time $t \in ]0,\infty]$. Moreover, under the mere assumption that $\beta&gt;1$ and $\gamma&gt;1$, we establish the global existence of weak solutions, thus pushing the global existence theory of the barotropic Navier--Stokes equations on $\mathbb{T}^2$ to the most general setting to date. One of the key ingredients of our proof is a novel application -- motivated by the recent work due to Danchin--Mucha [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 76 (2023), 3437--3492] -- of Desjardins' logarithmic interpolation inequality.</description>

      <title>Physics-constrained convolutional neural networks for inverse problems in spatiotemporal partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10306v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a physics-constrained convolutional neural network (PC-CNN) to solve two types of inverse problems in partial differential equations (PDEs), which are nonlinear and vary both in space and time. In the first inverse problem, we are given data that is offset by spatially varying systematic error (i.e., the bias, also known as the epistemic uncertainty). The task is to uncover the true state, which is the solution of the PDE, from the biased data. In the second inverse problem, we are given sparse information on the solution of a PDE. The task is to reconstruct the solution in space with high-resolution. First, we present the PC-CNN, which constrains the PDE with a time-windowing scheme to handle sequential data. Second, we analyse the performance of the PC-CNN for uncovering solutions from biased data. We analyse both linear and nonlinear convection-diffusion equations, and the Navier-Stokes equations, which govern the spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics of turbulent flows. We find that the PC-CNN correctly recovers the true solution for a variety of biases, which are parameterised as non-convex functions. Third, we analyse the performance of the PC-CNN for reconstructing solutions from sparse information for the turbulent flow. We reconstruct the spatiotemporal chaotic solution on a high-resolution grid from only 1% of the information contained in it. For both tasks, we further analyse the Navier-Stokes solutions. We find that the inferred solutions have a physical spectral energy content, whereas traditional methods, such as interpolation, do not. This work opens opportunities for solving inverse problems with partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Turbulence Producing Motions in the ABL Across a Natural Roughness Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Landforms such as sand dunes act as roughness elements to Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) flows, triggering the development of new scales of turbulent motions. These turbulent motions, in turn, energize and kick-up sand particles, influencing sediment transport and ultimately the formation and migration of dunes -- with knock on consequences for dust emission. While feedbacks between flow and form have been studied at the scale of dunes, research has not examined how the development of an Internal Boundary Layer (IBL) over the entire dune field influences sediment-transporting turbulence. Here, we deploy large-eddy simulation of an ABL encountering a natural roughness transition: the sand dunes at White Sands National Park, New Mexico. We analyze turbulence producing motions and how they change as the IBL grows over the dune field. Frequency spectrum and Reynolds shear stress profiles show that IBL thickness determines the largest scales of turbulence. More, the developing IBL enhances the frequency, magnitude and duration of sweep and ejection events -- turbulence producing motions whose peaks systematically migrate away from the wall as the IBL thickens. Because sweep and ejection events are known to drive sediment transport, our findings provide a mechanism for coupling the co-evolution of the landscape and the ABL flow over it. More broadly, our results have implications for how roughness transitions influence the transport of pollutants, particulates, heat, and moisture.</description>

      <title>Contact angle hysteresis and static friction for two-dimensional droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contact angle hysteresis of droplets will be examined in light of static friction between liquid drop and solid surface. Unlike frictions in solid-solid interfaces, pinning forces at contact points or contact lines would be the cause of friction. We will define coefficients of static friction and relate them with advancing and receding contact angles for the case of two-dimensional droplets. In our work sessile drops in an inclined plane, and pendent drops in a slanted ceiling will all be analyzed within a single framework with the inclination angle as a free parameter. We can then visualize the gradual change of shapes of a droplet put on a plane as the inclination angle changes adiabatically to make a complete turn. We point out that there could be two distinct stable configurations of pendent droplets for the same physical conditions, hence dubbed the bifurcation. And in the case of pendent droplets we investigate at what ranges of parameters pinch-offs occur, and find an interesting relation between the fallen-out volume and the Bond number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The propagation of internal waves in a hydrodynamic system comprising a solid bottom and an upper half-space is investigated. The study is conducted within the framework of a nonlinear low-dimensional model incorporating surface tension on an interface using the method of multi-scale expansions. The evolution equation of the envelope of the wave packet takes the form of the Schrodinger equation. Conditions for the Benjamin-Feir stability of the solution of the evolution equation are identified for various physical and geometrical characteristics of the system. An estimation of the parameter range in which the instability occurs is performed. Significant influence on the modulational stability of the geometrical characteristics of the system and surface tension is observed in each system for relatively small liquid layer thicknesses and waves with a wavelength comparable to the layer thickness</description>

      <title>Modeling the Effect of Sleeve Gastrectomy on Gastric Digestion in the Stomach: Insights from Multiphase Flow Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometry and motility of the stomach play a critical role in the digestion of ingested liquid meals. Sleeve gastrectomy, a common type of bariatric surgery used to reduce the size of the stomach, significantly alters the stomach's anatomy and motility, which impacts gastric emptying and digestion. In this study, we use an imaging data-based computational model, StomachSim, to investigate the consequences of sleeve gastrectomy. The pre-operative stomach anatomy was derived from imaging data and the post-sleeve gastrectomy shapes were generated for different resection volumes. We investigate the effect of sleeve sizes and motility patterns on gastric mixing and emptying. Simulations were conducted using an immersed-boundary flow solver, modeling a liquid meal to analyze changes in gastric content mixing and emptying rates. The results reveal that different degrees of volume reduction and impaired gastric motility have complex effects on stomach's mixing and emptying functions, which are important factors in gastric health of the patient. These findings provide insights into the biomechanical effects of sleeve gastrectomy on gastric digestion and emptying functions, highlighting the potential of computational models to inform surgical planning and post-operative management.</description>

      <title>HOPE: An Automatically Differentiable High-Order Non-Oscillatory Finite-Volume Shallow-Water Dynamic Core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An automatically differentiable, high-order non-oscillatory finite volume shallow water dynamic core has been constructed on a cubed sphere grid. This dynamic core has four advantageous properties: high order accuracy, essential non-oscillation, mass conservation, and scalability. Besides, the code development is based on PyTorch, enabling the model to run seamlessly on both CPU and GPU, while naturally possessing the capability of automatic differentiation. We named the new dynamic core as High Order Prediction Environment (HOPE). The spatial reconstruction is based on the two-dimensional tensor product polynomial and the genuine two-dimensional Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) scheme. A novel panel boundary approach ensures that the accuracy can reach arbitrary order. The algorithm has very high degree of compatibility with GPU architecture, allowing the computational overhead to be mitigated through the utilization of GPU. The LMARS (Low Mach number Approximate Riemann Solver) scheme is adopted as Riemann solvers to determine fluxes on the Gaussian points on edges. Flux across the interface between each cell edge is computed using linear Gaussian quadrature, and the tendency of prognostic values is obtained by summing all fluxes around the cell. This shallow water dynamic core demonstrates outstanding performance in ideal shallow water test cases. In the steady-state geostrophic flow, the 11th order scheme reduces errors to nearly round-off error even on coarse grids (2 degrees). Furthermore, the Rossby-Haurwitz wave preserves its shape for over 90 days. To test the non-oscillation property, we designed a cylinder dam break case. The WENO approach effectively suppresses non-physical oscillation, and the genuine two-dimensional reconstruction exhibits significantly better isotropy than the dimension-by-dimension scheme.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Deep Learning Based Super-Resolution For The Shallow Water Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the nonlinear shallow water equations as benchmark, we demonstrate that a simulation with the ICON-O ocean model with a 20km resolution that is frequently corrected by a U-net-type neural network can achieve discretization errors of a simulation with 10km resolution. The network, originally developed for image-based super-resolution in post-processing, is trained to compute the difference between solutions on both meshes and is used to correct the coarse mesh every 12h. Our setup is the Galewsky test case, modeling transition of a barotropic instability into turbulent flow. We show that the ML-corrected coarse resolution run correctly maintains a balance flow and captures the transition to turbulence in line with the higher resolution simulation. After 8 day of simulation, the $L_2$-error of the corrected run is similar to a simulation run on the finer mesh. While mass is conserved in the corrected runs, we observe some spurious generation of kinetic energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new model equation for Stokes gravity waves based on conformal transformations of Euler's equations. The local version of the model equation is relevant for dynamics of shallow water waves. It allows us to characterize the traveling periodic waves both in the case of smooth and peaked waves and to solve the existence problem exactly, albeit not in elementary functions. Spectral stability of smooth waves with respect to co-periodic perturbations is proven analytically based on the exact count of eigenvalues in a constrained spectral problem.</description>

      <title>Analog-Based Forecasting of Turbulent Velocity: Relationship between Unpredictability and Intermittency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of analog-based methodologies to predict, in a statistical way, the longitudinal velocity in a turbulent flow. The data used comes from hot wire experimental measurements from the Modane wind tunnel. We compared different methods and explored the impact of varying the number of analogs and their sizes on prediction accuracy. We illustrate that the innovation, defined as the difference between the true velocity value and the prediction value,  highlights particularly unpredictable events that we directly link with extreme events of the velocity gradients and so to intermittency. A statistical study of the innovation indicates that while the estimator effectively seizes linear correlations, it fails to fully capture higher-order dependencies. The innovation underscores the presence of intermittency, revealing the limitations of current predictive models and suggesting directions for future improvements in turbulence forecasting.This study evaluates the performance of analog-based methodologies to predict the longitudinal velocity in a turbulent flow.

      <title>PINNfluence: Influence Functions for Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a flexible and promising application of deep learning to partial differential equations in the physical sciences. While offering strong performance and competitive inference speeds on forward and inverse problems, their black-box nature limits interpretability, particularly regarding alignment with expected physical behavior. In the present work, we explore the application of influence functions (IFs) to validate and debug PINNs post-hoc. Specifically, we apply variations of IF-based indicators to gauge the influence of different types of collocation points on the prediction of PINNs applied to a 2D Navier-Stokes fluid flow problem. Our results demonstrate how IFs can be adapted to PINNs to reveal the potential for further studies. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/aleks-krasowski/PINNfluence.</description>
