      <title>LIMFAST. IV. Learning High-Redshift Galaxy Formation from Multiline Intensity Mapping with Implicit Likelihood Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By opening up new avenues to statistically constrain astrophysics and cosmology with large-scale structure observations, the line intensity mapping (LIM) technique calls for novel tools for efficient forward modeling and inference. Implicit likelihood inference (ILI) from semi-numerical simulations provides a powerful setup for investigating a large model parameter space in a data-driven manner, therefore gaining significant recent attention. Using simulations of high-redshift 158$\mu$m [CII] and 88$\mu$m [OIII] LIM signals created by the LIMFAST code, we develop an ILI framework in a case study of learning the physics of early galaxy formation from the auto-power spectra of these lines or their cross-correlation with galaxy surveys. We leverage neural density estimation with normalizing flows to learn the mapping between the simulated power spectra and parameters that characterize the physics governing the star formation efficiency and the $\dot{\Sigma}_{\star}$-$\Sigma_\mathrm{g}$ relation of high-redshift galaxies. Our results show that their partially degenerate effects can be unambiguously constrained when combining [CII] with [OIII] measurements to be made by new-generation mm/sub-mm LIM experiments.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: an extended [OIII] halo around the sub-Eddington quasar J1342+0928 at z=7.54</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (\textit{JWST}) opened a new observational window on the primordial Universe. Here we present new JWST NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy (IFS) observations of the $z=7.54$ quasar ULAS J1342+0928 obtained as part of the Galaxy Assembly with NIRSpec IFS (GA-NIFS) GTO programme. The new data-set obtained with both the prism ($R\sim100$) and the high-resolution grating ($R\sim2700$) allow for a complete description of the quasar emission from the rest-frame UV to optical bands. The low-resolution data reveal the presence of [\ion{O}{iii}] emission on $\sim$7 kpc scales, well above the typical galaxy size at this redshift, likely associated with a past outflow event. Additionally, the high-resolution observations show a more energetic ionised outflow on nuclear scales ($\lesssim 0.6$ kpc). The total ionised mass outflow rate ranges between 50 and 300 $\rm M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}$ where the significant spread is mostly due to the lack of tight constraints on the electron density. This range overlaps in part with the star formation rate range (85--545 $\rm M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}$), implying that the nuclear outflow could ultimately lead to an early star formation quenching. By employing an accretion disc modelling, for the first time on \textit{JWST} data, we manage to robustly estimate the black hole mass and the bolometric luminosity, $\rm \log(M_{BH}/(M_{\odot}))=9.2\pm 0.2$ and $\rm \log(L_{bol}/(erg \, s^{-1}))=46.8\pm 0.1$, respectively. We derive an Eddington ratio of $\rm \lambda_{Edd}\sim 0.4$, challenging the paradigm of widespread super-Eddington accretion in quasars at the epoch of reionisation.</description>

      <title>A galactic tug-of-war: how (not) to simultaneously fit the Milky Way satellite luminosity function and the mass-metallicity relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The satellite population of the Milky Way is shaped by a range of astrophysical processes including mergers, star formation, feedback, and cosmic reionisation. Determining which processes most strongly influence its properties is challenging and a key test of galaxy formation models. We train a neural network on the GALFORM semi-analytic model and apply a variance-based sensitivity analysis to characterise the influence of 11 astrophysical parameters on two key observables: the satellite luminosity function, and the mass-metallicity relation. We find that: (1) the abundance of bright satellites ($\mathrm{M}_V \lesssim -13$) is regulated primarily by supernova feedback; (2) the faint end of the luminosity function is shaped by the interplay between feedback and reionisation; and (3) the mass-metallicity relation is governed almost exclusively by feedback at all masses. We are unable to find a combination of parameters in the fiducial model that fits the observed data for both statistics simultaneously. To understand why, we employ SHapley Additive exPlanations to capture the directionality of each parameter variation. This enables us to pinpoint the origin of tensions in the model, showing that parameter adjustments that regulate the abundance of faint satellites drive stellar metallicities to be an order of magnitude too low and vice versa. This internal "tug-of-war" leads us to consider extensions to the baseline model, such as metal loading in winds, or allowing the feedback strength to evolve with redshift. Our study highlights the value of interrogating complex physical models through a sensitivity analysis framework by revealing high-order parameter interactions and non-linear responses that traditional one-at-a-time variations would miss.</description>

      <title>A Pristine Star-Forming Complex at z=4.19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a faint (M_1700 ~ -12.2), oxygen-deficient strongly-lensed ionizing source -- dubbed LAP2 (Lensed And Pristine 2) -- at a spectroscopic redshift of z=4.19. LAP2 appears to be isolated and lies very close to the caustic produced by the lensing galaxy cluster Abell 2744. It was observed with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec MSA in prism mode as part of the UNCOVER program. The NIRSpec spectrum reveals prominent Lya emission (7.1 sigma), clear Ha emission (6.2 sigma), tentative Hb emission (2.8 sigma), and no detectable [OIII]4959,5007 (~ 7 times fainter than Ha). The inferred [OIII] 2 sigma upper limit corresponds to an R3 index &lt;0.85 (assuming the Ha/Hb ~ 2.86 case~B recombination ratio), which, under high-ionization conditions, implies a metallicity of Z &lt; 6 X 10^(-3) Z_sun. The combination of faint ultraviolet luminosity, large rest-frame Ha equivalent width (~ 650 A), and extremely compact size (&lt; 10 pc) suggests that LAP2 is being caught in an early, pristine formation phase consistent with an instantaneous-burst scenario, with an estimated stellar mass of at most a few 10^4 Msun. Deep VLT/MUSE observations further reveal copious Lya emission forming an arclet that straddles the critical line. LAP2 thus joins the rare class of extremely metal-poor star-forming complexes that JWST has started to unveil at redshifts 3 - 7, and provides a rare glimpse into a still very poorly explored faint-luminosity regime.</description>

      <title>Toward the fabric of the Milky Way I. The density of disk streams from a local $250^3$ pc$^3$ volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07075v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied 12 disk streams found in a 250$^3$ pc$^3$ volume in the solar neighborhood, which we define as coeval and comoving stellar structures with aspect ratios greater than 3:1. Using Gaia Data Release 3 data and the advanced clustering algorithms SigMA and Uncover, we identified and characterized these streams beyond the search volume, doubling, on average, their known populations. We estimate the number density of disk streams to be $\approx 820$ objects / kpc$^3$ (for $|Z| &lt; 100$ pc), or surface densities of $\approx 160$ objects / kpc$^2$. These estimates surpass N-body estimates by one to two orders of magnitude and challenge the prevailing understanding of their destruction mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that these 12 disk streams are dynamically cold with 3D velocity dispersions between 2 and 5 km s$^{-1}$, exhibit narrow sequences in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and are highly elongated with average aspect ratios of 7:1, extending up to several hundred parsecs. We find evidence suggesting that one of the disk streams, currently embedded in the Scorpius-Centaurus association, is experiencing disruption, likely due to the primordial gas mass of the association.</description>

      <title>Numerical effects on the stripping of dark matter and stars in IllustrisTNG galaxy groups and clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar haloes and intra-cluster light around galaxies are crucial test beds for dark matter (DM) physics and galaxy formation models. We consider the role that the numerical resolution plays in the modelling of these systems by studying the stripping of satellites in the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations. We focus on host haloes of total halo mass $M_\mathrm{200c}=10^{12-15}M_{\odot}$ and satellites of stellar mass $&gt;10^{7}$$M_{\odot}$, and compare stellar halo / satellite properties across 9 IllustrisTNG runs with baryonic particle mass resolution between $8.5\times10^4M_{\odot}$ and $7\times10^8$$M_{\odot}$, using a Lagrangian-region technique to identify counterpart satellites across different resolution simulations of the same volume. We publish the corresponding catalogues alongside this paper. We demonstrate that the stripping of DM from satellites that orbit in group- and cluster-mass hosts is largely independent of resolution at least until 90 per cent of their initial mass at infall has been stripped. We do not find evidence for spurious disruption of galaxies due to insufficient resolution for the satellite masses we consider. By contrast, the stripping of stellar mass is strongly resolution-dependent: each factor of 8 improvement in particle stellar mass typically adds 2~Gyr to the stripping time. Improved numerical resolution within the IllustrisTNG model generally results in more compact satellites with larger stellar masses, which in turn generate more centrally concentrated stellar haloes and intra-cluster mass profiles. However, the concomitant increase in stellar mass of both satellites and hosts may still be the cause for the overprediction of the stellar halo mass at large host radii relative to observations seen in some previous studies.</description>

      <title>Prestellar Cores in Turbulent Clouds: Observational Perspectives on Structure, Kinematics, and Lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze an ensemble of simulated prestellar cores to facilitate interpretation of structure, kinematics, and lifetime of observed cores. While our theory predicts a "characteristic" density for star formation, it also predicts that the individual critical density varies among cores; any observed sample thus contains cores at various evolutionary stages within a given density bin. By analyzing the remaining lifetime, we find cores undergoing quasi-equilibrium collapse evolve on a timescale of twice the freefall time throughout most of their life. Our analysis shows that the central column density and the associated full-width half maximum provide a reasonably accurate observational estimator of the central volume density, and therefore the freefall time; this does, however require resolving the central column density plateau. Observations with a finite beam size tend to underestimate densities of evolved cores, and this makes observed lifetimes appear to decrease more steeply than the apparent freefall time. We measure from our simulations the ratio of prestellar duration to envelope infall time, and find this is consistent with the observed relative number of prestellar cores and embedded protostars. Yet, the absolute core lifetime in our simulations is significantly shorter than would be expected from empirical measurements of the relative numbers of prestellar cores and Class II sources; we discuss several possible reasons for this discrepancy. Finally, our simulated cores have nearly constant line-of-sight velocity dispersion within the emitting region in the sky plane, resembling observed "coherent cores." We show that this "coherence" is a consequence of projection effects, which mask the intrinsic power-law velocity structure function. We discuss possible ways to estimate line-of-sight path lengths.</description>

      <title>Constraining Baryon Fractions in Galaxy Groups and Clusters with the First CHIME/FRB Outrigger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) provide a sensitive probe of diffuse baryons: their dispersion measures (DMs) measure electron density independent of temperature and scale linearly with gas density. This makes them particularly well suited to studying the intragroup medium (IGrM), where traditional probes such as X-ray emission and the SZ effect are weak. Evidence suggests that the baryon content of group mass halos ($M_{500}\sim10^{13}-10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$) is strongly affected by galactic feedback, creating deviations from cluster scaling relations. Three FRBs from the first CHIME/FRB Outrigger sample come from host galaxies found within or behind galaxy clusters and groups. Using integrated halo density models, we estimate the DM contribution of each ICM/IGrM, accounting for uncertainties in halo mass and the distance to the host galaxy relative to the cluster center. For the more massive halos, predicted cluster DMs agree with the extragalactic DM budget. One burst, FRB 20230703A, intersects three groups yet has a low extragalactic DM. By comparing model predictions with the measured DM, we constrain the baryon fraction $f_g(R)$ in these halos. Comparing with published $M-f_g$ relations, we find consistency with recent eROSITA results at $R_{500}$, mild tension at $R_{200}$, and strong tensions with earlier X-ray-based relations. As CHIME/FRB Outriggers build a large catalog of localized FRBs, many additional sightlines through groups and clusters will be obtained. These will enable systematic tests of intragroup and intracluster gas properties and sharpen constraints on the distribution of baryons in massive halos.</description>

      <title>AGN-heated dust revealed in "Little Red Dots"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a puzzling population of extragalactic sources whose origin is highly debated. In this Letter, we stack NIRCam, MIRI and ALMA images of a large and homogeneously-selected sample of LRDs from multiple JWST Legacy fields. We find clear evidence for hot-dust emission, seen as a rising mid-infrared continuum up to rest-frame $\lambda_{\rm rest}$$\sim$ 3$\mu$m, that is best explained by a standard dusty AGN structure. This scenario holds regardless of whether the Optical/Ultraviolet (UV) continuum is stellar or AGN-dominated. Either ways, we argue that AGN-heated dust must have a geometry that leaves at least part of the Optical/UV continuum and broad-line region emission unobscured, which explains the observed blue UV slopes and prominent Balmer features. Lack of detections in the deep stack of X-ray images suggests that Compton-thick ($N_{\rm H}$$&gt;$3$\times$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) gas obscuration is common, and likely confined within the dust sublimation radius ($R$$_{\rm sub}$$\sim$0.1 pc). While this gas-dust displacement is in line with recent models (e.g. the ``Black Hole Star''), how pre-enriched hot dust can form around a nearly-pristine black hole environment remains to be explained.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Rays on Galaxy Scales: Progress and Pitfalls for CR-MHD Dynamical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen many arguments for cosmic rays (CRs) as an important influence on galactic and circumgalactic (CGM) physics, star and galaxy formation. We present a pedagogical overview of state-of-the-art modeling of CR-magnetohydrodynamics (CR-MHD) on macro scales (~kpc), highlighting their fundamental dependence on the micro (&lt; au) scales of CR gyro orbits and meso (~pc) scales of CR mean-free-paths, intended to connect the extragalactic, Galactic, and plasma CR transport modeling communities. We note the pitfalls and systematic errors that arise from older assumptions in CR modeling, including: use of a simple Fokker-Planck equation or ad-hoc two-moment formalisms for transport; assumption of leaky boxes or plane-parallel or shear-periodic boundaries for comparison to local interstellar medium (LISM) observations; ignoring detailed LISM constraints on CR spectra (e.g. focusing only on extragalactic observables or spectrally integrated models); assuming CR transport is mediated by classical models of advection, streaming from self-confinement (super-Alfvenic or Alfvenic), or extrinsic turbulence. We emphasize recent progress addressing these: development of rigorously-derived CR-MHD equations; use of global, 3D galaxy+halo models for LISM comparisons; new methods for full-spectrum dynamics; novel models for intermittent scattering and/or new drivers. We compile extragalactic+LISM observations to show how ~GeV CR transport is being rapidly constrained in the CGM, and present phenomenological models which can be used in future simulations. We conclude by highlighting critical open questions for micro, meso, and macro-scale CR-MHD simulations.</description>

      <title>Probing the Infrared/Radio correlation of the full IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample with MeerKAT and the VLA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the infrared/radio correlation of galaxies in the IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample using new MeerKAT observations at $\rm\nu = 1.28\, GHz$, complemented with VLA data. We classify the objects by primary energy source (Active Galactic Nuclei vs. Star-Forming) and take into account their merger status. With this, we aim to explore the effect of galaxy-galaxy interaction on the total-infrared (TIR)/radio correlation ($q_\mathrm{TIR}$) of star-forming galaxies by comparing the $q_\mathrm{TIR}$ distribution between isolated and interacting/merging sources. We found the median $q_\mathrm{TIR}$ to be $2.61 \pm 0.01$ (scatter = 0.16) for isolated galaxies and $2.51 \pm 0.08$ (scatter = 0.26) for interacting/merging galaxies. Our analysis reveals that interacting/merging galaxies exhibit lower $q_\mathrm{TIR}$ and higher dispersion compared to isolated galaxies, and the difference is marginally significant. Interacting/merging galaxies have redder $W2-W3$ colours, higher star formation rates (SFR) and specific SFR compared to isolated objects. We observe a significant decrease in $q_\mathrm{TIR}$ with increasing radio luminosity for isolated galaxies. Additionally, we find the median ratio of TIR ($8 \,\mu m &lt; \lambda &lt; 1000\, \mu m$) to far-infrared (FIR; $40 \,\mu m &lt; \lambda &lt; 120\, \mu m$) luminosities to be $\left&lt;L_\mathrm{TIR}/L_\mathrm{FIR}\right&gt;\approx2.29$. By examining the relation between $L_\mathrm{TIR}$ and the mid-infrared (MIR) star-formation rate indicator ($L_\mathrm{12\,\mu m}$) employed for our interacting/merging sample, we note a strong and consistent (similar non-linear behaviour) relationship between the TIR/radio and TIR/MIR ratios. Finally, we show that already at $z&lt;0.1$, $q_\mathrm{TIR}$ exhibits a dependence on stellar mass, with more massive galaxies displaying a lower $q_\mathrm{TIR}$.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Impact of Cosmic Rays on the Disc Sizes and Outflows from Dwarf Scales to Galaxy Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) are a non-thermal energy component in the interstellar and circumgalactic medium (CGM) that can act as an additional feedback channel beyond thermal and kinetic feedback from stars and AGN. They influence galaxy evolution by altering gas properties, regulating star formation, and shaping galactic outflows. We investigate these effects using a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations, which incorporate CR transport and feedback on top of the Auriga galaxy formation model. Our simulations span a wide range of halo masses, from dwarf galaxies to small groups ($M_{200\mathrm{c}}= 10^{10} - 10^{13}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$), allowing us to assess the mass-dependent impact of CRs in a cosmological setting. We find that CRs have the strongest impact in lower-mass galaxies ($M_{200\mathrm{c}} &lt; 10^{12}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$), where they suppress star formation rates by up to 50\%, reduce gas and stellar half-light radii, and drive outflows that reach higher velocities at the virial radius compared to simulations without CRs. These CR-enhanced outflows also transport more metals and magnetic fields into the CGM, leading to higher CGM metallicities, stronger magnetisation, and lower CGM temperatures. In more massive galaxies, CRs do not significantly affect star formation or outflow properties, likely because thermal and kinetic feedback from stars and AGN dominate in this regime. However, CRs still influence galaxy morphology across all halo masses by reducing the gas half-mass radius and stellar half-light radius. Finally, variations in CR transport properties, such as different diffusion coefficients or the exclusion of Alfv\'en cooling, significantly affect star formation, CGM properties, and outflows in lower-mass galaxies. This sensitivity makes these galaxies key environments for testing CR transport models and refining our understanding of their role in galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Conditions for Bar Formation in Bulgeless Disk Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While bars are commonly observed in disk galaxies, the precise conditions governing their formation remain incompletely understood. To investigate these conditions, we perform a suite of N-body simulations of bulgeless disk galaxies with stellar masses in the range $10^9 \leq M_d \leq 10^{11} \;M_\odot$. Our galaxy models are constructed based on the observed properties of nearby barred galaxies from the S4G survey, and we systematically vary the halo scale radius to isolate its dynamical influence. Bars in our simulations form via repeated swing amplifications of disk perturbations, sustained by feedback loops. The amplification factor $\Gamma$ depends on both the Toomre stability parameter $Q_T$ and the dimensionless wavelength $X$. Based on our simulation results, we propose a two-parameter bar formation criterion, $Q_T + 0.4(X - 1.4)^2 \leq 1.8$, corresponding to $\Gamma = 10$, which better captures the onset of bar formation than traditional one-parameter conditions. Bars in low-mass galaxies tend to be shorter and weaker, and are more susceptible to disruption by outer spiral arms. In contrast, bars in high-mass galaxies are longer, stronger, and more resilient to spiral interference. Bars in low-mass galaxies undergo only slight vertical thickening over time, whereas those in high-mass galaxies thicken rapidly via buckling instability.</description>

      <title>Supernovae drive large-scale, incompressible turbulence through small-scale instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sources of turbulence in our Galaxy may be diverse, but core-collapse supernovae (SNe) alone provide enough energy to sustain a steady-state galactic turbulence cascade. By localizing and analyzing supernova remnants (SNRs) in high-resolution SNe-driven galactic disk cut-out simulations from Beattie et al. (2025), I show that SNRs radiate incompressible turbulence through baroclinic vorticity generation, localized at the interface where the hot and warm plasma phases mix near the cooling radius. I provide evidence that this process is seeded by a Vishniac (1994)-type instability, which corrugates and folds the interface. I present an analytical relation for a baroclinicity-fed incompressible mode spectrum, which matches that observed in the simulated SNRs. The unstable layer produces a spectrum of incompressible modes $\propto k^{-3/2}$ locally within the SNRs. Through the inverse cascade mechanism described and measured in Beattie et al. (2025), this opens the possibility that the $\propto k^{-3/2}$ spectrum, arising from corrugated folds in the unstable SNR layer, can imprint itself on kiloparsec scales, thereby connecting small-scale instabilities in the layer to the large-scale incompressible turbulence cascade.</description>

      <title>Cosmological simulations of the same spiral galaxy: satellite properties, the role of baryonic physics and star formation history in shaping dark matter cores/cusps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of baryonic physics in shaping the population, structure, and internal dynamics of galactic subhalos using the Mochima suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations. A refined method is developed to identify bound subhalo material by isolating the local gravitational potential and applying multi-criteria phase-space selection. This approach enables a robust characterisation of subhalo properties across five baryonic runs with varying prescriptions for star formation, and supernova and protostellar feedback, as well as a dark matter-only baseline. At the population level, we find that host halo concentration, modulated by baryonic feedback, is a key predictor of subhalo survival. Subhalos with more massive stellar components exhibit deeper internal potentials and enhanced resilience to tidal disruption. At the structural level, we identify a broad diversity in inner dark matter profiles, consistent with observations of dwarf galaxies. We show that this diversity correlates with both star formation history and environmental interaction. In particular, galaxies that form most of their stars early tend to retain steep cusps, while those with extended or recent star formation exhibit oscillating inner slopes shaped by bursty feedback and tidal perturbations. These findings suggest that the so-called "diversity problem" may reflect the complex interplay between feedback history and gravitational environment, rather than a breakdown of cold dark matter predictions.</description>

      <title>Balmer Absorption in Iron Low-Ionization Broad Absorption Line Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While C IV is the most common absorption line in Broad Absorption Line Quasar spectra, Balmer absorption lines are among the rarest. We present analysis of Balmer absorption in a sample of fourteen iron low-ionization BAL quasars (FeLoBALQs); eight are new identifications. We measured velocity offset, width, and apparent optical depth. The partial covering ubiquitous in BAL quasar spectra alters the measured Balmer optical depth ratios; taking that into account, we estimated the true H(n= 2) column density. We found the anticipated correlation between Eddington ratio and outflow speed, but it is weak in this sample because nearly all of the objects have the low outflow speeds characterizing loitering outflow FeLoBAL quasars (H. Choi et al. 2022b), objects that are also found to have low accretion rates (K. M. Leighly et al. 2022; H. Choi et al. 2022a). Measures of dN/dv, the differential column density with respect to the outflow speed, are anticorrelated with the luminosity and Eddington ratio: the strongest absorption is observed at the lowest speeds in the lowest luminosity objects. The absorption line width is correlated with {\alpha}oi, the F{\lambda} point-to-point slope between 5100A and 3 microns. This parameter is strongly correlated with the Eddington ratio among low-redshift quasars (K. M. Leighly et al. 2024). Balmer absorption lines have been recently found in the spectra of Little Red Dots (LRDs), a class of high-redshift objects discovered by JWST. We note suggestive similarities between LRDs and FeLoBAL quasars in the emission line shape, the presence of steep reddening and a scattered blue continuum, the lack of hot dust emission, and X-ray weakness.</description>

      <title>An all-sky 3D dust map Based on Gaia and LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive 3D dust reddening map covering the entire Milky Way, constructed by combining reddening estimates based on LAMOST low-resolution spectra (E(B$-$V)$_{\rm LAMOST}$) with those derived from $Gaia$ XP spectra (E(B$-$V)$_{\rm XP}$), along with revised $Gaia$ distances. E(B$-$V)$_{\rm LAMOST}$ values of $\sim$ 4.6 million unique sources were obtained with the standard-pair analysis using LAMOST DR11 stellar parameters and synthesized $B/V$-band photometry from $Gaia$ XP spectra, showing a typical precision of $\sim$ 0.01 mag. The E(B$-$V)$_{\rm XP}$ from the catalog of \citet{zhang2023}, which was derived using forward modeling of $Gaia$ XP spectra, were cross-validated with E(B$-$V)$_{\rm LAMOST}$, leading to the selection of $\sim$ 150 million high-reliability measurements. The combined dataset achieves a median precision of $\sim$ 0.03 mag for E(B$-$V). To model the reddening -- distance relationship along various lines-of-sight, we implemented a parametric approach that accounts for contributions from the local bubble, diffuse interstellar-medium, and multiple potential molecular clouds. The sky was adaptively partitioned based on stellar density, resulting in angular resolutions ranging from 3.4$^{\prime}$ to 58$^{\prime}$, with about half of the sky having a resolution better than 6.9$^{\prime}$. The reddening precision of our 3D map for individual stars reaches $\sim$ 0.01 mag in most regions at $|b| &gt; 20^\circ$, but degrades to 0.01-0.05 mag at $|b| &lt; 20^\circ$. The map reaches a maximum distance of 3-5 kpc in high-extinction regions with $|b| &lt; 5^\circ$, and extends to 10-15 kpc elsewhere. An interactive platform and Python package have been developed for utilization of the 3D dust map. Available online: https://nadc.china-vo.org/data/dustmaps/.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive All-Sky Catalog of 3345 Molecular Clouds from Three-dimensional Dust Extinction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the distribution and properties of molecular clouds is crucial for tracing the structure and evolution of the interstellar medium and the large-scale morphology of the Milky Way. Here we present an all-sky catalog of 3,345 molecular clouds identified from our previous three-dimensional dust reddening map using a dendrogram-based clustering method with distance-adaptive parameters. The catalog spans heliocentric distances from 90 pc to 4.3 kpc and includes key physical properties for each cloud, including position, size, mass, surface density, and dust density. Approximately 650 clouds in our catalog are associated with the boundary of the Local Bubble, while around 740 clouds (excluding those associated with the Local Bubble) are located at high Galactic latitudes ($|b| &gt; 20^\circ$). The spatial distribution of the cataloged clouds reveals prominent large-scale features in the Galactic disk, including coherent spur-like structures, large-scale cavities, and a more detailed view of the Local Bubble shell. These findings refine our understanding of how molecular clouds trace the Galactic spiral arm network and provide new insight into the spatial structure of the Local Bubble. The catalog serves as a valuable resource for future studies of star formation, Galactic structure, and the interaction between molecular clouds and large-scale ISM features.</description>

      <title>Beyond No Tension: JWST z &gt; 10 Galaxies Push Simulations to the Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has identified some of the Universe's earliest galaxies, repeatedly pushing the frontier to ever higher redshifts and stellar masses. The presence of such extreme galaxies at such early times, with large stellar populations and high star-formation rates, naturally results in a tension between observation and theory. This tension between numerical models and observations can be either due to our underlying cosmological models or due to a gap in our understanding of early Universe astrophysics. In a prelude to this letter, we showed how the Renaissance simulations, which focused on high redshift galaxy formation were able to reconstruct similar stellar masses to the earliest and highest mass galaxies that had been discovered by JWST at the time of its publication (McCaffrey et al.2023). Since then many more galaxies have been discovered by JWST, in particular the "Mirage-or-Miracle" (MoM) survey broke the record recently with the highest redshift galaxy MoM-z14, which has a spectroscopically confirmed redshift of $z \sim 14.44$ followed closely by GS-z14 with a spectroscopically confirmed redshift of $z \sim 14.3$. We investigate in this letter whether these newly discovered galaxies are in conflict with the Renaissance simulations and thus whether they are causing tension with our established models of cosmology and/or high-redshift astrophysics. We discover that MoM-z14's high mass at early redshift can be explained by the Renaissance simulation suite, whereas the extremely high stellar mass of GS-z14 remains an outlier when compared to previous measurements of high-redshift galaxies detected by JWST and our numerical models (even after accounting for cosmic variance).</description>

      <title>Unveiling Galactic substructures with M Giant stars: A kinematic and chemical study based on LAMOST DR9, Gaia DR3 and APOGEE DR17</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the updated M giant star catalog selected from LAMOST DR9, we iden-tify substructures within the integrals-of-motion space through Friends-of-Friends cluster-ing algorithm. We obtain members belonging to several known substructures: the Sagittarius stream, Galactic Anticenter Substructure (GASS), Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES), Splash, and the high-{\alpha} disk. Furthermore, we also identify two groups which cannot be clearly asso-ciated with previously known substructures. Our findings confirm the existence of metal-rich constituents within the GES, representing newly formed stars that originated from the metal-enriched gas delivered during the GES merger event and subsequently evolved. Additionally, this study further expands the sample of GASS, high-{\alpha} disk, and Splash stars. Analysis of these metal-rich M giant stars as members of the GES, Splash, and high-{\alpha} disk compo-nents supports an evolution scenario for the early Milky Way, as proposed by previous stud-ies. In this scenario, stars initially formed in a high-{\alpha} primordial disk were dynamically heated by the massive accretion event (GES). This process redistributed stellar orbits, creat-ing the Splash population, while the undisturbed portion of the primordial disk persisted as the present-day high-{\alpha} disk component.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive separation of dark matter and baryonic mass components in galaxy clusters I: Mass constraints from Abell S1063</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this two-part series, we present a multi-probe mass modelling method for massive galaxy clusters, designed to disentangle the contributions of individual mass components (Dark matter, intra-cluster gas, stellar masses). In this first paper, we focus on recovering the mass constraint datasets required for the modelling approach introduced in the second paper. Specifically, we measure the light distribution, stellar mass, and kinematics of the cluster members, the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and the intra-cluster light (ICL) in Abell S1063. To that end, we developed a new method to extract the light profiles of the cluster members, BCG, and ICL, while accounting for contamination from nearby foreground and background galaxies in \textsc{Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) imaging. We obtained light profiles for $289$ cluster members using a dual Pseudo-Isothermal Elliptical (dPIE) model based on the HST F160W filter, while the BCG \&amp; ICL is modelled as a single component using a multi-Gaussian expansion. To estimate stellar masses and velocity dispersions, we rely on multi-band HST photometry and \textsc{VLT/MUSE} integral field spectroscopy, respectively. Stellar masses are derived using three different spectral energy distribution (SED) models. We measure the line-of-sight velocity dispersions of the cluster members at their half-light radii, as determined from their light profiles, while for the BCG \&amp; ICL components, we use elliptical annular apertures. Thanks to these measurements, we will be able to constrain the cluster stellar mass content, which is detailed in the second paper of the series. We publicly release these measurements with intermediary data products.</description>

      <title>The heart of NGC 5253 as seen with MUSE-NFM: nitrogen enrichment through stellar chemical feedback at parsec scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NGC 5253 is a nearby (D=3.6 Mpc) Blue Compact Dwarf galaxy, notable for its three massive young super star clusters (SSCs) and nitrogen enrichment. Its similarity to extreme star-forming galaxies at high redshift makes it a good local analogue for studying chemical enrichment at high spatial resolution. We characterise the ionised gas and dust in the giant HII region in the proximity of the three SSCs in the centre of NGC 5253 using new Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer Narrow Field Mode adaptive optics-assisted data at unprecedented spatial resolution of 0."15$\sim$2.3 pc. We derive the attenuation for the central SSCs and, for the first time, map the extinction parameter ($R_V$) in an extragalactic object. $R_V$ varies among SSCs, suggesting differences in dust physics. Electron temperature and density diagnostics yield flat temperature distributions $T_\mathrm{e,median}$([NII])$=12000 \pm 1700$ K and $T_\mathrm{e,median}$([SIII])$ = 11000 \pm 600$ K, and a structured $n_e$([SII]) of maximum $1930 \pm 40$ cm$^{-3}$. The direct method gives a flat helium abundance ($10^3y^+ = 81 \pm 4$) and uniform oxygen abundance ($12 + \log(\text{O/H}) = 8.22 \pm 0.05$). N/O shows a factor 2-3 enhancement around the SSCs, mapped here for the first time at such high spatial resolution. The total excess nitrogen mass is $\sim$0.3 $M_\odot$, which we estimate is producible by the observed WN-type Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Because there is no direct spatial overlap between the enrichment and WR star positions, the N-rich material appears to have been expelled from the original sites.</description>

Abstract: We measure and compare the size of the dusty torus with active galactic nucleus (AGN) luminosity and the size of the broad-line region (BLR), using a sample of 182 AGNs with the best H$\beta$ lag measurements. After correcting for accretion-disk contamination, torus sizes are determined from the time lags of the WISE W1 and W2 band light curves relative to the optical band variability based on the interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF) analysis and the Multiple and Inhomogeneous Component Analysis (MICA). We find that the torus size from the W1-band (W2-band) tightly correlates with the 5100~\AA\ continuum luminosity with an intrinsic scatter of 0.15-0.16 dex and the best-fit slope of $0.35 \pm 0.03$ ($0.33 \pm 0.03$), which is clearly shallower than the expected 0.5 slope from the sublimation radius-luminosity relation. We find a moderate negative trend that higher Eddington AGNs tend to have smaller torus sizes than expected from the best-fit, suggesting the Eddington ratio plays a role in flattening the torus size-luminosity relation. By comparing the torus size with the H$\beta$ reverberation time lag for a subsample of 67 AGNs, we find that the torus size is a factor of $\sim 10$ and $\sim 14$ larger than the BLR size, respectively for W1 and W2 bands. The torus size based on the W1 (W2) band correlates with the BLR size with the best-fit slope of $1.26 \pm 0.17$ ($1.10 \pm 0.16$), which is comparable but slightly steeper than a linear correlation.</description>

      <title>Disclosing Submillimeter Galaxy Formation: Mergers or Secular Evolution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the morphology of 125 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the PRIMER-COSMOS field using double Sersic modeling on JWST NIRCam images across six bands (F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M and F444W), with SMGs being classified by bulge Sersic index (n_bulge) and bulge-to-total luminosity ratio (B/T). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between the bright (SFR &gt; 175 M_sun yr^{-1}) and the faint group (SFR &lt; 175 M_sun yr^{-1}) reveals no significant statistical differences in morphology across bands. However, we notice that SMGs skew towards higher B/T ratios and lower n_bulge from shorter to longer wavelengths. In F444W, bright SMGs exhibit higher B/T and lower n_bulge, indicating flatter, disturbed bulges, while faint SMGs show lower B/T and higher n_bulge. Notably, SMGs with higher B/T tend to have low Sersic index, challenging the local universe dichotomy of classical bulges (B/T &gt; 0.5, n &gt; 4) versus pseudo-bulges (B/T &lt; 0.35, n &lt; 2). In the F277W band, non-parametric measurements indicate predominantly disk-dominated patterns, with only 24 percent of SMGs demonstrating merger signatures. After the removal of SMGs with disturbed morphology, the bulge classification scheme in F277W shows pseudo-bulges (21 percent) and clump migration bulges (16 percent) from secular evolution, compared to 4 percent merger-built bulges. Surprisingly, 48 percent of SMGs defy the classification scheme, showing high B/T (approximately 0.7) but low Sersic index (n_bulge &lt;= 1). Bars are confirmed in 7 percent of SMGs. This work suggests that secular evolution takes precedence over major mergers, supporting the idea that isolated evolution fueled by filamentary gas inflow plays a non-negligible role in the SMG bulge formation.</description>

      <title>The evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and star formation rates in the COLIBRE simulations from redshift 17 to 0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) and star formation rates (SFRs) across cosmic time in the COLIBRE simulations of galaxy formation. COLIBRE includes a multiphase interstellar medium, radiative cooling rates coupled to a model for the evolution of dust grains, and employs prescriptions for stellar and AGN feedback calibrated to reproduce the $z=0$ observed GSMF and stellar mass - size relation. We present the evolution of the GSMF from simulations at three resolutions: $m_{\rm gas}\approx m_{\rm dm}\sim 10^7$, $10^6$, and $10^5~\mathrm{M_\odot}$, in cosmological volumes of up to $400^3$, $200^3$, and $50^3$ cMpc$^3$, respectively. We demonstrate that COLIBRE is consistent with the observed GSMF over the full redshift range for which there are observations to compare with ($0&lt;z&lt;12$), with maximum systematic deviations of $\approx 0.3$ dex reached at $2&lt;z&lt;4$. We also examine the evolution of the star-forming main sequence, cosmic SFR density, stellar mass density, and galaxy quenched fraction, making predictions for both the fiducial COLIBRE model with thermally-driven AGN feedback and its variant with hybrid (thermal + kinetic jet) AGN feedback, and finding good agreement with observations. Notably, we show that COLIBRE matches the number density of massive quiescent galaxies at high redshifts reported by JWST, while predicting a stellar-to-halo mass relation that evolves little with redshift. We conclude that neither a redshift-dependent star formation efficiency, nor a variable stellar initial mass function, nor a deviation from $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ is necessary to reproduce the high-redshift JWST stellar masses and SFRs.</description>

      <title>Micro-Tidal Disruption Events in Young Star Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense young star clusters (YSCs) are ideal environments for dynamical interactions between stars and stellar mass black holes (BHs). In such dense environments, stars can undergo close encounters with BHs and fall within their tidal radius, resulting in micro-tidal disruption events (micro-TDEs), transient phenomena with potential multi-messenger signatures. We performed a suite of direct N-body simulations using the PETAR code, to which we implemented new prescriptions for modeling micro-TDEs. We constructed a set of realistic YSC models including primordial binaries, based on the observed Milky Way population. Our simulations incorporate stellar and binary evolution, supernova kicks, and stellar winds using the BSE code, and account for the Galactic tidal field via the GALPY library. We identify three dynamical channels for micro-TDE production: single star-single BH encounters, binary-mediated interactions (including supernova-kick triggers), and interactions involving higher-order multiple systems such as hierarchical triples and quadruples, as well as chaotic few-body interactions. Multiple encounters are the most efficient production channel, which dominates the total rate: 350-450 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. Micro-TDEs from YSCs are expected to be detectable by upcoming surveys, particularly the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, with detection rates potentially up to hundreds per year. The gravitational wave (GW) signals expected from micro-TDEs peak in the deci-Hertz band, making them accessible to future instruments such as the Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna and the Deci-Hertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. Micro-TDEs emerge as promising multi-messenger sources, potentially offering unique insights into star cluster dynamics, stellar collisions, and the population of dormant stellar-mass BHs, through both electromagnetic and GW observations.</description>

      <title>The first radio view of a type Ibn supernova in SN 2023fyq: Understanding the mass-loss history in the last decade before the explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernovae that interact with hydrogen-poor, helium-rich circumstellar material (CSM), known as Type Ibn supernovae (SNe Ibn), present a unique opportunity to probe mass-loss processes in massive stars. In this work, we report the first radio detection of a SN Ibn, SN 2023fyq, and characterize the mass-loss history of its stellar progenitor using the radio and X-ray observations obtained over 18 months post-explosion. We find that the radio emission from 58--185 days is best modeled by synchrotron radiation attenuated by free-free absorption from a CSM of density $\sim$ $10^{-18}$ g/$\rm{cm^{3}}$ ($\sim 10^{6} \mathrm{\rho_{ISM}}$) at a radius of $10^{16}$ cm, corresponding to a mass-loss rate of $\sim$ $4 \times 10^{-3} \ \mathrm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$ (for a wind velocity of 1700 km/s from optical spectroscopy) from 0.7 to 3 years before the explosion. This timescale is consistent with the time frame over which pre-explosion optical outbursts were observed. However, our late-time observations at 525 days post-explosion yield non-detections, and the 3$\sigma$ upper limits (along with an X-ray non-detection) allow us to infer lower-density CSM at $2\times 10^{16}$ cm with $\rm{\dot{M}}$ $&lt; 2.5\times 10^{-3} \ \mathrm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$. These results suggest a shell-like CSM from at most $4 \times 10^{15}$ to $2 \times 10^{16}$ cm ($\sim 10^{5} R_{\rm{\odot}}$) with an elevated CSM density (0.004 $\mathrm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$) that is roughly consistent with predictions from a merger model for this object. Future radio observations of a larger sample of SNe Ibn will provide key details on the extent and density of their helium-rich CSM.</description>

      <title>HE2159-0551: a very metal-poor peculiar low Ba giant -- a candidate from the LMS-1/Wukong</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive spectroscopic and kinematic analysis of the very metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -2.60 $\pm$ 0.20 dex) giant star HE2159-0551. By investigating the star's chemodynamic characteristics, we seek to address its formation, evolution, and role in the chemical enrichment of the early cosmos and the possible connection to known merger events. From high-resolution data we perform a one dimension, local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis using PyMoogi. We conduct a detailed abundance analysis of 23 elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, and Eu), allowing us to derive abundances or place limits. Finally, we compute orbital parameters to investigate the kinematics and thus the nucleosynthetic origin of HE2159-0551. The analysis yields significant insights into the chemical composition of HE2159-0551, highlighting its peculiarities among very metal-poor stars. The star shows signs of internal mixing and a peculiar abundance pattern, particular regarding the heavy elements. We find a low Ba abundance (s-process element) and a suppressed contamination of r-process elements, even though r-process enrichment may be expected in very metal-poor stars. The orbital parameters and kinematic properties indicate that HE2159-0551 is a thick disc star, connected to the old and metal-poor LMS-1/Wukong progenitor resulting from an early merger. Our kinematic analysis suggests a potential connection of HE2159-0551 to the merger LMS-1/Wukong. We conclude that the nucleosynthesis processes responsible for the star's enrichment in heavy elements are different from those observed in many other metal-poor stars as neither the main r- nor s-process can explain the derived abundance pattern. A possible weak-r or $\nu$p-process forming Sr-Zr but not Ba might have mixed into a low level of underlying r-process material in the low-mass LMS-1/Wukong system.</description>

      <title>Discovering Cataclysmic Variables from the Rubin Observatory LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will provide a windfall of new transients and variable sources. Here we have performed mock observation simulations to understand LSST's expected detection rates for cataclysmic variables (CVs) with known large amplitude variations. Under the thin-disk approximation for the distribution of CVs in our Galaxy, we found that only 20% of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae systems, representing the most energetic disk-driven outbursts in CVs, will be detected during outbursts by the LSST. Given their large amplitude (7-9 mag), {only those} brighter than $17.5$ mag at outburst maximum are expected to have an r-band quiescence counterpart in individual scans. Thanks to the planned cadence of the LSST towards the Galactic center, ~70% of the simulated outbursts will be detected twice or more on the discovery night, and two-thirds will be observed in different bands. CVs of the Polar class, which display luminosity changes up to 4 mag, can be unbiasedly recovered to 22.5 mag with more than 100 detections over 10 years of the LSST operation. Finally, we attempt to characterize the detection rate of micronovae bursts, and find that about 2.6%} of the simulated sample will be observed as a &gt;= 0.4 mag-amplitude and &lt;= 1-d duration spike in the long-term light curve. Overall, our results consolidate LSST's capability to studying time-domain phenomena in CVs, and inform on how to plan and organize follow-up observation strategies on transients discovered by LSST.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlations between the CLAMATO Lyman-alpha forest and galaxies within the COSMOS field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the 3D cross-correlation between the absorption of the $z\sim 2.3$ Lyman-alpha forest measured by the COSMOS Lyman-Alpha Mapping And Tomography Observations (CLAMATO) survey, and 1642 foreground galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from several different surveys, including 3D-HST, CLAMATO, zCOSMOS-Deep, MOSDEF, and VUDS. For each survey, we compare the measured cross-correlation with models incorporating the galaxy linear bias as well as observed redshift dispersion and systematic redshift offset. The derived redshift dispersion and offsets are generally consistent with those expected from, e.g., spectroscopic redshifts measured with UV absorption lines or NIR emission lines observed with specific instruments, but we find hints of `fingers-of-god' caused by overdensities in the field. We combine our foreground galaxy sample, and split them into 3 bins of robustly-estimated stellar mass in order to study the stellar mass-halo mass relationship. For sub-samples with median stellar masses of $\log_{10}(M_* / M_\odot) = [9.23,9.71,10.21]$, we find galaxy biases of $b_g\approx [2.9, 3.3,4.7]$, respectively. A comparison with mock measurements from the Bolshoi-Planck $N$-body simulation yields corresponding halo masses of $\log_{10}(M_* / M_\odot) \approx [10.3,11.6,12.1]$ for these stellar mass bins. At the low mass end, our results suggest enhanced star formation histories in mild tension with predictions from previous angular correlation and abundance matching-based observations, and the IllustrisTNG simulation.</description>

      <title>TeV Emission in NGC 4278: Shock Energetics Insufficient, Compact Origin Favored</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory recently detected TeV emission from the low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN) NGC 4278. Integral-field spectroscopy with MEGARA revealed ionized outflows on hundred-parsec scales with kinetic power $\dot E_{\rm shock} \sim 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$, well below the TeV luminosity $L_{\gamma} \gtrsim 10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The implied efficiencies, $\eta \gtrsim 1000$, are far above unity, showing that shocks cannot account for the TeV emission. Contemporaneous Fermi-Large Area Telescope and Swift data, consistent with a compact synchrotron self-Compton jet component, favor a nuclear origin. NGC 4278 is the first low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER)/LLAGN of its class detected at TeV energies, a benchmark for LINERs with outflows and a prime target for the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory. I conclude that the TeV photons arise from a compact nuclear accelerator, while optical outflows trace larger-scale jet--ISM interactions that coexist but do not power the TeV radiation.</description>

      <title>3I/ATLAS: In Search of the Witnesses to Its Voyage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered to date, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unusually high excess velocity and active cometary nature make it a key probe of the Galactic population of icy planetesimals. Understanding its origin requires tracing its past trajectory through the Galaxy and assessing the possible role of stellar encounters, both as a potential origin and a perturber to its orbit. We integrated the orbit of 3I/ATLAS backward in time for 10 Myr, together with a sample of Gaia DR3 stars with high-quality astrometry and radial velocities, to identify close passages within 2 pc. We identify 93 nominal encounters, 62 of which are significant at the $2\sigma$ level. However, none of these encounters produced any meaningful perturbation. The strongest perturber Gaia DR3 6863591389529611264 at 0.30 pc and with a relative velocity of 35 km s$^{-1}$, imparted only a velocity change of $|\Delta v| \simeq 5\times10^{-4}$ km s$^{-1}$ to the orbit of 3I/ATLAS. Our results indicate that no stellar flybys within the past 10 Myr and 500 pc contained in Gaia DR3 can account for the present trajectory of 3I/ATLAS or be associated with its origin. We further show that 3I/ATLAS is kinematically consistent with a thin-disk population, despite its large peculiar velocity.</description>

      <title>A survey for variable young stars with small telescopes: X -- Comparing stochastic YSO light curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light curves of young stars exhibit photometric variability over hours to decades and across a wide range of amplitudes. On time scales beyond a few rotation periods, these light curves are typically stochastic. The variability arises from a combination of accretion rate changes, line-of-sight extinction variations, and evolving spotted stellar surfaces. We aim to develop a methodology to quantitatively compare the full variability statistics of these inhomogeneously sampled light curves with model calculations. To achieve this, we converted the light curves into variability fingerprints. They map the probability of variation by a given amount over a given timescale. Applying principal component analysis to these fingerprints produces a stable distribution of the first two principal components. We show that this distribution is a continuum without clusters. Adding a model-generated fingerprint to an observational sample does not significantly alter the distribution of the sample, allowing a robust comparison between the model and observed light curves to assess statistical realism. We show that photometric uncertainties, timing, and observing cadence have a minimal impact on model placement within the observational distribution. The main source of variance among highly variable light curves of young stars is the timescale of the onset of significant variability (above 0.3mag), with 1-3month timescales being the most critical. The secondary cause of variance are long-term (above 1.5yr) dimming or rising trends.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Cometary Anti-tails as Observed in 3I/ATLAS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS at 3.8 au show an elongated coma similar to a cometary tail but pointing in the direction of the Sun. This type of anti-tail, not a result of perspective, may not have been previously observed. We explain the anti-tail as an anisotropic extension of the snow line, or survival radius of a sublimating ice grain, in the direction of the Sun. The anisotropy is due to the difference in the sublimation mass flux in the solar and perpendicular directions caused by the change in the illumination angle of the cometary surface. The stronger sublimation mass flux in the solar direction results in ice grains with larger sizes, longer sublimation lifetimes, and a snow line at a larger radial distance with respect to other directions. The observed radial surface brightness profiles as a function of illumination angle are well reproduced by a Haser-type spherical outflow with constant velocity and sublimating ice grains with angularly dependent survival lengths.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive separation of dark matter and baryonic mass components in galaxy clusters II: an overview of the mass distribution in Abell S1063</title>

Abstract: In the first paper of this series, we derived mass constraints on the total mass and the baryonic components of the galaxy cluster Abell S1063. The main focus was to recover stellar masses and kinematics for cluster members, the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the intra-cluster light (ICL). In this second paper, we introduce a multi-probe mass modelling approach that incorporates constraints on both the total mass and the individual baryonic components. We obtain comprehensive mass models of Abell S1063, in which the dark matter distribution is disentangled from the baryonic mass at both cluster and galaxy scales. The best-fitting mass model achieves an RMS of $0.50"$ on the multiple image positions. The kinematic profiles of the BCG \&amp; ICL, as well as the X-ray surface brightness of the intra-cluster gas, are accurately reproduced within observational uncertainties. However, a $35~\mathrm{km/s}$ scatter is required for the cluster member line-of-sight dispersions. This method yields the most complex parametric mass model with consistency among almost all available mass constraints. We find a $1\sigma$ agreement between the inferred stellar-to-subhalo mass relation and that predicted by large-scale cosmological simulations. The ICL stellar mass derived from our model is consistent with estimates from stellar population modelling. We present the first multi-probe mass modelling method capable of disentangling the dark matter from the baryonic mass distributions in massive galaxy clusters. Its results, such as the stellar-to-subhalo mass relation or the distribution of each mass component, can be directly compared to hydrodynamical cosmological simulations such as illustrisTNG.</description>

      <title>A dense dark matter core of the subhalo in the strong lensing system JVAS B1938+666</title>

Abstract: The nature of dark matter remains unknown, motivating the study of fuzzy/wave dark matter (FDM/$\psi$DM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) as alternative frameworks to address small-scale discrepancies in halo profiles inferred from observations. This study presents a non-parametric reconstruction of the mass distribution of the previously-found, dark subhalo in the strong-lensing system JVAS B1938+666. Compared with the standard Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, both SIDM and $\psi$DM ($m_{\psi}=1.32^{+0.22}_{-0.31}\times 10^{-22} \, \rm eV$) provide significantly better fits to the resulting density profile. Moreover, the SIDM model is favored over $\psi$DM with a Bayes factor of 14.44. The reconstructed density profile features a characteristic kiloparsec-scale core ($r_c \approx 0.5 \, \rm kpc$) with central density $\rho_c \approx 2.5\times 10^{7}\, \rm M_{\odot} \, kpc^{-3} $, exhibiting remarkable consistency with the core-halo mass scaling relations observed in Local Group dwarf spheroidals. These findings offer insights that may help address the core-cusp discrepancy in $\Lambda$CDM substructure predictions.</description>

      <title>Auriga Streams I: disrupting satellites surrounding Milky Way-mass haloes at multiple resolutions</title>

Abstract: In a hierarchically formed Universe, galaxies accrete smaller systems that tidally disrupt as they evolve in the host's potential. We present a complete catalogue of disrupting galaxies accreted onto Milky Way-mass haloes from the Auriga suite of cosmological magnetohydrodynamic zoom-in simulations. We classify accretion events as intact satellites, stellar streams, or phase-mixed systems based on automated criteria calibrated to a visually classified sample, and match accretions to their counterparts in haloes re-simulated at higher resolution. Most satellites with a bound progenitor at the present day have lost substantial amounts of stellar mass -- 67 per cent have $f_\text{bound} &lt; 0.97$ (our threshold of lost stellar mass to no longer be considered intact), while 53 per cent satisfy a more stringent $f_\text{bound} &lt; 0.8$. Streams typically outnumber intact systems, contribute a smaller fraction of overall accreted stars, and are substantial contributors at intermediate distances from the host centre ($\sim$0.1 to $\sim$0.7$R_\text{200m}$, or $\sim$35 to $\sim$250 kpc for the Milky Way). We also identify accretion events that disrupt to form streams around massive intact satellites instead of the main host. Streams are more likely than intact or phase-mixed systems to have experienced preprocessing, suggesting this mechanism is important for setting disruption rates around Milky Way-mass haloes. All of these results are preserved across different simulation resolutions, though we do find some hints that satellites disrupt more readily at lower resolution. The Auriga haloes suggest that disrupting satellites surrounding Milky Way-mass galaxies are the norm and that a wealth of tidal features waits to be uncovered in upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>Prevention is better than cure? Feedback from high specific energy winds in cosmological simulations with Arkenstone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deploy the new Arkenstone galactic wind model in cosmological simulations for the first time, allowing us to robustly resolve the evolution and impact of high specific energy winds. In a (25 $h^{-1}$ Mpc)$^3$ box we perform a set of numerical experiments that systematically vary the mass and energy loadings of such winds, finding that their energy content is the key parameter controlling the stellar to dark matter mass ratio. Increasing the mass loading, at fixed energy, actually results in mildly enhanced star formation, counter to prevailing wisdom, due to the wind becoming cooler. Of the simple parametrisations that we test, we find that an energy loading that scales inversely with halo mass best matches a wide range of observations and can do so with mass loadings drastically lower than those in most previous cosmological simulations. In this scenario, much less material is ejected from the interstellar medium. Instead, winds both heat gas in the circumgalactic medium, slowing infall onto the galaxy, and also drive shocks beyond the virial radius, decreasing the halo-scale accretion rate. We can also report that a much lower fraction of the available supernova energy is needed in preventative galaxy regulation than required by ejective wind feedback models such as IllustrisTNG. This is a Learning the Universe collaboration publication.</description>

      <title>Fundamental limits to orbit reconstruction due to non-conservation of stellar actions in a Milky Way-like simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conservation of stellar actions is a fundamental assumption in orbit reconstruction studies in the Milky Way. However, the disc is highly dynamic, with time-dependent, non-axisymmetric features like transient spiral arms and giant molecular clouds (GMCs) driving local fluctuations in the gravitational potential on top of the near-axisymmetric background. Using high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations that incorporate gas dynamics and star formation, we quantify the rate at which these effects drive non-conservation of the actions of young stars from Myr to Gyr timescales. We find that action evolution is well described as a logarithmic random walk, with vertical action evolving more rapidly than radial action; the diffusion rate associated with this random walk is weakly dependent on the stellar birth environment and scales approximately linearly with the galactic orbital frequency at a star's position. The diffusion rates we measure imply a fundamental limit of $\sim 100$ Myr as the timescale over which stellar orbits can be reliably reconstructed using methods that assume action conservation. By comparing diffusion rates for younger stars to those measured for an older and more vertically-extended control population, we conclude that radial action evolution is driven primarily by transient spiral arms, while vertical action evolution is driven by gravitational scattering off gaseous structures. Our results have significant implications for galactic archaeology and disc dynamics studies, necessitating a closer look at the timescales over which actions are assumed to be conserved in the disc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the dynamical mass profiles of dispersion-supported galaxies is particularly challenging due to projection effects and the unknown shape of their velocity anisotropy profile. Our goal is to develop a machine learning algorithm capable of recovering dynamical mass profiles of dispersion-supported galaxies from line-of-sight stellar data. Traditionally, this task relies on time-consuming methods that require profile parameterization and assume dynamical equilibrium and spherical symmetry. We train a convolutional neural network model using various sets of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies. By extracting projected stellar data from the simulated galaxies and feeding it into the model, we obtain the posterior distribution of the dynamical mass profile at ten different radii. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of existing literature mass estimators on our dataset. Our model achieves more accurate results than any literature mass estimator while also providing enclosed mass estimates at radii where no previous estimators exist. We confirm that the posterior distributions produced by the model are well-calibrated, ensuring they provide meaningful uncertainties. However, issues remain, as the method loses performance when trained on one set of simulations and applied to another, highlighting the importance of improving the generalization of ML methods trained on specific galaxy simulations.</description>

      <title>Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1). Optical and near-infrared identification and classification of point-like X-ray selected sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To better understand the role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxy evolution, it is crucial to achieve a complete and pure AGN census. X-ray surveys are key to this, but identifying their counterparts (CTPs) at other wavelengths remains challenging due to their larger positional uncertainties and limited availability of deeper, uniform ancillary data. Euclid is revolutionising this effort, offering extensive coverage of nearly the entire extragalactic sky, particularly in the near-infrared bands, where AGN are more easily detected. With the first Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1), we identifyed, classifyed, and determined the redshifts of Euclid CTPs to known point-like sources from major X-ray surveys, including XMM-Newton, Chandra, and eROSITA. Using Bayesian statistics, combined with machine learning (ML), we identify the CTPs to 11 286 X-ray sources from the three X-ray telescopes. For the large majority of 10 194 sources, the associations are unique, with the remaining $\sim$ 10% of multi-CTP cases equally split between XMM-Newton and eROSITA. ML is then used to distinguish between Galactic (8%) and extragalactic (92%) sources. We computed photo-zs using deep learning for the 8617 sources detected in the 10th data release of the DESI Legacy Survey, reaching an accuracy and a fraction of outliers of about 5%. Based on their X-ray luminosities, over 99% of CTPs identified as extragalactic are classified as AGN, most of which appear unobscured given their hardness ratios. With this paper, we release our catalogue, which includes identifiers, basic X-ray properties, the details of the associations, and additional features such as Galactic/extragalactic classifications and photometric/spectroscopic redshifts. We also provide probabilities for sub-selecting the sample based on purity and completeness, allowing users to tailor the sample according to their specific needs.</description>

      <title>Core collapse in resonant self-interacting dark matter across two decades in halo mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02928v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Core collapse, a process associated with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models, can increase the central density of halos by orders of magnitude with observable consequences for dwarf galaxy properties and gravitational lensing. Resonances in the self-interaction cross section, features of hidden-sector models with light mediators and attractive potentials, can boost the strength of self-interactions near specific relative velocities, accelerating collapse in halos with central velocity dispersions near the resonance. To explore this phenomenon, we present a suite of idealized N-body simulations of isolated halos with masses $10^7$-$10^9 \ \rm{M_\odot}$ evolved under two resonant cross section (RCS) models with localized enhancement to the cross section on scales $v \sim 5$-$50 \ \rm{km} \ \rm{s^{-1}}$. We show that the change in halo internal structure depends on how the velocity distribution of bound particles moves across resonances in the cross section during core formation and collapse. The interplay between the velocity distribution of bound particles and localized features of the cross section causes deviations from self-similar evolution, a characteristic of velocity-independent cross sections, at the level of up to $20\%$. Depending on the alignment with resonant features, halos of different masses reach different evolutionary stages after a fixed physical time and develop diverse density profiles and rotation curves.</description>

      <title>Confirming HSC strong lens candidates with DESI Spectroscopy. I. Project overview and first results</title>

Abstract: Accurate redshift determinations of both lenses and sources are critical for confirming strong-lens systems and fully realizing their scientific value. However, the thousands of strong-lens candidates now routinely discovered in wide-field imaging surveys make one-by-one follow-up observations impractical. In this work, we investigate the capability and efficiency of large-scale spectroscopic surveys in confirming strong-lens systems. As a case study, we cross-match strong lens candidates identified from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program with Data Release 1 (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We find that DESI DR1 serendipitously observed putative lenses and/or lensed images in approximately 50\% of these candidates. Analyzing the DESI spectra for $\approx 500$ matched candidates that meet our selection criteria, we determine both lens and source redshifts for 27 systems. Additionally, 76 candidate systems feature lensing galaxies at $z &gt; 0.8$, and one candidate system contains a quasar within its lensing galaxy. Applying this approach to other strong-lens candidates will yield many more confirmations, with a further several-fold increase anticipated from the final DESI data release. Our results highlight the growing importance of large-scale spectroscopic surveys in advancing strong lensing discoveries and science.</description>

      <title>A big red dot at cosmic noon</title>

Abstract: We report the discovery of a little red dot (LRD), dubbed BiRD ('big red dot'), at $z=2.33$ in the field around the $z=6.3$ quasar SDSSJ1030+0524. Using NIRCam images, we identified it as a bright outlier in the $F200W-F356W$ color vs $F356W$ magnitude diagram of point sources in the field. The NIRCam/WFSS spectrum reveals the emission from HeI$\lambda 10830$ and PaG line, both showing a narrow and a broad ($FWHM\gtrsim 2000\ \rm kms^{-1}$) component. The HeI line is affected by an absorption feature, tracing dense gas with HeI column density in the $2^3S$ level $N\sim 0.5-1.2\times 10^{14}\rm cm^{-2}$, depending on the location of the absorber, which is outflowing at the speed of $\Delta v \sim -830\ \rm kms^{-1}$. As observed in the majority of LRDs, BiRD does not show X-ray or radio emission. The BH mass and the bolometric luminosity, both inferred from the PaG broad component, amount to $M_{\rm BH}\sim 10^8\rm M_{\odot}$ and $L_{\rm bol}\sim 2.9\times 10^{45}\rm ergs^{-1}$, respectively. Intriguingly, BiRD presents strict analogies with other two LRDs spectroscopically confirmed at cosmic noon, GN-28074 ("Rosetta Stone") at $z=2.26$ and RUBIES-BLAGN-1 at $z=3.1$. The blueshifted HeI absorption detected in all three sources suggests that gas outflows may be common in LRDs. We derive a first estimate of the space density of LRDs at $z&lt;3$ based on JWST data, as a function of $L_{\rm bol}$ and BH mass. The space density is only a factor of $\sim 2-3$ lower than that of UV-selected quasars with comparable $L_{\rm bol}$ and $z$, meaning that the contribution of LRDs to the broader AGN population is also relevant at cosmic noon. A similar trend is also observed in terms of BH masses. If, as suggested by recent theories, LRDs probe the very first and rapid growth of black hole seeds, our finding may suggest that the formation of black hole seeds remains efficient at least up to cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>Probing the variations of interstellar dust abundance and properties within and between galaxies with HWO UV spectroscopy in the Local Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cycle of metals between the gas and the dust phases in the neutral interstellar medium (ISM) is an integral part of the baryon cycle in galaxies. The resulting variations in the abundance and properties of interstellar dust have important implications for how accurately we can trace the chemical enrichment of the universe over cosmic time. Multi-object UV spectroscopy with HWO can provide the large samples of abundance and dust depletion measurements needed to understand how the abundance and properties of interstellar dust vary within and between galaxies, thereby observationally addressing important questions about chemical enrichment and galaxy evolution. Medium-resolution (R~50,000) spectroscopy in the full UV range (950-3150 A) toward massive stars in Local Volume galaxies (D &lt; 10 Mpc) will enable gas- and dust-phase abundance measurements of key elements, such as Fe, Si, Mg, S, Zn. These measurements will provide an estimate of how the dust abundance varies with environment, in particular metallicity and gas density. However, measuring the carbon and oxygen contents of dust requires very high resolution (R &gt; 100,000) and high signal-to-noise (S/N &gt; 100) owing to the non-saturated UV transitions for those elements being extremely weak. Since carbon and oxygen in the neutral ISM contribute the largest metal mass reservoir for dust, it is critical that the HWO design include a grating similar to the HST STIS H gratings providing very high resolution, as well as FUV and NUV detectors capable of reaching very high S/N.</description>

      <title>The gravitational potential of spiral perturbations I. The 2D (razor-thin) case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I developed an efficient numerical method for obtaining the gravitational potential of razor-thin spiral perturbations and used it to assess the standard tight-winding approximation, which is found to be reasonably accurate for pitch angles $\alpha\lesssim20^\circ$. I derived the analytic potential of razor-thin logarithmic spirals with an arbitrary power-law amplitude. Approximating a spiral locally by one of these models provides a second-order tight-winding approximation that predicts the phase offset between the spiral potential and density, the resulting radially increasing pitch of the potential, and the nonlocal outward angular-momentum transport by gravitational torques. Beyond the inner and outer edge of a spiral with $m$ arms, its potential is not winding ($\alpha=90^\circ$), decays like $R^m$ and $R^{-1-m}$, respectively, and cannot be predicted by a local approximation.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Sightlines: Comparison of Hydrocarbon Dust Absorption Bands toward Cygnus OB2-12 and the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrared spectra of hydrocarbon dust absorption bands toward the bright hypergiant Cygnus OB2-12 are compared to published spectra of the Quintuplet Cluster, a sightline to the Galactic center. The Cyg OB2-12 data include a new ground-based 2.86-3.70 microns spectrum and a previously published, but here further analyzed, spectrum of the 5.50-7.34 microns region. Higher spectral resolution data for the Cyg OB2-12 sightline in the 3 micron region allows a detailed comparison of the 3.4 micron aliphatic bands to those observed toward the Quintuplet. Despite differences in interstellar environments along each sightline, strong similarities are observed in the central wavelengths and relative strengths for bands at 3.3, 3.4, 5.85, 6.2, and 6.85 microns. Analysis of these bands, produced by aromatic, aliphatic, olefinic, hydrogenated, and oxygenated components, shows that carbonaceous dust is a significant component of the diffuse interstellar medium, second in abundance only to silicates, and is primarily aromatic in nature. The grains producing these bands likely consist of large aromatic carbon cores with thin aliphatic mantles composed of hydrogenated amorphous carbon (HAC). Laboratory analog spectra reproduce the observed aliphatic absorption bands well, supporting the presence of such mantles. We present evidence that the carriers of both the 3.4 micron aliphatic and the 3.3 micron aromatic bands reside exclusively in the diffuse ISM, and that the 3.3 micron bands observed in the diffuse ISM differ from those seen in dense clouds, implying chemically distinct carriers.</description>

      <title>Mass Segregation and Transient Formation in Nuclear Stellar Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies occasionally disrupt stars or consume stellar-mass black holes (BHs) that wander too close, producing observable electromagnetic or gravitational wave signals. We examine how mass segregation impacts the rates and distributions of such events. Assuming a relaxed stellar cluster, composed of stars and stellar-mass BHs, we show that the tidal disruption rate of massive stars ($m\gtrsim M_\odot$) is enhanced relative to their abundance in the stellar population. For stars up to $m\approx3M_\odot$, this enhancement is roughly $m/M_\odot$ and it is driven by segregation within the sphere of influence. Stars with masses $m\gtrsim3M_\odot$, if relaxed, are predominantly scattered by more massive stellar-mass BHs, leading to a constant enhancement factor of $\approx 9$, independent of mass. This aligns with observational evidence suggesting an over-representation of massive stars in tidal disruption events. For stellar-mass BHs, we predict an enhancement factor scaling as $m_\bullet^{1/2}$ for plunges and $m_\bullet^{3/2}$ for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). The power of one-half in both cases reflects the shorter relaxation times of heavier BHs, allowing them to segregate into the sphere of influence from greater distances, thereby increasing their abundance. The additional power in the EMRIs' rate arises from the tendency of heavier BHs to circularize and sink inward more efficiently. Finally, we estimate the rate of main-sequence star inspirals and find that it favors low-mass stars ($m\lesssim M_\odot$). This seems compatible with the observationally estimated rate of quasiperiodic eruptions.</description>

      <title>JWST Discovery of a High-Redshift Tidal Disruption Event Candidate in COSMOS-Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13248v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rates and properties of tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide valuable insights into their host galaxy central stellar densities and the demographics of their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). TDEs have been observed only at low redshifts ($z \lesssim 1$), due to the difficulty in conducting deep time-domain surveys. In this work, we present the discovery of a high-redshift TDE candidate, HZTDE-1, in the COSMOS-Web survey with JWST's NIRCam, using a novel selection technique based on color and morphology. We first outline a methodology for identifying high-z TDEs in deep infrared imaging surveys, leveraging their unique spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and morphologies of these transients. We apply this technique to COSMOS-Web in filters F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W, and identify HZTDE-1, a transient point source relative to archival UltraVISTA infrared observations. If we assume it is a TDE, we estimate its photometric redshift to be $z=5.02^{+1.32}_{-1.11}$. HZTDE-1 cannot be explained by reasonable supernova or AGN models. However, we cannot rule out a superluminous supernova at $z\gtrsim3$. If confirmed with follow-up observations, HZTDE-1 would represent the highest-redshift TDE discovery to date, and would suggest an enhancement of the TDE rate in the high-redshift universe. Our method, which can be applied to future deep surveys with JWST and Roman, offers a pathway to identify TDEs at $z&gt;4$ and probe black hole demographics at early cosmic times.</description>

      <title>The cusp-halo relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulations have established that each halo of collisionless dark matter is expected to contain a $\rho = A r^{-1.5}$ density cusp at its center. This prompt cusp is a relic of the halo's earliest moments and has a mass comparable to the cutoff scale in the spectrum of initial density perturbations. In this work, we provide a framework to predict for each halo the coefficient $A$ of its central cusp. We also present a "cusp-NFW" functional form that accurately describes the density profile of a halo with a prompt cusp at its center. Accurate characterization of each halo's central cusp is of particular importance in the study of warm dark matter models, for which the spectral cutoff is on an astrophysically relevant mass scale. To facilitate easy incorporation of prompt cusps into any halo modeling approach, we provide a code package that implements the cusp-halo relation and the cusp-NFW density profile.</description>

      <title>Mass models of galaxy clusters from a non-parametric weak-lensing reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the CLASH sample of galaxy clusters using a new deprojection method for weak gravitational lensing observations. This method is non-parametric, allowing us to infer mass profiles, or equivalently circular velocities, without having to assume a specific halo profile. While this method assumes spherical symmetry, we show that, on average, triaxiality is unlikely to significantly affect our results. We use this method to study the total mass profiles of the CLASH clusters, as well as the relation between their total and baryonic components: (1) We find that the implied circular velocities are consistent with being approximately flat at large radii, akin to the rotation curves of galaxies. (2) We infer radially resolved baryonic mass fractions, finding that these vary significantly from cluster to cluster and depend strongly on the details of the X-ray gas mass profiles. Since the gas mass profiles are poorly constrained at large radii, it is unclear whether the CLASH clusters reach the cosmic baryon fraction expected in $\Lambda$CDM. (3) The non-parametric masses are consistent with the stellar mass--halo mass relation expected in $\Lambda$CDM. (4) Galaxy clusters systematically deviate from the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation (BTFR) and the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) defined by galaxies, but the magnitude of the offset depends strongly on the gas mass extrapolation at large radii. Contrary to some previous results based on hydrostatic equilibrium, we find that galaxy clusters may fall on the same BTFR and RAR as galaxies if one adds a suitable positive baryonic mass component.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present calibrated ATLAS photometry of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) from 28 March through 29 Aug 2025, obtained with the five-site, robotic ATLAS network in the c (420-650~nm), o (560-820~nm), and Teide w (420-720~nm) bands. Stacked difference images yield reliable light curves measured in four fixed apertures that capture the evolving coma. We observe 3I/ATLAS transitioning in color from red (c-o)~0.7 before MJD 60860 to near-solar (c-o)~0.3 after MJD 60870, coincident with the appearance of a prominent anti-solar tail. The absolute magnitude curve H(t) shows a slope break near MJD 60890 at r~3.3 au from -0.035 to -0.014 mag/day, or in terms of coma cross section as a function of heliocentric distance, r^{-3.9} to r^{-1.2}. We interpret the evolution as a shift from dust lifted from a reddened surface to production of small, optically bright icy grains and changing coma optical depth. We release the aperture photometry with geometry and uncertainties to enable cross-instrument synthesis of 3I/ATLAS activity and color evolution.</description>
