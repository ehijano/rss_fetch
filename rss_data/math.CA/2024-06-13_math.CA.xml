      <title>Inverse scattering problem for third order differential operators on the whole axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse scattering problem for an operator, which is a sum of the operator of the third derivative and of an operator of multiplication by a real function, is solved. The main closed system of equations of inverse problem is obtained. This system contains scattering coefficients and bound state elements as independent parameters. Form of the simplest reflectionless potential (analogous to soliton) is found.</description>

      <title>Vector valued piecewise continuous almost automorphic functions and some consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, for $\mathbb{X}$ a Banach space, the notion of piecewise continuous $\mathbb{Z}$-almost automorphic functions with values in finite dimensional spaces is extended to piecewise continuous $\mathbb{Z}$-almost automorphic functions with values in $\mathbb{X}$. Several properties of this class of functions are provided, in particular it is shown that if $\mathbb{X}$ is a Banach algebra, then this class of functions constitute also a Banach algebra; furthermore, using the theory of $\mathbb{Z}$-almost automorphic functions, a new characterization of compact almost automorphic functions is given. As consequences, with the help of $\mathbb{Z}$-almost automorphic functions, it is presented a simple proof of the characterization of almost automorphic sequences by compact almost automorphic functions; the method permits us to give explicit examples of compact almost automorphic functions which are not almost periodic. Also, using the theory developed here, it is shown that almost automorphic solutions of differential equations with piecewise constant argument are in fact compact almost automorphic. Finally, it is proved that the classical solution of the $1D$ heat equation with continuous $\mathbb{Z}$-almost automorphic source is also continuous $\mathbb{Z}$-almost automorphic; furthermore, we comment applications to the existence and uniqueness of the asymptotically continuous $\mathbb{Z}$-almost automorphic mild solution to abstract integro-differential equations with nonlocal initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Comparison criteria for first order polynomial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we use the comparison method for investigation of first order polynomial differential equations. We prove two comparison criteria for these equations. The proved criteria we use to obtain some global solvability criteria for first order polynomial differential equations. On the basis of these criteria we prove some criteria for existence of a closed solution (of closed solutions) of for first order polynomial differential equations. The results obtained we compare with some known results.</description>

      <title>${l}^2$ Decoupling for certain degenerate surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we aim to study decoupling inequality for a specific degenerate hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^4$. Inspired by the work of Bourgain--Demeter and Li--Zheng, we consider the hypersurface $\mathcal{S}^3_{4}:=\{(\xi_1,\xi_2,\xi_3,\xi^4_1+\xi^4_2+\xi^4_3):0\leq \xi_j\leq1, \text{for}~j=1,2,3\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^4$ and study decoupling estimates.</description>

      <title>The pseudospectrum of an operator with Bessel-type singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the asymptotic structure of the pseudospectrum of the singular Sturm-Liouville operator $L=\partial_x(f\partial_x)+\partial_x$ subject to periodic boundary conditions on a symmetric interval, where the coefficient $f$ is a regular odd function that has only a simple zero at the origin. The operator $L$ is closely related to a remarkable model examined by Davies in 2007, which exhibits surprising spectral properties balancing symmetries and strong non-self-adjointness. In our main result, we derive a concrete construction of classical pseudo-modes for $L$ and give explicit exponential bounds of growth for the resolvent norm in rays away from the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Inclusion and estimates for the jumps of minimizers in variational denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stability and inclusion of the jump set of minimizers of convex denoising functionals, such as the celebrated "Rudin-Osher-Fatemi" functional, for scalar or vectorial signals. We show that under mild regularity assumptions on the data fidelity term and the regularizer, the jump set of the minimizer is essentially a subset of the original jump set. Moreover, we give an estimate on the magnitude of jumps in terms of the data. This extends old results, in particular of the first author (with V. Caselles and M. Novaga) and of T. Valkonen, to much more general cases. We also consider the case where the original datum has unbounded variation, and define a notion of its jump set which, again, must contain the jump set of the solution.</description>
