      <title>Unconditional energy dissipation of Strang splitting for the matrix-valued Allen-Cahn equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy dissipation property of the Strang splitting method was first demonstrated for the matrix-valued Allen-Cahn (MAC) equation under restrictive time-step constraints [J. Comput. Phys. 454, 110985, 2022]. In this work, we eliminate this limitation through a refined stability analysis framework, rigorously proving that the Strang splitting method preserves the energy dissipation law unconditionally for arbitrary time steps. The refined proof hinges on a precise estimation of the double-well potential term in the modified energy functional. Leveraging this unconditional energy dissipation property, we rigorously establish that the Strang splitting method achieves global-in-time $H^1$-stability, preserves determinant boundedness, and maintains second-order temporal convergence for the matrix-valued Allen-Cahn equation. To validate these theoretical findings, we conduct numerical experiments confirming the method's energy stability and determinant bound preservation for the MAC equation.</description>

      <title>The Ubiquitous Sparse Matrix-Matrix Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiplication of a sparse matrix with another (dense or sparse) matrix is a fundamental operation that captures the computational patterns of many data science applications, including but not limited to graph algorithms, sparsely connected neural networks, graph neural networks, clustering, and many-to-many comparisons of biological sequencing data.
  In many application scenarios, the matrix multiplication takes places on an arbitrary algebraic semiring where the scalar operations are overloaded with user-defined functions with certain properties or a more general heterogenous algebra where even the domains of the input matrices can be different. Here, we provide a unifying treatment of the sparse matrix-matrix operation and its rich application space including machine learning, computational biology and chemistry, graph algorithms, and scientific computing.</description>

      <title>POD-based reduced order modeling of global-in-time iterative decoupled algorithms for Biot's consolidation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the efficient numerical algorithms of a three-field Biot's consolidation model. The approach begins with the introduction of innovative monolithic and global-in-time iterative decoupled algorithms, which incorporate the backward differentiation formulas for time discretization. In each iteration, these algorithms involve solving a diffusion subproblem over the entire temporal domain, followed by solving a generalized Stokes subproblem over the same time interval. To accelerate the global-in-time iterative process, we present a reduced order modeling approach based on proper orthogonal decomposition, aimed at reducing the primary computational cost from the generalized Stokes subproblem. The effectiveness of this novel method is validated both theoretically and through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Convergence of hyperbolic approximations to higher-order PDEs for smooth solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the convergence of hyperbolic approximations for several classes of higher-order PDEs, including the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony, Korteweg-de Vries, Gardner, Kawahara, and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations, provided a smooth solution of the limiting problem exists. We only require weak (entropy) solutions of the hyperbolic approximations. Thereby, we provide a solid foundation for these approximations, which have been used in the literature without rigorous convergence analysis. We also present numerical results that support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Optimal Design of Broadband Absorbers with Multiple Plasmonic Nanoparticles via Reduced Basis Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a computational framework for the optimal design of broadband absorbing materials composed of plasmonic nanoparticle arrays. This design problem poses several key challenges: (1) the complex multi-particle interactions and high-curvature geometries; (2) the requirement to achieve broadband frequency responses, including resonant regimes; (3) the complexity of shape derivative calculations; and (4) the non-convexity of the optimization landscape. To systematically address these challenges, we employ three sequential strategies. First, we introduce a parameterized integral equation formulation that circumvents traditional shape derivative computations. Second, we develop a shape-adaptive reduced basis method (RBM) that utilizes the eigenfunctions of the Neumann-Poincar\'{e} operator for forward problems and their adjoint counterparts for adjoint problems, thereby addressing singularities and accelerating computations. Third, we propose a physics-informed initialization strategy that estimates nanoparticle configurations under weak coupling assumptions, thereby improving the performance of gradient-based optimization algorithms. The method's computational advantages are demonstrated through numerical experiments, which show accurate and efficient designs across various geometric configurations. Furthermore, the framework is flexible and extensible to other material systems and boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Monolithic Multi-level Overlapping Schwarz Solvers for Fluid Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additive overlapping Schwarz Methods are iterative methods of the domain decomposition type for the solution of partial differential equations. Numerical and parallel scalability of these methods can be achieved by adding coarse levels. A successful coarse space, inspired by iterative substructuring, is the generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund (GDSW) space. In https://doi.org/10.1137/18M1184047, based on the GDSW approach, two-level monolithic overlapping Schwarz preconditioners for saddle point problems were introduced. We present parallel results up to 32768 MPI ranks for the solution of incompressible fluid problems for a Poiseuille flow example on the unit cube and a complex extrusion die geometry using a two- and a three-level monolithic overlapping Schwarz preconditioner. These results are achieved through the combination of the additive overlapping Schwarz solvers implemented in the Fast and Robust Overlapping Schwarz (FROSch) library https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-56750-7_19, which is part of the Trilinos package ShyLU https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2012.64, and the FEATFLOW library http://www.featflow.de using a scalable interface for the efficient coupling of the two libraries. This work is part of the project StroemungsRaum - Novel Exascale-Architectures with Heterogeneous Hardware Components for Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulations, funded by the German Bundesministerium fur Forschung, Technologie und Raumfahrt BMFTR (formerly BMBF) as part of the program on New Methods and Technologies for Exascale Computing (SCALEXA).</description>

      <title>Derivation and Numerical Simulation of a Thermodynamically Consistent Magneto Two-Phase Flow Model for Magnetic Drug Targeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a novel and comprehensive thermodynamically consistent model for the complex interactions between superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs), a carrier fluid, and a magnetic field, as they occur in Magnetic Drug Targeting (MDT), the targeted delivery of magnetically functionalized drug carriers by external magnetic fields. It consists of a convection-diffusion equation for SPIONs, a modified Navier-Stokes system for the averaged velocity of the carrier fluid-nanoparticle mixture and a quasi-stationary Maxwell system for the magnetic variables. The derived model extends previous models for MDT by taking into account the response of the carrier fluid and of the magnetic field to the dynamics of the SPIONs, and thus provides a comprehensive tool for the prediction and optimization of MDT processes. After introducing a semi-implicit finite element scheme for the numerical simulation of the model, simulation results for the fully coupled model are performed and compared with results from a reduced version of the model, where the response of the carrier flow and of the magnetic field to the SPION dynamics is neglected. Furthermore, the sensitivity of MDT with respect to experimental parameters, such as magnet positioning, is investigated.</description>

      <title>Explicit Construction of Approximate Kolmogorov-Arnold Superpositions with C2-Smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explicitly construct an approximate version of the Kolmogorov-Arnold superpositions, which is composed of C2 inner and outer functions, and can approximate an arbitrary alpha-Holder continuous function well. The inner functions are generated by applying suitable translations and dilations to a piecewise C2, strictly increasing function, while the outer functions are constructed row-wise through piecewise C2 interpolation using newly designed shape functions. This novel variant of Kolmogorov-Arnold superpositions overcomes the wild and pathological behaviors of the inherent single variable functions, but retains the essence of Kolmogorov strategy of exact representation, an objective that Sprecher, Neural Networks 144, 2021, has actively pursued.</description>

      <title>A high-order deterministic dynamical low-rank method for proton transport in heterogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dose calculations in proton therapy require the fast and accurate solution of a high-dimensional transport equation for a large number of (pencil) beams with different energies and directions. Deterministically solving this transport problem at a sufficient resolution can however be prohibitively expensive, especially due to highly forward peaked scattering of the protons. We propose using a model order reduction approach, the dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA), which evolves the solution on the manifold of low-rank matrices in (pseudo-)time. For this, we compare a collided-uncollided split of the linear Boltzmann equation and its Fokker-Planck approximation. We treat the uncollided part using a ray-tracer and combine high-order phase space discretizations and a mixture model for materials with DLRA for the collided equation. Our method reproduces the results of a full-rank reference code at significantly lower rank, and thus computational cost and memory, and further makes computations feasible at much higher resolutions. At higher resolutions, we also achieve good accuracy with respect to TOPAS MC in homogeneous as well as heterogeneous materials. Finally, we demonstrate that several beam sources with different angles can be computed with little cost increase compared to individual beams.</description>

      <title>Discretizing linearized Einstein-Bianchi system by symmetric and traceless tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Einstein-Bianchi system uses symmetric and traceless tensors to reformulate Einstein's original field equations. However, preserving these algebraic constraints simultaneously remains a challenge for numerical methods. This paper proposes a new formulation that treats the linearized Einstein-Bianchi system (near the trivial Minkowski metric) as the Hodge wave equation associated with the conformal Hessian complex. To discretize this equation, a conforming finite element conformal Hessian complex that preserves symmetry and traceless-ness simultaneously is constructed on general three-dimensional tetrahedral grids, and its exactness is proven.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce discrete analogues of the exponential, sine, and cosine functions. Then using a discrete trigonometric version of a non-polynomial divided difference, we define discrete analogues of the trigonometric B-splines. We derive a two-term recurrence relation, a two-term formula for the discrete derivative, and two variants of the Marsden identity for these discrete trigonometric B-splines. Since the classical exponential, sine, and cosine functions are limiting cases of their discrete analogues, we conclude that many of the standard results for classical polynomial B-splines extend naturally both to trigonometric B-splines and to discrete trigonometric B-splines.</description>

      <title>LRTuckerRep: Low-rank Tucker Representation Model for Multi-dimensional Data Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-dimensional data completion is a critical problem in computational sciences, particularly in domains such as computer vision, signal processing, and scientific computing. Existing methods typically leverage either global low-rank approximations or local smoothness regularization, but each suffers from notable limitations: low-rank methods are computationally expensive and may disrupt intrinsic data structures, while smoothness-based approaches often require extensive manual parameter tuning and exhibit poor generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel Low-Rank Tucker Representation (LRTuckerRep) model that unifies global and local prior modeling within a Tucker decomposition. Specifically, LRTuckerRep encodes low rankness through a self-adaptive weighted nuclear norm on the factor matrices and a sparse Tucker core, while capturing smoothness via a parameter-free Laplacian-based regularization on the factor spaces. To efficiently solve the resulting nonconvex optimization problem, we develop two iterative algorithms with provable convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional image inpainting and traffic data imputation demonstrate that LRTuckerRep achieves superior completion accuracy and robustness under high missing rates compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>Next Generation Equation-Free Multiscale Modelling of Crowd Dynamics via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bridging the microscopic and the macroscopic modelling scales in crowd dynamics constitutes an important, open challenge for systematic numerical analysis, optimization, and control. We propose a combined manifold and machine learning approach to learn the discrete evolution operator for the emergent crowd dynamics in latent spaces from high-fidelity agent-based simulations. The proposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation Equation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and multiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the mass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first step, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete microscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based on manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space into the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the corresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning reduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning techniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the crowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density profiles. We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density distribution via SVD conserves the mass. With this "embed-&gt;learn in latent space-&gt;lift back to the ambient space" pipeline, we create an effective solution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution. For our illustrations, we use the Social Force Model to generate data in a corridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions. The numerical results demonstrate high accuracy, robustness, and generalizability, thus allowing for fast and accurate modelling/simulation of crowd dynamics from agent-based simulations.</description>

      <title>Micro-macro and macro-macro limits for controlled leader-follower systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a leader-follower system of interacting particles subject to feedback control and derive its mean-field limits through a two-step passage: first to a micro-macro system coupling leader particles with a follower fluid, and then to a fully continuum macro-macro system. For each limiting procedure, we establish quantitative stability and convergence estimates based on modulated energy methods and Wasserstein distances. These results provide a rigorous foundation for the hierarchical reduction of controlled multi-agent systems. Numerical simulations are presented, including examples with interaction potentials beyond the analytical class considered, to demonstrate the dynamics and support the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem in Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) of identifying and classifying objects located on the ground by means of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, we adopt a single scattering approximation to classify the shape of the object using both simulated SAR data and reconstructed images from this data, and we compare the success of these approaches. We then identify ice types in real SAR imagery from the satellite Sentinel-1. In both experiments we achieve a promising high classification accuracy ($\geq$75\%). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of CNNs in using SAR data for both geometric and environmental classification tasks. Our investigation also explores the effect of SAR data acquisition at different antenna heights on our ability to classify objects successfully.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Free Two-to-Infinity and One-to-Two Norms Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose new randomized algorithms for estimating the two-to-infinity and one-to-two norms in a matrix-free setting, using only matrix-vector multiplications. Our methods are based on appropriate modifications of Hutchinson's diagonal estimator and its Hutch++ version. We provide oracle complexity bounds for both modifications. We further illustrate the practical utility of our algorithms for Jacobian-based regularization in deep neural network training on image classification tasks. We also demonstrate that our methodology can be applied to mitigate the effect of adversarial attacks in the domain of recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral Galerkin method for the zero dispersion limit of the fractional Korteweg-de Vries equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a fully discrete Crank-Nicolson Fourier-spectral-Galerkin (FSG) scheme for approximating solutions of the fractional Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, which involves a fractional Laplacian with exponent $\alpha \in [1,2]$ and a small dispersion coefficient of order $\varepsilon^2$. The solution in the limit as $\varepsilon \to 0$ is known as the zero dispersion limit. We demonstrate that the semi-discrete FSG scheme conserves the first three integral invariants, thereby structure preserving, and that the fully discrete FSG scheme is $L^2$-conservative, ensuring stability. Using a compactness argument, we constructively prove the convergence of the approximate solution to the unique solution of the fractional KdV equation in $C([0,T]; H_p^{1+\alpha}(\mathbb{R}))$ for the periodic initial data in $H_p^{1+\alpha}(\mathbb{R})$. The devised scheme achieves spectral accuracy for the initial data in $H_p^r,$ $r \geq 1+\alpha$ and exponential accuracy for the analytic initial data. Additionally, we establish that the approximation of the zero dispersion limit obtained from the fully discrete FSG scheme converges to the solution of the Hopf equation in $L^2$ as $\varepsilon \to 0$, up to the gradient catastrophe time $t_c$. Beyond $t_c$, numerical investigations reveal that the approximation converges to the asymptotic solution, which is weakly described by the Whitham's averaged equation within the oscillatory zone for $\alpha = 2$. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the convergence of the scheme and to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Optimal error bounds on an exponential wave integrator Fourier spectral method for the logarithmic Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a nearly optimal error bound on the exponential wave integrator Fourier spectral (EWI-FS) method for the logarithmic Schr\"odinger equation (LogSE) under the assumption of $H^2$-solution, which is theoretically guaranteed. Subject to a CFL-type time step size restriction $\tau |\ln \tau| \leq h^2/|\ln h|$ for obtaining the stability of the numerical scheme affected by the singularity of the logarithmic nonlinearity, an $L^2$-norm error bound of order $O(\tau |\ln \tau|^2 + h^2 |\ln h|)$ is established, where $\tau$ is the time step size and $h$ is the mesh size. Compared to the error estimates of the LogSE in the literature, our error bound either greatly improves the convergence rate under the same regularity assumptions or significantly weakens the regularity requirement to obtain the same convergence rate. Moreover, our result can be directly applied to the LogSE with low regularity $L^\infty$-potential, which is not allowed in the existing error estimates. Two main ingredients are adopted in the proof: (i) an $H^2$-conditional $L^2$-stability estimate, which is established using the energy method to avoid singularity of the logarithmic nonlinearity, and (ii) mathematical induction with inverse inequalities to control the $H^2$-norm of the numerical solution. Numerical results are reported to confirm our error estimates and demonstrate the necessity of the time step size restriction imposed. We also apply the EWI-FS method to investigate soliton collisions in one dimension and vortex dipole dynamics in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Empirical Hyper Element Integration Method (EHEIM) with Unified Integration Criteria for Efficient Hyper Reduced FE$^2$ Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical homogenization for mechanical multiscale modeling by means of the finite element method (FEM) is an elegant way of obtaining structure-property relations, if the behavior of the constituents of the lower scale is well understood. However, the computational costs of this so-called FE$^2$ method are so high that reduction methods are essential. While the construction of a reduced basis for the microscopic nodal displacements using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) has become a standard technique, the reduction of the computational effort for the projected nodal forces, the so-called hyper reduction, is an additional challenge, for which different strategies have been proposed in the literature. The empirical cubature method (ECM), which has been proven to be very robust, implemented the conservation of the total volume is used as a constraint in the resulting optimization problem, while energy-based criteria have been proposed in other contributions.
  The present contribution presents a unified integration criteria concept, involving the aforementioned criteria, among others. These criteria are used both with a Gauss point-based as well as with an element-based hyper reduction scheme, the latter retaining full compatibility with the common modular finite element framework. The methods are combined with a previously proposed clustered training strategy and a monolithic solver. Numerical examples empirically demonstrate that the additional criteria improve the accuracy for a given number of modes. Vice verse, less modes and thus lower computational costs are required to reach a given level of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Convergence of finite elements for the Eyles-King-Styles model of tumour growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a convergence analysis of the evolving surface finite element method (ESFEM) applied to the original Eyles-King-Styles model of tumour growth. The model consists of a Poisson equation in the bulk, a forced mean curvature flow on the surface, and a coupled velocity law between bulk and surface. Due to the non-trivial bulk-surface coupling, all previous analyses required an additional regularization term. By introducing a $H^{1/2}(\Gamma)$ energy estimates theory, we develop an essentially new theoretical framework that addresses the intrinsic bulk-surface coupling. Based on this framework, we provide the first rigorous convergence proof for the original model without regularization.</description>

      <title>A Fast Direct Solver for Boundary Integral Equations Using Quadrature By Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13809v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct and analyze a hierarchical direct solver for linear systems arising from the discretization of boundary integral equations using the Quadrature by Expansion (QBX) method. Our scheme builds on the existing theory of Hierarchical Semi-Separable (HSS) matrix operators that contain low-rank off-diagonal submatrices. We use proxy-based approximations of the far-field interactions and the Interpolative Decomposition (ID) to construct compressed HSS operators that are used as fast direct solvers for the original system. We describe a number of modifications to the standard HSS framework that enable compatibility with the QBX family of discretization methods. We establish an error model for the direct solver that is based on a multipole expansion of the QBX-mediated proxy interactions and standard estimates for the ID. Based on these theoretical results, we develop an automatic approach for setting scheme parameters based on user-provided error tolerances. The resulting solver seamlessly generalizes across two- and tree-dimensional problems and achieves state-of-the-art asymptotic scaling. We conclude with numerical experiments that support the theoretical expectations for the error and computational cost of the direct solver.</description>

      <title>A parameterized Wasserstein Hamiltonian flow approach for solving the Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method to compute the solution of time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE). Using push-forward maps and Wasserstein Hamiltonian flow, we reformulate the TDSE as a Hamiltonian system in terms of push-forward maps. The new formulation can be viewed as a generative model in the Wasserstein space, which is a manifold of probability density functions. Then we parameterize the push-forward maps by reduce-order models such as neural networks. This induces a new metric in the parameter space by pulling back the Wasserstein metric on density manifold, which further results in a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the parameters of the reduce-order model. Leveraging the computational techniques from deep learning, such as Neural ODE, we design an algorithm to solve the TDSE in the parameterized push-forward map space, which provides an alternative approach with the potential to scale up to high-dimensional problems. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of this algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand (BGG) framework to the construction of finite element conformal Hessian complexes and conformal elasticity complexes in three dimensions involving conformal tensors (i.e., symmetric and traceless tensors). These complexes incorporate higher-order differential operators, including the linearized Cotton-York operator, and require conformal tensor spaces with nontrivial smoothness and trace conditions. A novel application of the discrete BGG framework, combined with the geometric decomposition of bubble spaces and a reduction operation, to local bubble finite element complexes is introduced. This yields simpler and more tractable constructions than global BGG-based approaches, and leads to the bubble conformal complexes. Building on these bubble conformal complexes and the associated face bubble complexes, finite element conformal Hessian complexes and conformal elasticity complexes with varying degrees of smoothness are systematically developed. The resulting complexes support stable and structure-preserving numerical methods for applications in relativity, Cosserat elasticity, and fluid mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate theoretically and numerically transport noise-induced diffusion in flows on the sphere. Previous analysis on the torus demonstrated that suitably chosen transport noise in the Euler equations leads to diffusive behavior resembling the Navier--Stokes equations. Here, we analyze dynamics on the sphere with noise-induced differential elliptic operator dissipation and characterize their energy and enstrophy decay properties. Through structure-preserving numerical simulations with the Zeitlin discretization, we demonstrate that appropriately scaled transport noise induces energy dissipation while preserving enstrophy and coadjoint orbits. The presented analysis lays a groundwork for further theoretical investigation of transport noise and supports the calibration of transport noise models as a parametrization for unresolved processes in geophysical fluid simulations.</description>

Abstract: We consider the nonconvex optimization problem associated with the decomposition of a real symmetric tensor into a sum of rank-one terms. Use is made of the rich symmetry structure to construct infinite families of critical points represented by Puiseux series in the problem dimension, and so obtain precise analytic estimates on the objective function value and the Hessian spectrum. The results enable an analytic characterization of various obstructions to local optimization methods, revealing, in particular, a complex array of saddles and minima that differ in their symmetry, structure, and analytic properties. A notable phenomenon, observed for all critical points considered, concerns the index of the Hessian increasing with the objective function value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We focus on a family of nonlinear continuity equations for the evolution of a non-negative density $\rho$ with a continuous and compactly supported nonlinear mobility $\mathrm{m}(\rho)$ not necessarily concave. The velocity field is the negative gradient of the variation of a free energy including internal and confinement energy terms. Problems with compactly supported mobility are often called saturation problems since the values of the density are constrained below a maximal value. Taking advantage of a family of approximating problems, we show the existence of $C_0$-semigroups of $L^1$ contractions. We study the $\omega$-limit of the problem, its most relevant properties, and the appearance of free boundaries in the long-time behaviour. This problem has a formal gradient-flow structure, and we discuss the local/global minimisers of the corresponding free energy in the natural topology related to the set of initial data for the $L^\infty$-constrained gradient flow of probability densities. Furthermore, we analyse a structure preserving implicit finite-volume scheme and discuss its convergence and long-time behaviour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems arise in many applications, especially tomographic imaging. We develop a Learned Alternating Minimization Algorithm (LAMA) to solve such problems via two-block optimization by synergizing data-driven and classical techniques with proven convergence. LAMA is naturally induced by a variational model with learnable regularizers in both data and image domains, parameterized as composite functions of neural networks trained with domain-specific data. We allow these regularizers to be nonconvex and nonsmooth to extract features from data effectively. We minimize the overall objective function using Nesterov's smoothing technique and residual learning architecture. It is demonstrated that LAMA reduces network complexity, improves memory efficiency, and enhances reconstruction accuracy, stability, and interpretability. Extensive experiments show that LAMA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular benchmark datasets for Computed Tomography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Immersed boundary finite element methods allow the user to bypass the potentially troublesome task of boundary-conforming mesh generation. When combined with explicit time integration, poorly cut elements with little support in the physical domain lead to a severely reduced critical time step size, posing a major challenge for immersed wave propagation simulations. The finite cell method stabilizes cut elements by defining the weak form of the problem also in the fictitious domain, but scaled by a small value $\alpha$. This paper investigates the effect of the finite cell method on the critical time step size for explicit time integration. Starting with an analytical one-degree-of-freedom model, we systematically study the influence of $\alpha$-stabilization on the maximum eigenvalue, and thus on the critical time step size, for corner and sliver cuts. The analysis is complemented by a numerical study of an example with one element and increasing polynomial degree, confirming that the critical time step size does not decrease below a certain limit, even as the cut fraction tends to zero. This lower bound is controlled by the choice of $\alpha$. In higher dimensions, sliver cuts are found to be more detrimental than corner cuts, thus determining the minimum critical time step size. Increasing the polynomial degree has only little effect on this degradation. Based on these observations, we derive an estimate of the minimum critical time step size as a function of $\alpha$, which we use to propose a modified CFL condition for the finite cell method. The validity of this condition is demonstrated on a two-dimensional perforated plate example.</description>

      <title>Approximation Rates in Besov Norms and Sample-Complexity of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with Residual Connections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15110v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold superposition theorem, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as an improved backbone for most deep learning frameworks, promising more adaptivity than their multilayer perceptron (MLP) predecessor by allowing for trainable spline-based activation functions. In this paper, we probe the theoretical foundations of the KAN architecture by showing that it can optimally approximate any Besov function in $B^{s}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$ on a bounded open, or even fractal, domain $\mathcal{X}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ at the optimal approximation rate with respect to any weaker Besov norm $B^{\alpha}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$; where $\alpha &lt; s$. We complement our approximation result with a statistical guarantee by bounding the pseudodimension of the relevant class of Res-KANs. As an application of the latter, we directly deduce a dimension-free estimate on the sample complexity of a residual KAN model when learning a function of Besov regularity from $N$ i.i.d. noiseless samples, showing that KANs can learn the smooth maps which they can approximate.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) approach to a reaction-diffusion SEIQR epidemiological model, which captures the spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious disease transmission. Formulated as a system of semilinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), the model extends classical compartmental models by incorporating spatial diffusion to account for population movement and spatial heterogeneity. The proposed NSFD discretization is designed to preserve the continuous model's essential qualitative features, such as positivity, boundedness, and stability, which are often compromised by standard finite difference methods. We rigorously analyze the model's well-posedness, construct a structure-preserving NSFD scheme for the PDE system, and study its convergence and local truncation error. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the scheme's effectiveness in preserving biologically consistent dynamics.</description>
