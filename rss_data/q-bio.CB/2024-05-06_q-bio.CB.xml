      <title>Proliferation-driven mechanical feedback regulates cell dynamics in growing tissues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local stresses in a tissue, a collective property, regulate cell division and apoptosis. In turn, cell growth and division induce active stresses in the tissue. As a consequence, there is a feedback between cell growth and local stresses. However, how the cell dynamics depend on local stress-dependent cell division and the feedback strength is not fully understood. Here, we probe the consequences of stress-mediated growth and cell division on cell dynamics using agent-based simulations of a two-dimensional growing tissue. We discover a rich dynamical behavior of individual cells, ranging from jamming (mean square displacement, $\Delta (t) \sim t^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha$ less than unity), to hyperdiffusion ($\alpha &gt; 2$) depending on cell division rate and the strength of the mechanical feedback. Strikingly, $\Delta (t)$ is determined by the tissue growth law, which quantifies cell proliferation (number of cells $N(t)$ as a function of time). The growth law ($N(t) \sim t^{\lambda}$ at long times) is regulated by the critical pressure that controls the strength of the mechanical feedback and the ratio between cell division-apoptosis rates. We show that $\lambda \sim \alpha$, which implies that higher growth rate leads to a greater degree of cell migration. The variations in cell motility are linked to the emergence of highly persistent forces extending over several cell cycle times. Our predictions are testable using cell-tracking imaging techniques.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality reduction of neuronal degeneracy reveals two interfering physiological mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuronal systems maintain stable functions despite large variability in their physiological components. Ion channel expression, in particular, is highly variable in neurons exhibiting similar electrophysiological phenotypes, which poses questions regarding how specific ion channel subsets reliably shape neuron intrinsic properties. Here, we use detailed conductance-based modeling to explore the origin of stable neuronal function from variable channel composition. Using dimensionality reduction, we uncover two principal dimensions in the channel conductance space that capture most of the variance of the observed variability. Those two dimensions correspond to two physiologically relevant sources of variability that can be explained by feedback mechanisms underlying regulation of neuronal activity, providing quantitative insights into how channel composition links to neuronal electrophysiological activity. These insights allowed us to understand and design a model-independent, reliable neuromodulation rule for variable neuronal populations.</description>
