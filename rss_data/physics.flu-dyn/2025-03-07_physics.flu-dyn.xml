      <title>Emergent turbulence and coarsening arrest in active-spinner fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover activity-driven crossover from phase separation to a new turbulent state in a two-dimensional system of counter-rotating spinners. We study the statistical properties of this active-rotor turbulence using the active-rotor Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes model, and show that the vorticity $\omega \propto \phi$, the scalar field that distinguishes regions with different rotating states. We explain this intriguing proportionality theoretically, and we characterize power-law energy and concentration spectra, intermittency, and flow-topology statistics. We suggest biological implications of such turbulence.</description>

      <title>Direct numerical simulation benchmarks for the prediction of boundary layer bypass transition in the narrow sense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive set of direct numerical simulation benchmarks of bypass transition in the narrow sense with inlet freestream turbulent intensity levels of 0.75%, 1.5%, 2.25%, 3.0%, and 6.0%, respectively. Detailed descriptions of length scales and the rate of viscous dissipation are provided. We ask two key physical questions. First, how do the decay rates and length scales of freestream turbulence over a transitional and turbulent boundary layer compare to those in spatially developing isotropic turbulence without the wall? Second, what bypass mechanisms drive turbulent spot inception at the intermediate rage of freestream turbulence intensity level? We find that the boundary-layer freestream turbulence decay and length scales evolve similarly to their spatially developing isotropic turbulence flow without the wall counterparts. We also present evidence of the coexistence of two turbulent spot inception mechanisms at the inlet FST level of 2.25%: the long low-speed streak primary and secondary instabilities (only in lower inlet FST levels) and the self-amplifying process of oblique vortex filaments interacting with a Delta-shaped low-speed patch underneath (prevailing only in higher inlet FST levels).</description>

      <title>Decaying turbulence beneath surface waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores decaying turbulence beneath surface waves that is initially isotropic and shear-free. We start by presenting phenomenology revealed by wave-averaged numerical simulations: an accumulation of angular momentum in coherent vortices, suppression of kinetic energy dissipation, and the development of depth-alternating jets. We interpret these features through an analogy with rotating turbulence (Holm 1996), wherein the curl of the Stokes drift, $\nabla \times \mathbf{u}^S$, takes on the role of the background vorticity (for example, $(f_0 + \beta y) \mathbf{\hat z}$ on the $\beta$-plane). We pursue this thread further by showing that a two-equation model proposed by (Bardina et al. 1985) for rotating turbulence reproduces the simulated evolution of volume-integrated kinetic energy. This success of the two-equation model -- which explicitly parameterizes wave-driven suppression of kinetic energy dissipation -- carries implications for modeling turbulent mixing in the ocean surface boundary layer. We conclude with a discussion about a wave-averaged analogue of the Rossby number appearing in the two-equation model, which we term the ``pseudovorticity number'' after the pseudovorticity $\nabla \times \mathbf{u}^S$. The pseudovorticity number is related to the Langmuir number in an integral sense.</description>

      <title>Neural network-augmented eddy viscosity closures for turbulent premixed jet flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending gradient-type turbulence closures to turbulent premixed flames is challenging due to the significant influence of combustion heat release. We incorporate a deep neural network (DNN) into Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) models for the turbulent viscosity and thermal conductivity as nonlinear functions of the local flow state and thermochemical gradients. Our models are optimized over the RANS partial differential equations (PDEs) using an adjoint-based data assimilation procedure. Because we directly target the RANS solution, as opposed to the unclosed terms, successfully trained models are guaranteed to improve the in-sample accuracy of the DNN-augmented RANS predictions. We demonstrate the learned closures for in- and out-of-sample $\textit{a posteriori}$ RANS predictions of compressible, premixed, turbulent jet flames with turbulent Damk\"ohler numbers spanning the gradient- and counter-gradient transport regimes. The DNN-augmented RANS predictions have one to two orders of magnitude lower spatiotemporal mean-squared error than those using a baseline $k$--$\epsilon$ model, even for Damk\"ohler numbers far from those used for training. This demonstrates the accuracy, stability, and generalizability of the PDE-constrained modeling approach for turbulent jet flames over this relatively wide Damk\"ohler number range.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian flow statistics in experimental homogeneous isotropic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on Lagrangian flow statistics from experimental measurements of homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The investigated flow is driven by 12 impellers inside an icosahedral volume. Seven impeller rotation rates are considered resulting in seven Reynolds numbers with $205 \leq \text{Re}_\lambda \leq 602$. We perform high-speed imaging using 3 cameras to record a total of $8.2\times10^6$ frames, and using high resolution three dimensional (3D) particle tracking velocimetry position, velocity, and acceleration of particle tracks are obtained in the vicinity of the center of the device. From these tracks, we obtain the Eulerian and Lagrangian flow statistics, mainly based on second-order structure functions and autocorrelation functions. The universal constants $C_0^*$ (for the Lagrangian second order structure function), $C_\varepsilon$ (for the energy injection rate) and $a_0$ (for the acceleration fluctuations) are determined, as well as all the relevant Lagrangian and Eulerian flow time scales. Analytical relations between these constants and time scales are experimentally verified.</description>

      <title>Bubbles-induced transition to elasto-inertial turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interface-resolved direct numerical simulations are performed to investigate bubble-induced transition from laminar to elasto-inertial turbulent (EIT) state in a pressure-driven viscoelastic square channel flow. The Giesekus model is used to account for the viscoelasticity of the continuous phase while the dispersed phase is Newtonian. Simulations are performed for both single and two-phase flows for a wide range of the Reynolds (Re) and the Weissenberg (Wi) numbers. It is demonstrated that injection of bubbles into a laminar viscoelastic flow introduces streamline curvature that is sufficient to trigger an elastic instability leading to a transition to a fully EIT regime. The temporal turbulent kinetic energy spectrum shows a scaling of -2 for this multiphase EIT regime. It is shown that, once the flow is fully transitioned to a turbulent state by the injection of bubbles, the drag increases for all the cases. It is also observed that bubbles move towards the channel centreline and form a string-shaped alignment pattern in the core region at the lower values of Re=10 and Wi=1. In this regime, the flow exhibits an intermittent behaviour, i.e., there are turbulent like fluctuations in the core region while it is essentially laminar near the wall. Unlike the solid particles, it is found that increasing shear-thinning effect breaks up the alignment of bubbles. Interestingly, the drag remains slightly lower in this intermittent regime than the corresponding laminar state.</description>

      <title>The effect of self-induced Marangoni flow on polar-nematic waves in active-matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation of propagating large-scale density waves of mixed polar-nematic symmetry in a colony of self-propelled agents that are bound to move along the planar surface of a thin viscous film. The agents act as an insoluble surfactant, i.e. the surface tension of the liquid depends on their density. Therefore, density gradients generate a Marangoni flow. We demonstrate that for active matter in the form of self-propelled surfactants with local (nematic) aligning interactions such a Marangoni flow nontrivially influences the propagation of the density waves. Upon gradually increasing the Marangoni parameter, which characterises the relative strength of the Marangoni flow as compared to the self-propulsion speed, the density waves broaden while their speed may either increase or decrease depending on wavelength and overall mean density. A further increase of the Marangoni parameter eventually results in the disappearance of the density waves. This may occur either discontinuously at finite wave amplitude via a saddle-node bifurcation or continuously with vanishing wave amplitude at a wave bifurcation, i.e. a finite-wavelength Hopf bifurcation.</description>

      <title>Efficient neural topology optimization via active learning for enhancing turbulent mass transfer in fluid channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of fluid channel structures of reactors or separators of chemical processes is key to enhancing the mass transfer processes inside the devices. However, the systematic design of channel topological structures is difficult for complex turbulent flows. Here, we address this challenge by developing a machine learning framework to efficiently perform topology optimization of channel structures for turbulent mass transfer. We represent a topological structure using a neural network (referred to as `neural topology', which is optimized by employing pre-trained neural operators combined with a fine-tuning strategy with active data augmentation. The optimization is performed with two objectives: maximization of mass transfer efficiency and minimization of energy consumption, for the possible considerations of compromise between the two in real-world designs. The developed neural operator with active learning is data efficient in network training and demonstrates superior computational efficiency compared with traditional methods in obtaining optimal structures across a large design space. The optimization results are validated through experiments, proving that the optimized channel improves concentration uniformity by 37% compared with the original channel. We also demonstrate the variation of the optimal structures with changes in inlet velocity conditions, providing a reference for designing turbulent mass-transfer devices under different operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Bounds on dissipation in three-dimensional planar shear flows: reduction to two-dimensional problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bounds on turbulent averages in shear flows can be derived from the Navier-Stokes equations by a mathematical approach called the background method. Bounds that are optimal within this method can be computed at each Reynolds number Re by numerically optimizing subject to a spectral constraint, which requires a quadratic integral to be nonnegative for all possible velocity fields. Past authors have eased computations by enforcing the spectral constraint only for streamwise-invariant (2.5D) velocity fields, assuming this gives the same result as enforcing it for three-dimensional (3D) fields. Here we compute optimal bounds over 2.5D fields and then verify, without doing computations over 3D fields, that the bounds indeed apply to 3D flows. One way is to directly check that an optimizer computed using 2.5D fields satisfies the spectral constraint for all 3D fields. We introduce a criterion that gives a second way, applicable to planar shear flow models with a certain symmetry, that is based on a theorem of Busse (ARMA 47:28, 1972) for the energy stability problem. The advantage of checking this criterion, as opposed to directly checking the 3D constraint, is lower computational cost and more natural extrapolation to large Re. We compute optimal upper bounds on friction coefficients for the wall-bounded Kolmogorov flow known as Waleffe flow, and for plane Couette flow, which require lower bounds on dissipation in the first model and upper bounds in the second. For Waleffe flow, all bounds computed using 2.5D fields satisfy our criterion, so they hold for 3D flows. For Couette flow, where bounds have previously been computed using 2.5D fields by Plasting and Kerswell (JFM 477:363, 2003), our criterion holds only up to moderate Re, but at larger Re we directly verify the 3D spectral constraint. This supports the assumption by Plasting and Kerswell that their bounds hold for 3D flows.</description>

      <title>Advancing sustainable energy solutions with microfluidic porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to a sustainable, low-carbon energy future requires transformative advancements in energy and environmental technologies. Carbon capture and sequestration, underground hydrogen storage, and nuclear waste geological disposal will be central aspects of a sustainable energy future, both for mitigating CO2 emissions and providing green energy. A comprehensive understanding of multiphase flow through porous media, along with reactive transport and microbial activities, is essential for assessing the feasibility and managing the risks of these technologies. Microfluidic porous media platforms have emerged as powerful tools for the direct visualization of multiphase reactive flow in porous media and eventually optimizing these multiple physicochemical and biological processes. This review highlights critical scientific challenges associated with these sustainable energy solutions and summarizes the state-of-the-art microfluidic techniques for studying the interplay between multiphase flow, reactive transport, and biological effects in porous media. We provide a comprehensive overview of how these microfluidic approaches enhance the understanding of fundamental pore-scale dynamics and bridge the gap between pore-scale events and large-scale processes. This review is expected to promote both experimental and theoretical understanding of multiphase reactive flow in porous media, thereby informing material design, process optimization, and predictive modeling for scalable implementation. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration across microfluidics, fluid mechanics, geophysics, materials science, and subsurface engineering, we hope to accelerate innovation and advance sustainable energy solutions.</description>

      <title>Numerical Study On Temperature Variations Of Superheated Steam Flowing Through A Regulation Valve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superheated steam is widely employed in various energy systems, particularly in power plants, chemical industries, and other applications where high-temperature and high-pressure steam is essential for efficient energy conversion and process control. In these systems, regulation valves are crucial components that control the flow of steam, adjusting its pressure and temperature to ensure safe and efficient operation. Accurate understanding and prediction of temperature variations within regulation valves are essential for optimizing their performance and improving the overall system efficiency. This study investigates the temperature variations of superheated steam flowing through a regulation valve using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations combined with Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) techniques. The analysis begins with an examination of the internal flow field parameters, including temperature and pressure, to understand the overall fluid dynamics within the valve. POD is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the CFD results. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is employed to extract the dominant modes that capture the key flow structures responsible for heat transfer and temperature fluctuations. The POD analysis reveals that the most influential modes are associated with regions of high turbulence intensity and significant temperature gradients, which are critical to the thermal performance of the steam flow through the regulation valve. The application of POD to 3D CFD results represents a novel approach, particularly for complex fluid flow models such as steam flow through regulation valves. The insights gained from this study have practical implications for the design and optimization of temperature and pressure regulation valves in energy systems, providing a theoretical foundation for enhancing the efficiency and reliability of these systems.</description>

      <title>Inverse energy transfer in three-dimensional quantum vortex flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex reconnections play a fundamental role in fluids.They increase the complexity of flow and develop small-scale motions.In this work, we report that in superfluids, they can also excite large scales. We numerically illustrate that during a superfluid vortex reconnection energy is injected into the thermal (normal) component of helium~II at small length scales, but is transferred nonlinearly to larger length scales, increasing the integral length scale of the normal fluid. We show that this inverse energy transfer is triggered by the helical imbalance generated in the normal fluid flow by the mutual friction force coupling the superfluid vortices and the normal component. We finally discuss the relevance of our findings to the problem of superfluid turbulence.</description>

      <title>Meshless Super-Resolution of Scattered Data via constrained RBFs and KNN-Driven Densification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel meshless method to achieve super-resolution from scattered data obtained from sparse, randomly-positioned sensors such as the particle tracers of particle tracking velocimetry. The method combines K-Nearest Neighbor Particle Tracking Velocimetry (KNN-PTV, Tirelli et al. 2023) with meshless Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (meshless POD, Tirelli et al. 2025) and constrained Radial Basis Function regression (c-RBFs, Sperotto et al. 2022). The main idea is to use KNN-PTV to enhance the spatial resolution of flow fields by blending data from \textit{locally similar} flow regions available in the time series. This \textit{similarity} is assessed in terms of statistical coherency with leading features, identified by meshless POD directly on the scattered data without the need to first interpolate onto a grid, but instead relying on RBFs to compute all the relevant inner products. Lastly, the proposed approach uses the c-RBF on the denser scattered distributions to derive an analytical representation of the flow fields that incorporates physical constraints. This combination is meshless because it does not require the definition of a grid at any step of the calculation, thus providing flexibility in handling complex geometries. The algorithm is validated on 3D measurements of a jet flow in air. The assessment covers three key aspects: statistics, spectra, and modal analysis. The proposed method is evaluated against standard Particle Image Velocimetry, KNN-PTV, and c-RBFs. The results demonstrate improved accuracy, with an average error on the order of 11%, compared to 13-14% for the other methods. Additionally, the proposed method achieves an increase in the cutoff frequency of approximately 3-4/D, compared to the values observed in the competing approaches. Furthermore, it shows nearly half the errors in low-order reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Coarse graining and reduced order models for plume ejection dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring the atmospheric dispersion of pollutants is increasingly critical for environmental impact assessments. High-fidelity computational models are often employed to simulate plume dynamics, guiding decision-making and prioritizing resource deployment. However, such models can be prohibitively expensive to simulate, as they require resolving turbulent flows at fine spatial and temporal resolutions. Moreover, there are at least two distinct dynamical regimes of interest in the plume: (i) the initial ejection of the plume where turbulent mixing is generated by the shear-driven Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and (ii) the ensuing turbulent diffusion and advection which is often modeled by the Gaussian plume model. We address the challenge of modeling the initial plume generation. Specifically, we propose a data-driven framework that identifies a reduced-order analytical model for plume dynamics -- directly from video data. We extract a time series of plume center and edge points from video snapshots and evaluate different regressions based to their extrapolation performance to generate a time series of coefficients that characterize the plume's overall direction and spread. We regress to a sinusoidal model inspired by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability for the edge points in order to identify the plume's dispersion and vorticity. Overall, this reduced-order modeling framework provides a data-driven and lightweight approach to capture the dominant features of the initial nonlinear point-source plume dynamics, agnostic to plume type and starting only from video. The resulting model is a pre-cursor to standard models such as the Gaussian plume model and has the potential to enable rapid assessment and evaluation of critical environmental hazards, such as methane leaks, chemical spills, and pollutant dispersal from smokestacks.</description>

      <title>Capillary jet in a slab of foam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A capillary jet plunging into a quasi-2D slab of monodisperse foam of the same solution is studied experimentally. We show that the jet can have a drastic impact on the foam. At small speeds it inflates the channels separating the bubbles. At intermediate speeds, impact with channels creates very small bubbles. At higher speeds, the jet thins the foam films, which can result in bubble rupture. We study the mechanisms behind these processes using an elementary foam formed by three soap films in contact through a Plateau border. We obtain scaling laws, which transfer quantitatively from the elementary foam to the 2D foam.</description>

      <title>Multiscale thermodynamic nonequilibrium effects in Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and their relative importance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the complex kinetics of thermodynamic nonequilibrium effects (TNEs) and their relative importance during the development of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) using high-order discrete Boltzmann models (DBMs). First, the capabilities and differences among various discrete velocity sets in capturing TNEs and distribution functions are assessed. Practical guidelines for constructing discrete velocity stencils are proposed to enhance phase-space discretization and improve the robustness of high-order DBM simulation. At different stages of KHI and under varying initial conditions, multiscale TNEs, such as viscous stresses of different orders, emerge with distinct dominant roles. Specifically, three scenarios are identified: (i) regimes dominated by first-order TNEs,(ii) alternation between first- and second-order TNEs, and (iii) states where second-order TNEs govern the system's behavior. To quantitatively capture these transitions, criteria for TNE dominance at different orders in KHI evolution are established based on the relative thermodynamic nonequilibrium intensity (\(R_{\text{TNE}}\)). In scenarios dominated by second-order TNEs, differences between first-order and second-order models are compared in terms of macroscopic quantities, nonequilibrium effects, and kinetic moments, revealing the physical limitations of low-order models in capturing TNEs. Furthermore, the effectiveness, extensibility, and limitations of a representative high-order model are examined under second-order TNE-dominated conditions. To encapsulate these findings, a nonequilibrium phase diagram that visually maps the multiscale characteristics of KHI is constructed. This diagram not only provides intuitive insights into the dynamic interplay of different nonequilibrium effects but also serves as a kinetic roadmap for selecting suitable models under diverse nonequilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>Exploring Bayesian olfactory search in realistic turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of tracking the source of a passive scalar in a turbulent flow is relevant to flying insect behavior and several other applications. Extensive previous work has shown that certain Bayesian strategies, such as "infotaxis," can be very effective for this difficult "olfactory search" problem. More recently, a quasi-optimal Bayesian strategy was computed under the assumption that encounters with the scalar are independent. However, the Bayesian approach has not been adequately studied in realistic flows which exhibit spatiotemporal correlations. In this work, we perform direct numerical simulations (DNS) of an incompressible flow at $\mathrm{Re}_\lambda\simeq150,$ while tracking Lagrangian particles which are emitted by a point source and imposing a uniform mean flow with several magnitudes (including zero). We extract the spatially-dependent statistics of encounters with the particles, which we use to build Bayesian policies, including generalized ("space-aware") infotactic heuristics and quasi-optimal policies. We then assess the relative performance of these policies when they are used to search using scalar cue data from the DNS, and in particular study how this performance depends on correlations between encounters. Among other results, we find that quasi-optimal strategies continue to outperform heuristics in the presence of strong mean flow but fail to do so in the absence of a mean flow. We also explore how to choose optimal search parameters, including the frequency and threshold concentration of observation.</description>

      <title>A robust shifted proper orthogonal decomposition: Proximal methods for decomposing flows with multiple transports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new methodology for decomposing flows with multiple transports that further extends the shifted proper orthogonal decomposition (sPOD). The sPOD tries to approximate transport-dominated flows by a sum of co-moving data fields. The proposed methods stem from sPOD but optimize the co-moving fields directly and penalize their nuclear norm to promote low rank of the individual data in the decomposition. Furthermore, we add a robustness term to the decomposition that can deal with interpolation error and data noises. Leveraging tools from convex optimization, we derive three proximal algorithms to solve the decomposition problem. We report a numerical comparison with existing methods against synthetic data benchmarks and then show the separation ability of our methods on 1D and 2D incompressible and reactive flows. The resulting methodology is the basis of a new analysis paradigm that results in the same interpretability as the POD for the individual co-moving fields.</description>
