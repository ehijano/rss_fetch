      <title>Coherent Structures in One-dimensional Buneman Instability Nonlinear Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-duration one-dimensional PIC simulations are presented of Buneman-unstable, initially Maxwellian, electron and ion distributions shifted with respect to one another, providing detailed phase-space videos of the time-dependence. The final state of high initial ion temperature cases is dominated by fast electron holes, but when initial ion temperature is less than approximately four times the electron temperature, ion density modulation produces potential perturbations of approximately ion-acoustic character, modified by the electron distribution shift. Early in the nonlinear phase, they often have electron holes trapped in them ("coupled hole-solitons": CHS). In high-available-energy cases, when major broadening of the electron distribution occurs, both electron holes and coupled hole-solitons can be reflected, giving persistent counter-propagating potential peaks. Analytical theory is presented of steady nonlinear potential structures in model nonlinear particle distribution plasmas with Buneman unstable parameters. It compares favorably in some respects with the nonlinear simulations, but not with the later phases when the electron velocity distributions are greatly modified.</description>

      <title>Single Mode Wave Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The usual approach on electrostatic wave decay process for a weak beam-plasma system considers two different wave modes interplaying, the Langmuir and ion-sound mode. In the present paper, a single mode approach is shown to be feasible for conditions where the respective dispersion relations undergo topological changes. Numerical solutions for the dispersion relation of a beam-plasma system are presented, supporting the modeling of an analytic dispersion relation of a single wave mode. This wave mode is accounted for in the kinetic equations for particles and waves, which rule the evolution of the system. The results are compared against the two-wave mode approach using Langmuir and ion-sound waves, within the context of weak turbulence theory. It is found that the single mode approach can account for the basic features of particles and waves, since the single mode exhibits both a region of low and high frequency which ultimately play the roles of ion-sound and Langmuir modes, respectively.</description>

      <title>Degradation of performance in ICF implosions due to Rayleigh--Taylor instabilities: a Hamiltonian perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rayleigh--Taylor instability (RTI) is an ubiquitous phenomenon that occurs in inertial-confinement-fusion (ICF) implosions and is recognized as an important limiting factor of ICF performance. To analytically understand the RTI dynamics and its impact on ICF capsule implosions, we develop a first-principle variational theory that describes an imploding spherical shell undergoing RTI. The model is based on a thin-shell approximation and includes the dynamical coupling between the imploding spherical shell and an adiabatically compressed fluid within its interior. Using a quasilinear analysis, we study the degradation trends of key ICF performance metrics (e.g., stagnation pressure, residual kinetic energy, and aerial density) as functions of initial RTI parameters (e.g., the initial amplitude and Legendre mode), as well as the 1D implosion characteristics (e.g., the convergence ratio). We compare analytical results from the theory against nonlinear results obtained by numerically integrating the governing equations of this reduced model. Our findings emphasize the need to incorporate polar flows in the calculation of residual kinetic energy and demonstrate that higher convergence ratios in ICF implosions lead to significantly greater degradation of key performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of OpenMC as a framework for atomic transport and plasma interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern tooling is demanded for predicting the transport and reaction characteristics of atoms and molecules, especially in the context of magnetic confinement fusion. DEGAS2, among the most common and capable tools currently in use, shares many fundamental similarities with the OpenMC framework, which was primarily developed for neutron and photon transport. In this work, we demonstrate that OpenMC is suitable for atomic transport calculations. The relative error between the models is small, and the performance of OpenMC is at least comparable to DEGAS2. This is the case even without taking advantage of heterogeneous computing architecture, which is only one of the several remarkable new capabilities that this demonstration heralds.</description>

      <title>Prevention of resistive wall tearing mode major disruptions with feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resistive wall tearing modes (RWTM) can cause major disruptions. A signature of RWTMs is that the rational surface is sufficiently close to the wall. For $(m,n) = (2,1)$ modes, at normalized minor radius $\rho = 0.75$, the value of $q$ is $q_{75} &lt; 2.$ This is confirmed in simulations and theory and in a DIII-D locked mode disruption database. The $q_{75} &lt; 2$ criterion is valid at high $\beta$ as well as at low $\beta.$ A very important feature of RWTMs is that they produce major disruptions only when the $q_{75} &lt; 2$ criterion is satisfied. If it is not satisfied, or if the wall is ideally conducting, then the mode does not produce a major disruption, although it can produce a minor disruption. Feedback, or rotation of the mode at the wall by complex feedback, can emulate an ideal wall, preventing major disruptions. The $q_{75}$ criterion is analyzed in a linear simulations, and a simple geometric model is given.</description>

      <title>New Insights on the High Reconnection Rate and the Diminishment of Ion Outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered electron-only reconnection has drawn great interests due to abnormal features like lack of ion outflows and high reconnection rates. Using particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate their physical mechanisms. The reconnection rate, when normalized by ion parameters ($R_i$), may appear anomalously high, whereas that normalized by electron parameters ($R_e$) remains ~0.1. We propose that the essence of high $R_i$ is insufficient field line bending outside the electron diffusion region, indicating an incomplete development of the ion diffusion region. It may result from bursty reconnection in thin current sheets, or small system sizes. The ion outflow diminishes at high $\beta_i$ when the gyroradius ($\rho_i$) exceeds the system size. Low-velocity ions still experience notable acceleration from Hall fields. However, a local distribution includes many high-velocity ions that experience random accelerations from different electric fields across $\rho_i$, resulting in near-zero bulk velocities. Our study helps understand reconnection structures and the underlying physics for transitions between different regimes.</description>

      <title>Upgrade of the Diagnostic Neutral Beam Injector for the RFX-mod2 experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagnostic Neutral Beam Injectors (DNBI), through the combined use of Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy (CHERS) and Motional Stark effect diagnostics (MSE), are a well-known tool to access important information about magnetically confined plasmas, such as radial profiles of ion temperature, ion flow, impurity content and intensity and direction of the magnetic field. For this purpose, a DNBI was installed and operated in the RFX-mod experiment, which was designed to confine plasma mainly through the Reversed Field Pinch configuration. The DNBI, designed and built by the Budker Institute of Plasma Physics, was based on a source of positive hydrogen ions, accelerated to 50 keV and for an equivalent neutral beam current of about 5 A at the source. The beam could be modulated and the maximum overall duration was 50 ms. With the upgrade of RFX-mod to the present RFX-mod2 machine, the DNBI is being renovated to solve several plant faults and improve the overall reliability of the system. The 50 kV power supply is being improved, as well as the power supplies in the high voltage deck and its insulation transformer. The control system, originally based on CAMAC technology, was redesigned to be fully replaced. This contribution reviews the technical criticalities emerged in the DNBI check-up and the new solutions adopted to make the DNBI operative and more reliable.</description>

      <title>Oscillations of subcritical fast magnetosonic shock boundaries caused by shock reformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of a deformed subcritical fast magnetosonic shock front is compared between two two-dimensional PIC simulations with different orientations of the magnetic field relative to the simulation box. All other initial and simulation conditions are kept identical. Shock boundary oscillations are observed in the simulation where the magnetic field direction is resolved. This oscillation is caused by the reformation of the shock front. One part of the front acts as a shock, while the other functions as a magnetic piston, with both halves changing their states in antiphase. The oscillation period corresponds to the time required for one shock wave to grow as the other collapses. In contrast, the corrugated fast magnetosonic shock does not oscillate in the second simulation, where the magnetic field is oriented out of the simulation plane. This dependence on magnetic field orientation suggests that the shock oscillation is induced by magnetic tension, which is only effective in the first simulation. In both simulations, the shock perturbation does not grow over time, indicating that the shocks are stable. The potential relevance of these findings for the Alfv\'enic oscillations of the supercritical Earth's bow shock, detected by the MMS multi-spacecraft mission, is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Multi-Mission Observations of Relativistic Electrons and High-Speed Jets Linked to Shock Generated Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shock-generated transients, such as hot flow anomalies (HFAs), upstream of planetary bow shocks, play a critical role in electron acceleration. Using multi-mission data from NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) and ESA's Cluster missions, we demonstrate the transmission of HFAs through Earth's quasi-parallel bow shock, associated with acceleration of electrons up to relativistic energies. Energetic electrons, initially accelerated upstream, are shown to remain broadly confined within the transmitted transient structures downstream, where betatron acceleration further boosts their energy due to elevated compression levels. Additionally, high-speed jets form at the compressive edges of HFAs, exhibiting a significant increase in dynamic pressure and potentially contributing to driving further localized compression. Our findings emphasize the efficiency of quasi-parallel shocks in driving particle acceleration far beyond the immediate shock transition region, expanding the acceleration region to a larger spatial domain. Finally, this study underscores the importance of multi-scale observational approach in understanding the convoluted processes behind collisionless shock physics and their broader implications.</description>

      <title>Validation of the static forward Grad-Shafranov equilibrium solvers in FreeGSNKE and Fiesta using EFIT++ reconstructions from MAST-U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key aspect in the modelling of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria in tokamak devices is having access to fast, accurate, and stable numerical simulation methods. There is an increasing demand for reliable methods that can be used to develop traditional or machine learning-based shape control feedback systems, optimise scenario designs, and integrate with other plasma edge or transport modelling codes. To handle such applications, these codes need to be flexible and, more importantly, they need to have been validated against both analytically known and real-world tokamak equilibria to ensure they are consistent and credible. In this paper, we are interested in solving the static forward Grad-Shafranov (GS) problem for free-boundary MHD equilibria. Our focus is on the validation of the static forward solver in the Python-based equilibrium code FreeGSNKE by solving equilibria from magnetics-only EFIT++ reconstructions of MAST-U shots. In addition, we also validate FreeGSNKE against equilibria simulated using the well-established MATLAB-based equilibrium code Fiesta. To do this, we develop a computational pipeline that allows one to load the same (a)symmetric MAST-U machine description into each solver, specify the required inputs (active/passive conductor currents, plasma profiles and coefficients, etc.) from EFIT++, and solve the GS equation for all available time slices across a shot. For a number of different MAST-U shots, we demonstrate that both FreeGSNKE and Fiesta can successfully reproduce various poloidal flux quantities and shape targets (e.g. midplane radii, magnetic axes, separatrices, X-points, and strikepoints) in agreement with EFIT++ calculations to a very high degree of accuracy. We also provide public access to the code/data required to load the MAST-U machine description in FreeGSNKE/Fiesta and reproduce the equilibria in the shots shown.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of Kohn-Sham density functional theory for warm- and hot-dense matter equation of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the accuracy of Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) for warm- and hot-dense matter (WDM and HDM). Specifically, considering a wide range of systems, we perform accurate ab initio molecular dynamics simulations with temperature-independent local/semilocal density functionals to determine the equations of state at compression ratios of 3x--7x and temperatures near 1 MK. We find very good agreement with path integral Monte Carlo benchmarks, while having significantly smaller error bars and smoother data, demonstrating the accuracy of DFT for the study of WDM and HDM at such conditions. In addition, using a $\Delta$-machine learned force field scheme, we confirm that the DFT results are insensitive to the choice of exchange-correlation functional, whether local, semilocal, or nonlocal.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the blowout plasma wakefields produced by drive beams with elliptical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the underdense (blowout) regime of plasma wakefield acceleration (PWFA), the particle beam is denser than the plasma. Under these conditions, the plasma electrons are nearly completely rarefacted from the beam channel, resulting in a nominally uniform ion column. Extensive investigations of this interaction assuming axisymmetry have been undertaken. However, the plasma blowout produced by a transversely asymmetric driver possesses quite different characteristics. They create an asymmetric plasma rarefaction region (bubble) which leads to asymmetric focusing in the two transverse planes. This is also accompanied by an undesired non-uniform accelerating gradient. The asymmetric blowout cross-section is found through simulation to be elliptical, and treating it as such permits a simple extension of the symmetric theory. In particular, focusing fields linear in both transverse directions exist in the bubble. The form of the wake potential and the concomitant matching conditions in this elliptical cavity are discussed in this paper. We also discuss bubble boundary estimation in the long driver limit and applications of the asymmetric features of the wakefield.</description>

      <title>Extreme heating of minor ions in imbalanced solar-wind turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Minor ions in the solar corona are heated to extreme temperatures, far in excess of those of the electrons and protons that comprise the bulk of the plasma. These highly non-thermal distributions make minor ions sensitive probes of the underlying collisionless heating processes, which are crucial to coronal heating and the creation of the solar wind. The recent discovery of the "helicity barrier" offers a mechanism where imbalanced Alfv\'enic turbulence in low-beta plasmas preferentially heats protons over electrons, generating high-frequency, proton-cyclotron-resonant fluctuations. We use the hybrid-kinetic particle-in-cell code, Pegasus++, to drive imbalanced Alfv\'enic turbulence in a 3D low-beta plasma with additional passive ion species, He$^{2+}$ and O$^{5+}$. A helicity barrier naturally develops, followed by clear phase-space signatures of oblique ion-cyclotron-wave heating and Landau-resonant heating from the imbalanced Alfv\'enic fluctuations. The former results in characteristically arced ion velocity distribution functions, whose non-bi-Maxwellian features are shown by linear ALPS calculations to be critical to the heating process. Additional features include a steep transition-range electromagnetic spectrum, the presence of ion-cyclotron waves propagating in the direction of imbalance, significantly enhanced proton-to-electron heating ratios, anisotropic ion temperatures that are significantly more perpendicular with respect to magnetic field, and extreme heating of heavier species in a manner consistent with empirically derived mass scalings informed by measurements. None of these features are realized in an otherwise equivalent simulation of balanced turbulence. If seen simultaneously in the fast solar wind, these signatures of the helicity barrier would testify to the necessity of incorporating turbulence imbalance in a complete theory for the evolution of the solar wind.</description>
