      <title>Thermodynamics, Weak Gravitational Lensing, and Parameter Estimation of a Schwarzschild Black Hole Immersed in Hernquist Dark Matter Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we obtain a novel black hole (BH) solution of a Schwarzschild BH immersed in a Hernquist dark matter (SBHD) halo. The thermodynamic properties of the resultant spacetime are then studied to gauge the impact of dark matter (DM) on the local and global stability of the composite system of the BH-DM halo. With the intention of finding imprints of DM, we then studied weak gravitational lensing (GL) and shadow. Both display significant dependence on the DM parameters - core radius $r_s$ and core density $\rho_s$. Finally, we constrain DM parameters by utilizing bounds on the deviation parameter $\delta$ for super-massive BHs (SMBHs) $M87^*$ and $Sgr A^*$ reported by Event horizon telescope (EHT), Keck, and VLTI observatories. Our analysis finds SBHD congruent with experimental observations, thereby making it a feasible candidate for an SMBH.</description>

      <title>How Much NEC Breaking Can the Universe Endure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum fields can notoriously violate the null energy condition (NEC). In a cosmological context, NEC violation can lead to, e.g., dark energy at late times with an equation-of-state parameter smaller than $-1$ and nonsingular bounces at early times. However, it is expected that there should still be a limit in semiclasssical gravity to how much `negative energy' can accumulate over time and in space as a result of quantum effects. In the course of formulating quantum-motivated energy conditions, the smeared null energy condition has emerged as a recent proposal. This condition conjectures the existence of a semilocal bound on negative energy along null geodesics, which is expected to hold in semiclassical gravity. In this work, we show how the smeared null energy condition translates into theoretical constraints on NEC-violating cosmologies. Specifically, we derive the implied bounds on dark energy equation-of-state parameters and an inequality between the duration of a bouncing phase and the growth rate of the Hubble parameter at the bounce. In the case of dark energy, we identify the parameter space over which the smeared null energy condition is consistent with the recent constraints from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI).</description>

      <title>Dynamical nonlinear tails in Schwarzschild black hole ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear tails in black hole perturbations, arising from second-order effects, present a distinct departure from the well-known Price tail of linear theory. We present an analytical derivation of the power law indices and amplitudes for nonlinear tails stemming from outgoing sources, and validate these predictions to percent-level accuracy with numerical simulations. We then perform a perturbative analysis on the dynamical formation of nonlinear tails in a self-interacting scalar field model, wherein the nonlinear tails are sourced by a $\lambda \Phi^3$ cubic coupling. Due to cascading mode excitations and back-reactions, nonlinear tails with $t^{-l-1}$ power law are sourced in each harmonic mode, dominating the late time behavior of the scalar perturbations. In verification, we conducted numerical simulations of the self-interacting scalar model, including all real spherical harmonic (RSH) with $l\leq 4$ and their respective nonlinear couplings. We find general agreement between the predicted and numerical power law indices and amplitudes for the nonlinear tails, with the exception of $l=4$ modes, which display $t^{-4}$ power law instead of the predicted $t^{-5}$. This discrepancy is due to distortion in the source of the tails, which is caused by another nonlinear effect. These results establish nonlinear tails as universal features of black hole dynamics, with implications for gravitational wave astronomy: they may imprint observable signatures in merger remnants, offering novel probes of strong-field gravity and nonlinear mode couplings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a massive-photon electrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in the curved spacetime of Einstein's gravity. We consider a Proca-type photon mass and present equations in terms of electric and magnetic (EM) fields and the vector potential. We present the electrodynamics and MHD in the covariant and ADM formulations valid in general spacetime and in linearly perturbed cosmological spacetime. We present wave equations assuming the metric variations are negligible compared with the field variations. Equations are derived without fixing the temporal gauge condition and the gauge transformation properties of the EM fields and the vector potential are presented. Using the post-Newtonian approximation we show the dark Proca field behaves as dust in the non-relativistic limit under the Klein transformation.</description>

      <title>Cosmological post-Newtonian approximation of a Lorentz-violating vector field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A candidate for relativistic MOND with successful cosmology was proposed by using a Lorentz-violating vector field in Einstein's gravity. We show that the dynamic nature of the vector field makes it challenging to realize the MOND. Only in the stationary limit, thus excluding cosmological situations, one can achieve the MOND limit. We study the evolution of density perturbations in the baryon-vector field system using both post-Newtonian approximation and relativistic perturbation theory. Our results show that the behavior differs from what we expect in the non-relativistic MOND proposal, i.e., the faster growth of structures in the MOND regime.</description>

      <title>Particle Deflections around Microscopic Loop Quantum Black Holes with Rigorous Quantum Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of quantum gravity effects is highly limited in both macroscopic and microscopic scenarios: The small quantum parameter makes most large-scale observations practically indistinguishable from general relativity. While at the Planck scale, where the effect of quantum gravity is undoubtedly significant, the energy requirement is remarkably high for any test particle as a probe. In this work, by focusing on the inner-most stable circular orbit (ISCO) of both massless and massive particles around a microscopic loop quantum black hole, we show that given the current knowledge of ultra-high-energy particles, quantum corrections of relative scale $&gt;10^{-10}$ can appear when the radius of the black hole horizon remains larger than the wavelength of high-energy Gamma rays, where the classical photon trajectory may still hold to a certain degree. In addition, more significant corrections can be observed when considering low velocity massive particles. Potentially, our results could suggest a new area for testing the effects of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Black holes and solitonic objects with bosonic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes (BH) are among the most unusual and exciting physical objects. Besides being simultaneously Relativistic and quantum mechanical objects, which allows the discovery and/or tests of new physics, BHs also present a lack of "individuality". As a recall, if two stars have the same mass M and angular momentum J, nothing binds them to be distributed in the same way in both stars. However, two distinctly originated BH with the same M and J, will be indistinguishable. In recent years, several alternative models of ultra-compact objects have emerged to explain the unknown Universe. Between them, objects made and/or surrounded by bosonic fields are at the centre of recent developments. This thesis aims to construct and study such bosonic objects. In particular, the scalarization phenomena - where a BH gets immersed in a non-trivial scalar field - and the construction of Boson Stars - self-gravitating configurations of bosonic fields; as well as techniques to study them, namely: decomposition into spherical harmonics and the "complete" study of the virial identity through Derrick's argument. In this regard, we have constructed a parallelized, adaptative-step 6(5) order Runge-Kutta integrator to solve, with very high accuracy, the set of ODEs. Concerning PDEs, we resort to a professional solver (CADSOL/FIDISOL program package) due to the added complexity.</description>

      <title>Rotational Metric: A Solution to Einstein's Clock-Rate Problem and Its Magnetospheric Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotational metric offers an exact solution to Einstein's clock-rate problem in curved spacetime regarding whether time flows more slowly at the equator of a compact object like a neutron star than at its poles. Similar to what Einstein had done for a uniformly rotating disk, the metric can be obtained directly from the Schwarzschild metric through rotational transformations. In accordance with the equivalence of inertia and gravity, the rotational metric exhibits more complex geometric structures due to the effects of inertia-gravity arising from rotation. For instance, it has an extra ergosphere compared to the original Schwarzschild metric. The presence of the ergosphere could serve as a compelling example that illustrates how the rotational transformations can introduce new structures into a gravitational system. Exactly, there are additional physical degrees of freedom, carried by the rotational transformations, that are 'eaten' by the gravitational system to form an extra ergosphere inside the system itself, which is in analogy to the Higgs mechanism in particle physics. In this process, the rotational transformations play a role of 'symmetry breaking'. Besides, the rotational metric can describe the gravitational system that rigidly corotates with a spinning mass. It has potential applications in describing the rotationally-induced gravitational effects within various rotating magnetospheres and relevant astronomical phenomena. The understanding of the rotational metric is therefore expected to bring novel insights into general relativity and high-energy astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Parity-violating corrections to the orbital precession of binary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we test for gravitational parity violation in the PSR J1141-6545 system by analyzing the orbital plane inclination precession induced by the misalignment between the white dwarf's spin axis and the system's total angular momentum. Using the parity-violating metric of gravity that incorporates terms from both the exterior and boundary of the field source, we calculated corrections to the relative acceleration and orbital inclination precession rates, which exhibit significant deviations from the GR prediction. The parity-violating contributions depend on the projection of the spin vector along the orbital angular momentum direction, contrasting with GR, where it depends on the projection within the orbital plane. The corrections are perpendicular to GR contribution, highlighting a fundamental distinction. The exterior field correction is linear in the theoretical parameter and coupled to eccentricity $e$, while the boundary term correction is quadratic. By comparing these corrections with GR and incorporating observational uncertainty, we derive constraint on the theoretical parameter, yielding $ \dot{f}_{\rm PV}\lesssim 10~ \rm m$.</description>

      <title>Immortality through the dark forces: Dark-charge primordial black holes as dark matter candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fact that no Hawking radiation from the final stages of evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs) has yet been observed places stringent bounds on their allowed contribution to dark matter. Concretely, for Schwarzschild PBHs, i.e., uncharged and non-rotating black holes, this rules out black hole masses of less than $10^{-15} M_{\odot}$. In this article, we propose that by including an additional 'dark' $U(1)$ charge one can significantly lower the PBHs' Hawking temperature, slowing down their evaporation process and significantly extending their lifetimes. With this, PBHs again become a viable option for dark matter candidates over a large mass range. We will explore in detail the effects of varying the dark electron (lightest dark charged fermion) mass and charge on the evaporation dynamics. For instance, we will show that by allowing the dark electron to have a sufficiently high mass and/or low charge, our approach suppresses both Hawking radiation and the Schwinger effect, effectively extending even the lifespan of PBHs with masses smaller than $10^{-15} M_{\odot}$ beyond the current age of the universe. We will finally present a new lower bound on the allowed mass range for dark-charged PBHs as a function of the dark electron charge and mass, showing that the PBHs' mass can get to at least as low as $10^{-24}M_\odot$ depending on the dark electron properties. This demonstrates that the phenomenology of the evaporation of PBHs is ill-served by a focus solely on Schwarzschild black holes.</description>

      <title>Bouncing Theory in the Modified $f(R,G,T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the dynamics of the universe using a modified gravity model represented by $f(R, G, T)$, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar, $G$ is the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, and $T$ is the trace of the stress-energy tensor. The model incorporates two scalar fields and is analyzed within a flat Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe. We derive the equations of motion, energy-momentum tensor components, energy density, and pressure while establishing conservation laws. Using the Einstein field equations, we obtain modified Friedmann equations and simplify their solutions. We emphasize crossing the phantom divide line (PDL) of the equation of state (EoS) parameter and reversing the scale factor and Hubble parameter at $t = 0$ to resolve the singularity problem by proposing a bouncing cosmology, thereby exploring early universe dynamics without an initial singularity. By analyzing five samples $f(R, G, T)$ models, we reconstruct their effective energy density and pressure, demonstrating the significance of crossing the PDL. Our framework generalizes other theories, including conformally modified Weyl gravity, and is validated through numerical calculations and graphical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00267v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The saddle point approximation to formal quantum gravitational partition functions has yielded plausible computations of horizon entropy in various settings, but it stands on shaky ground. In this paper we visit some of that shaky ground, address some foundational questions, and describe efforts toward a more solid footing. We focus on the case of de Sitter horizon entropy which, it has been argued, corresponds to the dimension of the Hilbert space of a ball of space surrounded by the cosmological horizon.</description>

      <title>Vacua and infrared radiation in de Sitter quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the asymptotic behavior of quantum fields and perturbative quantum gravity in de Sitter space. We show that the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a de Sitter invariant vacuum state in the free theory is if the local field observables commute with the ``memory observable'' on any cosmological horizon. This criterion yields simple, gauge-invariant proofs of the existence of a de Sitter invariant vacuum for the (source-free) massive scalar field, electromagnetic field and linearized gravitational field. However, the massless, minimally coupled scalar does not satisfy this criterion and, consequently, there is no de Sitter invariant vacuum state. In this case, we construct the Hilbert space of normalizable states that have ``square integrable'' distributions in the memory and the conjugate constant mode. This Hilbert space has a unitary representation of the de Sitter symmetry group but no de Sitter invariant normalizable state. However even for free theories with a normalizable de Sitter invariant vacuum we show, by a simple example, that in the presence of a source a large number of infrared particles can be produced if the source interacts with the field for timescales much longer than the Hubble time. In the limit as the source persists forever it emits an infinite number of infrared particles.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Transitions, AdS and the Distance Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the connection between black hole instabilities and Swampland constraints, presenting new insights into the AdS Distance Conjecture. By examining the scale at which horizon instabilities of Schwarzschild-AdS$_d$ black holes take place$-\Lambda_{\mathrm{BH}}-$we uncover a universal scaling relation, $\Lambda_{\mathrm{BH}}\sim |\Lambda_{\mathrm{AdS}}|^{\alpha}$, with $\frac{1}{d}\leq \alpha\leq \frac{1}{2}$, linking the emergence of towers of states directly to instability scales as $\Lambda_{\mathrm{AdS}}\to 0$. This approach circumvents the explicit dependence on field-space distances, offering a refined formulation of the AdS Distance Conjecture grounded in physical black hole scales. From a top-down perspective, we find that these instability scales correspond precisely to the Gregory-Laflamme and Horowitz-Polchinski transitions, as expected for the flat space limit, and consistently with our proposed bounds. Furthermore, revisiting explicit calculations in type IIB string theory on AdS$_5\times S^5$, we illustrate how higher-derivative corrections may alter these bounds, potentially extending their applicability towards the interior of moduli space. Using also general results about gravitational collapse in AdS, our analysis points towards a possible breakdown of the conjecture in $d&gt;10$, suggesting an intriguing upper limit on the number of non-compact spacetime dimensions. Finally, we briefly discuss parallel considerations and implications for the dS case.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the rapidly emerging field of multi-messenger gravitational lensing - the discovery and science of gravitationally lensed phenomena in the distant universe through the combination of multiple messengers. This is framed by gravitational lensing phenomenology that has grown since the first discoveries in the 20th century, messengers that span 30 orders of magnitude in energy from high energy neutrinos to gravitational waves, and powerful "survey facilities" that are capable of continually scanning the sky for transient and variable sources. Within this context, the main focus is on discoveries and science that are feasible in the next 5-10 years with current and imminent technology including the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network of gravitational wave detectors, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, and contemporaneous gamma/X-ray satellites and radio surveys. The scientific impact of even one multi-messenger gravitational lensing discovery will be transformational and reach across fundamental physics, cosmology and astrophysics. We describe these scientific opportunities and the key challenges along the path to achieving them. This article is the introduction to the Theme Issue of the Philosophical Transactions of The Royal Society A on the topic of Multi-messenger Gravitational Lensing, and describes the consensus that emerged at the associated Theo Murphy Discussion Meeting in March 2024.</description>

      <title>Axion dissipation in conductive media and neutron star superradiance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In axion electrodynamics, magnetic fields enable axion-photon mixing. Recent proposals suggest that rotating, conductive plasmas in neutron star magnetospheres could trigger axion superradiant instabilities -- an intriguing idea, given that such instabilities are typically associated with rotating black holes. In this work, we extend these investigations by properly incorporating plasma dynamics, particularly the plasma-induced photon effective mass, which suppresses the axion-photon mixing. Using two toy models for the conductive regions in the magnetosphere and accounting for fluid dynamics in both the frequency and time domain, we show that typical astrophysical plasma densities strongly inhibits the axionic instability. While our results assumes flat spacetime, the conclusions also apply to axion bound states in curved spacetimes, making neutron star superradiance less viable than previously thought. As a byproduct of our work, we provide a detailed description of axion electrodynamics in dissipative plasmas and uncover phenomena such as low-frequency axion "tails" and axion-induced electrostatic fields in dense plasmas.</description>

      <title>Two or three things particle physicists (mis)understand about (pre)heating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition from the end of inflation to a hot, thermal Universe, commonly referred to as (re)heating, is a critical yet often misunderstood phase in early Universe cosmology. This short review aims to provide a comprehensive, conceptually clear, and accessible introduction to the physics of (re)heating, tailored to the particle physics community. We critically examine the standard Boltzmann approach, emphasizing its limitations in capturing the intrinsically non-perturbative and non-linear dynamics that dominate the early stages of energy transfer. These include explosive particle production, inflaton fragmentation, turbulence, and thermalization; phenomena often overlooked in perturbative treatments. We survey a wide range of theoretical tools, from Boltzmann equations to lattice simulations, clarifying when each is applicable and highlighting scenarios where analytic control is still feasible. Special attention is given to model-dependent features such as (pre)heating, the role of fermions, gravitational couplings, and the impact of multifield dynamics. We also discuss exceptional cases, including Starobinsky-like models and instant (pre)heating, where (re)heating proceeds through analytically tractable channels without requiring full non-linear simulations. Ultimately, this review serves both as a practical guide and a cautionary tale, advocating for a more nuanced and physically accurate understanding of this pivotal epoch within the particle physics community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is commonly remarked that contemporary physics faces a challenge in reconciling quantum theory with Relativity, specifically General Relativity as a theory of gravity. But "challenge" is too mild a descriptor. Once one understands both what John Bell proved and what Einstein himself demanded of Relativity it becomes clear that the predictions of quantum theory, predictions that have been verified in the lab, are flatly incompatible with what Einstein wanted and built into General Relativity. There is not merely a tension but an incompatibility between the predictions of quantum theory and Relativity, and what has to give way is the Relativistic account of space-time structure and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Energy transport in holographic non-conformal interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study energy transport in a system of two dimensional conformal field theories exchanging energy across a non-conformal interface involving a localised scalar operator, using holographic duality. By imposing the sourceless boundary condition, or equivalently, enforcing energy conservation at the interface, we show that the sum of the transmission and reflection coefficients is equal to one. Unlike conformal interfaces, we find that both the energy transmission and reflection coefficients are generally complex and frequency dependent. When the interface brane connects two distinct AdS$_2$ geometries, the transmission coefficient approaches the value expected for a conformal interface in the UV regime at high frequencies and in the IR regime at low frequencies. In the intermediate frequency range, the transmission coefficient may exhibit oscillatory behavior. Moreover, we present a nontrivial example of a fully transmissive interface, which exhibits similarities to a topological interface.</description>

      <title>Detectability of the chiral gravitational wave background from audible axions with the LISA-Taiji network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chiral gravitational wave background (GWB) can be produced by axion-like fields in the early universe. We perform parameter estimation for two types of chiral GWB with the LISA-Taiji network: axion-dark photon coupling and axion-Nieh-Yan coupling. We estimate the spectral parameters of these two mechanisms induced by axion and determine the normalized model parameters using the Fisher information matrix. For highly chiral GWB signals that we choose to analyze in the mHz band, the normalized model parameters are constrained with a relative error less than $6.7\%$ (dark photon coupling) and $2.2\%$ (Nieh-Yan coupling) at the one-sigma confidence level. The circular polarization parameters are constrained with a relative error around $21\%$ (dark photon coupling) and $6.2\%$ (Nieh-Yan coupling) at the one-sigma confidence level.</description>

Abstract: A comprehensive description is given of a space--time model of an accelerating massive particle. The particle radiates gravitational waves with optical shear. The wave fronts are smoothly deformed spheres and the particle experiences radiation reaction, similar to an accelerating charged particle, and a loss of mass described by a Bondi mass--loss formula. The space--time is one of the Bondi--Sachs forms but presented in a form here which is particularly suited to the construction of the model particle. All details of the calculations are given. A detailed examination of the gravitational field of the particle is provided which illustrates the presence of gravitational radiation and also exhibits, in the form of a type of singularity found in some Robinson--Trautman space--times, the absence of an external field to supply energy to the particle.</description>

      <title>Cosmic anisotropy and Bianchi Characterization: Killing vector fields and constructing their metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On the largest scales the universe appears to be almost perfectly homogeneous and isotropic, adhering to the cosmological principle. On smaller scales inhomogeneities and anisotropies become increasingly prominent, reflecting the origin, emergence and formation of structure in the Universe and its cosmological impact. Also, a range of tensions between various cosmological observations may suggest it to be necessary to explore the consequences of such deviations from the ideal uniform universe. In this study, we restrict this to an investigation of anisotropies on the nature of the Universe. This motivates a more thorough understanding of the manifestation of anisotropy in cosmological applications. When letting go of the assumption of isotropy, spacetime metrics become homogeneous and completely anisotropic. As such, the Lie algebras of Killing vector fields will be 3D, and fit into the so-called 9-part Bianchi classification. This work strives to, given a suitable 3D Lie algebra of vector fields $\{\xi_a\}_{a=1,2,3}$ reconstruct the basis for a metric on which this Lie algebra is Killing. Through finding a determining equation for the frame invariant under $\{\xi_a\}$ and using the method of characteristics to solve it, expressions for said invariant frame in terms of the $\{\xi_a\}$ are obtained. This leads to general equations for the invariant frame in terms of the $\{\xi_a\}$, organized by Bianchi class. Some examples demonstrating this method are worked out.</description>

      <title>Black hole images under spherical-shell and circular-annulus accretion models in Schwarzschild spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00361v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the static and infalling spherical-shell models of optically thin accretion on Schwarzschild black hole, the formulas for the integrated intensities observed by a distant observer are derived, and by taking the monochromatic emission pattern with a $1/r^{2}$ radial profile as example, the black hole images for the spherical shell with different boundaries are plotted. For these BH images, the geometric and luminosity features are summarized, and the qualitative explanations of the luminosity variations between the static and infalling spherical-shell models are provided. A notable feature of the black hole image in the infalling spherical-shell model is that when the inner boundary of the spherical shell is far from the bound photon orbit, the observed luminosity near the exterior of the shadow is enhanced. The circular-annulus models of optically and geometrically thin accretion on Schwarzschild black hole are further explored. For a lightlike geodesic, the analytical forms of the transfer functions working for all impact parameter values are first given, and the redshift factors in the static, infalling, and rotating circular-annulus models are then deduced. With these results, in the three situations, the formulas for the integrated intensities observed by a distant observer viewing the circular annulus at an inclination angle are derived, and the corresponding black hole images for each emission pattern provided in Phys. Rev. D \textbf{100} (2019) 024018 are plotted. Finally, for the BH images of arbitrary order, the geometric and luminosity features are also summarized, and the qualitative explanations of the luminosity variations between different CA models are also given.</description>

      <title>Metastable Cosmological Constant and Gravitational Bubbles: Ultra-Late-Time Transitions in Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observed cosmological constant may originate as the minimum value $U_{min}$ of a scalar field potential, where the scalar field is frozen due to a large mass. If this vacuum is metastable, it may decay to a true vacuum either at present or in the future. Assuming its decay rate $\Gamma$ is comparable to the Hubble expansion rate $H_0$, we estimate the scale of true vacuum bubbles and analyze their evolution. We find that their initial formation scale is sub-millimeter and their tension causes rapid collapse if $m \gtrsim 1.7 \cdot 10^{-3}\, eV$. For smaller masses, the bubbles expand at the speed of light. We extend our analysis to scalar-tensor theories with non-minimal coupling, finding that the nucleation scale of gravitational constant bubbles remains consistent with the sub-millimeter regime of General Relativity. The critical mass scale remains around $10^{-3}\,eV$. A theoretical estimate at redshift $z_{obs} \sim 0.01$ suggests an observable bubble radius of $\sim 50$ Mpc, implying a gravitational transition triggered $\sim 300$ Myr ago, with a present-day size approaching $100$ Mpc. Additionally, we explore mass ranges ($m &lt; 10^{-3}\,eV$) and non-minimal coupling $\xi$ ranges ($10^{-8}\,eV^{2-n} - 10^{-1}\,eV^{2-n}$) that lead to a variation $\Delta G/G_N$ within the $1\%-7\%$ range. We assume non-minimal coupling of the form $F(\phi)=1/\kappa - \xi \phi^n$, with $\kappa=8\pi G_N$ and $2 \leq n \leq 9$. Finally, we review various local physics or/and transition based proposed solutions to the Hubble tension, including ultra-late-time transitional models ($z \sim 0.01$), screened fifth-force mechanisms, and the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, which features a transition at $z \sim 2$. We discuss observational hints supporting these scenarios and the theoretical challenges they face.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this survey is to take a snapshot of the attitudes of physicists working on some of the most pressing questions in modern physics, which may be useful to sociologists and historians of science. For this study, a total of 85 completed surveys were returned out of 151 registered participants of the ``Black holes Inside and out'' conference, held in Copenhagen in 2024. The survey asked questions about some of the most contentious issues in fundamental physics, including the nature of black holes and dark energy. A number of surprising results were found. For example, some of the leading frameworks, such as the cosmological constant, cosmic inflation, or string theory - while most popular - gain less than the majority of votes from the participants. The only statement that gains majority approval (by 68\% of participants) was that the Big Bang meant ``the universe evolved from a hot dense state'', not ``an absolute beginning time''. These results provide reasons for caution in describing ideas as consensus in the scientific community when a more nuanced view may be justified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.10340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speed matters. How the masses and spins of new particles active during inflation can be read off from the statistical properties of primordial density fluctuations is well understood. However, not when the propagation speeds of the new degrees of freedom and of the curvature perturbation differ, which is the generic situation in the effective field theory of inflationary fluctuations. Here we use bootstrap techniques to find exact analytical solutions for primordial 2-,3- and 4-point correlators in this context. We focus on the imprints of a heavy relativistic scalar coupled to the curvature perturbation that propagates with a reduced speed of sound $c_s$, hence strongly breaking de Sitter boosts. We show that akin to the de Sitter invariant setup, primordial correlation functions can be deduced by acting with suitable weight-shifting operators on the four-point function of a conformally coupled field induced by the exchange of the massive scalar. However, this procedure requires the analytical continuation of this seed correlator beyond the physical domain implied by momentum conservation. We bootstrap this seed correlator in the extended domain from first principles, starting from the boundary equation that it satisfies due to locality. We further impose unitarity, reflected in cosmological cutting rules, and analyticity, by demanding regularity in the collinear limit of the four-point configuration, in order to find the unique solution. Equipped with this, we unveil that heavy particles that are lighter than $H/c_s$ leave smoking gun imprints in the bispectrum in the form of resonances in the squeezed limit, a phenomenon that we call the low speed collider. We characterise the overall shape of the signal as well as its unusual logarithmic mass dependence, both vividly distinct from previously identified signatures of heavy fields.

Abstract: We investigate lensing reconstruction using the clustered galaxy distribution as a source field, using both the traditional cosmic microwave background quadratic estimator and a shear-only estimator. We calculate the expected signal-to-noise ratio of the cross power spectrum of such reconstructions with cosmic shear measurements for an LSST-like galaxy survey. Modeling the galaxy field as a Gaussian random field, we find that there is substantial clustering signal in the source field at angular scales substantially smaller than those typically used by CMB reconstructions. The expected signal-to-noise for cross-correlations in LSST from cosmic shear is $\sim$60 in the presence of shape noise, while cross correlating with a sample-variance limited mass map would have signal-to-noise in the hundreds. This type of cross-correlation could be used as a way to identify systematic errors in lensing studies and is just one example of many possible higher order correlations in galaxy surveys that may contain substantial cosmological information.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the influence of matter fields on the geometry of black hole horizons within higher-order gravity theories. Focusing on five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity at a critical coupling constant ($\alpha = -3/(4\Lambda)$), we demonstrate that while vacuum solutions permit horizons with arbitrary geometry, the introduction of a scalar field imposes constraints. Specifically, the scalar hair restricts the horizon to manifolds of constant scalar curvature, extending beyond the Thurston geometries (Sol, Nil, $SL_2R$) previously identified. We prove a uniqueness theorem for the scalar-coupled solutions, showing that the metric and scalar field must adopt specific forms, with the horizon geometry solely required to satisfy the constant curvature condition. Furthermore, analogous results are established in generic $F(R)$ gravity, where arbitrary horizons with constant scalar curvature emerge at critical couplings, exemplified by $F(R) = R + \lambda R^2 - 2\Lambda$ with $\lambda = -1/(8\Lambda)$. These findings highlight a probably universal feature: critical couplings in higher-order gravity enable unconstrained horizon geometries in vacuum, while matter fields introduce geometric restrictions. This work deepens understanding of the interplay between matter, higher-curvature corrections, and black hole horizon geometry.</description>

      <title>Local Operator Algebras of Charged States in Gauge Theory and Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Powerful techniques have been developed in quantum field theory that employ algebras of local operators, yet local operators cannot create physical charged states in gauge theory or physical nonzero-energy states in perturbative quantum gravity. A common method to obtain physical operators out of local ones is to dress the latter using appropriate Wilson lines. This procedure destroys locality, it must be done case by case for each charged operator in the algebra, and it rapidly becomes cumbersome, particularly in perturbative quantum gravity.
  In this paper we present an alternative approach to the definition of physical charged operators: we define an automorphism that maps an algebra of local charged operators into a (non-local) algebra of physical charged operators. The automorphism is described by a formally unitary intertwiner mapping the exact BRS operator associated to the gauge symmetry into its quadratic part.
  The existence of an automorphism between local operators and the physical ones, describing charged states, allows to retain many of the results derived in local operator algebras and extend them to the physical-but-nonlocal algebra of charged operators as we discuss in some simple applications of our construction. We also discuss a formal construction of physical states and possible obstructions to it.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave inference of star cluster properties from intermediate-mass black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation ground-based gravitational wave observatories will observe mergers of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) out to high redshift. Such IMBHs can form through runaway tidal encounters in the cores of dense stellar clusters. In this paper, we ask if the gravitational wave observation of a single merger event between two IMBHs, occurring in the aftermath of the coalescence of the clusters in which they formed, can be used to infer the properties of their host clusters, such as mass, redshift, and half-mass radius. We implement an astrophysically motivated analytic model for cluster evolution and IMBH growth, and we perform IMBH binary parameter estimation using a network of three next-generation detectors. We find that inferring the structural properties of clusters in this way is challenging due to model degeneracy. However, the posteriors on the cluster formation redshifts have relatively narrow peaks, and it may still be possible to infer the cluster formation history by measuring a whole population of IMBH binary merger events.</description>

      <title>Bananas are Unparticles: Differential Equations and Cosmological Bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish an exact correspondence between tree-level cosmological correlators with unparticle exchange (at integer scaling dimensions) and banana diagrams of conformally coupled scalars. This duality enables us to systematically solve the governing differential equations through the application of shift relations and de Sitter bootstrap techniques. Furthermore, we adapt a dimensional regularization scheme to cosmological correlators, demonstrating how renormalization conditions uniquely fix the regularization prescription. Our results provide new insights into the analytic structure of higher-order loop corrections to inflationary correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Association of 220 PeV Neutrino KM3-230213A with Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14471v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the KM3NeT Collaboration announced the detection of a 220 PeV neutrino from the celestial coordinates RA=94.3\degree~ and Dec=-7.8\degree~ on 13 February 2023 at 01:16:47 UTC \cite{KM3NeT:2025npi}. The source for this extra-ordinary cosmic neutrino, designated KM3-230213A, is not identified yet but there has been speculation that it might be associated with a gamma-ray burst GRB~090401B \cite{Amelino-Camelia:2025lqn}. The purpose of this report is to search the association of this 220 PeV neutrino with potential GRB sources from a more general consideration of Lorentz invariance violation (LV) without predefined LV scale. We try to associate this extra-ordinary neutrino with potential GRBs within angular separation of 1\degree, 3\degree~ and 5\degree~ respectively and the results are listed in Table 1. We find the constraints $E_{\rm{LV}}\leq 5.3\times 10^{18}$~GeV for subluminal LV violation and $E_{\rm{LV}}\leq 5.6\times 10^{19}$~GeV for superluminal LV violation if KM3-230213A is a GRB neutrino.</description>
