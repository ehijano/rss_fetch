      <title>A Topology-Based Machine Learning Model Decisively Outperforms Flux Balance Analysis in Predicting Metabolic Gene Essentiality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: The rational identification of essential genes is a cornerstone of drug discovery, yet standard computational methods like Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) often struggle to produce accurate predictions in complex, redundant metabolic networks. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that the topological structure of a metabolic network contains a more robust predictive signal for essentiality than functional simulations alone. Methodology: To test this hypothesis, we developed a machine learning pipeline by first constructing a reaction-reaction graph from the e_coli_core metabolic model. Graph-theoretic features, including betweenness centrality and PageRank, were engineered to describe the topological role of each gene. A RandomForestClassifier was trained on these features, and its performance was rigorously benchmarked against a standard FBA single-gene deletion analysis using a curated ground-truth dataset. Results: Our machine learning model achieved a solid predictive performance with an F1-Score of 0.400 (Precision: 0.412, Recall: 0.389). In profound contrast, the standard FBA baseline method failed to correctly identify any of the known essential genes, resulting in an F1-Score of 0.000. Conclusion: This work demonstrates that a "structure-first" machine learning approach is a significantly superior strategy for predicting gene essentiality compared to traditional FBA on the E. coli core network. By learning the topological signatures of critical network roles, our model successfully overcomes the known limitations of simulation-based methods in handling biological redundancy. While the performance of topology-only models is expected to face challenges on more complex genome-scale networks, this validated framework represents a significant step forward and highlights the primacy of network architecture in determining biological function.</description>

      <title>Maximum likelihood estimation of log-affine models using detailed-balanced reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental question in the field of molecular computation is what computational tasks a biochemical system can carry out. In this work, we focus on the problem of finding the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for log-affine models. We revisit a construction due to Gopalkrishnan of a mass-action system with the MLE as its unique positive steady state, which is based on choosing a basis for the kernel of the design matrix of the model. We extend this construction to allow for any finite spanning set of the kernel, and explore how the choice of spanning set influences the dynamics of the resulting network, including the existence of boundary steady states, the deficiency of the network, and the rate of convergence. In particular, we prove that using a Markov basis as the spanning set guarantees global stability of the MLE steady state.</description>

      <title>Optimal Inference of Asynchronous Boolean Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02634v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The network inference problem arises in biological research when one needs to quantitatively choose the best protein-interaction model for explaining a phenotype. The diverse nature of the data and nonlinear dynamics pose significant challenges in the search for the best methodology. In addition to balancing fit and model complexity, computational efficiency must be considered. In this paper, we present a novel approach that finds a solution that fits the observed dataset and otherwise a minimal number of unobserved datasets. We present algorithms for computing Boolean networks that optimally satisfy this criterion, and allow for asynchronicity network dynamics. Furthermore, we show that using our methodology a solution to the pseudo-time inference problem, which is pertinent to the analysis of single-cell data, can be intertwined with network inference. Results are described for real and simulated datasets.</description>
