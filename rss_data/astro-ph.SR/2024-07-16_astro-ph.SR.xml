      <title>Epsilon Sagittarii: An Extreme Rapid Rotator with a Decretion Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report high-precision multi-wavelength linear-polarization observations of the bright B9 (or A0) star $\epsilon$ Sagittarii. The polarization shows the distinctive wavelength dependence expected for a rapidly rotating star. Analysis of the polarization data reveals an angular rotation rate $\omega$ (= $\Omega/\Omega_{crit})$ of 0.995 or greater, the highest yet measured for a star in our galaxy. An additional wavelength-independent polarization component is attributed to electron scattering in a low-density edge-on gas disk that also produces the narrow absorption components seen in the spectrum. Several properties of the star (polarization due to a disk, occasional weak H$\alpha$ emission, and multiple periodicities seen in space photometry) resemble those of Be stars, but the level of activity in all cases is much lower than that of typical Be stars. The stellar properties are inconsistent with single rotating-star evolutionary tracks, indicating that it is most likely a product of binary interaction. The star is an excellent candidate for observation by interferometry, optical spectropolarimetry to detect the \"{O}hman effect, and UV polarimetry; any of which would allow its extreme rotation to be tested and its stellar properties to be refined.</description>

      <title>A flux-independent increase in outflows prior to the emergence of active regions on the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging active regions are associated with convective flows on the spatial scale and lifetimes of supergranules. To understand how these flows are involved in the formation of active regions, we aim to identify where active regions emerge in the supergranulation flow pattern. We computed supergranulation scale flow maps at the surface for all active regions in the Solar Dynamics Observatory Helioseismic Emerging Active Region Survey. We classified each of the active regions into four bins, based on the amplitude of their average surface flow divergence at emergence. We then averaged the flow divergence over the active regions in each bin as a function of time. We also considered a corresponding set of control regions. We found that, on average, the flow divergence increases during the day prior to emergence at a rate independent of the amount of flux that emerges. By subtracting the averaged flow divergence of the control regions, we found that active region emergence is associated with a remaining converging flow at 0.5-1 days prior to emergence. This remnant flow, $\Delta \, \mathrm{div} \, \mathbf{v_h} = (-4.9 \pm 1.7) \times 10^{-6}$ 1/s, corresponds to a flow speed of 10-20 m/s (an order of magnitude less than supergranulation flows) out to a radius of about 10 Mm. We show that these observational results are qualitatively supported by simulations of a small bipole emerging through the near-surface convective layers of the Sun. The question remains whether these flows are driving the emergence, or are caused by the emergence.</description>

      <title>Searching for stellar CMEs in the Praesepe and Pleiades clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the Sun, the energetic, erupting phenomena of flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) often occur together. While space-based photometry has revealed frequent white-light flares for vast numbers of stars, only a handful of coronal mass ejections have been detected. Space-based photometry reveals the timing and detailed structure of flares. To detect CME signatures, however, optical spectroscopy is essential, as the ejected plasma can be detected by Doppler-shifted emission bumps in the Balmer-regions. We present a dedicated ground-based multi-object spectroscopic observations of the young, nearby Praesepe (600 Myr) and Pleiades (135 Myr) clusters to detect CMEs and flares parallel with the observations of Praesepe by the TESS satellite. During the 10 days of overlapping observations, we did not find any obvious signs of CMEs or flares in the H$\alpha$ region.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an Extremely r-process-enhanced Thin-disk Star with [Eu/H] = +0.78</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly r-process-enhanced stars are rare and usually metal-poor ([Fe/H] &lt; - 1.0), and mainly populate the Milky Way halo and dwarf galaxies. This study presents the discovery of a relatively bright (V = 12.72), highly r-process-enhanced (r-II) star ([Eu/Fe] = +1.32, [Ba/Eu] = - 0.95), LAMOST J020623.21 + 494127.9. This star was selected from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) medium-resolution (R ~ 7500) spectroscopic survey; follow-up high-resolution (R ~ 25,000) observations were conducted with the High Optical Resolution Spectrograph (HORuS) installed on the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). The stellar parameters (${T_{\rm eff}}$ = 4130 K, $\rm log\,g $ = 1.52, $ \rm[Fe/H] $ = $ - $0.54, $\xi$ = 1.80 $ \rm{km\,{s^{-1}}} $) have been inferred taking into account non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects. The abundances of [Ce/Fe], [Pr/Fe], and [Nd/Fe] are +0.19, +0.65 and +0.64, respectively, relatively low compared to the Solar r-process pattern normalized to Eu. This star has a high metallicity ([Fe/H] = - 0.54) compared to most other highly r-process-enhanced stars, and has the highest measured abundance ratio of Eu to H ([Eu/H] = +0.78). It is classified as a thin-disk star based on its kinematics, and does not appear to belong to any known stream or dwarf galaxy.</description>

      <title>Magnetogram-to-Magnetogram: Generative Forecasting of Solar Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating the solar magnetic field is crucial to understand the physical processes in the solar interior as well as their effects on the interplanetary environment. We introduce a novel method to predict the evolution of the solar line-of-sight (LoS) magnetogram using image-to-image translation with Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). Our approach combines "computer science metrics" for image quality and "physics metrics" for physical accuracy to evaluate model performance. The results indicate that DDPMs are effective in maintaining the structural integrity, the dynamic range of solar magnetic fields, the magnetic flux and other physical features such as the size of the active regions, surpassing traditional persistence models, also in flaring situation. We aim to use deep learning not only for visualisation but as an integrative and interactive tool for telescopes, enhancing our understanding of unexpected physical events like solar flares. Future studies will aim to integrate more diverse solar data to refine the accuracy and applicability of our generative model.</description>

      <title>Population synthesis of Thorne-\.Zytkow objects: Rejuvenated donors and unexplored progenitors in the common envelope formation channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Common envelope evolution of a massive star and a neutron star companion has two possible outcomes: formation of a short-period binary (a potential gravitational wave source progenitor) or a merger of the massive star with the neutron star. If the binary merges, a structure with a neutron star core surrounded by a large diffuse envelope, a so-called Thorne-\.Zytkow object (T\.ZO), may form. The predicted appearance of this hypothetical class of star is very similar to red supergiants, making observational identification difficult.
  Aims. Our objective is to understand the properties of systems that are potential T\.ZO progenitors, e.g., binary systems that enter a common envelope phase with a neutron star companion. We also aim to distinguish those that have been through a previous stable mass transfer phase, which can rejuvenate the accretor. We estimate the number of T\.ZOs in the Milky Way and assess the impact of uncertainties in their formation.
  Methods. We use the rapid population synthesis code COMPAS at Solar metallicity and with common envelope efficiency parameter set to unity to determine the population demographics of T\.ZOs. We use one-dimensional evolutionary T\.ZO models from the literature to determine a fit for T\.ZO lifetime in order to estimate the current number of T\.ZOs in the Galaxy as well as to assess core disruption during the merger.
  Results. We explore the progenitors in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, calculate formation rates, and investigate kinematics of the progenitor stars. We find that the vast majority ($\approx 92\%$) of T\.ZO progenitors in our population have experienced mass transfer and become rejuvenated before their formation event. Using a constant star formation rate we estimate $\approx 2\times 10 ^{-4}$ T\.ZOs per $M_\odot$ in our Galaxy, corresponding to $\approx 5\pm 1$ T\.ZOs in the Milky Way at present.</description>

      <title>FitteR for Accretion ProPErties of T Tauri stars (FRAPPE): A new approach to use Class III spectra to derive stellar and accretion properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of the stellar and accretion properties of classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) require comparison with photospheric spectral templates. Here we aim at expanding the currently available grid of wide-wavelength coverage observed spectra of non-accreting stars with additional new spectra and an interpolation method that allows us to obtain a continuous grid of low resolution spectra ranging from spectral type G8 to M9.5, while also mitigating observational uncertainties. This interpolated grid is then implemented in the self-consistent method to derive stellar and accretion properties of CTTS. With the new templates, we aim to estimate a lower limit on the accretion luminosities that can be obtained through a study of the UV excess emission using observed templates. We analyse the molecular photospheric features present in the VLT/X-Shooter spectra of the targets to perform a spectral classification, including estimates of their extinction. We apply a non-parametric fitting method to the full grid of observed templates to obtain an interpolated grid of templates. We use the uncertainties on our interpolated grid to estimate a lower limit on the accretion luminosity that we can measure with this method. We find that the measurable accretion luminosities ranges from $\sim 2.7$ dex lower than the stellar luminosity in M5.5 stars to $\sim 1.3$ dex lower for G8 stars. For young stars with masses of $\sim 1M_{\odot}$ and ages of 3-6 Myr this limit translates into an observational limit of mass accretion rate on the order of $10^{-10} \rm M_{\odot}/yr$. The implementation of an interpolated grid of observed templates allows us to better disentangle degenerate solutions, leading to a more reliable estimate of accretion rates in young accreting stars.</description>

      <title>Additional Doppler Monitoring Corroborates HAT-P-11 c as a Planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2010, Bakos and collaborators discovered a Neptune-sized planet transiting the K-dwarf HAT-P-11 every five days. Later in 2018, Yee and collaborators reported an additional Jovian-mass companion on a nine year orbit based on a decade of Doppler monitoring. The eccentric outer giant HAT-P-11c may be responsible for the peculiar polar orbit of the inner planet HAT-P-11b. However, Basilicata et al. (2024) recently suggested that the HAT-P-11c Doppler signal could be caused by stellar activity. In this research note, we extend the Yee et al. (2018) Doppler time series by six years. The combined dataset spanning 17 years covers nearly two orbits of the outer planet. Importantly, we observe two periastron passages of planet c and do not observe a coherent activity signature. Together with the previously reported astrometric acceleration of HAT-P-11 from Hipparcos and Gaia, we believe there is strong evidence for HAT-P-11c as a bona fide planet.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars and the dense matter equation of state: from microscopic theory to macroscopic observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The past years have witnessed tremendous progress in understanding the properties of neutron stars and of the dense matter in their cores, made possible by electromagnetic observations of neutron stars and the detection of gravitational waves from their mergers. These observations provided novel constraints on neutron-star structure, that is intimately related to the properties of dense neutron-rich matter described by the nuclear equation of state. Nevertheless, constraining the equation of state over the wide range of densities probed by astrophysical observations is still challenging, as the physics involved is very broad and the system spans many orders of magnitude in densities. Here, we review theoretical approaches to calculate and model the neutron-star equation of state in various regimes of densities, and discuss the related consequent properties of neutron stars. We describe how the equation of state can be calculated from nuclear interactions that are constrained and benchmarked by nuclear experiments. We review neutron-star observations, with particular emphasis on information provided by gravitational-wave signals and electromagnetic observations. Finally, we discuss future challenges and opportunities in the field.</description>

      <title>AstroMLab 1: Who Wins Astronomy Jeopardy!?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of proprietary and open-weights large language models using the first astronomy-specific benchmarking dataset. This dataset comprises 4,425 multiple-choice questions curated from the Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, covering a broad range of astrophysical topics. Our analysis examines model performance across various astronomical subfields and assesses response calibration, crucial for potential deployment in research environments. Claude-3.5-Sonnet outperforms competitors by up to 4.6 percentage points, achieving 85.0% accuracy. For proprietary models, we observed a universal reduction in cost every 3-to-12 months to achieve similar score in this particular astronomy benchmark. Open-source models have rapidly improved, with LLaMA-3-70b (80.6%) and Qwen-2-72b (77.7%) now competing with some of the best proprietary models. We identify performance variations across topics, with non-English-focused models generally struggling more in exoplanet-related fields, stellar astrophysics, and instrumentation related questions. These challenges likely stem from less abundant training data, limited historical context, and rapid recent developments in these areas. This pattern is observed across both open-weights and proprietary models, with regional dependencies evident, highlighting the impact of training data diversity on model performance in specialized scientific domains. Top-performing models demonstrate well-calibrated confidence, with correlations above 0.9 between confidence and correctness, though they tend to be slightly underconfident. The development for fast, low-cost inference of open-weights models presents new opportunities for affordable deployment in astronomy. The rapid progress observed suggests that LLM-driven research in astronomy may become feasible in the near future.</description>

      <title>Toward an efficient second-order method for computing the surface gravitational potential on spherical-polar meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical accretion discs that carry a significant mass compared with their central object are subject to the effect of self-gravity. In the context of circumstellar discs, this can, for instance, cause fragmentation of the disc gas, and -- under suitable conditions -- lead to the direct formation of gas-giant planets. If one wants to study these phenomena, the disc's gravitational potential needs to be obtained by solving the Poisson equation. This requires to specify suitable boundary conditions. In the case of a spherical-polar computational mesh, a standard multipole expansion for obtaining boundary values is not practicable. We hence compare two alternative methods for overcoming this limitation. The first method is based on a known Green's function expansion (termed "CCGF") of the potential, while the second (termed "James' method") uses a surface screening mass approach with a suitable discrete Green's function. We demonstrate second-order convergence for both methods and test the weak scaling behaviour when using thousands of computational cores. Overall, James' method is found superior owing to its favourable algorithmic complexity of $\sim \mathcal{O}(n^3)$ compared with the $\sim\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ scaling of the CCGF method.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Kinematics in Young Clusters: The {\lambda} Ori Cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Most stars form in clusters or associations but only a small number of these groups are expected to remain bound for longer than a few Myr. Once star formation has ended and the molecular gas around young stellar objects has been expelled via feedback processes, most initially bound young clusters lose the majority of their binding mass and begin to disperse into the Galactic field. Aims. This process can be investigated by analysing the structure and kinematic trends in nearby young clusters, particularly expansion, the tell-tale sign that a cluster is no longer gravitationally bound but is dispersing into the field. Methods. We combine Gaia DR3 5-parameter astrometry with calibrated radial velocities for members of the nearby young cluster {\lambda} Ori (Collinder 69). Results. We characterise the plane-of-sky substructure of the cluster using the Q-parameter and Angular Dispersion parameter. We find evidence that the cluster contains significant substructure, but that this is preferentially located away from the central cluster core, which is smooth and likely remains bound. We find strong evidence for expansion in {\lambda} Ori in the plane-of-sky using a number of metrics, but also that the trends are asymmetric at the 5{\sigma} significance level. with the maximum rate of expansion being directed nearly parallel to the Galactic plane. We then invert the maximum rate of expansion of 0.144^{+0.003}_{-0.003} kms^{-1}pc^{-1} to give an expansion timescale of 6.944^{+0.148}_{-0.142} Myr, which is slightly larger than typical literature age estimates for the cluster. We also find asymmetry in the velocity dispersion, potential signatures of cluster rotation, and calculate kinematic ages for individual cluster members by tracing their motion back in time to their closest approach to the cluster center.</description>

      <title>Solar Models and Astrophysical S-factors Constrained by Helioseismic Results and Updated Neutrino Fluxes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ratio of metal abundance to hydrogen abundance of the solar photosphere, $(Z/X)_{s}$, has been revised several times. Standard solar models, based on these revised solar abundances, are in disagreement with seismically inferred results. Recently, Magg et al. introduced a new value for $(Z/X)_{s}$, which is still in debate in the community. The solar abundance problem or solar modeling problem remains a topic of ongoing debate. We constructed rotating solar models in accordance with various abundance scales where the effects of convection overshoot and enhanced diffusion were included. Among these models, those utilizing Magg's abundance scale exhibit superior sound-speed and density profiles compared to models using other abundance scales. Additionally, they reproduce the observed frequency separation ratios $r_{02}$ and $r_{13}$. These models also match the seismically inferred surface helium abundance and convection zone depth within $1\sigma$ level. Furthermore, the calculated neutrino fluxes from these models agree with detected ones at the level of $1\sigma$. We found that neutrino fluxes and density profile are influenced by nuclear reactions, allowing us to use the combination of detected neutrino fluxes and seismically inferred density for diagnosing astrophysical $S$-factors. This diagnostic approach shows that $S_{11}$ may be underestimated by $2\%$, while $S_{33}$ may be overestimated by about $3\%$ in previous determinations. The $S$-factors favored by updated neutrino fluxes and helioseismic results can lead to significant improvements in solar models.</description>

      <title>Exploring the unexpected: Disharmonized harmonic pulsation modes in high-amplitude $\delta$ Scuti stars</title>

Abstract: Harmonics are a ubiquitous feature across various pulsating stars. They are traditionally viewed as mere replicas of the independent primary pulsation modes and have thus been excluded from asteroseismological models. Recent research, however, has uncovered a significant discrepancy: in high-amplitude $\delta$ Scuti (HADS) stars, harmonics exhibit uncorrelated variations in amplitude and frequency relative to their independent primary pulsation modes. The nature of these disharmonized harmonics is a question of critical importance. In our study we analysed five triple-mode HADS stars observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and discovered some pervasive patterns of disharmonized harmonics in both the fundamental ($f_0$) and first overtone ($f_1$) pulsation modes. Intriguingly, through an in-depth frequency interaction analysis of V1393 Cen, we identified $2f_1$ as an independent pulsation mode, distinct from $f_1$, and identified it as the progenitor of the frequency variations observed in $3f_1$, $4f_1$, $5f_1$, and $6f_1$. Similar behaviour can be found in DO CMi and GSC 06047-00749, in which $2f_1$ and $3f_1$ are the independent pulsation modes, respectively. Notably, we found an interesting pattern when decomposing the harmonics that might suggest a generation process of harmonics. These findings serve as a new window on the research of harmonics, which remains a hidden corner of contemporary asteroseismology.</description>

      <title>MUSE spectroscopy of the high abundance discrepancy planetary nebula NGC 6153</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (Abridged) The Abundance Discrepancy problem in planetary nebulae (PNe) has long puzzled astronomers. NGC6153, with its high Abundance Discrepancy Factor (ADF~10), provides an opportunity to understand the chemical structure and ionisation processes by constructing detailed emission line maps and examining variations in electron temperature and density. We used the MUSE spectrograph to acquire IFU data covering the wavelength range 4600-9300 \AA\ with a spatial sampling of 0.2 arcsec and spectral resolutions ranging from R = 1600-3500. We created emission line maps for 60 lines and two continuum regions. We developed a tailored methodology for the analysis of the data, including correction for recombination contributions to auroral lines and the contributions of different plasma phases. Our analysis confirmed the presence of a low-temperature plasma component in NGC6153. We find that electron temperatures derived from recombination line/continuum diagnostics are significantly lower than those derived from collisionally excited lines diagnostics. Ionic chemical abundance maps were constructed, considering the weight of the cold plasma phase in the HI emission. Adopting this approach, we found ionic abundances that could be up to 0.2 dex lower for those derived from CELs and up to 1.1 dex higher for those derived from RLs than in the case of an homogeneous HI emission. The Abundance Contrast Factor (ACF) between both plasma components was defined, with values, on average, 0.9 dex higher than the ADF. Different methods for calculating ionisation correction factors (ICFs) yielded consistent results. Our findings emphasize that accurate chemical abundance determinations in high-ADF PNe must account for multiple plasma phases.</description>

      <title>Direct Imaging of a Prolonged Plasma/Current Sheet and Quasiperiodic Magnetic Reconnection on the Sun</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is widely believed to be the fundamental process in the solar atmosphere that underlies magnetic energy release and particle acceleration. This process is responsible for the onset of solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and other explosive events (e.g., jets). Here, we report direct imaging of a prolonged plasma/current sheet along with quasiperiodic magnetic reconnection in the solar corona using ultra-high-resolution observations from the 1.6-meter Goode Solar Telescope (GST) at BBSO and Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA). The current sheet appeared near a null point in the fan-spine topology and persisted over an extended period (~20 hours). The length and apparent width of the current sheet were about 6 arcsec and 2 arcsec respectively, and the plasma temperature was ~10-20 MK. We observed quasiperiodic plasma inflows and outflows (bidirectional jets with plasmoids) at the reconnection site/current sheet. Furthermore, quasiperiodic reconnection at the long-lasting current sheet produced recurrent eruptions (small flares and jets) and contributed significantly to the recurrent impulsive heating of the active region. Direct imaging of a plasma/current sheet and recurrent null-point reconnection for such an extended period has not been reported previously. These unprecedented observations provide compelling evidence that supports the universal model for solar eruptions (i.e., the breakout model) and have implications for impulsive heating of active regions by recurrent reconnection near null points. The prolonged and sustained reconnection for about 20 hours at the breakout current sheet provides new insights into the dynamics and energy release processes in the solar corona.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Transition Energy Measurements of Neon-like Fe XVII Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08395v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We improve by a factor of 4-20 the energy accuracy of the strongest soft X-ray transitions of Fe XVII ions by resonantly exciting them in an electron beam ion trap with a monochromatic beam at the P04 beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron facility. By simultaneously tracking instantaneous photon-energy fluctuations with a high-resolution photoelectron spectrometer, we minimize systematic uncertainties down to 10-15 meV, or velocity equivalent $\pm\sim$5 km s$^{-1}$ in their rest energies, substantially improving our knowledge of this key astrophysical ion. Our large-scale configuration-interaction computations include more than four million relativistic configurations and agree with the experiment at a level without precedent for a 10-electron system. Thereby, theoretical uncertainties for interelectronic correlations become far smaller than those of quantum electrodynamics (QED) corrections. The present QED benchmark strengthens our trust in future calculations of many other complex atomic ions of interest to astrophysics, plasma physics, and for the development of optical clocks with highly charged ions.</description>

      <title>Bumpy Superluminous Supernovae Powered by Magnetar-star Binary Engine</title>

Abstract: Wolf-Rayet stars in close binary systems can be tidally spun up by their companions, potentially leaving behind fast-spinning highly-magnetized neutron stars, known as ``magnetars", after core collapse. These newborn magnetars can transfer rotational energy into heating and accelerating the ejecta, producing hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). In this {\em{Letter}}, we propose that the magnetar wind of the newborn magnetar could significantly evaporate its companion star, typically a main-sequence or helium star, if the binary system is not disrupted by the {abrupt mass loss and} SN kick. The subsequent heating and acceleration of the evaporated star material along with the SN ejecta by the magnetar wind can produce a post-peak bump in the SLSN lightcurve. Our model can reproduce the primary peaks and post-peak bumps of four example observed multiband SLSN lightcurves, revealing that the mass of the evaporated material could be $\sim0.4-0.6\,M_\odot$ if the material is hydrogen-rich. {We propose that the magnetar could induce strongly enhanced evaporation from its companion star near the pericenter if the orbit of the post-SN binary is highly eccentric, ultimately generating multiple post-peak bumps in the SLSN lightcurves. This ``magnetar-star binary engine" model may offer a possible explanation for the evolution of polarization, along with the origin and velocity broadening of late-time hydrogen or helium broad spectral features observed in some bumpy SLSNe.} The diversity in the lightcurves and spectra of SLSNe may be attributed to the wide variety of companion stars and post-SN binary systems.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Diffuse Molecular Media with Non-ideal Magnetohydrodynamics and Consistent Thermochemistry: Numerical Simulations and Dynamic Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulent diffuse molecular clouds can exhibit complicated morphologies caused by the interactions among radiation, chemistry, fluids, and fields. We performed full 3D simulations for turbulent diffuse molecular interstellar media, featuring time-dependent non-equilibrium thermochemistry co-evolved with magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Simulation results exhibit the relative abundances of key chemical species (e.g., C, CO, OH) vary by more than one order of magnitude for the "premature" epoch of chemical evolution ($t\lesssim 2\times 10^5~{\rm yr}$). Various simulations are also conducted to study the impacts of physical parameters. Non-ideal MHD effects are essential in shaping the behavior of gases, and strong magnetic fields ($\sim 10~\mu{\rm G}$) tend to inhibit vigorous compressions and thus reduce the fraction of warm gases ($T\gtrsim 10^2~{\rm K}$). Thermodynamical and chemical conditions of the gas are sensitive to modulation by dynamic conditions, especially the energy injection by turbulence. Chemical features, including ionization (cosmic ray and diffuse interstellar radiation), would not directly affect the turbulence power spectra. Nonetheless, their effects are prominent in the distribution profiles of temperatures and gas densities. Comprehensive observations are necessary and useful to eliminate the degeneracies of physical parameters and constrain the properties of diffuse molecular clouds with confidence.</description>
