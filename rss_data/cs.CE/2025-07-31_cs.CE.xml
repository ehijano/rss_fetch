      <title>Axioms for Model Fidelity Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital engineering has transformed the design and development process. However, the utility of digital engineering is fundamentally dependent on the assumption that a simulation provides information consistent with reality. This relationship is described as model fidelity. Despite the widespread use of the term, existing definitions of model fidelity often lack formal rigor in practical application, which leaves ambiguity in how this similarity should be evaluated. This paper presents seven fundamental axioms to aid the development of future fidelity evaluation frameworks. An example of a ground vehicle model is used under an existing fidelity evaluation framework to observe the applicability of these axioms. In addition, these axioms are used as a reference point for considering future opportunities in future work related to model fidelity.</description>

      <title>An Information Bottleneck Asset Pricing Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have garnered significant attention in financial asset pricing, due to their strong capacity for modeling complex nonlinear relationships within financial data. However, sophisticated models are prone to over-fitting to the noise information in financial data, resulting in inferior performance. To address this issue, we propose an information bottleneck asset pricing model that compresses data with low signal-to-noise ratios to eliminate redundant information and retain the critical information for asset pricing. Our model imposes constraints of mutual information during the nonlinear mapping process. Specifically, we progressively reduce the mutual information between the input data and the compressed representation while increasing the mutual information between the compressed representation and the output prediction. The design ensures that irrelevant information, which is essentially the noise in the data, is forgotten during the modeling of financial nonlinear relationships without affecting the final asset pricing. By leveraging the constraints of the Information bottleneck, our model not only harnesses the nonlinear modeling capabilities of deep networks to capture the intricate relationships within financial data but also ensures that noise information is filtered out during the information compression process.</description>

      <title>Adjoint-Based Aerodynamic Shape Optimization with a Manifold Constraint Learned by Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an adjoint-based aerodynamic shape optimization framework that integrates a diffusion model trained on existing designs to learn a smooth manifold of aerodynamically viable shapes. This manifold is enforced as an equality constraint to the shape optimization problem. Central to our method is the computation of adjoint gradients of the design objectives (e.g., drag and lift) with respect to the manifold space. These gradients are derived by first computing shape derivatives with respect to conventional shape design parameters (e.g., Hicks-Henne parameters) and then backpropagating them through the diffusion model to its latent space via automatic differentiation. Our framework preserves mathematical rigor and can be integrated into existing adjoint-based design workflows with minimal modification. Demonstrated on extensive transonic RANS airfoil design cases using off-the-shelf and general-purpose nonlinear optimizers, our approach eliminates ad hoc parameter tuning and variable scaling, maintains robustness across initialization and optimizer choices, and achieves superior aerodynamic performance compared to conventional approaches. This work establishes how AI generated priors integrates effectively with adjoint methods to enable robust, high-fidelity aerodynamic shape optimization through automatic differentiation.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in Financial NLP: A Comparative Study on Financial Report Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide variety of Financial Natural Language Processing (FinNLP) tasks. However, systematic comparisons among widely used LLMs remain underexplored. Given the rapid advancement and growing influence of LLMs in financial analysis, this study conducts a thorough comparative evaluation of five leading LLMs, GPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini and DeepSeek, using 10-K filings from the 'Magnificent Seven' technology companies. We create a set of domain-specific prompts and then use three methodologies to evaluate model performance: human annotation, automated lexical-semantic metrics (ROUGE, Cosine Similarity, Jaccard), and model behavior diagnostics (prompt-level variance and across-model similarity). The results show that GPT gives the most coherent, semantically aligned, and contextually relevant answers; followed by Claude and Perplexity. Gemini and DeepSeek, on the other hand, have more variability and less agreement. Also, the similarity and stability of outputs change from company to company and over time, showing that they are sensitive to how prompts are written and what source material is used.</description>

      <title>Scientific Machine Learning with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of scientific machine learning, which originally utilized multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is increasingly adopting Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for data encoding. This shift is driven by the limitations of MLPs, including poor interpretability, fixed activation functions, and difficulty capturing localized or high-frequency features. KANs address these issues with enhanced interpretability and flexibility, enabling more efficient modeling of complex nonlinear interactions and effectively overcoming the constraints associated with conventional MLP architectures. This review categorizes recent progress in KAN-based models across three distinct perspectives: (i) data-driven learning, (ii) physics-informed modeling, and (iii) deep operator learning. Each perspective is examined through the lens of architectural design, training strategies, application efficacy, and comparative evaluation against MLP-based counterparts. By benchmarking KANs against MLPs, we highlight consistent improvements in accuracy, convergence, and spectral representation, clarifying KANs' advantages in capturing complex dynamics while learning more effectively. Finally, this review identifies critical challenges and open research questions in KAN development, particularly regarding computational efficiency, theoretical guarantees, hyperparameter tuning, and algorithm complexity. We also outline future research directions aimed at improving the robustness, scalability, and physical consistency of KAN-based frameworks.</description>

      <title>Data Readiness for Scientific AI at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines how Data Readiness for AI (DRAI) principles apply to leadership-scale scientific datasets used to train foundation models. We analyze archetypal workflows across four representative domains - climate, nuclear fusion, bio/health, and materials - to identify common preprocessing patterns and domain-specific constraints. We introduce a two-dimensional readiness framework composed of Data Readiness Levels (raw to AI-ready) and Data Processing Stages (ingest to shard), both tailored to high performance computing (HPC) environments. This framework outlines key challenges in transforming scientific data for scalable AI training, emphasizing transformer-based generative models. Together, these dimensions form a conceptual maturity matrix that characterizes scientific data readiness and guides infrastructure development toward standardized, cross-domain support for scalable and reproducible AI for science.</description>

      <title>EB-gMCR: Energy-Based Generative Modeling for Signal Unmixing and Multivariate Curve Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signal unmixing analysis decomposes data into basic patterns and is widely applied in chemical and biological research. Multivariate curve resolution (MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base patterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in understanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix factorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually unknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the scalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This study reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an energy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the smallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts from a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable gating network to retain only active components while estimating their concentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent sources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 &gt;= 0.98 and recovered the component count within 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 &gt;= 0.99 with near exact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity or nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to other instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By uniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR offers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including chemical library-driven scenarios.

      <title>Modelling and simulation of electro-mechanically coupled dielectric elastomers and myocardial tissue using smoothed finite element methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational modelling offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to experimental studies in biomedical engineering. In cardiac electro-mechanics, finite element method (FEM)-based simulations provide valuable insights into diseased tissue behaviour and the development of assistive systems such as di-electric elastomer actuators. However, the use of automatically generated tetrahedral meshes, commonly applied due to geometric complexity, often leads to numerical issues including overly stiff responses and volume locking, particularly in incompressible materials. Smoothed finite element methods (S-FEMs) offer a promising alternative by softening the stiffness matrix through gradient smoothing over defined smoothing domains. This work extends S-FEM formulations to electro-mechanically coupled problems and compares their performance against standard linear FEM. We implement and evaluate four approaches in the Abaqus environment via custom user elements: standard linear FEM, face-based S-FEM (FS-FEM), node-based S-FEM (NS-FEM), and the hybrid face/node-based S-FEM (FSNS-FEM). Two benchmark problems are studied: the electrically induced contraction of a compressible dielectric elastomer and an incompressible, orthotropic myocardial tissue sample. Reference solutions are obtained using a mesh consisting of higher-order elements. Our results demonstrate that FSNS-FEM provides the best balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, closely matching reference data. NS-FEM produces softer results, which leads to an overestimation of the true deformation. FS-FEM and standard FEM consistently exhibit overly stiff behaviour, with pronounced volume locking in the myocardial case. These findings support the potential of S-FEMs, in particular FSNS-FEM, for accurate simulation of coupled electro-mechanical behaviour in complex biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>EducationQ: Evaluating LLMs' Teaching Capabilities Through Multi-Agent Dialogue Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14928v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as educational tools, yet evaluating their teaching capabilities remains challenging due to the resource-intensive, context-dependent, and methodologically complex nature of teacher-student interactions. We introduce EducationQ, a multi-agent dialogue framework that efficiently assesses teaching capabilities through simulated dynamic educational scenarios, featuring specialized agents for teaching, learning, and evaluation. Testing 14 LLMs across major AI Organizations (OpenAI, Meta, Google, Anthropic, and others) on 1,498 questions spanning 13 disciplines and 10 difficulty levels reveals that teaching effectiveness does not correlate linearly with model scale or general reasoning capabilities - with some smaller open-source models outperforming larger commercial counterparts in teaching contexts. This finding highlights a critical gap in current evaluations that prioritize knowledge recall over interactive pedagogy. Our mixed-methods evaluation, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis and expert case studies, identifies distinct pedagogical strengths employed by top-performing models (e.g., sophisticated questioning strategies, adaptive feedback mechanisms). Human expert evaluations show 78% agreement with our automated qualitative analysis of effective teaching behaviors, validating our methodology. EducationQ demonstrates that LLMs-as-teachers require specialized optimization beyond simple scaling, suggesting next-generation educational AI prioritize targeted enhancement of specific pedagogical effectiveness.</description>

      <title>DrugMCTS: a drug repurposing framework combining multi-agent, RAG and Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07426v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated considerable potential in scientific domains such as drug repositioning. However, their effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data. To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree Search for drug repositioning. The framework employs five specialized agents tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug repositioning.</description>
