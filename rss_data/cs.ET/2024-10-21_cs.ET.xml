      <title>HyCiM: A Hybrid Computing-in-Memory QUBO Solver for General Combinatorial Optimization Problems with Inequality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computationally challenging combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) play a fundamental role in various applications. To tackle COPs, many Ising machines and Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) solvers have been proposed, which typically involve direct transformation of COPs into Ising models or equivalent QUBO forms (D-QUBO). However, when addressing COPs with inequality constraints, this D-QUBO approach introduces numerous extra auxiliary variables, resulting in a substantially larger search space, increased hardware costs, and reduced solving efficiency. In this work, we propose HyCiM, a novel hybrid computing-in-memory (CiM) based QUBO solver framework, designed to overcome aforementioned challenges. The proposed framework consists of (i) an innovative transformation method (first to our known) that converts COPs with inequality constraints into an inequality-QUBO form, thus eliminating the need of expensive auxiliary variables and associated calculations; (ii) "inequality filter", a ferroelectric FET (FeFET)-based CiM circuit that accelerates the inequality evaluation, and filters out infeasible input configurations; (iii) %When feasible solutions are detected, a FeFET-based CiM annealer that is capable of approaching global solutions of COPs via iterative QUBO computations within a simulated annealing process. The evaluation results show that HyCiM drastically narrows down the search space, eliminating $2^{100} \text{ to } 2^{2536}$ infeasible input configurations compared to the conventional D-QUBO approach.</description>

      <title>SoK: Prompt Hacking of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The safety and robustness of large language models (LLMs) based applications remain critical challenges in artificial intelligence. Among the key threats to these applications are prompt hacking attacks, which can significantly undermine the security and reliability of LLM-based systems. In this work, we offer a comprehensive and systematic overview of three distinct types of prompt hacking: jailbreaking, leaking, and injection, addressing the nuances that differentiate them despite their overlapping characteristics. To enhance the evaluation of LLM-based applications, we propose a novel framework that categorizes LLM responses into five distinct classes, moving beyond the traditional binary classification. This approach provides more granular insights into the AI's behavior, improving diagnostic precision and enabling more targeted enhancements to the system's safety and robustness.</description>

      <title>An AI Guide to Enhance Accessibility of Social Virtual Reality for Blind People</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of virtual reality (VR) has led to increased use of social VR platforms for interaction. However, these platforms lack adequate features to support blind and low vision (BLV) users, posing significant challenges in navigation, visual interpretation, and social interaction. One promising approach to these challenges is employing human guides in VR. However, this approach faces limitations with a lack of availability of humans to serve as guides, or the inability to customize the guidance a user receives from the human guide. We introduce an AI-powered guide to address these limitations. The AI guide features six personas, each offering unique behaviors and appearances to meet diverse user needs, along with visual interpretation and navigation assistance. We aim to use this AI guide in the future to help us understand BLV users' preferences for guide forms and functionalities.</description>

      <title>Enhancing In-vehicle Multiple Object Tracking Systems with Embeddable Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cognitive function of tracking multiple objects, needed in autonomous mobile vehicles, comprises object detection and their temporal association. While great progress owing to machine learning has been recently seen for elaborating the similarity matrix between the objects that have been recognized and the objects detected in a current video frame, less for the assignment problem that finally determines the temporal association, which is a combinatorial optimization problem. Here we show an in-vehicle multiple object tracking system with a flexible assignment function for tracking through multiple long-term occlusion events. To solve the flexible assignment problem formulated as a nondeterministic polynomial time-hard problem, the system relies on an embeddable Ising machine based on a quantum-inspired algorithm called simulated bifurcation. Using a vehicle-mountable computing platform, we demonstrate a realtime system-wide throughput (23 frames per second on average) with the enhanced functionality.</description>

      <title>Not Sure Your Car Withstands Cyberwarfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data and derived information about target victims has always been key for successful attacks, both during historical wars and modern cyber wars. Ours turns out to be an era in which modern cars generate a plethora of data about their drivers, and such data could be extremely attractive for offenders. This paper seeks to assess how well modern cars protect their drivers' data. It pursues its goal at a requirement level by analysing the gaps of the privacy policies of chief automakers such as BMW and Mercedes with respect to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It is found that both brands are still imprecise about how they comply with a number of GDPR articles, hence compliance often results non-verifiable. Most importantly, while BMW exhibits slightly broader compliance, both brands still fail to comply with a number of relevant articles of the regulation. An interpretation of these findings is a non-negligible likelihood that your car may turn against you should cyberwarfare break out.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Impact of AR-Assisted Warnings on Roadway Workers' Stress Under Different Workload Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent data from the Federal Highway Administration highlights an alarming increase in fatalities and injuries in roadway work zones, emphasizing the need for enhanced worker safety measures. This study addresses this concern by evaluating stress levels among roadway workers equipped with AR-assisted multi-sensory warning technology during varying work intensities. The research leverages a high-fidelity Virtual Reality environment to simulate realistic work scenarios, enabling safe evaluation of high-risk situations. Unlike previous studies focusing on external factors, this research investigates the internal physiological impact on workers. Utilizing wearable sensors, the study collected physiological data, including photoplethysmography (PPG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and skin temperature (ST), to assess stress levels continuously and non-invasively. Our findings from 18 participants reveal significant differences between light- and medium-intensity activities in heart rate variability metrics. These metrics commonly used to assess autonomic nervous system function and stress levels, included mean heart rate, NN50, pNN50, and HF-HRV. By examining the relationship between AR-enabled warnings, work intensity, and stress levels, the study contributes to enhancing worker safety and well-being. The proposed methodology offers potential for active stress monitoring in the field, contributing to enhanced safety practices and worker productivity in construction sites. By providing real-time physiological data, this approach enables informed stress management and more effective hazard warning systems in roadway work zones. This research bridges a gap in understanding the physiological impacts of AR-assisted warnings on roadway workers. The insights gained from this study can inform future safety interventions and guide the development of more effective warning systems.</description>

      <title>Dyna-5G: A Dynamic, Flexible, and Self-Organizing 5G Network for M2M Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present Dyna-5G, a dynamic, self-organizing 5G New Radio (5G-NR) network designed for massive Machine-to-Machine (M2M) networks. Traditional 5G NR networks, characterized by their centralized architecture, face challenges in supporting applications that require dynamic, decentralized communication, such as autonomous vehicles and drone swarms for emergency responses. These scenarios often suffer from the centralized model's single point of failure, undermining the reliability required in critical and fully autonomous applications. Dyna-5G addresses these challenges by allowing each device in the network to function as either part of the Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core Network, or as User Equipment (UE), thus maintaining network functionality even when conventional infrastructure components are compromised. Dyna-5G has built-in mechanisms carefully designed specifically for M2M networks, such as failure-recovery and ad-hoc entry and exit. We demonstrate the performance and feasibility of Dyna-5G using a custom-built testbed that simulates real-world missions, demonstrating our network's robustness, adaptability, and failure recovery capabilities. The results indicate that our entire 5G network model can fully re-organize in 6 seconds at maximum, without compromising the mission.</description>
