      <title>Photon Absorption Remote Sensing Virtual Histopathology: Diagnostic Equivalence to Gold-Standard H&amp;E Staining in Skin Cancer Excisional Biopsies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon Absorption Remote Sensing (PARS) enables label-free imaging of subcellular morphology by observing biomolecule specific absorption interactions. Coupled with deep-learning, PARS produces label-free virtual Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) stained images in unprocessed tissues. This study evaluates the diagnostic performance of these PARS-derived virtual H&amp;E images in benign and malignant excisional skin biopsies, including Squamous (SCC), Basal (BCC) Cell Carcinoma, and normal skin. Sixteen unstained formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin excisions were PARS imaged, virtually H&amp;E stained, then chemically stained and imaged at 40x. Seven fellowship trained dermatopathologists assessed all 32 images in a masked randomized fashion. Concordance analysis indicates 95.5% agreement between primary diagnoses rendered on PARS versus H&amp;E images (Cohen's k=0.93). Inter-rater reliability was near-perfect for both image types (Fleiss' k=0.89 for PARS, k=0.80 for H&amp;E). For subtype classification, agreement was near-perfect 91% (k=0.73) for SCC and was perfect for BCC. When assessing malignancy confinement (e.g., cancer margins), agreement was 92% between PARS and H&amp;E (k=0.718). During assessment dermatopathologists could not reliably distinguish image origin (PARS vs. H&amp;E), and diagnostic confidence was equivalent between the modalities. Inter-rater reliability for PARS virtual H&amp;E was consistent with reported benchmarks for histologic evaluation. These results indicate that PARS virtual histology may be diagnostically equivalent to traditional H&amp;E staining in dermatopathology diagnostics, while enabling assessment directly from unlabeled, or unprocessed slides. In turn, the label-free PARS virtual H&amp;E imaging workflow may preserve tissue for downstream analysis while producing data well-suited for AI integration potentially accelerating and enhancing the accuracy of skin cancer diagnostics.</description>

      <title>OmicsQ: A User-Friendly Platform for Interactive Quantitative Omics Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: High-throughput omics technologies generate complex datasets with thousands of features that are quantified across multiple experimental conditions, but often suffer from incomplete measurements, missing values and individually fluctuating variances. This requires sophisticated analytical methods for accurate, deep and insightful biological interpretations, capable of dealing with a large variety of data properties and different amounts of completeness. Software to handle such data complexity is rare and mostly relies on programming-based environments, limiting accessibility for researchers without computational expertise. Results: We present OmicsQ, an interactive, web-based platform designed to streamline quantitative omics data analysis. OmicsQ integrates established statistical processing tools with an intuitive, browser-based visualization interface. It provides robust batch correction, automated experimental design annotation, and missing-data handling without imputation, which ensures data integrity and avoids artifacts from a priori assumptions. OmicsQ seamlessly interacts with external applications for statistical testing, clustering, analysis of protein complex behavior, and pathway enrichment, offering a comprehensive and flexible workflow from data import to biological interpretation that is broadly applicable tov data from different domains. Availability and Implementation: OmicsQ is implemented in R and R Shiny and is available at https://computproteomics.bmb.sdu.dk/app_direct/OmicsQ. Source code and installation instructions can be found at https://github.com/computproteomics/OmicsQ</description>

      <title>Modelling collective cell migration in a data-rich age: challenges and opportunities for data-driven modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical modelling has a long history in the context of collective cell migration, with applications throughout development, disease and regenerative medicine. The aim of modelling in this context is to provide a framework in which to mathematically encode experimentally derived mechanistic hypotheses, and then to test and validate them to provide new insights and understanding. Traditionally, mathematical models have consisted of systems of partial differential equations that model the evolution of cell density over time, together with the dynamics of any associated biochemical signals or the underlying substrate. The various terms in the model are usually chosen to provide simplified, phenomenological descriptions of the underlying biology, and follow long-standing conventions in the field. However, with the recent development of a plethora of new experimental technologies that provide quantitative data on collective cell migration processes, we now have the opportunity to leverage statistical and machine learning tools to determine mathematical models directly from the data. This perspectives article aims to provide an overview of recently developed data-driven modelling approaches, outlining the main methodologies and the challenges involved in using them to interrogate real-world data relating to collective cell migration.</description>

      <title>Exploring Visual Complaints through a test battery in Acquired Brain Injury Patients: A Detailed Analysis of the DiaNAH Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigated visual impairment complaints in a sample of 948 Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) patients using the DiaNAH dataset, emphasizing advanced machine learning techniques for managing missing data. Patients completed a CVS questionnaire capturing eight types of visual symptoms, including blurred vision and altered contrast perception. Due to incomplete data, 181 patients were excluded, resulting in an analytical subset of 767 individuals. To address the challenge of missing data, an automated machine learning (AutoML) approach was employed for data imputation, preserving the distributional characteristics of the original dataset. Patients were grouped according to singular and combined complaint clusters derived from the 40,320 potential combinations identified through the CVS questionnaire. A linear correlation analysis revealed minimal to no direct relationship between patient-reported visual complaints and standard visual perceptual function tests. This study represents an initial systematic attempt to understand the complex relationship between subjective visual complaints and objective visual perceptual assessments in ABI patients. Given the limitations of sample size and variability, further studies with larger populations are recommended to robustly explore these complaint clusters and their implications for visual perception following brain injury.</description>

      <title>The Global Diffusion Limit for the Space Dependent Variable-Order Time-Fractional Diffusion Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffusion equation and its time-fractional counterpart can be obtained via the diffusion limit of continuous-time random walks with exponential and heavy-tailed waiting time distributions. The space dependent variable-order time-fractional diffusion equation is a generalization of the time-fractional diffusion equation with a fractional exponent that varies over space, modelling systems with spatial heterogeneity. However, there has been limited work on defining a global diffusion limit and an underlying random walk for this macroscopic governing equation, which is needed to make meaningful interpretations of the parameters for applications. Here, we introduce continuous time and discrete time random walk models that limit to the variable-order fractional diffusion equation via a global diffusion limit and space- and time- continuum limits. From this, we show how the master equation of the discrete time random walk can be used to provide a numerical method for solving the variable-order fractional diffusion equation. The results in this work provide underlying random walks and an improved understanding of the diffusion limit for the variable-order fractional diffusion equation, which is critical for the development, calibration and validation of models for diffusion in spatially inhomogeneous media with traps and obstacles.</description>

      <title>Different behaviors of diffusing diffusivity dynamics based on three different definitions of fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of a "diffusing diffusivity" (DD), a stochastically time-varying diffusion coefficient, are explored within the frameworks of three different forms of fractional Brownian motion (FBM): (i) the Langevin equation driven by fractional Gaussian noise (LE-FBM), (ii) the Weyl integral representation introduced by Mandelbrot and van Ness (MN-FBM), and (iii) the Riemann-Liouville fractional integral representation (RL-FBM) due to L{\'e}vy. The statistical properties of the three FBM-generalized DD models are examined, including the mean-squared displacement (MSD), mean-squared increment (MSI), autocovariance function (ACVF) of increments, and the probability density function (PDF). Despite the long-believed equivalence of MN-FBM and LE-FBM, their corresponding FBM-DD models exhibit distinct behavior in terms of the MSD and MSI. In the MN-FBM-DD model, the statistical characteristics directly reflect an effective diffusivity equal to its mean value. In contrast, in LE-FBM-DD, correlations in the random diffusivity give rise to an unexpected crossover behavior in both MSD and MSI. We also find that the MSI and ACVF are nonstationary in RL-FBM-DD but stationary in the other two DD models. All DD models display a crossover from a short-time non-Gaussian PDF to a long-time Gaussian PDF. Our findings offer guidance for experimentalists in selecting appropriate FBM-generalized models to describe viscoelastic yet non-Gaussian dynamics in bio- and soft-matter systems with heterogeneous environments.</description>

      <title>m-KAILIN: Knowledge-Driven Agentic Scientific Corpus Distillation Framework for Biomedical Large Language Models Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) in biomedical research has underscored the limitations of existing open-source annotated scientific corpora, which are often insufficient in quantity and quality. Addressing the challenge posed by the complex hierarchy of biomedical knowledge, we propose a knowledge-driven, multi-agent framework for scientific corpus distillation tailored for LLM training in the biomedical domain. Central to our approach is a collaborative multi-agent architecture, where specialized agents, each guided by the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) hierarchy, work in concert to autonomously extract, synthesize, and self-evaluate high-quality textual data from vast scientific literature. These agents collectively generate and refine domain-specific question-answer pairs, ensuring comprehensive coverage and consistency with biomedical ontologies while minimizing manual involvement. Extensive experimental results show that language models trained on our multi-agent distilled datasets achieve notable improvements in biomedical question-answering tasks, outperforming both strong life sciences LLM baselines and advanced proprietary models. Notably, our AI-Ready dataset enables Llama3-70B to surpass GPT-4 with MedPrompt and Med-PaLM-2, despite their larger scale. Detailed ablation studies and case analyses further validate the effectiveness and synergy of each agent within the framework, highlighting the potential of multi-agent collaboration in biomedical LLM training.</description>

      <title>Modelling the effect of antibody depletion on dose-response behavior for common immunostaining protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antibody binding properties for immunostaining applications are often characterized by dose-response curves, which describe the amount of bound antibodies as a function of the antibody concentration applied at the beginning of the experiment. A common model for the dose-response curve is the Langmuir isotherm, which assumes an equilibrium between the binding and unbinding of antibodies. However, for common immunostaining protocols, the equilibrium assumption is violated, and the dose-response behavior is governed by an accumulation of permanently bound antibodies. Assuming a constant antibody concentration, the resulting accumulation model can easily be solved analytically. However, in many experimental setups the overall amount of antibodies is fixed, such that antibody binding reduces the concentration of free antibodies. Solving the corresponding depletion accumulation model is more difficult and seems to be impossible for heterogeneous epitope landscapes. In this paper, we first solve the depletion-free accumulation model analytically for a homogeneous epitope landscape. From the obtained solution, we derive inequalities between the depletion-free accumulation model, the depletion accumulation model, and the Langmuir isotherm. This allows us to characterize the depletion effect for homogeneous epitope landscapes. Next, we generalize the problem to heterogeneous epitope landscapes, where we prove the existence and uniqueness of a solution that behaves as expected from the experimental setting. These natural properties define bounds for the depletion accumulation model. We conclude this paper by applying the bounds to characterize the depletion effect for heterogeneous epitope landscapes.</description>

      <title>Evaluating tDCS Intervention Effectiveness via Functional Connectivity Network on Resting-State EEG Data in Major Depressive Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive therapeutic intervention for major depressive disorder (MDD), yet its effects on neural mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study investigates the impact of tDCS in individuals with MDD using resting-state EEG data and network neuroscience to analyze functional connectivity. We examined power spectral density (PSD) changes and functional connectivity (FC) patterns across theta, alpha, and beta bands before and after tDCS intervention. A notable aspect of this research involves the modification of the binarizing threshold algorithm to assess functional connectivity networks, facilitating a meaningful comparison at the group level. Our analysis using optimal threshold binarization techniques revealed significant modifications in network topology, particularly evident in the beta band, indicative of reduced randomization or enhanced small-worldness after tDCS. Furthermore, the hubness analysis identified specific brain regions, notably the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) regions across all frequency bands, exhibiting increased functional connectivity, suggesting their involvement in the antidepressant effects of tDCS. Notably, tDCS intervention transformed the dispersed high connectivity into localized connectivity and increased left-sided asymmetry across all frequency bands. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the effects of tDCS on neural mechanisms in MDD, offering a potential direction for further research and therapeutic development in the field of neuromodulation for mental health disorders.</description>

      <title>Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Multi-Cancer Classification and Biomarker Identification, An Interpretable Multi-Omics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of heterogeneous multi-omics datasets at a systems level remains a central challenge for developing analytical and computational models in precision cancer diagnostics. This paper introduces Multi-Omics Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (MOGKAN), a deep learning framework that utilizes messenger-RNA, micro-RNA sequences, and DNA methylation samples together with Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks for cancer classification across 31 different cancer types. The proposed approach combines differential gene expression with DESeq2, Linear Models for Microarray (LIMMA), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to reduce multi-omics data dimensionality while preserving relevant biological features. The model architecture is based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem principle and uses trainable univariate functions to enhance interpretability and feature analysis. MOGKAN achieves classification accuracy of 96.28 percent and exhibits low experimental variability in comparison to related deep learning-based models. The biomarkers identified by MOGKAN were validated as cancer-related markers through Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. By integrating multi-omics data with graph-based deep learning, our proposed approach demonstrates robust predictive performance and interpretability with potential to enhance the translation of complex multi-omics data into clinically actionable cancer diagnostics.</description>

      <title>SCMPPI: Supervised Contrastive Multimodal Framework for Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction plays a pivotal role in deciphering cellular functions and disease mechanisms. To address the limitations of traditional experimental methods and existing computational approaches in cross-modal feature fusion and false-negative suppression, we propose SCMPPI-a novel supervised contrastive multimodal framework. By effectively integrating sequence-based features (AAC, DPC, ESMC-CKSAAP) with network topology (Node2Vec embeddings) and incorporating an enhanced contrastive learning strategy with negative sample filtering, SCMPPI achieves superior prediction performance. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate its state-of-the-art accuracy(98.13%) and AUC(99.69%), along with excellent cross-species generalization (AUC&gt;99%). Successful applications in CD9 networks, Wnt pathway analysis, and cancer-specific networks further highlight its potential for disease target discovery, establishing SCMPPI as a powerful tool for multimodal biological data analysis.</description>
