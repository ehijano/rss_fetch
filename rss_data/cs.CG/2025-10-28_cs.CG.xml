      <title>On the complexity of the free space of a translating square in R^3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a polyhedral robot $B$ that can translate (without rotating) amidst a finite set of non-moving polyhedral obstacles in $\mathbb R^3$. The "free space" $\mathcal F$ of $B$ is the set of all positions in which $B$ is disjoint from the interior of every obstacle.
  Aronov and Sharir (1997) derived an upper bound of $O(n^2\log n)$ for the combinatorial complexity of $\mathcal F$, where $n$ is the total number of vertices of the obstacles, and the complexity of $B$ is assumed constant.
  Halperin and Yap (1993) showed that, if $B$ is either a "flat" convex polygon or a three-dimensional box, then a tighter bound of $O(n^2\alpha(n))$ holds. Here $\alpha(n)$ is the inverse Ackermann function.
  In this paper we prove that if $B$ is a square (or a rectangle or a parallelogram), then the complexity of $\mathcal F$ is $O(n^2)$. We conjecture that this bound holds more generally if $B$ is any convex polygon whose edges come in parallel pairs. For such polygons $B$, the only triple contacts whose number we were not able to bound by $O(n^2)$ are those made by three mutually non-parallel edges of $B$.
  Similarly, for the case where $B$ is a cube (or a box or a parallelepiped), we bound by $O(n^2)$ all triple contacts except those made by three mutually non-parallel edges of $B$.</description>

      <title>Online Hitting Set for Axis-Aligned Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are given a set $P$ of $n$ points in the plane, and a sequence of axis-aligned squares that arrive in an online fashion. The online hitting set problem consists of maintaining, by adding new points if necessary, a set $H\subseteq P$ that contains at least one point in each input square. We present an $O(\log n)$-competitive deterministic algorithm for this problem. The competitive ratio is the best possible, apart from constant factors. In fact, this is the first $O(\log n)$-competitive algorithm for the online hitting set problem that works for geometric objects of arbitrary sizes (i.e., arbitrary scaling factors) in the plane. We further generalize this result to positive homothets of a polygon with $k\geq 3$ vertices in the plane and provide an $O(k^2\log n)$-competitive algorithm.</description>

      <title>Expected Length of the Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree and 1-norms of Chromatic Persistence Diagrams in the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $c$ be the constant such that the expected length of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree of $n$ random points in the unit square is $c \sqrt{n}$ in the limit, when $n$ goes to infinity. We improve the prior best lower bound of $0.6008 \leq c$ by Avram and Bertsimas to $0.6289 \leq c$. The proof is a by-product of studying the persistent homology of randomly $2$-colored point sets. Specifically, we consider the filtration induced by the inclusions of the two mono-chromatic sublevel sets of the Euclidean distance function into the bi-chromatic sublevel set of that function. Assigning colors randomly, and with equal probability, we show that the expected $1$-norm of each chromatic persistence diagram is a constant times $\sqrt{n}$ in the limit, and we determine the constant in terms of $c$ and another constant, $c_L$, which arises for a novel type of Euclidean minimum spanning tree of $2$-colored point sets.</description>

      <title>Coresets for Clustering Under Stochastic Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of constructing coresets for $(k, z)$-clustering when the input dataset is corrupted by stochastic noise drawn from a known distribution. In this setting, evaluating the quality of a coreset is inherently challenging, as the true underlying dataset is unobserved. To address this, we investigate coreset construction using surrogate error metrics that are tractable and provably related to the true clustering cost. We analyze a traditional metric from prior work and introduce a new error metric that more closely aligns with the true cost. Although our metric is defined independently of the noise distribution, it enables approximation guarantees that scale with the noise level. We design a coreset construction algorithm based on this metric and show that, under mild assumptions on the data and noise, enforcing an $\varepsilon$-bound under our metric yields smaller coresets and tighter guarantees on the true clustering cost than those obtained via classical metrics. In particular, we prove that the coreset size can improve by a factor of up to $\mathrm{poly}(k)$, where $n$ is the dataset size. Experiments on real-world datasets support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach.</description>

      <title>T-REGS: Minimum Spanning Tree Regularization for Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning representations without labeled data, often by enforcing invariance to input transformations such as rotations or blurring. Recent studies have highlighted two pivotal properties for effective representations: (i) avoiding dimensional collapse-where the learned features occupy only a low-dimensional subspace, and (ii) enhancing uniformity of the induced distribution. In this work, we introduce T-REGS, a simple regularization framework for SSL based on the length of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) over the learned representation. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that T-REGS simultaneously mitigates dimensional collapse and promotes distribution uniformity on arbitrary compact Riemannian manifolds. Several experiments on synthetic data and on classical SSL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach at enhancing representation quality.</description>

      <title>Lattice and Non-lattice Piercing of Axis-Parallel Rectangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.10385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a family ${\mathcal F}$ of shapes in the plane, we study what is the lowest possible density of a point set $P$ that pierces (``intersects'', ``hits'') all translates of each shape in ${\mathcal F}$. For instance, if ${\mathcal F}$ consists of two axis-parallel rectangles the best known piercing set, i.e., one with the lowest density, is a lattice.
  Given a finite family ${\mathcal F}$ of axis-parallel rectangles, we present an algorithm for finding an optimal ${\mathcal F}$-piercing lattice. The algorithm runs in time polynomial in the number of rectangles and the maximum aspect ratio of the rectangles in the family. No prior algorithms for this problem were known.
  On the other hand, we show that for every $n \geq 3$, there exists a family of $n$ axis-parallel rectangles for which the best piercing density achieved by a lattice is separated by a positive (constant) gap from the optimal piercing density for the respective family. Finally, we show that the best lattice can be sometimes worse by $20\%$ than the optimal piercing set.</description>

      <title>Online Hitting Sets for Disks of Bounded Radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present algorithms for the online minimum hitting set problem in geometric range spaces: given a set $P$ of $n$ points in the plane and a sequence of geometric objects that arrive one-by-one, we need to maintain a hitting set at all times by making irrevocable decisions. For disks of radii in the interval $[1,M]$, we present an $O(\log M \log n)$-competitive algorithm. This result generalizes from disks to positive homothets of any convex body in the plane with scaling factors in the interval $[1,M]$. As a main technical tool, we reduce the problem to the online hitting set problem for a finite subset of integer points and geometric objects with the lowest point property, introduced in this paper, which behave similarly to bottomless rectangles. Specifically, for a given $N&gt;1$, we present an $O(\log N)$-competitive algorithm for the variant where $P$ is a subset of an $N\times N$ section of the integer lattice, and the geometric objects have the lowest point property.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Cooling Center Coverage Using Persistent Homology of a Filtered Witness Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In light of the increase in frequency of extreme heat events, there is a critical need to develop tools to identify geographic locations that are at risk of heat-related mortality. This paper aims to identify locations by assessing holes in cooling-center coverage using persistent homology (PH), a method from topological data analysis (TDA). Persistent homology has shown promising results in identifying holes in coverage of specific resources. We adapt these methods using a witness complex construction to study the coverage of cooling centers. We test our approach on four locations (central Boston, MA; central Austin, TX; Portland, OR; and Miami, FL) and use death times, a measurement of the size and scale of the gap in coverage, to identify most at risk regions. For comparison, we implement a standard technique for studying the risk of heat-related mortality called a heat vulnerability index (HVI). The HVI is a numerical score calculated for a geographic area based on demographic information. PH and the HVI identify different locations as vulnerable, thus indicating a potential value of assessing vulnerability from multiple perspectives. By using the regions identified by both persistent homology and the HVI, we provide a more holistic understanding of coverage.</description>
