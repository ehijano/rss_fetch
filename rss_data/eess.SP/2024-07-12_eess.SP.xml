      <title>Massive Index Modulation with Combinatorics-Free Detection for Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) and index modulation (IM) are promising technologies for beyond fifth generation (B5G) and sixth generation (6G) systems. While ISAC enables new applications, IM is attractive for its inherent energy and spectral efficiencies. In this article we propose massive IM as an enabler of ISAC, by considering transmit signals with information conveyed through the indexation of the resources utilized in their transmission, and pilot symbols exploited for sensing. In order to overcome the complexity hurdle arising from the large sizes of IM codebooks, we propose a novel message passing (MP) decoder designed under the Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) framework exploiting a novel unit vector decomposition (UVD) of IM signals with purpose-derived novel probability distributions. The proposed method enjoys a low decoding complexity that is independent of combinatorial factors, while still approaching the performance of unfeasible state-of-the-art (SotA) search-based methods. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated via complexity analysis and numerical results for piloted generalized quadrature spatial modulation (GQSM) systems of large sizes (up to 96 antennas).</description>

      <title>A Framework of FAS-RIS Systems: Performance Analysis and Throughput Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communication systems which involve a fixed-antenna base station (BS) and a mobile user (MU) that is equipped with fluid antenna system (FAS). Specifically, the RIS is utilized to enable communication for the user whose direct link from the base station is blocked by obstacles. We propose a comprehensive framework that provides transmission design for both static scenarios with the knowledge of channel state information (CSI) and harsh environments where CSI is hard to acquire. It leads to two approaches: a CSI-based scheme where CSI is available, and a CSI-free scheme when CSI is inaccessible. Given the complex spatial correlations in FAS, we employ block-diagonal matrix approximation and independent antenna equivalent models to simplify the derivation of outage probabilities in both cases. Based on the derived outage probabilities, we then optimize the throughput of the FAS-RIS system. For the CSI-based scheme, we first propose a gradient ascent-based algorithm to obtain a near-optimal solution. Then, to address the possible high computational complexity in the gradient algorithm, we approximate the objective function and confirm a unique optimal solution accessible through a bisection search method. For the CSI-free scheme, we apply the partial gradient ascent algorithm, reducing complexity further than full gradient algorithms. We also approximate the objective function and derive a locally optimal closed-form solution to maximize throughput. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for the transmission design in FAS-RIS systems.</description>

      <title>Handling Distance Constraint in Movable Antenna Aided Systems: A General Optimization Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The movable antenna (MA) is a promising technology to exploit more spatial degrees of freedom for enhancing wireless system performance. However, the MA-aided system introduces the non-convex antenna distance constraints, which poses challenges in the underlying optimization problems. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a general framework for optimizing the MA-aided system under the antenna distance constraints. Specifically, we separate the non-convex antenna distance constraints from the objective function by introducing auxiliary variables. Then, the resulting problem can be efficiently solved under the alternating optimization framework. For the subproblems with respect to the antenna position variables and auxiliary variables, the proposed algorithms are able to obtain at least stationary points without any approximations. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework, we present two case studies: capacity maximization and regularized zero-forcing precoding. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed optimization framework outperforms the existing baseline schemes under both cases.</description>

      <title>HRRPGraphNet: A Graph Neural Network Based Approach for HRRP Radar Target Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High Resolution Range Profiles (HRRP) have become a key area of focus in the domain of Radar Automatic Target Recognition (RATR). Despite the success of data-driven neural network-based HRRP recognition, challenges such as insufficient training samples persist in its real-world application. This letter introduces HRRPGraphNet, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) model designed specifically for HRRP target recognition that leverages new insights to address these challenges. A pivotal innovation is the transformation of HRRP data into a graph structure, utilizing a range cell amplitude-based node vector and a range-relative adjacency matrix. This graph-based approach facilitates both local feature extraction via one-dimensional convolution layers and global feature extraction through a graph convolution layer, capitalizing on the intrinsic relationships between range cells which is a distinct advantage over existing sequence-based methods. Experiments on the aircraft electromagnetic simulation dataset and the measured dataset have confirmed HRRPGraphNet's superior accuracy and robustness, particularly in fewer training sample environments, underscoring the potential of graph-driven innovations in HRRP-based RATR.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the residual throughput penalty due to ISRS, after power-optimization, in multiband systems. We show it to be mild. We also revisit the launch power optimization 3-dB rule.

      <title>Enhancing ADHD Diagnosis with EEG: The Critical Role of Preprocessing and Key Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder that significantly impacts various key aspects of life, requiring accurate diagnostic methods. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are used in diagnosing ADHD, but proper preprocessing is crucial to avoid noise and artifacts that could lead to unreliable results.
  Method: This study utilized a public EEG dataset from children diagnosed with ADHD and typically developing (TD) children. Four preprocessing techniques were applied: no preprocessing (Raw), Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filtering, Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR), and Independent Component Analysis (ICA). EEG recordings were segmented, and features were extracted and selected based on statistical significance. Classification was performed using Machine Learning models, as XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbors.
  Results: The absence of preprocessing leads to artificially high classification accuracy due to noise. In contrast, ASR and ICA preprocessing techniques significantly improved the reliability of results. Segmenting EEG recordings revealed that later segments provided better classification accuracy, likely due to the manifestation of ADHD symptoms over time. The most relevant EEG channels were P3, P4, and C3. The top features for classification included Kurtosis, Katz fractal dimension, and power spectral density of Delta, Theta, and Alpha bands.
  Conclusions: Effective preprocessing is essential in EEG-based ADHD diagnosis to prevent noise-induced biases. This study identifies crucial EEG channels and features, providing a foundation for further research and improving ADHD diagnostic accuracy. Future work should focus on expanding datasets, refining preprocessing methods, and enhancing feature interpretability to improve diagnostic accuracy and model robustness for clinical use.</description>

      <title>Semantic Feature Division Multiple Access for Multi-user Digital Interference Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the ever-increasing user density and quality of service (QoS) demand,5G networks with limited spectrum resources are facing massive access challenges. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel discrete semantic feature division multiple access (SFDMA) paradigm for multi-user digital interference networks. Specifically, by utilizing deep learning technology, SFDMA extracts multi-user semantic information into discrete representations in distinguishable semantic subspaces, which enables multiple users to transmit simultaneously over the same time-frequency resources. Furthermore, based on a robust information bottleneck, we design a SFDMA based multi-user digital semantic interference network for inference tasks, which can achieve approximate orthogonal transmission. Moreover, we propose a SFDMA based multi-user digital semantic interference network for image reconstruction tasks, where the discrete outputs of the semantic encoders of the users are approximately orthogonal, which significantly reduces multi-user interference. Furthermore, we propose an Alpha-Beta-Gamma (ABG) formula for semantic communications, which is the first theoretical relationship between inference accuracy and transmission power. Then, we derive adaptive power control methods with closed-form expressions for inference tasks. Extensive simulations verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SFDMA.</description>

      <title>6D Motion Parameters Estimation in Monostatic Integrated Sensing and Communications System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to estimate the six dimensional (6D) motion parameters of dynamic target for monostatic integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system. We first provide a generic ISAC framework for dynamic target sensing based on massive multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) array. Next, we derive the relationship between the sensing channel of ISAC base station (BS) and the 6D motion parameters of dynamic target. Then, we employ the array signal processing methods to estimate the horizontal angle, pitch angle, distance, and virtual velocity of dynamic target. Since the virtual velocities observed by different antennas are different, we adopt plane fitting to estimate the dynamic target's radial velocity, horizontal angular velocity, and pitch angular velocity from these virtual velocities. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 6D motion parameters estimation scheme, which also confirms a new finding that one single BS with massive MIMO array is capable of estimating the horizontal angular velocity and pitch angular velocity of dynamic target.</description>

      <title>Coherently amplified ultrafast imaging in a free-electron interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accessing the low-energy non-equilibrium dynamics of materials with simultaneous spatial and temporal resolutions has been a bold frontier of electron microscopy in recent years. One of the main challenges is the ability to retrieve extremely weak signals while simultaneously disentangling amplitude and phase information. Here, we present an algorithm-based microscopy approach that uses light-induced electron modulation to demonstrate the coherent amplification effect in electron imaging of optical near-fields. We provide a simultaneous time-, space-, and phase-resolved measurement in a micro-drum made from a hexagonal boron nitride membrane, visualizing the sub-cycle spatio-temporal dynamics of 2D polariton wavepackets therein. The phase-resolved measurement reveals vortex-anti-vortex singularities on the polariton wavefronts, together with an intriguing phenomenon of a traveling wave mimicking the amplitude profile of a standing wave. Our experiments show a 20-fold coherent amplification of the near-field signal compared to conventional electron near-field imaging, resolving peak field intensities of ~W/cm2 (field amplitude of few kV/m). As a result, our work opens a path toward spatio-temporal electron microscopy of biological specimens and quantum materials - exciting yet sensitive samples, which are currently difficult to investigate.</description>

      <title>A Trustworthy AIoT-enabled Localization System via Federated Learning and Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a significant demand for indoor localization technology in smart buildings, and the most promising solution in this field is using RF sensors and fingerprinting-based methods that employ machine learning models trained on crowd-sourced user data gathered from IoT devices. However, this raises security and privacy issues in practice. Some researchers propose to use federated learning to partially overcome privacy problems, but there still remain security concerns, e.g., single-point failure and malicious attacks. In this paper, we propose a framework named DFLoc to achieve precise 3D localization tasks while considering the following two security concerns. Particularly, we design a specialized blockchain to decentralize the framework by distributing the tasks such as model distribution and aggregation which are handled by a central server to all clients in most previous works, to address the issue of the single-point failure for a reliable and accurate indoor localization system. Moreover, we introduce an updated model verification mechanism within the blockchain to alleviate the concern of malicious node attacks. Experimental results substantiate the framework's capacity to deliver accurate 3D location predictions and its superior resistance to the impacts of single-point failure and malicious attacks when compared to conventional centralized federated learning systems.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Robust Multi-Object Tracking via Fusion of mmWave Radar and Camera Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving holds great promise in addressing traffic safety concerns by leveraging artificial intelligence and sensor technology. Multi-Object Tracking plays a critical role in ensuring safer and more efficient navigation through complex traffic scenarios. This paper presents a novel deep learning-based method that integrates radar and camera data to enhance the accuracy and robustness of Multi-Object Tracking in autonomous driving systems. The proposed method leverages a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory network to incorporate long-term temporal information and improve motion prediction. An appearance feature model inspired by FaceNet is used to establish associations between objects across different frames, ensuring consistent tracking. A tri-output mechanism is employed, consisting of individual outputs for radar and camera sensors and a fusion output, to provide robustness against sensor failures and produce accurate tracking results. Through extensive evaluations of real-world datasets, our approach demonstrates remarkable improvements in tracking accuracy, ensuring reliable performance even in low-visibility scenarios.</description>

      <title>MemWarp: Discontinuity-Preserving Cardiac Registration with Memorized Anatomical Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many existing learning-based deformable image registration methods impose constraints on deformation fields to ensure they are globally smooth and continuous. However, this assumption does not hold in cardiac image registration, where different anatomical regions exhibit asymmetric motions during respiration and movements due to sliding organs within the chest. Consequently, such global constraints fail to accommodate local discontinuities across organ boundaries, potentially resulting in erroneous and unrealistic displacement fields. In this paper, we address this issue with MemWarp, a learning framework that leverages a memory network to store prototypical information tailored to different anatomical regions. MemWarp is different from earlier approaches in two main aspects: firstly, by decoupling feature extraction from similarity matching in moving and fixed images, it facilitates more effective utilization of feature maps; secondly, despite its capability to preserve discontinuities, it eliminates the need for segmentation masks during model inference. In experiments on a publicly available cardiac dataset, our method achieves considerable improvements in registration accuracy and producing realistic deformations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with a remarkable 7.1\% Dice score improvement over the runner-up semi-supervised method. Source code will be available at https://github.com/tinymilky/Mem-Warp.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Electroretinogram Signal Generation Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for Enhancing Classification of Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electroretinogram (ERG) is a clinical test that records the retina's electrical response to light. The ERG is a promising way to study different neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) - a neurodevelopmental condition that impacts language, communication, and reciprocal social interactions. However, in heterogeneous populations, such as ASD, where the ability to collect large datasets is limited, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) is complicated. Synthetic ERG signals generated from real ERG recordings carry similar information as natural ERGs and, therefore, could be used as an extension for natural data to increase datasets so that AI applications can be fully utilized. As proof of principle, this study presents a Generative Adversarial Network capable of generating synthetic ERG signals of children with ASD and typically developing control individuals. We applied a Time Series Transformer and Visual Transformer with Continuous Wavelet Transform to enhance classification results on the extended synthetic signals dataset. This approach may support classification models in related psychiatric conditions where the ERG may help classify disorders.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Age of Information and Energy Consumption in NR-V2X System based on Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving may be the most important application scenario of next generation, the development of wireless access technologies enabling reliable and low-latency vehicle communication becomes crucial. To address this, 3GPP has developed Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) specifications based on 5G New Radio (NR) technology, where Mode 2 Side-Link (SL) communication resembles Mode 4 in LTE-V2X, allowing direct communication between vehicles. This supplements SL communication in LTE-V2X and represents the latest advancement in cellular V2X (C-V2X) with improved performance of NR-V2X. However, in NR-V2X Mode 2, resource collisions still occur, and thus degrade the age of information (AOI). Therefore, a interference cancellation method is employed to mitigate this impact by combining NR-V2X with Non-Orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology. In NR-V2X, when vehicles select smaller resource reservation interval (RRI), higher-frequency transmissions take ore energy to reduce AoI. Hence, it is important to jointly consider AoI and communication energy consumption based on NR-V2X communication. Then, we formulate such an optimization problem and employ the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm to compute the optimal transmission RRI and transmission power for each transmitting vehicle to reduce the energy consumption of each transmitting vehicle and the AoI of each receiving vehicle. Extensive simulations have demonstrated the performance of our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Multi-Threshold AoII-Optimum Sampling Policies for CTMC Information Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study push-based sampling and transmission policies for a status update system consisting of a general finite-state continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) information source with known dynamics, with the goal of minimizing the average age of incorrect information (AoII). The problem setting we investigate involves an exponentially distributed delay channel for transmissions and a constraint on the average sampling rate. We first show that the optimum sampling and transmission policy is a 'multi-threshold policy', where the thresholds depend on both the estimation value and the state of the original process, and sampling and transmission need to be initiated when the instantaneous AoII exceeds the corresponding threshold, called the estimation- and state-aware transmission (ESAT) policy. Subsequently, we formulate the problem of finding the thresholds as a constrained semi-Markov decision process (CSMDP) and the Lagrangian approach. Additionally, we propose two lower complexity sub-optimum policies, namely the estimation-aware transmission (EAT) policy, and the single-threshold (ST) policy, for which it is possible to obtain these thresholds for CTMCs with relatively larger number of states. The underlying CSMDP formulation relies on the 'multi-regime phase-type' (MRPH) distribution which is a generalization of the well-known phase-type distribution, which allows us to obtain the distribution of time until absorption in a CTMC whose transition rates change with respect to time in a piece-wise manner. The effectiveness of the proposed ESAT, EAT and ST sampling and transmission policies are shown through numerical examples, along with comparisons with a baseline scheme that transmits packets according to a Poisson process in out-of-sync periods.</description>

      <title>Surpassing Cosine Similarity for Multidimensional Comparisons: Dimension Insensitive Euclidean Metric (DIEM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement in computational power and hardware efficiency has enabled the tackling of increasingly complex and high-dimensional problems. While artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved remarkable results in various scientific and technological fields, the interpretability of these high-dimensional solutions remains challenging. A critical issue in this context is the comparison of multidimensional quantities, which is essential in techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and k-means clustering. Common metrics such as cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, and Manhattan distance are often used for such comparisons - for example in muscular synergies of the human motor control system. However, their applicability and interpretability diminish as dimensionality increases. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of dimensionality on these three widely used metrics. Our results reveal significant limitations of cosine similarity, particularly its dependency on the dimensionality of the vectors, leading to biased and less interpretable outcomes. To address this, we introduce the Dimension Insensitive Euclidean Metric (DIEM), derived from the Euclidean distance, which demonstrates superior robustness and generalizability across varying dimensions. DIEM maintains consistent variability and eliminates the biases observed in traditional metrics, making it a more reliable tool for high-dimensional comparisons. This novel metric has the potential to replace cosine similarity, providing a more accurate and insightful method to analyze multidimensional data in fields ranging from neuromotor control to machine learning and deep learning.</description>

      <title>Speech dereverberation constrained on room impulse response characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-channel speech dereverberation aims at extracting a dry speech signal from a recording affected by the acoustic reflections in a room. However, most current deep learning-based approaches for speech dereverberation are not interpretable for room acoustics, and can be considered as black-box systems in that regard. In this work, we address this problem by regularizing the training loss using a novel physical coherence loss which encourages the room impulse response (RIR) induced by the dereverberated output of the model to match the acoustic properties of the room in which the signal was recorded. Our investigation demonstrates the preservation of the original dereverberated signal alongside the provision of a more physically coherent RIR.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Based Doppler Centroid Estimation and Speckle Noise Reduction for Spaceborne SAR Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.07457v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present stripmap mode spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging with the focus on Doppler centroid estimation. The Doppler centroid is the result of non-zero squint angle which if it is not compensated it can de-focus the image. We present an efficient method based on image entropy to estimate the fractional part of the Doppler centroid. We further address the speckle noise removal process which high resolution SAR images suffer from and degrade the quality of the reconstructed images considerably.
  Finally, we utilize experimental data gathered from RADARSAT-1 satellite from Vancouver, Canada to verify the accuracy of the proposed techniques.</description>

      <title>SubspaceNet: Deep Learning-Aided Subspace Methods for DoA Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direction of arrival (DoA) estimation is a fundamental task in array processing. A popular family of DoA estimation algorithms are subspace methods, which operate by dividing the measurements into distinct signal and noise subspaces. Subspace methods, such as Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) and Root-MUSIC, rely on several restrictive assumptions, including narrowband non-coherent sources and fully calibrated arrays, and their performance is considerably degraded when these do not hold. In this work we propose SubspaceNet; a data-driven DoA estimator which learns how to divide the observations into distinguishable subspaces. This is achieved by utilizing a dedicated deep neural network to learn the empirical autocorrelation of the input, by training it as part of the Root-MUSIC method, leveraging the inherent differentiability of this specific DoA estimator, while removing the need to provide a ground-truth decomposable autocorrelation matrix. Once trained, the resulting SubspaceNet serves as a universal surrogate covariance estimator that can be applied in combination with any subspace-based DoA estimation method, allowing its successful application in challenging setups. SubspaceNet is shown to enable various DoA estimation algorithms to cope with coherent sources, wideband signals, low SNR, array mismatches, and limited snapshots, while preserving the interpretability and the suitability of classic subspace methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05363v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic sleep staging is essential for sleep assessment and disorder diagnosis. Most existing methods depend on one specific dataset and are limited to be generalized to other unseen datasets, for which the training data and testing data are from the same dataset. In this paper, we introduce domain generalization into automatic sleep staging and propose the task of generalizable sleep staging which aims to improve the model generalization ability to unseen datasets. Inspired by existing domain generalization methods, we adopt the feature alignment idea and propose a framework called SleepDG to solve it. Considering both of local salient features and sequential features are important for sleep staging, we propose a Multi-level Feature Alignment combining epoch-level and sequence-level feature alignment to learn domain-invariant feature representations. Specifically, we design an Epoch-level Feature Alignment to align the feature distribution of each single sleep epoch among different domains, and a Sequence-level Feature Alignment to minimize the discrepancy of sequential features among different domains. SleepDG is validated on five public datasets, achieving the state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Radar Anti-jamming Strategy Learning via Domain-knowledge Enhanced Online Convex Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamic competition between radar and jammer systems presents a significant challenge for modern Electronic Warfare (EW), as current active learning approaches still lack sample efficiency and fail to exploit jammer's characteristics. In this paper, the competition between a frequency agile radar and a Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM)-based intelligent jammer is considered. We introduce an Online Convex Optimization (OCO) framework designed to illustrate this adversarial interaction. Notably, traditional OCO algorithms exhibit suboptimal sample efficiency due to the limited information obtained per round. To address the limitations, two refined algorithms are proposed, utilizing unbiased gradient estimators that leverage the unique attributes of the jammer system. Sub-linear theoretical results on both static regret and universal regret are provided, marking a significant improvement in OCO performance. Furthermore, simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithms outperform common OCO baselines, suggesting the potential for effective deployment in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS), which consists of numerous passive elements, has recently emerged in wireless communication systems as a promising technology providing 360$^\circ$ coverage and better performance. In our research, we introduce an active STAR-RIS (ASTARS)-aided integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system designed to optimize the radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), enhancing detection and signal transmission efficiency. The introduction of an ISAC system aims to improve both communication efficiency and sensing capabilities. Also, we employ orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to address the frequency-selective fading problem. Furthermore, we evaluate the radar sensing capabilities by examining the range and velocity, and assess the performance through the mean-squared error (MSE) of their estimations. Our simulation results demonstrate that ASTARS outperforms STAR-RIS in our system configurations, and that the proposed optimization approach further enhances the system performance. Additionally, we confirm that an increase in the subcarrier spacing can reduce the transmission bit error rate (BER) under high-velocity conditions.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Sample Size in Reconstructing Noisy Graph Signals: A Theoretical Characterisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing a signal on a graph from noisy observations of a subset of the vertices is a fundamental problem in the field of graph signal processing. This paper investigates how sample size affects reconstruction error in the presence of noise via an in-depth theoretical analysis of the two most common reconstruction methods in the literature, least-squares reconstruction (LS) and graph-Laplacian regularised reconstruction (GLR). Our theorems show that at sufficiently low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), under these reconstruction methods we may simultaneously decrease sample size and decrease average reconstruction error. We further show that at sufficiently low SNRs, for LS reconstruction we have a $\Lambda$-shaped error curve and for GLR reconstruction, a sample size of $ \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is the total number of vertices, results in lower reconstruction error than near full observation. We present thresholds on the SNRs, $\tau$ and $\tau_{GLR}$, below which the error is non-monotonic, and illustrate these theoretical results with experiments across multiple random graph models, sampling schemes and SNRs. These results demonstrate that any decision in sample-size choice has to be made in light of the noise levels in the data.</description>

      <title>A Fast Multitaper Power Spectrum Estimation in Nonuniformly Sampled Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonuniformly sampled signals are prevalent in real-world applications, but their power spectra estimation, usually from a finite number of samples of a single realization, presents a significant challenge. The optimal solution, which uses Bronez Generalized Prolate Spheroidal Sequence (GPSS), is computationally demanding and often impractical for large datasets. This paper describes a fast nonparametric method, the MultiTaper NonUniform Fast Fourier Transform (MTNUFFT), capable of estimating power spectra with lower computational burden. The method first derives a set of optimal tapers through cubic spline interpolation on a nominal analysis band. These tapers are subsequently shifted to other analysis bands using the NonUniform FFT (NUFFT). The estimated spectral power within the band is the average power at the outputs of the taper set. This algorithm eliminates the needs for time-consuming computation to solve the Generalized Eigenvalue Problem (GEP), thus reducing the computational load from $O(N^4)$ to $O(N \log N + N \log(1/\epsilon))$, which is comparable with the NUFFT. The statistical properties of the estimator are assessed using Bronez GPSS theory, revealing that the bias of estimates and variance bound of the MTNUFFT estimator are identical to those of the optimal estimator. Furthermore, the degradation of bias bound may serve as a measure of the deviation from optimality. The performance of the estimator is evaluated using both simulation and real-world data, demonstrating its practical applicability. The code of the proposed fast algorithm is available on GitHub (https://github.com/jiecui/mtnufft).</description>

      <title>Green Operations of SWIPT Networks: The Role of End-User Devices</title>

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) devices often come with batteries of limited capacity that are not easily replaceable or rechargeable, and that constrain significantly the sensing, computing, and communication tasks that they can perform. The Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) paradigm addresses this issue by delivering power wirelessly to energy-harvesting IoT devices with the same signal used for information transfer. For their peculiarity, these networks require specific energy-efficient planning and management approaches. However, to date, it is not clear what are the most effective strategies for managing a SWIPT network for energy efficiency. In this paper, we address this issue by developing an analytical model based on stochastic geometry, accounting for the statistics of user-perceived performance and base station scheduling. We formulate an optimization problem for deriving the energy optimal configuration as a function of the main system parameters, and we propose a genetic algorithm approach to solve it. Our results enable a first-order evaluation of the most effective strategies for energy-efficient provisioning of power and communications in a SWIPT network. We show that the service capacity brought about by users brings energy-efficient dynamic network provisioning strategies that radically differ from those of networks with no wireless power transfer.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Majority Vote Computation with Modulation on Conjugate-Reciprocal Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a new approach to compute the majority vote (MV) function based on modulation on conjugate-reciprocal zeros (MOCZ) and introduce three different methods. In these methods, each transmitter maps the votes to the zeros of a Huffman polynomial, and the corresponding polynomial coefficients are transmitted. The receiver evaluates the polynomial constructed by the elements of the superposed sequence at conjugate-reciprocal zero pairs and detects the MV with a direct zero-testing (DiZeT) decoder. With differential and index-based encoders, we eliminate the need for power-delay information at the receiver while improving the computation error rate (CER) performance. The proposed methods do not use instantaneous channel state information at the transmitters and receiver. Thus, they provide robustness against phase and time synchronization errors. We theoretically analyze the CERs of the proposed methods. Finally, we demonstrate their efficacy in a distributed median computation scenario.</description>
