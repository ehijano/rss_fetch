      <title>Structural Chirality from Inverse Semigroups to Twisted Groupoid $C^*$-Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a structural theory of chirality for inverse semigroups and show how it propagates canonically to \'{e}tale groupoids and twisted groupoid $C^*$-algebras. Starting from inverse semigroup data equipped with admissible twist information, we construct a canonical twisted universal groupoid in the sense of Paterson and introduce a mirror correspondence encoding intrinsic asymmetry. Our main result identifies a structural obstruction to mirror self-duality at the level of twisted universal groupoids and shows that this obstruction descends to an obstruction for the associated reduced twisted groupoid $C^*$-algebra to be isomorphic to its opposite. The framework is representation-independent, yet compatible with concrete germ groupoid models, and provides a unified bridge between partial symmetries, groupoid structures, and analytic invariants in noncommutative operator algebras.</description>

      <title>Mayer--Vietoris and Twisted \v{C}ech Spectral Sequences for C$^*$-Algebras with Free Quantum Group Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a Mayer--Vietoris/\v{C}ech viewpoint on $K$-theory for crossed products by discrete quantum groups, emphasizing how local-to-global gluing data interacts with quantum-group coefficients. Starting from a $G$-equivariant ideal cover and the associated Mayer--Vietoris six-term exact sequence, we package the resulting $K$-theoretic computation into a \v{C}ech-type spectral sequence whose $E^1$-page is explicitly described by iterated intersections. We then introduce a minimal ``twisted'' gluing mechanism controlled by a $\mathbb Z/2$-valued \v{C}ech $2$-cocycle and an involutive automorphism of the coefficient algebra. Under a Kirchberg--UCT hypothesis on the quantum-group crossed-product coefficient, the twist produces a nontrivial differential $d_2$ identified as $\varphi_*-\mathrm{id}$ on coefficient $K$-theory. In a concrete regime where the coefficient $K$-groups are cyclic (e.g.\ order $3$), the differential becomes an isomorphism and forces a $K$-theoretic obstruction to Morita triviality. This yields a conceptual mechanism for producing non-Morita-trivial twisted C$^*$-algebras with quantum-group crossed-product fibers, detected purely by Mayer--Vietoris/\v{C}ech data.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative coarse metric geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by coarse geometry and the classical role of Roe algebras as large-scale invariants of proper metric spaces, we show that proper quantum metric spaces as introduced by Latr\'emoli\`ere are noncommutative coarse spaces. This further allows us to develop a bridge between Latr\'emoli\`ere's framework and the W*-metric approach to quantum metric spaces. Furthermore, we construct Roe algebras for locally compact quantum metric spaces and verify that they recover the classical Roe algebras in the commutative case. We furthermore apply this framework to some examples of locally compact quantum metric spaces and show that it leads to the natural conclusion. Finally we use this framework to introduce notions of higher index theory for locally compact quantum metric spaces.</description>

      <title>The smallest quantum Mackey deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When $G$ is a real semisimple group, there is a surprising interplay between its representation theory and that of its motion group $G_0$, known as the Mackey analogy. The present paper extends this analogy to the framework of $q$-deformations, for $G = \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. In fact, we construct a deformation of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ parametrized by $(q,t) \in \mathbb{R}_+^* \times \mathbb{R}$, where $q$ is the quantization parameter and $t$ is the Mackey parameter. We show how the representation theory varies along this deformation and we prove an analogue of the Connes-Kasparov isomorphism for the $q$-deformed reduced group C*-algebra.</description>

      <title>A Homogeneous Nullstellensatz for Joint Invariant Subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jurij Vol\v{c}i\v{c} conjectured that a noncommutative polynomial $g$ belongs to the unital $\mathbb{K}$-algebra generated by finitely many noncommutative polynomials if and only if, for matrices of every size, every joint invariant subspace of the evaluations of the generators is also invariant under the evaluation of $g$. In this paper, we establish a homogeneous Nullstellensatz for joint invariant subspaces by proving that this equivalence holds whenever the generators are homogeneous. In contrast, we demonstrate that the statement fails in the general case, thereby settling the conjecture completely.</description>

      <title>Hyponormal contractions and analytic shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyponormal operators are known to be among the most difficult operators to analyze. In this work, we focus on two finite types of hyponormal operators. The first type becomes analytic shifts, while the second type admits analytic models. A basic model for hyponormal operators plays a key role in our analysis.</description>

      <title>The Mackey bijection as a stratified equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is about the Mackey analogy between the tempered representation theory of a real reductive group and that of its Cartan motion group. We consider the embedding of reduced C*-algebras constructed recently in connection with the Mackey bijection, and study its behavior on certain natural stratifications of the tempered duals. We formulate our result using a notion of stratified equivalence inspired by the study of the smooth dual of $p$-adic groups via the structure of Hecke algebras, in particular by the work of Aubert, Baum, Plymen and Solleveld. We derive related new topological properties of the Mackey bijection. We also analyze the behavior of the Mackey embedding on a stratification of reduced C*-algebras attached to a partition of the tempered dual into particularly elementary pieces, introduced in recent work of Bradd, Higson and Yuncken.</description>

      <title>Morita equivalence for operator systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.12031v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define $\Delta$-equivalence for operator systems and show that it is identical to stable isomorphism. We define $\Delta$-contexts and bihomomorphism contexts and show that two operator systems are $\Delta$-equivalent if and only if they can be placed in a $\Delta$-context, equivalently, in a bihomomorphism context. We show that nuclearity for a variety of tensor products is an invariant for $\Delta$-equivalence and that function systems are $\Delta$-equivalent precisely when they are order isomorphic. We prove that $\Delta$-equivalent operator systems have equivalent categories of representations. As an application, we characterise $\Delta$-equivalence of graph operator systems in combinatorial terms. We examine a notion of Morita embedding for operator systems, showing that mutually $\Delta$-embeddable operator systems have orthogonally complemented $\Delta$-equivalent corners when represented in the double dual of their C*-envelopes.</description>
