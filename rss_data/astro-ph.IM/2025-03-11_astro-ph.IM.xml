      <title>High resolution spectra of the [6297-6303] and [6361-6367] Angstr{\"o}m domains (including forbidden OI lines) of the Sun and brightest stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dataset of high resolution spectra of the Sun and ten bright stars of the domains [6297-6303] and [6361-6367] Angtr{\"o}m. Solar spectra were obtained in the quiet Sun at various distances from disk centre with the ground based Meudon Solar Tower and Themis telescope (12 m{\AA} resolution) and with the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) onboard the Hinode satellite (21 m{\AA} resolution). Spectra of 10 bright stars (magnitude \&lt; 2) were also got with Themis at 12 m{\AA} resolution. These spectral domains contain the faint and forbidden OI lines (6300.31 {\AA} and 6363.79 {\AA}) that are useful for the research of Oxygen abundance. The spectra shown here are freely available in FITS format to the research community.</description>

      <title>10 Years of Archival High-Resolution NIR Spectra: The Raw and Reduced IGRINS Spectral Archive (RRISA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) is a compact, high-resolution (R~45,000) near-infrared spectrograph spanning 1.45 to 2.45 um in a single exposure. We introduce the Raw and Reduced IGRINS Spectral Archive (RRISA), which provides public data access for all non-proprietary IGRINS data taken at McDonald Observatory's Harlan J. Smith Telescope, the Lowell Discovery Telescope (formerly Discovery Channel Telescope), and Gemini South. RRISA provides access to raw files, reduced data products, and cross-matched IGRINS targets with the SIMBAD, 2MASS, Gaia DR3, APOGEE2 DR17, and PASTEL catalogs. We also introduce version 3 of the IGRINS data reduction pipeline, IGRINS PLP v3, which implements an improved cosmic ray correction, pattern noise removal, and a new flexure correction that reduces telluric residuals. RRISA and supporting information can be found at http://igrinscontact.github.io.</description>

      <title>ELT-METIS imaging simulations for disks and envelopes associated with FU Ori-type objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the detectability of extended mid-infrared (MIR) emission associated with FU-Ori type objects (FUors) using the METIS coronagraphs on the 39-m Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). The imaging simulations were made for three representative filters ($\lambda$=3.8, 4.8, and 11.3 micron) of the METIS instrument. We demonstrate that the detectability of the extended MIR emission using these coronagraphs is highly dependent on the uncertain nature of the central FUor and its circumstellar environment in various contexts. These contexts are: (A) whether the central radiation source is either a flat self-luminous accretion disk or a star at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, (B) the size of the accretion disk for the bright central MIR emission at milliarcsecond scales, (C) whether the extended emission is due to either an optically thick disk or an optically thin envelope, and (D) dust grain models. Observations at $\lambda$=3.8 micron will allow us to detect the extended emission in many cases, while the number of cases with detection may significantly decrease toward longer wavelengths due to the fainter nature of the extended emission and high thermal background noise. In some cases, the presence of a binary companion can significantly hamper detections of the extended MIR emission. NIR and MIR imaging observations at existing 8-m class telescopes, prior to the METIS observations, will be useful for (1) reducing the many model uncertainties and (2) searching for binary companions associated with FUors, therefore determining the best observing strategy using METIS.</description>

      <title>A Centroiding Algorithm for Point-source Trails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrometric measurements are significantly challenged by the relative motion between the point source and the telescope, primarily due to the difficulty in accurately determining the position of the point source at the mid-exposure moment. Especially when the trail is irregular in shape or results from nonuniform relative motion, determining the centroid of such a trail becomes significantly more challenging. To address this issue, a new centroiding algorithm for point-source trails has been developed. This algorithm employs a piecewise linear model to approximate the irregular trajectory of a point source. An estimated intensity distribution of the trail is constructed by integrating the point-spread function with the approximated trajectory. The cost function is defined as the difference between the estimated and observed trail intensity distributions, with an added smoothness constraint term. Optimizing this cost function yields a refined trajectory fit. A coarse-to-fine iterative approach is used to progressively converge on the true trajectory of the point source, ultimately determining both the trail's centroid and the trajectory of the point source. The efficacy of the algorithm is validated using synthetic images. Furthermore, this technique is applied to Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem images of several inner Saturnian satellites, successfully processing 267 astrometric observations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in real astronomical applications.</description>

      <title>Optical photon-counting observation of the Crab pulsar with Kanata telescope using prototype IMONY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed an optical photon-counting imaging system, IMONY, as an instrument for short-scale time-domain astronomy. In this study, we utilized a Geiger avalanche photodiode array with a $4\times 4$ pixel configuration, with each pixel measuring \SI{100}{\micro m}. We developed a dedicated analog frontend board and constructed a data acquisition system with an FPGA to time-stamp each photon with a time resolution of \SI{100}{\ns}. We mounted a prototype model of the system on the 1.5-m Kanata telescope, intending to observe the Crab pulsar and conduct joint observations with Iitate and Usuda radio telescopes in Japan. We successfully demonstrated that IMONY could image the Crab pulsar as an expected point source and acquire the well-known pulse shape. We found that the time lag between the optical and radio main pulses was $304\pm$\SI{35}{\mu s}, consistent with previous studies.</description>

      <title>New CCD Driving Technique to Suppress Anomalous Charge Intrusion from Outside the Imaging Area for Soft X-ray Imager of Xtend onboard XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Soft X-ray Imager (SXI) is an X-ray CCD camera of the Xtend system onboard the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM), which was successfully launched on September 7, 2023 (JST). During ground cooling tests of the CCDs in 2020/2021, using the flight-model detector housing, electronic boards, and a mechanical cooler, we encountered an unexpected issue. Anomalous charges appeared outside the imaging area of the CCDs and intruded into the imaging area, causing pulse heights to stick to the maximum value over a wide region. Although this issue has not occurred in subsequent tests or in orbit so far, it could seriously affect the imaging and spectroscopic performance of the SXI if it were to happen in the future. Through experiments with non-flight-model detector components, we successfully reproduced the issue and identified that the anomalous charges intrude via the potential structure created by the charge injection electrode at the top of the imaging area. To prevent anomalous charge intrusion and maintain imaging and spectroscopic performance that satisfies the requirements, even if this issue occurs in orbit, we developed a new CCD driving technique. This technique is different from the normal operation in terms of potential structure and its changes during imaging and charge injection. In this paper, we report an overview of the anomalous charge issue, the related potential structures, the development of the new CCD driving technique to prevent the issue, the imaging and spectroscopic performance of the new technique, and the results of experiments to investigate the cause of anomalous charges.</description>

      <title>Analysing the flux stability of stellar calibrator candidates with TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ESA space mission Ariel requires bright sources that are stable at the level of 100ppm over 6 hours in order to accurately measure exoplanet atmospheres through transmission spectroscopy. To ensure this, in-flight instrument calibration can be performed by observing stellar calibrators. In this study, a stellar calibrator candidate list distributed over the sky is created and a flux variability analysis is performed to identify the best stellar calibrators for transit spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres with Ariel. A starting candidate sample of 1937 solar-type stars is created using the all-sky surveys Two Micron All Sky Survey and Gaia. Using stellar light curves from the Transit Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), the flux variability of each star is characterised by computing its Lomb-Scargle periodogram and reduced chi-squared. This enables the elimination of stars with detectable variability from the sample. Approximately 22.2% of stars from the starting sample pass the selection as potential calibrators. These do not all necessarily meet Ariel's stability requirement, although some will. No correlation between flux stability and stellar properties is found, as long as the correct value ranges for the parameters are chosen, like a surface temperature between 5000 and 6300K. The only exception is stellar magnitude: Noise in TESS data increases as stars get dimmer, so, a high percentage of faint stars passes the selection since their variability is more likely hidden within the inherent TESS noise. Contrarily, stars brighter than 5mag cannot be used as calibrators. A list of 430 promising bright calibration targets distributed over the sky has been selected. These can potentially be used as stellar calibrators for the Ariel mission. Targets from this list will have to be further studied to determine which ones possess a flux stability better than 100ppm over 6 hours.</description>

      <title>On the completeness and reliability of visual source extraction : an examination of eight thousand data cubes by eye</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [Edited for arXiv] Source extraction in HI radio surveys is still often performed using visual inspection, but the efficacy of such procedures lacks rigorous quantitative assessment due to their laborious nature. Algorithmic methods are often preferred due to their repeatable results and speed. I here quantitatively assess visual source extraction using a large sample of artificial sources and a comparatively rapid source extraction tool, and compare the results with those from automatic techniques. I injected 4,232 sources into a total of 8,500 emission-free data cubes, with at most one source per cube. Sources covered a wide range of signal-to-noise and velocity widths. I blindly searched all cubes, measuring the completeness and reliability for pairs of signal-to-noise and line width values. Smaller control tests were performed to account for the possible biases in the search, which gave results in good agreement with the main experiment. I also searched cubes injected with artificial sources using algorithmic extractors, and compare these results with a set of catalogues independently reported from real observational data. I find that the results of visual extraction follow a tight relation between integrated signal-to-noise and completeness. Visual extraction compares favourably in efficacy with the algorithmic methods, tending to recover a higher fraction of fainter sources. Visual source extraction can be a surprisingly rapid procedure which gives higher completeness levels than automatic techniques, giving predictable, quantifiable results which are not strongly subject to the whims of the observer. For recovering the faintest features, algorithmic extractors can be competitive with visual inspection but cannot yet out-perform it, though their advantage in speed can be a significant compensating factor.</description>

      <title>GHOST commissioning science results -- IV: Chemodynamical analyses of Milky Way satellites Sagittarius II and Aquarius II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Gemini/GHOST high-resolution spectra of five stars observed in two low surface brightness Milky Way satellites, Sagittarius II (Sgr2) and Aquarius II (Aqu2). For Aqu2, the velocities and metallicities of the two stars are consistent with membership in a dark matter-dominated ultra faint dwarf galaxy (UFD). The chemical abundance ratios suggest inefficient star formation from only one or a few supernovae (e.g., low Na, Sr, Ba), and enriched potassium (K) from super-AGB stars. For Sgr2, the velocity and metallicity dispersions of its members are not clearly resolved and our detailed chemical abundances show typical ratios for metal-poor stars, with low dispersions. There is only one exception - we report the discovery of an r-process enhanced star (Sgr2584, [Eu/Fe]= $+0.7 \pm 0.2 $; thus, an r-I star). As r-I stars are found in both UFDs (Tuc III, Tuc IV, Grus II) and globular clusters (M15 and M92), then this does not help to further classify the nature of Sgr2. Our exploration of Sgr2 demonstrates the difficulty in classifying some of the faintest (ambiguous) satellites. We advocate for additional diagnostics in analysing the ambiguous systems, such as exploring radial segregation (by mass and/or chemistry), N-body simulations, and the need for dark matter to survive Galactic tidal effects. The spectra analysed in this paper were taken as part of the GHOST commissioning observations, testing faint observation limits (G &lt; 18.8) and the single and double IFU observing modes.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Impact of LSST $u$-band Survey Strategy on Photometric Redshift Estimation and the Detection of Lyman-break Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will conduct the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), promising to discover billions of galaxies out to redshift 7, using six photometric bands ($ugrizy$) spanning the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared. The exact number of and quality of information about these galaxies will depend on survey depth in these six bands, which in turn depends on the LSST survey strategy: i.e., how often and how long to expose in each band. $u$-band depth is especially important for photometric redshift (photo-z) estimation and for detection of high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs). In this paper we use a simulated galaxy catalog and an analytic model for the LBG population to study how recent updates and proposed changes to Rubin's $u$-band throughput and LSST survey strategy impact photo-z accuracy and LBG detection. We find that proposed variations in $u$-band strategy have a small impact on photo-z accuracy for $z &lt; 1.5$ galaxies, but the outlier fraction, scatter, and bias for higher redshift galaxies varies by up to 50%, depending on the survey strategy considered. The number of $u$-band dropout LBGs at $z \sim 3$ is also highly sensitive to the $u$-band depth, varying by up to 500%, while the number of $griz$-band dropouts is only modestly affected. Under the new $u$-band strategy recommended by the Rubin Survey Cadence Optimization Committee, we predict $u$-band dropout number densities of $110$ deg$^{-2}$ (3200 deg$^{-2}$) in year 1 (10) of LSST. We discuss the implications of these results for LSST cosmology.</description>

      <title>Picking-up Local GRB Candidates Based on Their Host Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid identification of candidates of high-value gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), including both high-$z$ and local events, is crucial for outlining subsequent observational strategy. In this paper, we present a model that enables an on-duty astronomer to rapidly identify candidates of local GRBs prior to spectroscopy, provided that these events have been localized at an arcseconds precision. After taking into account the mass distribution of the host galaxies of GRBs, the model calculates the two-dimensional cross-match probabilities between a localized GRB and its surrounding nearby galaxies, and then returns the best match with the highest probability. The model is evaluated not only by the observed GRB sample with redshifts up to $z=4$, but also through the simulated GRB samples. By using the recently published GLADE+ galaxies catalog with a completeness of 95\% up to 500Mpc, along with the NED-LVS catalog, the Precision and Recall of the model are determined to be 0.23-0.33 and 0.75, respectively, at the best performance. A dedicated web service, which will be integrated into the SVOM Science User Support System, has been developed to deploy the model.</description>

      <title>Detecting kHz gravitons from a neutron star merger with a multi-mode resonant mass detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a multi-mode bar consisting of mass elements of decreasing size for the implementation of a gravitational version of the photo-electric effect through the stimulated absorption of up to kHz gravitons from a binary neutron star merger and post-merger. We find that the multi-mode detector has normal modes that retain the coupling strength to the gravitational wave of the largest mass-element, while only having an effective mass comparable to the mass of the smallest element. This allows the normal modes to have graviton absorption rates due to the tonne-scale largest mass, while the single graviton absorption process in the normal mode could be resolved through energy measurements of a mass-element in-principle smaller than pico-gram scale. We argue the feasibility of directly counting gravito-phonons in the bar through energy measurements of the end mass. This improves the transduction of the single-graviton signal, enhancing the feasibility of detecting single gravitons.</description>

      <title>Computing Anharmonic Infrared Spectra of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Using Machine-Learning Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are key contributors to interstellar aromatic infrared (IR) bands. However, current spectral databases for IR emission analysis are limited by the omission of vibrational anharmonicity and temperature effects, primarily because of the high computational cost of conventional quantum chemical calculations (QCCs). In this work, we present a machine learning-based molecular dynamics (MLMD) approach that efficiently computes anharmonic IR spectra while incorporating temperature effects. MLMD achieves predictive accuracy comparable to that of QCCs but with significantly reduced computational cost, scaling linearly with the number of atoms in the system. We applied MLMD to calculate the anharmonic spectra of 1704 PAHs in the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database with up to 216 carbon atoms, demonstrating its capability for high-throughput spectral calculations of large molecular systems. Our results highlight MLMD's potential to enable the development of extensive molecular spectral datasets, enhancing data-driven analyses of astronomical IR spectra, particularly in anticipation of upcoming data from the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>SIROCCO: A Publicly Available Monte Carlo Ionization and Radiative Transfer Code for Astrophysical Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Outflows are critical components of many astrophysical systems, including accreting compact binaries and active galactic nuclei (AGN). These outflows can significantly affect a system's evolution and alter its observational appearance by reprocessing the radiation produced by the central engine. Sirocco (Simulating Ionization and Radiation in Outflows Created by Compact Objects - or "the code formerly known as Python") is a Sobolev-based Monte Carlo ionization and radiative transfer code. It is designed to simulate the spectra produced by any system with an azimuthally-symmetric outflow, from spherical stellar winds to rotating, biconical accretion disc winds. Wind models can either be parametrized or imported, e.g. from hydrodynamical simulations. The radiation sources include an optically thick accretion disc and various central sources with flexible spectra and geometries. The code tracks the "photon packets" produced by the sources in any given simulation as they traverse and interact with the wind. The code assumes radiative near-equilibrium, so the thermal and ionization state can be determined iteratively from these interactions. Once the physical properties in the wind have converged, Sirocco can be used to generate synthetic spectra at a series of observer sightlines. Here, we describe the physical assumptions, operation, performance and limitations of the code. We validate it against tardis, cmfgen and cloudy, finding good agreement, and present illustrative synthetic spectra from disc winds in cataclysmic variables, tidal disruption events, AGN and X-ray binaries. Sirocco is publicly available on GitHub, alongside its associated data, documentation and sample input files covering a wide range of astrophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Bayesian model selection for equation of state of cold neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a computational framework, Bayesian Evidence calculation fOr Model Selection (BEOMS) to evaluate multiple Bayesian model selection methods in the context of determining the equation of state (EOS) for cold neutron star (NS), focusing on their performance with current and next-generation gravitational wave (GW) observatories. We conduct a systematic comparison of various EOS models by using posterior distributions obtained from EOS-agnostic Bayesian inference of binary parameters applied to GWs from a population of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. The cumulative evidence for each model is calculated in a multi-dimensional parameter space characterized by neutron star masses and tidal deformabilities. Our findings indicate that Bayesian model selection is most effective when performed in the two-dimensional subspace of component mass and tidal deformability, requiring fewer events to distinguish between EOS models with high confidence. Furthermore, we establish a relationship between the precision of tidal deformability measurements and the accuracy of model selection, taking into account the evolving sensitivities of current and planned GW observatories. BEOMS offers computational efficiency and can be adapted to execute model selection for gravitational wave data from other sources.</description>
