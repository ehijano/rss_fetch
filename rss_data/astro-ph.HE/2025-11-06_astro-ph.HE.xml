      <title>Quasi-Periodic Polarized Emissions from Kink Structure in Magnetized Relativistic Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent polarimetric observations of blazars indicate the development of current-driven (CD) kink instability after passing the recollimation shocks in the relativistic jets and association with quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). To investigate multi-wavelength polarized features of CD kink instability in jets, we develop {\tt RaptorP}, a new special relativistic module of the polarized General Relativistic Radiative Transfer (GRRT) code {\tt RAPTOR}. Based on 3D SRMHD simulations of over-pressured magnetized jets, we find that jet images vary at different frequencies. At low frequencies, the emission comes from the turbulent ambient medium surrounding the jet that obscures the inner jet structure. Electronic Vector Position Angle (EVPA) patterns are perpendicular to the jet propagation direction, indicating a dominance of the poloidal magnetic field. At high frequencies, bright knots and twisted kink structures appear, and EVPA patterns are consistent with a toroidal magnetic field. We also find that QPOs in light curves of intensity and linear polarization (degree and angle). The peak frequency in Power Spectral Densities (PSDs) is well-matched with the rotation period of the kink structure in relativistic jets. It shows an anti-correlation between total intensity and the degree of polarization at a lower inclination angle. Our findings, based on realistic polarized radiation calculations, will explain the observational signatures seen in blazars.</description>

      <title>Study of Four nulling pulsars with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03150v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of 4 nulling pulsars with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). For PSR J1649+2533, our results suggest mode changing rather than subpulse drifting as previously reported at lower frequencies. For PSR J1752+2359, we confirm its quasi-periodic switching between distinct emission states, but further show that the so-called "quasi-null" or "RRAT-like" state actually consists of persistent low-level emission superposed with occasional bright pulses. For PSR J1819+1305, our data confirm the modulation reported earlier, while additional weaker features are also seen. For PSR J1916+1023, we detect both nulling and subpulse drifting, but find no clear evidence of direct interaction between them. These results provide new insights into the diverse manifestations of pulsar nulling, highlight the capability of FAST to detect subtle emission states, and add to the growing body of work on pulsar emission variability.</description>

      <title>Exploring the spectral characteristics of the periodic burster 4U 1323-62: Type-I X-ray burst and persistent emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the results obtained by the analysis of persistent and type-I thermonuclear X-ray burst emission observed from the periodic burster 4U 1323-62. These analyses are based on the NuSTAR observation performed on 2024 August 7 for a total exposure of around 90 ks. The persistent emission is well described by an absorbed thermal Comptonization model. An absorption edge is also detected at an energy of approximately 7.87 keV, which indicates the presence of absorbing material in the vicinity of this system. Six bursts have been observed during this observation, wherein we find the burst recurrence time to be approximately 4.52 hr. All the bursts exhibit the characteristics of a sharp rise and exponential decay. We perform the time-resolved spectroscopy of the burst spectra described by a model consisting of thermal emission from the neutron star surface and a varying persistent emission component to study the evolution of burst parameters. The enhancement of the persistent emission during burst exposure is characterized by the scaling parameter f a, which reflects the increasing strength of the burst-disc interaction with burst intensity, likely driven by Poynting-Robertson drag. The spectral analysis of bursts estimate the average apparent blackbody emitting radius of the neutron star to lie within 1.5-3.5 km. The ignition depths computed from the burst parameters indicate short Type-I thermonuclear bursts from a mixed hydrogen-helium fuel layer.</description>

      <title>Measuring scattering variations in pulsar timing observations: A test of the fidelity of current methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The turbulent nature of the ionised interstellar medium (IISM) causes dispersion measure (DM) and scattering variations in pulsar timing measurements. To improve precision of gravitational wave measurements, pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations have begun the use of sophisticated and intricate noise modelling techniques such as modelling stochastic variations induced by the turbulent IISM and quasi-deterministic processes attributed to discrete structures. However, the reliability of these techniques has not been studied in detail, and it is unclear whether the recovered processes are physical or if they are impacted by misspecification. In this work, we present an analysis to test the efficacy of IISM noise models based on the data from the MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array (MPTA) 4.5-year data release. We first performed multi-frequency, long-length (500 refractive length scale) simulations of multipath propagation in the IISM to study the properties of scattering variations under a variety of scattering conditions. The results of our simulations show the possibility of significant radio-frequency decorrelation in the scattering variations, particularly for the anisotropic scattering medium. Our analysis of the observed DM and scattering variations using the MPTA 4.5-year data set shows that there can be apparent anticorrelations between DM and scattering variations, which we attribute to the model fitting methods. We also report a possibility that plasma underdensities might exist along the sight lines of PSR J1431$-$5740 and PSR J1802$-$2124. Finally, using simulations, we show that the IISM noise models can result in the apparent measurement of strong frequency dependence of scattering variations observed in the MPTA data set. Our analysis shows that improvements in the IISM noise modelling techniques are necessary to accurately measure the IISM properties.</description>

      <title>The First Upper Bound on the Non-Stationary Gravitational Wave Background and its Implication on the High Redshift Binary Black Hole Merger Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high redshift merger rate and mass distribution of black hole binaries (BHBs) is a direct probe to distinguish astrophysical black holes (ABHs) and primordial black holes (PBHs), which can be studied using the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background (SGWB). The conventional analyses solely based on the power spectrum are limited in constraining the properties of the underlying source population under the assumption of a non-sporadic Gaussian distribution. However, recent studies have shown that SGWB will be sporadic and non-Gaussian in nature, which will cause non-zero 'spectral correlation' depending on the high redshift merger rate and mass distribution of the compact objects. In this work, we present the first spectral covariance analysis of the SGWB using data from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration during the third and the first part of the fourth observing runs. Our analysis indicates that the current spectral correlation is consistent with non-stationary noise, yielding no detection from the current data and providing only upper bounds between frequencies in the range 25 Hz to 100 Hz. This upper bound on the spectral correlation translates to the upper bounds on the mass-dependent merger rate of PBHs between $2.4\times10^{4}$ and $2.3\times10^{2} \rm ~Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ (at ${\rm z} = 1 $ ) with a log-normal mass distribution with median masses between $20 ~M_{\odot}$ and $120 ~M_{\odot}$. This provides a stringent upper bound on the PBH merger rate at high redshift and hence puts constraints on the PBH formation scenario even in the presence of large spatial clustering. In the future, detection of this signal will lead to direct evidence of the high-redshift black hole population using gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Search for Axion-Like Particles in High-Magnetic-Field Pulsars with NICER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) can couple to photons in strong magnetic fields, producing characteristic fluctuations in X-ray spectra. Using data from NASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition EXplorer (NICER), we analyzed three pulsars, PSR J2229+6114, PSR J1849-0001, and PSR B0531+21, to search for such features. Each spectrum was modeled with a sliding-window power-law fitting method to identify local deviations from the smooth continuum. From these analyses, we derived constraints on the axion-photon coupling constant $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ within a refined parameter space compared to previous studies, obtaining upper limits in the range $10^{-12}-10^{-14}GeV^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic variability from circumbinary discs around binary black holes during their post-decoupling epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present general-relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of inviscid circumbinary discs (CBDs) around near equal-mass binary black holes (BBH) in the binary-disc post-decoupling epoch. We use an approximate BBH spacetime with a post-Newtonian inspiral motion trajectory from ${\sim}80 (M/10^7 \mathrm{M_\odot}) \, \mbox{days}$ (separation of ${\sim}\,30$ gravitational radii) to ${\sim}100 (M/10^7 \mathrm{M_\odot}) \, \mbox{minutes}$ before merger. Initial data for the inspiral runs are produced from circular-orbits runs covering the formation timescale of the overdense {\lq}lump{\rq}, orbiting the CBD inner edge. The CBD non-axisymmetries (spiral waves and lump) lead to non-negligible angular momentum transport with effective viscosity ${\alpha_\mathrm{eff} \, {\sim} \, 10^{{-3}}{- 2\times 10}^{-2}}$. We post-process these simulations with a general-relativistic ray-tracing code to obtain synthetic observations in thermal emission. We find the lump and its associated electromagnetic (EM) modulation, already reported in the pre-decoupling epoch, to survive post-decoupling up until the end of the simulation. For LISA sources, our findings point to an active EM signature in UV during optimal gravitational wave source localization. For PTA sources and current BBH candidates detected through their optical periodicity: the lump{ in a low-viscosity CBD is a possible, though not unique, origin} for the observed periodicity.</description>

      <title>The strong Fe K line and spin of the black-hole X-ray binary MAXI J1631-479</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the transient black hole binary MAXI J1631--479 in its soft spectral state observed simultaneously by the NICER and NuSTAR instruments. Its puzzling feature is the presence of a strong and broad Fe K line, while the continuum consists of a strong disk blackbody and a very weak power-law tail. The irradiation of the disk by a power-law spectrum fitting the tail is much too weak to account for the strong line. Two solutions were proposed in the past. One invoked an intrinsic Fe K disk emission, and the other invoked disk irradiation by the returning blackbody emission. We instead find that the strong line is naturally explained by the irradiation of the disk by the spectrum from Comptonization of the disk blackbody by coronal relativistic electrons. The shape of the irradiating spectrum at $\lesssim$10 keV reflects that of the disk blackbody; it is strongly curved and has a higher flux than that of a fit with a power-law irradiation. That flux accounts for the line. While this result is independent of the physical model used for the disk intrinsic emission, the value of the fitted spin strongly depends on it. When using a Kerr disk model for a thin disk with a color correction, the fitted spin corresponds to a retrograde disk, unlikely for a Roche-lobe overflow binary. Then, a model accounting for both the disk finite thickness and radiative transfer yields a spin of $a_*\approx0.8$--0.9, which underlines the strong model-dependence of X-ray spin measurements.</description>

      <title>Stellar critical parameters in the uniform density approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar models are calculated in the approximation of a uniform density distribution. Variational method was used for determination of the boundary of a stability loss, for stellar masses in the range from 2 up to $10^5$ $M_{\odot}$. The effects of the general relativity had been taken into account. The equation of state in the temperature and density ranges $10^9 &lt; T &lt; 10^{10} K$, $10^5 &lt; \rho &lt; 10^{10}\,\frac{g}{cm^3}$ had been taken from the work of Imshennik and Nadyozhin (1965). The critical parameters for the values of entropy and stellar masses differ from more accurate values, obtained using a more complicated variant of accepted density distribution, not more than 12$\%$.</description>

      <title>Measuring accretion disc properties in the transitional millisecond pulsar PSR J1023+0038 using XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, NICER and Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether the accretion disc in the X-ray high-mode of transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSP) reaches near the neutron star surface by penetrating the magnetosphere is a crucial question with many implications, including for continuous gravitational wave emission from the pulsar. We attempt to answer this question for the tMSP PSR J1023+0038 by segregating high-mode data and performing detailed spectral analysis using the XMM-Newton EPIC-PN+MOS1+MOS2 joint observations, XMM-Newton+NuSTAR joint observations, NICER and Chandra individual observations during different epochs. With the sum of longest exposures ($\sim$202 ksec of high mode data from $\sim$364 ksec of total exposure), we performed a self-consistent spectral analysis and constrain the inner disc radius 16.8 $\pm$ 3.8 km with at least 3$\sigma$ significance. Such a measurement is found consistent with best-fit spectral values of inner disc radius from other observatory like NICER and a joint observations with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR within 3$\sigma$ limits. We also detect a Fe emission line at 6.45 keV, for the first time from a tMSP, in the Chandra spectrum with 99% significance with an upper limit of the inner disc radius of 21 R$_g$, supporting independently the fact that inner disc extends into neutron stars's magnetosphere during high mode. All results from our analysis imply that the accretion disc is significantly present and extended within the corotation radius of the neutron star in PSR J1023+0038 during the X-ray high-mode of the tMSP PSR J1023+0038. The measured range of inner disc radius is fully consistent with an independent analysis by Bhattacharyya (2020), which suggests continuous gravitational wave emission from this neutron star, and the standard model of X-ray pulsations in accreting MSPs.</description>

      <title>First Associated Neutrino Search for a Failed Supernova Candidate with Super-Kamiokande</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03470v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2024, a failed supernova candidate, M31-2014-DS1, was reported in the Andromeda galaxy (M31), located at a distance of approximately 770 kpc. In this paper, we search for neutrinos from this failed supernova using data from Super-Kamiokande (SK). Based on the estimated time of black hole formation inferred from optical and infrared observations, we define a search window for neutrino events in the SK data. Using this window, we develop a dedicated analysis method for failed supernovae and apply it to M31-2014-DS1, by conducting a cluster search using the timing and energy information of candidate events. No significant neutrino excess is observed within the search region. Consequently, we place an upper limit on the electron antineutrino luminosity from M31-2014-DS1 and discuss its implications for various failed SN models and their neutrino emission characteristics. Despite the 18 MeV threshold adopted to suppress backgrounds, the search remains sufficiently sensitive to constrain the Shen-TM1 EOS, yielding a 90% confidence level upper limit of 1.76 \times 10^{53} erg on the electron antineutrino luminosity, slightly above the expected value of 1.35 \times 10^{53} erg.</description>

      <title>X-Ray Observations of Old Nearby Supernovae: Constraints on Compact Object Populations and Late Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of the population of compact objects created in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are uncertain. X-ray observations years to decades after the explosions offer a way to gain insight into this, as hard X-ray emission from the central regions will emerge as the ejecta absorption decreases. Here we analyze and place upper limits on late-time X-ray emission in 242 nearby SNe, using 607 observations from Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift, and NuSTAR. We use absorption models based on 3D simulations of neutrino-driven explosions to account for absorption of emission from the compact objects by the asymmetric ejecta. We detect X-ray emission from 12 SNe, including four for the first time (SN 1982R, SN 1984J, SN 1992bu, and SN 2003gk), and several of the others at later epochs than before. The X-ray spectra of these SNe are consistent with interaction with the circumstellar medium (CSM), with the possible exception of SN 1979C, which shows an additional hard component, as also noted in previous studies at earlier epochs. This emission may be due to a pulsar wind nebula. Using the upper limits in the full sample, we also perform a population synthesis to constrain the fraction of SNe that produce pulsars and the properties of the pulsars themselves. We find that pulsar populations with mean initial spin periods $\gtrsim100\rm~ ms$ are favored. Finally, we note that the high luminosities of several of the SNe with CSM interaction imply interactions with dense shells.</description>

      <title>Broad Iron Line as a Relativistic Reflection from Warm Corona in AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present that the broad feature usually observed in X-ray spectra can be explained by a ray-traced emission from a two-slab system containing a dissipative, warm corona on top of an accretion disk in an AGN. Such an accretion flow is externally illuminated by X-ray radiation from a lamp located above a central SMBH. Thermal lines from highly ionized iron ions (FeXXV and FeXXVI), caused by both internal heating and reflection from the warm corona, can be integrated into an observed broad line profile due to the close vicinity of the SMBH. We investigate the dependence of the broad line profile by varying the SMBH spin parameter, viewing angle, lamp height, and dissipation factor. Our results introduce a new method to probe properties of the warm corona using high-resolution spectroscopic measurements. We use the photoionization code TITAN to compute local ion populations and emission line profiles, and the ray-tracing code GYOTO to include relativistic effects on the outgoing X-ray spectrum. In our models, the temperature of the inner atmosphere covering the disk can reach values of 10^7 - 10^8 K due to internal warm corona dissipation and external illumination, which is adequate for generating the highly ionized iron lines. These lines can undergo significant gravitational redshift near the black hole, leading to a prominent spectral feature centered around 6.4 keV. For all computed models, the relativistic corrections shift highly ionized iron lines to the X-ray region, usually attributed to fluorescent emission from the illuminated skin of an accretion disk. Hence, in the case of a warm corona covering the inner disk regions, the resulting theoretical line profile under strong gravity is a sum of different iron line transitions, and those originating from highly ionized iron contribute the most to the observed total line profile in AGN.</description>

      <title>The Trace Anomaly at Neutron Star Centers: Minimum or Not?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the equation of state (EOS) $P(\varepsilon)$ of neutron star (NS) matter has been extensively studied, the EOS-parameter $\phi = P/\varepsilon$ or equivalently the dimensionless trace anomaly $\Delta = 1/3 - \phi$, which quantifies the balance between pressure $P$ and energy density $\varepsilon$, remains far less explored, especially in NS cores. Its bounds and density profile carry crucial information about the nature of superdense matter. Physically, the EOS-parameter $\phi$ represents the mean stiffness of matter accumulated from the stellar surface up to a given density. Based on the intrinsic structure of the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations, we show that $\phi$ decreases monotonically outward from the NS center, independent of any specific input NS EOS model. Furthermore, observational evidence of a peak in the speed-of-sound squared (SSS) density-profile near the center effectively rules out a valley and a subsequent peak in the radial profile of $\phi$ at similar densities, reinforcing its monotonic decrease. These model-independent relations impose strong constraints on the near-center behavior of the EOS-parameter $\phi$, particularly demonstrating that the mean stiffness (or equivalently $\Delta$) reaches a local maximum (minimum) at the center.</description>

      <title>AppleCiDEr II: SpectraNet -- A Deep Learning Network for Spectroscopic Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07215v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-domain surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) have opened a new frontier in the discovery and characterization of transients. While photometric light curves provide broad temporal coverage, spectroscopic observations remain crucial for physical interpretation and source classification. However, existing spectral analysis methods -- often reliant on template fitting or parametric models -- are limited in their ability to capture the complex and evolving spectra characteristic of such sources, which are sometimes only available at low resolution. In this work, we introduce SpectraNet, a deep convolutional neural network designed to learn robust representations of optical spectra from transients. Our model combines multi-scale convolution kernels and multi-scale pooling to extract features from preprocessed spectra in a hierarchical and interpretable manner. We train and validate SpectraNet on low-resolution time-series spectra obtained from the Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM) and other instruments, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in classification. Furthermore, in redshift prediction tasks, SpectraNet achieves a root mean squared relative redshift error of 0.02, highlighting its effectiveness in precise regression tasks as well.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of ringdown models calibrated to numerical relativity simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ''ringdown'' stage of gravitational-wave signals from binary black hole mergers, mainly consisting of a superposition of quasinormal modes emitted by the merger remnant, is a key tool to test fundamental physics and to probe black hole dynamics. However, ringdown models are known to be accurate only in the late-time, stationary regime. A key open problem in the field is to understand if these models are robust when extrapolated to earlier times, and if they can faithfully recover a larger portion of the signal. We address this question through a systematic time-domain calculation of the mismatch between non-precessing, quasi-circular ringdown models parameterised by the progenitor binary's degrees of freedom and full numerical relativity inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) simulation catalog. For the best-performing models, the mismatch is typically in the range $[10^{-6}, 10^{-4}]$ for the $(\ell,|m|)= (2,2)$ harmonic, and $[10^{-4}, 10^{-2}]$ for higher-order modes. Our findings inform ongoing observational searches for quasinormal modes, and underscore the need for improved modeling of higher-order modes to meet the sensitivity requirements of future gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

Abstract: In December 2024, the European Space Agency's (ESA) XMM-Newton X-ray Observatory celebrated the 25th anniversary of its launch. The annual number of peer-reviewed articles utilising XMM-Newton data has exhibited a consistent upward trajectory over the past two and a half decades, attaining more than 400 in 2022. The annual call for observing time proposals continues to experience a high level of oversubscription, typically ranging from a factor of 6 to 7. In order to enhance the scientific discovery space, XMM-Newton, primarily through the Project Scientist and Science Operations Centre, has pursued a strategy of expansion, which can be grouped into three phases: Large Projects with long observing time (2006-2009), Joint Observations (2011-2016), and Targets of Opportunity (2016-2024), respectively. A salient feature of XMM-Newton's time allocation is the systematic removal of biases from the second call onwards, a strategy that has enabled the attainment of comparable gender success rates and high acceptance rates for young scientists over 25 years, a feat only recently accomplished by similar missions through the introduction of double-anonymous review. XMM-Newton research is conducted by an active community of 4,300 scientists, of which approximately 570 are leading (1st author). The foundation of this community and its research is predicated on XMM-Newton data, with the project's policy of user support and calibration being fundamental constituents, as well as the project's active engagement and communication with its members.</description>

      <title>A dust condensation instability in AGN atmospheres: failed winds and the broad line region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are important drivers of galactic evolution; however, the underlying physical processes governing their properties remain uncertain. In particular, the specific cause for the generation of the broad-line region is unclear. There is a region where the underlying accretion disc atmosphere becomes cool enough for dust condensation. Using models of the disc's vertical structure, accounting for dust condensation and irradiation from the central source, we show that their upper atmospheres become extended, dusty, and radiation-pressure-supported. Due to the density--temperature dependence of dust condensation, this extended atmosphere forms as the dust abundance slowly increases with height, resulting in density and temperature scale heights considerably larger than the gas pressure scale height. We show that such an atmospheric structure is linearly unstable. An increase in the gas density raises the dust sublimation temperature, leading to an increased dust abundance, a higher opacity, and hence a net vertical acceleration. Using localised 2D hydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate the existence of our linear instability. In the non-linear state, the disc atmosphere evolves into ``fountains'' of dusty material that are vertically launched by radiation pressure before being exposed to radiation from the central source, which sublimates the dust and shuts off the radiative acceleration. These dust-free clumps then evolve ballistically, continuing upward before falling back towards the disc under gravity. This clumpy ionized region has velocity dispersions $\gtrsim 1000$ km/s. This instability and our simulations are representative of the Failed Radiatively Accelerated Dusty Outflow (FRADO) model proposed for the AGN broad-line region.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Calculations of $\beta$-Decay Rates and Implications for $r$-Process Nucleosynthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear $\beta$ decay is a key element of the astrophysical rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process). In this paper, we present state-of-the-art global $\beta$-decay calculations based on the quantified relativistic nuclear energy density functional theory and the deformed proton-neutron quasiparticle random-phase approximation. Our analysis considers contributions from allowed and first-forbidden transitions. We used two point-coupling functionals with carefully calibrated time-odd terms and isoscalar pairing strength. The new calculations display consistent results for both employed functionals, especially near the neutron drip line, suggesting slower $\beta$ decays past the $N=126$ neutron shell closure than in commonly used $\beta$-decay models. The new rates, along with the existing rates based on the latest non-relativistic calculations, are found to slow down the synthesis of heavy elements in the $r$-process and significantly reduce the contribution of neutron-induced fission.</description>

      <title>Relativistic multistage resonant and trailing-field acceleration induced by large-amplitude Alfv\'en waves in a strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a particle acceleration mechanism driven by large-amplitude Alfv\'en waves in a strong magnetic field. The acceleration process proceeds through multiple stages triggered by counterpropagating wave-particle resonant acceleration (CWRA) via decay instability. Initially, parent and daughter Alfv\'en waves resonantly accelerate particles perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field. The resultant modulational instability generates electrostatic fields within the wave packet, which are locally amplified by the ponderomotive force of the Alfv\'en wave packet. These fields subsequently drive further acceleration within a few relativistic gyroperiods via gyroresonant surfing acceleration (GRSA). During this, the v*B force facilitates momentum transfer from the perpendicular to the parallel direction. In the later stage, particles become trapped by the parent wave and gain additional energy through single wave resonant acceleration (SWRA). Furthermore, the accumulation of accelerated particles induces electrostatic trailing fields behind and at the tail of the wave packet, which drive trailing-field acceleration (TFA) of other electrons. The combined effects of these mechanisms, CWRA followed by GRSA and SWRA, result in highly relativistic electron energy. The electron energy accelerated through the above process is higher than that accelerated through TFA. This multistage acceleration process provides insights into the generation of high energy cosmic rays in astrophysical environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we extend our previously presented analytical formulas (Phys.Rev.D 109 (2024) 12, 124055) for describing light rays passing near or emitted in the vicinity of compact objects to a broader class of spherically symmetric, static spacetimes, including the Johansen-Psaltis and Rezzolla-Zhidenko metric families. The generalized formulas retain the simplicity and accuracy of the original approach while allowing for more general deviations from Schwarzschild geometry. These expressions provide an approximate yet accurate mapping between emission points and the image plane of an asymptotic observer, enabling fast analytical computations of accretion disk images, polarization of the emitted radiation, luminosity curves associated with pulsars, and other related applications. As examples, we compute isoradial curves for several metric families and the Stokes parameters Q and U for a hot spot orbiting near a black hole described by one of the studied metrics, presenting the corresponding polarization (QU) curves.</description>

      <title>Stellar-like Galactic center excess challenges particle dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Galactic Center (GC) is potentially hosting the largest indirect signal from particle dark matter (DM), which in many well-motivated models would produce gamma rays as their final states. However, this region has often been dismissed for DM studies because of the evidence for an unexpected gamma-ray component over astrophysical backgrounds at GeV energies, firstly discovered in the data of the \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT), the so-called Galactic Center Excess (GCE). While this was initially considered to hint at GeV thermal relics, recent work supports a GCE interpretation in terms of a stellar population of millisecond pulsar-like sources in the Galactic bulge. Building on this preference, we re-evaluate the GC as a powerful target for indirect DM searches via gamma rays. This is achieved by combining adaptive template fitting and pixel-count statistical methods to assess the role of sub-threshold point sources in the observed \textit{Fermi}-LAT gamma-ray counts, while minimizing the mismodeling of Galactic diffuse emission backgrounds. In a fully self-consistent way, the gamma-ray data are fitted with a mixed model comprising a DM signal and a stellar bulge, both potentially contributing to the GCE. The space left for signals from weak-scale DM particle annihilations is quantified by extracting 95\% C.L. upper limits on the annihilation cross section, which, depending on the DM density profile, result in stringent limits for masses $\lesssim 300$ GeV. The robustness of our results is supported by tests on simulated data.</description>

Abstract: Galactic white-dwarf binaries play a central role in the inference model for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. In this manuscript, we employ the $\texttt{bahamas}$ codebase to characterize, in a global-fit fashion, the reconstruction of the Galactic foreground during the first year of observation. To account for its statistical properties, we represent the data in time--frequency domain, and characterize the effectiveness of multiple approaches, e.g. statistically viable likelihoods, sampling schemes, segmentation widths, and gaps density. Our analysis yields consistent results across, with overwhelming evidence in favor of a non-stationary model in less than a month of data. Moreover, we show robustness against the presence of additional extragalactic foregrounds, and test the suitability of our approximations on the more complex simulated data in the $\textit{Yorsh}$ data challenge.</description>

Abstract: Complex inference tasks, such as those encountered in Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data analysis, rely on Bayesian frameworks. The high-dimensional parameter space and the strong interdependencies among astrophysical, pulsar noise, and nuisance parameters introduce significant challenges for efficient learning and robust inference. These challenges are emblematic of broader issues in decision science, where model over-parameterization and prior sensitivity can compromise both computational tractability and the reliability of the results. We address these issues in the framework of hierarchical Bayesian modeling by introducing a reparameterization strategy. Our approach employs Normalizing Flows (NFs) to decorrelate the parameters governing hierarchical priors from those of astrophysical interest. The use of NF-based mappings provides both the flexibility to realize the reparametrization and the tractability to preserve proper probability densities. We further adopt i-nessai, a flow-guided nested sampler, to accelerate exploration of complex posteriors. This unified use of NFs improves statistical robustness and computational efficiency, providing a principled methodology for addressing hierarchical Bayesian inference in PTA analysis.</description>

      <title>What can cosmic-ray knees reveal about source populations?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic ray (CR) knees (spectral steepenings) encode information on CR accelerator populations. We seek population features that imprint onto knee observables in a manner that is robust enough to be discernible even in the presence of significant systematics in CR data. In particular, we explore how diversity among population members could imprint on the knee phenomenology, under the assumption that a knee is due to a fixed-rigidity cutoff in the source spectra. We use a simple theoretical model for a population of CR accelerators. Each population member accelerates CR to a power-law spectrum, up to a cutoff rigidity. We allow for variance among members, in cutoff rigidity and power-law slope. We find that: (a) the slope step of the spectrum is $\sim 0.5$, decreasing weakly with increasing spread in either property; (b) composition always breaks first; (c) the difference between the break energies in composition and flux increases with increasing diversity; (d) composition and flux break together only if population diversity is minimal. These trends are robust under our assumptions; deviations from them would indicate more complex physics than encoded in our simple model. Comparing these trends with observed CR knees, we conclude that: (i) the primary knee at $\sim 4\times10^{15}$ eV is consistent with a constant-rigidity cutoff according to KASCADE-Grande data processed with post-LHC hadronic models, but not according to other datasets; (ii) the second knee at $\sim 5 \times 10^{17}$ eV requires more complexity than our model; (iii) the spectral feature identified by Auger at $\sim 10^{19}$ eV is consistent with a constant-rigidity source cutoff only if there is a substantial spread in both cutoff rigidity and slope. Interestingly, a significant spread in slope would also result in spectral curvature before the break, which would in turn be contributing to the ankle feature.</description>

      <title>Effects of extragalactic magnetic field on the spectra of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays from jetted sources</title>

Abstract: The origins and acceleration mechanisms of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are unknown. Many models attribute their extreme energies to powerful astrophysical jets. Understanding whether jet geometry -- specifically the opening angle and its orientation relative to Earth -- affects observational signatures is crucial for interpreting UHECR data. In this work, we perform numerical simulations of UHECR propagation in a magnetized universe to investigate the spectral signatures of jetted and nonjetted astrophysical sources. We demonstrate, for the first time, that under certain conditions, emission geometry can play a decisive role in shaping the observed spectrum of individual UHECR sources. These findings provide new insights into the conditions necessary for detecting UHECRs from jets, and highlight how the interplay between emission geometry and magnetic fields influences observed energy spectra.</description>

      <title>Spectra for the Vacuum Cherenkov Effect in Astrophysical Electromagnetic Cascades with Lorentz Invariance Violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance violation is a feature of several quantum gravity models in which Lorentz symmetry is broken at high energies, possibly leading to changes in particle behavior and interactions. In this work, we investigate vacuum Cherenkov radiation, a reaction in which an electron spontaneously emits a photon. This process, forbidden when Lorentz symmetry is unbroken, is a phenomenological consequence of some quantum gravity models. We derive, for the first time, the spectra for the vacuum Cherenkov reaction, and confirm our results numerically. These results can be used to derive limits on Lorentz invariance violation.</description>

      <title>CRPropa 3.3: Toward a Unified Multi-Messenger Framework from GeV to ZeV Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present CRPropa 3.3, the latest release of the publicly available Monte Carlo framework for simulating the propagation of high-energy particles in astrophysical environments. This version introduces significant extensions that enables multi-messenger studies across a broad energy range, from GeV to ZeV. New features include explicit time tracking, time-dependent advection fields, and support for position-dependent radiation backgrounds, for more realistic simulations of Galactic and extragalactic propagation. Nuclear cross sections have been updated and expanded up to lead (Z=82). We illustrate some of these new features, including acceleration at moving shocks and gamma-ray propagation in the interstellar radiation field. Together, these improvements establish CRPropa 3.3 as a comprehensive tool for modelling cosmic rays, gamma rays, and their secondaries in structured, time-dependent environments, setting the stage for next-generation multi-messenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>EP250108a/SN2025kg: A Magnetar-powered Gamma-Ray Burst Supernova Originating from a Close Helium-star Binary via Isolated Binary Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SN\,2025kg, linked to EP250108a, is among the brightest broad-lined Type Ic supernova (SN Ic-BL) known, showing unique helium absorptions, a late-time broad H$\alpha$, and an early bump. In this {\em{Letter}}, we propose a jet-cocoon origin to explain EP250108a as off-axis cooling emission from a mildly relativistic inner cocoon viewed at $\sim45^\circ$ and the early bump of SN\,2025kg as the outer cocoon cooling emission, both constraining an energy of $\sim(1-2)\times10^{52}{\rm{erg}}$ and a progenitor radius of $\sim5\,R_\odot$. To explain SN\,2025kg's exceptionally luminous peak, potential energy injection into the $\sim2.5\,M_\odot$ ejecta from a magnetar with initial period $\sim1.7\,{\rm{ms}}$ and magnetic field $\sim2\times10^{15}{\rm{G}}$ may be required, implying a rapidly rotating $\sim4\,M_\odot$ progenitor. Thus, the progenitor may be a low-mass helium star with an extended helium envelope, supported by helium absorption lines and an inferred weak pre-SN wind. Hydrogen-rich material may reside in the inner ejecta layers, as suggested by the late-time broad H$\alpha$, possibly originating from main-sequence companion material evaporated by the magnetar wind. Since the observed near-solar metallicity challenges the popular quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution channel, the rapidly rotating helium-star progenitor of EP250108a/SN\,2025kg might attain angular momentum by being tidally spun up by a main-sequence companion in a close binary formed through isolated binary evolution.</description>

      <title>Constraints on neutrino-Majoron couplings using SN1987A data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino decay to a lighter neutrino and a massless or almost massless (pseudo)scalar Goldstone boson remains of wide interest, as in the search for ultralight dark matter or for neutrinoless double beta-decay, and for its implications in astrophysics and cosmology. Neutrino interactions with Majorons can affect the dynamics of supernovae and impact the emitted neutrino flux. Using a three-neutrino framework and detailed supernova simulations, we perform the first likelihood analysis of the 24 neutrino events from SN1987A, including nonradiative decay in matter to a massless (pseudo)scalar boson like a Majoron. Focusing on the induced spectral distortions, we present bounds on the neutrino-Majoron couplings, as a function of the lightest neutrino mass, that are either complementary or competitive with current ones.</description>

      <title>Plausible Indication of Gamma-Ray Absorption by Dark Matter in NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: NGC 1068 is the brightest extragalactic source in high-energy neutrinos as seen by IceCube, yet the accompanying gamma-ray flux is orders of magnitude weaker. It has been argued that this indicates that the bulk of neutrinos and gamma rays are emitted in the innermost vicinity of the central supermassive black hole, which is transparent to neutrinos, but opaque to gamma rays. Even in such extreme scenarios for the acceleration of cosmic rays, astrophysical models typically overestimate the low-energy gamma-ray flux and/or require some fine-tuning in the physical parameters. Here we suggest instead that the dark matter surrounding the supermassive black hole may absorb the gamma rays, inducing the observed deficit. We show that for a dark matter-photon scattering cross section in the range $\sigma_{\rm DM-\gamma}/m_{\rm DM} \simeq 10^{-28}-10^{-30}$ cm$^2$/GeV, Fermi-LAT measurements can be well reconciled with IceCube data. We also present some simple particle physics examples that achieve the correct spectral energy dependence while respecting complementary constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the X-ray analysis of seven local compact elliptical galaxies (cEGs), selected for their morphological resemblance to high-redshift red nuggets. As likely descendants of the red nugget population, cEGs offer a unique window into the early Universe, enabling the study of early galaxy evolution and the interplay between black holes, stellar bulges, and dark matter halos. Using data from Chandra and XMM-Newton, we investigate the properties of the hot gaseous halos in cEGs. Two galaxies - MRK 1216 and PGC 32873 - host luminous, spatially extended X-ray atmospheres, allowing us to derive radial thermodynamic profiles. For MRK 1216, we performed high-resolution spectral modeling with RGS data, which hints at super-solar $\alpha/\rm{Fe}$ abundance ratios. The remaining galaxies show either faint or undetected X-ray halos, though several display AGN-like (active galactic nucleus) power-law emission. In the context of local scaling relations, cEGs show only mild deviations from the general galaxy population, exhibiting a slightly steeper $M_{\star}-L_{X}$ relation and occupying the lower boundary of the $M_{\star}$-$M_{\rm vir}$ relation. These trends suggest that high-redshift red nuggets may also host a diverse range of X-ray atmospheres. We speculate that the compactness of cEGs may trace back to the population of `little red dots' (LRDs), hinting at a potential link between LRDs, red nuggets, and compact relic galaxies in the local Universe.</description>

      <title>Hubble constant constraint using 117 FRBs with a more accurate probability density function for ${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are among the most mysterious astronomical transients. Due to their short durations and cosmological distances, their dispersion measure (DM) - redshift ($z$) relation is useful for constraining cosmological parameters and detecting the baryons in the Universe. The increasing number of localized FRBs in recent years has provided more precise constraints on these parameters. However, the larger dataset reveals limitations in the widely used probability density function ($p_{\rm diff}$) for ${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$, which refers to the diffuse electron term of FRB DM. In this project, we collect 117 of the latest, localized FRBs, discuss the effect of a more accurate $\sigma_{\rm diff}$, which is a parameter in $p_{\rm diff}$ and once thoughts as ``effective standard deviation'', and more clearly rewrite their likelihood to better constrain the parameters above. We find that the widely used approximation $\sigma_{\rm diff} \sim F/\sqrt{z}$ only works under contrived assumptions and shows the greatest deviation from the true standard deviation in low redshift. In general, one should use an accurate method to derive this parameter from $p_{\rm diff}$. Our method yields better constraints on $H_0\Omega_b f_{\rm diff} = 2.813_{-0.258}^{+0.250}\;{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ or $H_0 = 66.889_{-5.459}^{+6.754} \;{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ when combining the FRB data with CMB measurements and taking $f_{\rm diff} = 0.84$. This fully analytical correction helps us better constrain cosmological parameters with the increasing number of localized FRBs available today.</description>

      <title>Once-in-a-lifetime encounter models for neutrino media II: Quasi-steady states and miscidynamic flavor evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extended the once-in-a-lifetime encounter (OILE) model to stochastic interactions among neutrinos. As in the original OILE model, the new model reproduces the mean-field behavior of a dense neutrino gas for time $t\lesssim (\mu\gamma)^{-1}$, where $\mu$ measures the strength of the mean-field neutrino self-interaction potential and is proportional to the neutrino density, and the dimensionless "impact parameter" $\gamma$ is a measure of the change in the flavor quantum state of a neutrino during interaction with another neutrino when the wave packets of the two neutrinos overlap. As in the mean-field case, the OILE model with random neutrino velocities experiences kinetic flavor decoherence as the flavor quantum states of the neutrinos diverge from each other. Unlike the mean-field case, however, the OILE model has a "collision term" due to the quantum entanglement among neutrinos. For $\gamma\ll1$, this incoherent effect can drive the neutrinos into a quasi-steady state that is similar to the collective precession mode in a homogeneous and isotropic neutrino gas in the mean-field approximation. Subsequently, the collision term drives the neutrino gas adiabatically through different quasi-steady states and eventually to flavor equilibration. This process is an example of miscidynamic flavor evolution, with the mixing equilibria being the quasi-steady precession states.</description>
