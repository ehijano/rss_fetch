      <title>ECGomics: An Open Platform for AI-ECG Digital Biomarker Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Conventional electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis faces a persistent dichotomy: expert-driven features ensure interpretability but lack sensitivity to latent patterns, while deep learning offers high accuracy but functions as a black box with high data dependency. We introduce ECGomics, a systematic paradigm and open-source platform for the multidimensional deconstruction of cardiac signals into digital biomarker. Methods: Inspired by the taxonomic rigor of genomics, ECGomics deconstructs cardiac activity across four dimensions: Structural, Intensity, Functional, and Comparative. This taxonomy synergizes expert-defined morphological rules with data-driven latent representations, effectively bridging the gap between handcrafted features and deep learning embeddings. Results: We operationalized this framework into a scalable ecosystem consisting of a web-based research platform and a mobile-integrated solution (https://github.com/PKUDigitalHealth/ECGomics). The web platform facilitates high-throughput analysis via precision parameter configuration, high-fidelity data ingestion, and 12-lead visualization, allowing for the systematic extraction of biomarkers across the four ECGomics dimensions. Complementarily, the mobile interface, integrated with portable sensors and a cloud-based engine, enables real-time signal acquisition and near-instantaneous delivery of structured diagnostic reports. This dual-interface architecture successfully transitions ECGomics from theoretical discovery to decentralized, real-world health management, ensuring professional-grade monitoring in diverse clinical and home-based settings. Conclusion: ECGomics harmonizes diagnostic precision, interpretability, and data efficiency. By providing a deployable software ecosystem, this paradigm establishes a robust foundation for digital biomarker discovery and personalized cardiovascular medicine.</description>

      <title>Flocking by stopping: a novel mechanism of emergent order in collective movement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective movement is observed widely in nature, where individuals interact locally to produce globally ordered, coherent motion. In typical models of collective motion, each individual takes the average direction of multiple neighbors, resulting in ordered movement. In small flocks, noise induced order can also emerge with individuals copying only a randomly chosen single neighbor at a time. We propose a new model of collective movement, inspired by how real animals move, where individuals can move in two directions or remain stationary. We demonstrate that when individuals interact with a single neighbor through a novel form of halting interaction -- where an individual may stop upon encountering an oppositely moving neighbor rather than instantly aligning -- persistent collective order can emerge even in large populations. This represents a fundamentally different mechanism from conventional averaging-based or noise-induced ordering. Using deterministic and stochastic mean-field approximations, we characterize the conditions under which such ``flocking by stopping'' behavior can occur, and confirm the mean-field predictions using individual-based simulations. Our results highlight how incorporating a stopped state and halting interactions can generate new routes to order in collective movement.</description>

      <title>Empowering LLMs for Structure-Based Drug Design via Exploration-Augmented Latent Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong representation and reasoning capabilities, but their application to structure-based drug design (SBDD) is limited by insufficient understanding of protein structures and unpredictable molecular generation. To address these challenges, we propose Exploration-Augmented Latent Inference for LLMs (ELILLM), a framework that reinterprets the LLM generation process as an encoding, latent space exploration, and decoding workflow. ELILLM explicitly explores portions of the design problem beyond the model's current knowledge while using a decoding module to handle familiar regions, generating chemically valid and synthetically reasonable molecules. In our implementation, Bayesian optimization guides the systematic exploration of latent embeddings, and a position-aware surrogate model efficiently predicts binding affinity distributions to inform the search. Knowledge-guided decoding further reduces randomness and effectively imposes chemical validity constraints. We demonstrate ELILLM on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark, showing strong controlled exploration and high binding affinity scores compared with seven baseline methods. These results demonstrate that ELILLM can effectively enhance LLMs capabilities for SBDD.</description>

      <title>Optical Manipulation of Erythrocytes via Evanescent Waves: Assessing Glucose-Induced Mobility Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of red blood cells (RBCs) under the influence of evanescent waves generated by total internal reflection (TIR). Using a 1064 nm laser system and a dual-chamber prism setup, we quantified the mobility of erythrocytes in different glucose environments. Our methodology integrates automated tracking via TrackMate\c{opyright} to analyze over 60 trajectory sets. The results reveal a significant decrease in mean velocity, from 11.8 {\mu}m/s in 5 mM glucose to 8.8 {\mu}m/s in 50 mM glucose (p = 0.019). These findings suggest that evanescent waves can serve as a non-invasive tool to probe the mechanical properties of cell membranes influenced by biochemical changes.</description>

      <title>SAGE-FM: A lightweight and interpretable spatial transcriptomics foundation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables spatial gene expression profiling, motivating computational models that capture spatially conditioned regulatory relationships. We introduce SAGE-FM, a lightweight spatial transcriptomics foundation model based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) trained with a masked central spot prediction objective. Trained on 416 human Visium samples spanning 15 organs, SAGE-FM learns spatially coherent embeddings that robustly recover masked genes, with 91% of masked genes showing significant correlations (p &lt; 0.05). The embeddings generated by SAGE-FM outperform MOFA and existing spatial transcriptomics methods in unsupervised clustering and preservation of biological heterogeneity. SAGE-FM generalizes to downstream tasks, enabling 81% accuracy in pathologist-defined spot annotation in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and improving glioblastoma subtype prediction relative to MOFA. In silico perturbation experiments further demonstrate that the model captures directional ligand-receptor and upstream-downstream regulatory effects consistent with ground truth. These results demonstrate that simple, parameter-efficient GCNs can serve as biologically interpretable and spatially aware foundation models for large-scale spatial transcriptomics.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-enhanced non-amnestic Alzheimer's disease diagnosis from MRI and clinical features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), defined as an abnormal buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain can be diagnosed with high accuracy based on protein biomarkers via PET or CSF analysis. However, due to the invasive nature of biomarker collection, most AD diagnoses are made in memory clinics using cognitive tests and evaluation of hippocampal atrophy based on MRI. While clinical assessment and hippocampal volume show high diagnostic accuracy for amnestic or typical AD (tAD), a substantial subgroup of AD patients with atypical presentation (atAD) are routinely misdiagnosed. To improve diagnosis of atAD patients, we propose a machine learning approach to distinguish between atAD and non-AD cognitive impairment using clinical testing battery and MRI data collected as standard-of-care. We develop and evaluate our approach using 1410 subjects across four groups (273 tAD, 184 atAD, 235 non-AD, and 685 cognitively normal) collected from one private data set and two public data sets from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We perform multiple atAD vs. non-AD classification experiments using clinical features and hippocampal volume as well as a comprehensive set of MRI features from across the brain. The best performance is achieved by incorporating additional important MRI features, which outperforms using hippocampal volume alone. Furthermore, we use the Boruta statistical approach to identify and visualize significant brain regions distinguishing between diagnostic groups. Our ML approach improves the percentage of correctly diagnosed atAD cases (the recall) from 52% to 69% for NACC and from 34% to 77% for ADNI, while achieving high precision. The proposed approach has important implications for improving diagnostic accuracy for non-amnestic atAD in clinical settings using only clinical testing battery and MRI.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Patched or Partial Holograms to allow for Whole Slide Imaging with a Self-Referencing Holographic Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The last decade has seen significant advances in computer-aided diagnostics for cytological screening, mainly through the improvement and integration of scanning techniques such as whole slide imaging (WSI) and the combination with deep learning. Simultaneously, new imaging techniques such as quantitative phase imaging (QPI) are being developed to capture richer cell information with less sample preparation. So far, the two worlds of WSI and QPI have not been combined. In this work, we present a reconstruction algorithm which makes whole slide imaging of cervical smears possible by using a self-referencing three-wave digital holographic microscope. Since a WSI is constructed by combining multiple patches, the algorithm is adaptive and can be used on partial holograms and patched holograms. We present the algorithm for a single shot hologram, the adaptations to make it flexible to various inputs and show that the algorithm performs well for the tested epithelial cells. This is a preprint of our paper, which has been accepted for publication in 2026 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI).</description>

      <title>A Joint Survival Modeling and Therapy Knowledge Graph Framework to Characterize Opioid Use Disorder Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivation: Opioid use disorder (OUD) often arises after prescription opioid exposure and follows transitions among onset, remission, and relapse. Linked EHR-survey resources such as the All of Us Research Program enable stage-specific risk modeling and connection to intervention options. Results: We built a multi-stage framework to model time-to-onset, time-to-remission, and time-to-relapse after remission using All of Us EHR and survey data. For each participant we derived longitudinal predictors from clinical conditions and survey concepts, including recent (1/3/12-month) event counts, cumulative exposures, and time since last event. We fit regularized Cox models for each transition and aggregated selection frequencies and hazard ratios to identify a compact set of high-confidence predictors. Pain, mental health, and polysubstance use contributed across stages: chronic pain syndromes, tobacco/nicotine dependence, anxiety and depressive disorders, and cannabis dependence prominently predicted onset and relapse, whereas tobacco dependence during remission and other remission-coded conditions were strongly associated with transition to remission. To support therapeutic prioritization, we constructed a therapy knowledge graph integrating genetic targets, biological pathways, and published evidence to map identified risk factors to candidate treatments in recent OUD studies and clinical guidelines.</description>

      <title>Mantis: A Foundation Model for Mechanistic Disease Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12260v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infectious disease forecasting in novel outbreaks or low-resource settings is hampered by the need for large disease and covariate data sets, bespoke training, and expert tuning, all of which can hinder rapid generation of forecasts for new settings. To help address these challenges, we developed Mantis, a foundation model trained entirely on mechanistic simulations, which enables out-of-the-box forecasting across diseases, regions, and outcomes, even in settings with limited historical data. We evaluated Mantis against 48 forecasting models across six diseases with diverse modes of transmission, assessing both point forecast accuracy (mean absolute error) and probabilistic performance (weighted interval score and coverage). Despite using no real-world data during training, Mantis achieved lower mean absolute error than all models in the CDC's COVID-19 Forecast Hub when backtested on early pandemic forecasts which it had not previously seen. Across all other diseases tested, Mantis consistently ranked in the top two models across evaluation metrics. Mantis further generalized to diseases with transmission mechanisms not represented in its training data, demonstrating that it can capture fundamental contagion dynamics rather than memorizing disease-specific patterns. These capabilities illustrate that purely simulation-based foundation models such as Mantis can provide a practical foundation for disease forecasting: general-purpose, accurate, and deployable where traditional models struggle.</description>

      <title>Not All Accuracy Is Equal: Prioritizing Independence in Infectious Disease Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensemble forecasts have become a cornerstone of large-scale disease response, underpinning decision making at agencies such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Their growing use reflects the goal of combining multiple models to improve accuracy and stability versus relying on any single model. However, while ensembles regularly demonstrate stability against individual model failures, improved accuracy is not guaranteed. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the CDC's multi-model ensemble outperformed the best single model by only 1\%, and CDC flu ensembles have often ranked below individual models.
  Prior work has established that ensemble performance depends critically on diversity: when models make independent errors, combining them yields substantial gains. In practice, however, this diversity is often lacking. Here, we propose that this is due in part to how models are developed and selected: both modelers and ensemble builders optimize for stand-alone accuracy rather than ensemble contribution, and most epidemic forecasts are built from a small set of approaches trained on the same surveillance data. The result is highly correlated errors, limiting the benefit of ensembling.
  This suggests that in developing models and ensembles, we should prioritize models that contribute complementary information rather than replicating existing approaches. We present a toy example illustrating the theoretical cost of correlated errors, analyze correlations among COVID-19 forecasting models, and propose improvements to model fitting and ensemble construction that foster genuine diversity. Ensembles built with this principle in mind produce forecasts that are more robust and more valuable for epidemic preparedness and response.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network Reveals the Local Cortical Morphology of Brain Aging in Normal Cognition and Alzheimers Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating brain age (BA) from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) provides a useful approach to map the anatomic features of brain senescence. Whereas global BA (GBA) summarizes overall brain health, local BA (LBA) can reveal spatially localized patterns of aging. Although previous studies have examined anatomical contributors to GBA, no framework has been established to compute LBA using cortical morphology. To address this gap, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN) that uses morphometric features (cortical thickness, curvature, surface area, gray/white matter intensity ratio and sulcal depth) to estimate LBA across the cortical surface at high spatial resolution (mean inter-vertex distance = 1.37 mm). Trained on cortical surface meshes extracted from the MRIs of cognitively normal adults (N = 14,250), our GNN identifies prefrontal and parietal association cortices as early sites of morphometric aging, in concordance with biological theories of brain aging. Feature comparison using integrated gradients reveals that morphological aging is driven primarily by changes in surface area (gyral crowns and highly folded regions) and cortical thickness (occipital lobes), with additional contributions from gray/white matter intensity ratio (frontal lobes and sulcal troughs) and curvature (sulcal troughs). In Alzheimers disease (AD), as expected, the model identifies widespread, excessive morphological aging in parahippocampal gyri and related temporal structures. Significant associations are found between regional LBA gaps and neuropsychological measures descriptive of AD-related cognitive impairment, suggesting an intimate relationship between morphological cortical aging and cognitive decline. These results highlight the ability of GNN-derived gero-morphometry to provide insights into local brain aging.</description>
