      <title>Strong completeness of Lp-type vector lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let E be a Dedekind complete Riesz space with weak unit e, equipped with a conditional expectation operator T. We prove that the spaces Lp(T), with their natural vector-valued norms, are strongly complete, extending the p=2 case of Kuo, Kalauch, and Watson. This resolves a question that has remained open for several years. We begin by studying a general type of convergence and its unbounded modification, unifying and generalizing order, norm, and absolute weak convergence while providing simpler proofs. As an application, we consider vector-valued norms and their unbounded variants, generalizing strong convergence in Lp-spaces and convergence in probability. This framework establishes the completeness of Lp(T) and of the universal completion E^{u}, reinforcing the uo-completeness of universally complete vector lattices. Finally we apply our main theorem to obtain a new result in ergodicity for conditional preserving systems.</description>

      <title>Measuring Asymptotic Convergence: A Unified Framework from Isotropic Infinity to Anisotropic Ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified approach to defining a point at infinity for an arbitrary space and formalizing convergence to this point. Central to our work is a method to quantify and classify the rates at which functions approach their limits at infinity. Our framework applies to various settings (metric spaces, topological spaces, directed sets, measure spaces) by introducing an exhaustion of the space via an associated exhaustion function h. Using h, we adjoin an ideal point \omega_A to the space A and define convergence a \to \omega_A in a manner intrinsic to A. To measure convergence rates, we introduce a family of parameterized norms, denoted ||f||_{\infty,h,p}, which provides a refined classification of asymptotic behavior (e.g., distinguishing rates of order O(h^{-p})). Furthermore, the framework is extended to handle anisotropic spaces with multiple distinct ends by introducing a 'multi-exhaustion' formalism, allowing for a precise, directional analysis of convergence rates towards each asymptotic channel. This approach allows for a distinction between the global convergence captured by the norm and the purely asymptotic behavior at infinity, which can be analyzed via the limit superior of the convergence ratio. We further investigate the theoretical limits of this measure by establishing sufficient conditions (such as monotonicity) under which a finite norm guarantees convergence. The framework is shown to recover classical results, such as the Alexandroff one-point compactification and standard definitions of limits, while also providing a richer quantitative structure. Examples in each context are provided to illustrate the concepts.</description>

      <title>Structure and positivity of linear maps preserving covariance under unitary evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a complex finite-dimensional or infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space, $\mathcal{B(H)}$ and $\mathcal{T(H)}$ be the Banach spaces of all bounded linear operators and of all trace class operators on $\mathcal{H},$ respectively. In this paper, we give a concrete description of the linear maps $\Phi:\mathcal{T(H)}\rightarrow \mathcal{B(H\otimes H)}$ that are continuous relative to the norm topology and covariance under unitary evolution (i.e., $\Phi(UXU^*)=(U\otimes U)\Phi(X)(U^*\otimes U^*)$ for all $X\in\mathcal{T(H)}$ and unitary operators $U\in\mathcal{B(H)}).$ Using this, we obtain the equivalent conditions for this class of maps to be self-adjoint or positive. As a corollary, we get that the virtual broadcasting map $\mathcal{B}_{vb}:\mathcal{T(H)}\rightarrow \mathcal{B(H\otimes H)}$ with the form $\mathcal{B}_{vb}(X)=\frac{ 1}{2}[S(I\otimes X)+S(X\otimes I)]$ is uniquely determined by three conditions: covariance under unitary evolution, invariance under permutation of the copies and consistency with classical broadcasting, where $S\in\mathcal{B(H\otimes H)}$ is the swap operator. Moreover, the linear maps $\Psi:\mathcal{B(H)}\rightarrow \mathcal{B(H\otimes H)}$ that are continuous relative to the $W^*$-topology and covariance under unitary evolution are also characterized.</description>

      <title>Best Proximity Point Results for Cyclic Orbital Contraction Mappings in $CAT_p(0)$ Metric Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of cyclic orbital contraction mappings which generalizes the concept of cyclic contraction mappings. We establish the existence of best proximity point of these mappings in the framework of $CAT_p(0)$ metric spaces. Also, we study the existence of best proximity point theorems for cyclic orbital contraction mappings in uniformly convex Banach spaces.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study spectral Barron spaces whose elements are made up of some vector-valued functions on a compact group whose Fourier transforms admit a certain summability property. We investigate their functional properties and some continuous embeddings of these spaces with respect to other function spaces among which are Sobolev spaces of vector-valued functions and the space of bounded vector-valued functions on compact groups.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barycentric algebras are an abstraction of the notion of convex sets, defined by a set of equations. We study semitopological and topological barycentric algebras, in the spirit of a previous study by Klaus Keimel on semitopological and topological cones (2008), which are special cases of semitopological and topological barycentric algebras.</description>

      <title>A homological approach to (Grothendieck's) completeness problem for regular LB-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the long-standing question of whether every regular LB-space is complete. The latter is open since the 1950s and is based on Grothendieck's early work in functional analysis. Rather than looking for a proof or counterexample, we categorify the question and formulate homological versions in terms of derived categories with respect to several natural exact structures. In one case we establish a bounded derived equivalence between the categories of regular and complete LB-spaces.</description>

      <title>Raja's covering index of $L_p$ spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Raja's covering index $\Theta_X(n)$ for classical $L_p$-spaces and their non-commutative counterparts. For infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces we give a short elementary argument showing that $\Theta_H(2)=1/\sqrt{2}$, thus answering a question of Raja about the precise two-piece covering index of $\ell_2$. For scalar-valued Lebesgue spaces $L_p(\mu)$, $1\le p&lt;\infty$, we construct an explicit block decomposition of the unit ball yielding the upper bound $\Theta_{L_p(\mu)}(n)\le n^{-1/p}$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$; in particular $\Theta_{\ell_p}(n)\le n^{-1/p}$. For $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, this combines with Raja's general lower bound for $p$-asymptotically uniformly smoothable spaces to give the sharp asymptotic estimate $\Theta_{L_p(\mu)}(n)\asymp n^{-1/p}$.
  We also obtain uniform lower bounds $\Theta_{L_p(\mu;E)}(n)\gtrsim n^{-1/p}$ for Bochner spaces $L_p(\mu;E)$, with constants independent of the Banach space $E$; this shows that, at the level of power-type lower estimates, the covering index cannot distinguish between very different asymptotic geometries of~$E$ and provides a partial negative answer to a problem of Raja. Finally, using non-commutative Clarkson inequalities, we derive power-type lower bounds $\Theta_{L_p(M,\tau)}(n)\gtrsim n^{-1/r}$ for non-commutative $L_p(M,\tau)$ spaces associated with semifinite von Neumann algebras, where $r=\min\{p,2\}$. We do not attempt to optimise the exponent or constants in the non-commutative setting.</description>

      <title>Stability and Regularization of Quasi-Variational Inequalities under Monotone Operator Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes comprehensive stability results for quasi-variational inequalities (QVIs) under monotone perturbations of the governing operator. We prove strong convergence of both minimal and maximal solutions when sequences of operators converge pointwise while preserving fundamental properties including homogeneity, strong monotonicity, Lipschitz continuity, and T-monotonicity. Our analysis extends to regularization techniques, finite-dimensional approximations, and non-monotone nonlinearities, providing explicit convergence rates under appropriate conditions. The theory encompasses applications to $p$-Laplacian operators, elliptic regularizations, and optimal control problems with QVI constraints. By developing a unified framework that bridges classical monotone operator theory with contemporary computational challenges, this work provides essential mathematical foundations for the robust numerical approximation and sensitivity analysis of quasi-variational problems arising in materials science, physics, and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>On operator Connes-amenability of the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Runde and Spronk showed in 2004 that there are non-amenable groups $G$, including $\mathbb F_2$, where $B(G)$ is operator Connes-amenable. This result was surprising since the measure algebra $M(G)$ is Connes-amenable if and only if $G$ is amenable, which might lead one to guess that $B(G)$ should be operator Connes-amenable if and only if $G$ is amenable. This leads to the question: for which groups $G$ is $B(G)$ operator Connes-amenable? We make progress on this problem by giving the first examples of groups where $B(G)$ is known to not be operator Connes-amenable. More specifically, we show that $B(G)$ is not operator Connes-amenable when $G$ is a non-compact locally compact group with property (T) and finite almost periodic compactification, or when $G$ is a discrete group without the factorization property. This refutes the suggestion of Dales that $B(G)$ might be operator Connes-amenable for every locally compact group.</description>

      <title>On the existence of solutions of dynamic equations on time scales in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we address the question of solvability of dynamic equations on time scales in Banach spaces. In particular, our main theorem extends the result for classical differential equations in Banach spaces of Bana\'s and Goebel (1980), to an arbitrary time scale. Central role is played by the axiomatic theory of measures of noncompactness. Moreover, we study countable systems of dynamic equations on time scales arising from semi-discretisation of parabolic partial dynamic equations.</description>

Abstract: Let $(X,+,d)$ be an Abelian metric group and $A\subset X$. We investigate the spectre of a set $A$, defined as the set of all elements $z\in X$ such that for every $x\in A$ either $x+z \in A$ or $x-z \in A$. We consider the corresponding to this notion operator $S$ acting on the hyperspace of compact sets and examine its properties. Furthermore, we study the families of achievement sets and sets of $P$-sums in this hyperspace, as well as prove some properties of achievement sets in the plane.</description>

      <title>Products of irreducible operators in factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal M$ be a separable factor.
  An operator $T$ in $\mathcal{M}$ is said to be irreducible in $\mathcal{M}$ if the von Neumann algebra $W^*(T)$ generated by $T$ is an irreducible subfactor of $\mathcal{M}$, i.e., $W^*(T)'\cap\mathcal{M}=\mathbb{C}I$.
  In this paper, we show that every operator in a separable factor $\mathcal{M}$ is the product of two irreducible operators in $\mathcal{M}$, except the zero operator in factors of type $\mathrm{I}_{2n+1}$ for $n\geqslant 1$.
  This may be viewed as a multiplicative analogue of Radjavi's result which asserts that every operator on a separable Hilbert space is the sum of two irreducible operators.</description>

      <title>Sharp inequalities for symmetric polynomials, Hunter's conjecture, and moments of exponential random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove Hunter's conjecture on complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials. For even $n$ and every integer $k\geq 1$, we show that under the constraint $\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2=1$ the global minimum of the even-degree polynomial $h_{2k}(a_1,\dots,a_n)$ is attained precisely at the half-plus/half-minus vector and we compute the optimal value in closed form. The proof combines algebraic properties of $h_{2k}$ with the probabilistic representation $k!\,h_k(a)=\mathbb{E}(\sum_{i=1}^n a_iX_i)^k$, where $X_1,\dots,X_n$ are i.i.d. standard exponential random variables with density $e^{-x}1_{x&gt;0}$ and a combinatorial identity. This viewpoint further yields sharp upper and lower bounds for $\mathbb{E}|\sum_{i=1}^n a_iX_i|^{q}$ under natural constraints on the coefficients, including the spherical constraint $\sum a_i^2=1$ combined with the non-negative regime $a_i\ge0$, or the centred regime $\sum a_i=0$. Moreover, we determine the exact minimum of $h_{2k}$ on the $\ell_\infty$-sphere $S_\infty = \{a \in \mathbb{R}^n : \|a\|_\infty = 1\}$, which yields sharp norm comparison inequalities between the matrix norms induced by complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials and the classical operator and Schatten norms.</description>

      <title>Interpolation problems in subdiagonal algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak A$ be a subdiagonal algebra with diagonal $\mathfrak D$ in a $\sigma$-finite von Neumann algebra $\mathcal M$ with respect to a faithful normal conditional expectation $\Phi$. We mainly consider the interpolation problem in $\mathfrak A$ with the universal factorization property. We determine when a finitely generated left ideal in $\mathfrak A$ is trivial. By constructing a periodic flow on $\mathcal M$ according to a type 1 subdiagonal algebra, we show that type 1 subdiagonal algebras coincide with analytic operator algebras associated with periodic flows in von Neumann algebras. This enables us to present a form decomposition of a type 1 subdiagonal algebra. As an application, we deduce a noncommutative operator-theoretic variant of the Corona theorem for type 1 subdiagonal algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On graded Lie groups, we develop a mechanism that transfers the uniformity of maximal hypoellipcity from the frozen coefficients principal part of a differential operator to the full operator. Our approach brings the century-old "freeze-unfreeze" strategy into the hypoelliptic setting, and offers a transparent and flexible framework for lifting symbol-level hypoelliptic properties to global elliptic estimates, without relying on pseudodifferential calculus. In addition, we prove that symmetric operators of hypoelliptic type on a graded Lie group are self-adjoint.</description>

      <title>Spectral Theory of Almost Periodic Banach--Malcev Algebras and Applications to Moufang Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce almost periodic Banach--Malcev algebras as a non-associative extension of Bohr's classical theory. Our framework is based on the relative compactness of adjoint orbits $\{e^{t\,\mathrm{ad}(x)}(y)\}$, which yields the spectral characterization $\sigma(\mathrm{ad}(x)) \subseteq i\mathbb{R}$, uniform boundedness of orbit closures in the strong operator topology, and a continuous functional calculus for almost periodic derivations. Compact Malcev algebras -- most notably the imaginary octonions $\mathrm{Im}(\mathbb{O})$ -- provide canonical finite-dimensional examples, and their associated Moufang loops carry strictly periodic flows. We also analyze structural actions on eigenspaces of the Malcev Laplacian as a concrete case study, where the bounded defect operator $S(x,y) \in \mathcal{B}(M)$ quantifies the non-associative correction. While speculative links to non-associative gauge theory are noted, they lie beyond the established mathematical scope. The recent convergence control of the BCH series for special Banach--Malcev algebras \cite{Athmouni2025} provides analytic justification for the local Moufang structure used throughout.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we introduce inhomogeneous Sobolev spaces that naturally generalise the standard Sobolev-Slobodeckij spaces. The inhomogeneity of these spaces is governed by a set function $\mu$, referred to as an environment. In the case where $\mu$ is an almost doubling set function, we relate these new spaces with inhomogeneous Besov spaces recently introduced by Barral-Seuret in 2023. When $\mu$ is in addition a capacity, wee also prove that prevalent elements in such spaces are multifractal (with a singularity spectrum that we determine), completing previous Baire generic results already obtained.</description>

      <title>Differentiable convex extensions with sharp Lipschitz constants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a superreflexive Banach space $X$, and a set $E \subset X$, we characterise the $1$-jets $(f,G)$ on $E$ that admit $C^{1,\omega}$ convex extensions $(F,DF)$ to all of $X$; where $\omega$ is any admissible modulus of continuity depending on the regularity of $X$. Moreover, we obtain precise estimates for the growth of the $C^{1,\omega}$ seminorm of the extensions with respect to the initial data. We show how these estimates can be improved in the Hilbert setting, and are asymptotically sharp for H\"older moduli. Remarkably, our extensions have the sharp Lipschitz constant $\mathrm{Lip}(F,X) = \|G\|_{L^\infty(E)}$, when $G$ is a bounded map. All these extensions are given by simple and explicit formulas. We also prove a similar theorem for $C^1$ convex extensions of jets defined on compact subsets $E$ of superreflexive spaces $X$, with the sharp Lipschitz constant too. The results are new even when $X=\mathbb{R}^n.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Busemann-Petty problem asks whether smaller central hyperplane sections of origin-symmetric convex bodies necessarily imply smaller total volume. Zvavitch studied this question for arbitrary measures with continuous even densities, providing sufficient conditions for affirmative cases in terms of the distributional behavior of the ratio between the densities involved. We refine this result by extending it to a broader class of distributions and allowing a distinct pair of densities for each body, one for hyperplane sections and another for the full volume. We also present some examples illustrating cases not covered by previous results.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of the normalized power sequence of spectral operators on Hilbert space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{H}$ be a complex Hilbert space, and let $\mathscr{B}(\mathscr{H})$ denote the set of all bounded operators on $\mathscr{H}$ . For an operator $T \in \mathscr{B}(\mathscr{H})$, let $|T| := (T^*T)^{\frac{1}{2}}$. For $A$ in $\mathscr{B}(\mathscr{H})$, we refer to the sequence, $\{ |A^n|^{\frac{1}{n}} \}_{n \in \mathbb{N} }$, as the $\textit{normalized power sequence}$ of $A$. As our main result, we prove that the normalized power sequence of a spectral operator in $\mathscr{B}(\mathscr{H})$ converges in norm, and provide an explicit description of the limit in terms of its idempotent-valued spectral resolution. Our approach substantially generalizes the corresponding result by the first-named author in the case of matrices in $M_m(\mathbb{C})$, and supplements the Haagerup-Schultz theorem on SOT-convergence of the normalized power sequence of an operator in a $II_1$ factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose $A=[a_{ij}]\in \mathcal{M}_n(\mathbb{C})$ is a complex $n \times n$ matrix and $B\in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ is a bounded linear operator on a complex Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. We show that $w(A\otimes B)\leq w(C),$ where $w(\cdot)$ denotes the numerical radius and $C=[c_{ij}]$ with $c_{ij}= w\left(\begin{bmatrix} 0&amp; a_{ij}\\ a_{ji}&amp;0 \end{bmatrix} \otimes B\right).$ This refines Holbrook's classical bound $w(A\otimes B)\leq w(A) \|B\|$ [J. Reine Angew. Math. 1969], when all entries of $A$ are non-negative. If moreover $a_{ii}\neq 0$ $ \forall i$, we prove that $w(A\otimes B)= w(A) \|B\|$ if and only if $w(B)=\|B\|.$ We then extend these and other results to the more general setting of semi-Hilbertian spaces induced by a positive operator.
  In the reverse direction, we also specialize these results to Kronecker products and hence to Schur/entrywise products, of matrices: (1)(a) We first provide an alternate proof (using $w(A)$) of a result of Goldberg-Zwas [Linear Algebra Appl. 1974] that if the spectral norm of $A$ equals its spectral radius, then each Jordan block for each maximum-modulus eigenvalue must be $1 \times 1$ ("partial diagonalizability"). (b) Using our approach, we further show given $m \geq 1$ that $w(A^{\circ m})\leq w^m(A)$ - we also characterize when equality holds here. (2) We provide upper and lower bounds for the $\ell_p$ operator norm and the numerical radius of $A\otimes B$ for all $A \in \mathcal{M}_n(\mathbb{C})$, which become equal when restricted to doubly stochastic matrices $A$. Finally, using these bounds we obtain an improved estimation for the roots of an arbitrary complex polynomial.</description>

      <title>Translation--Modulation Identities, Ergodic Log-Products and a Conditional Obstruction for Schwartz Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18529v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study very smooth functions on the real line, namely Schwartz functions, that satisfy a finite identity relating their translates and a single modulation. Concretely, we assume there is a nontrivial linear combination of translates of the function that equals a fixed frequency shift of the same function.
  Passing to the Fourier transform turns this into a multiplicative transfer relation: the value of the Fourier transform at one point is obtained by multiplying its value at another point by a trigonometric polynomial. Iterating this relation expresses the Fourier transform along an arithmetic progression as a product of such trigonometric factors times a fixed initial value. We then recast this product in an ergodic theoretic framework by viewing it as a Birkhoff sum for a continuous observable on a compact abelian group generated by a diagonal unitary matrix. The key quantity controlling the growth or decay of the Fourier transform along the progression is a space average, namely the integral over the compact group of the logarithm of the absolute value of the associated trigonometric polynomial. The main rigorously proved statement is the following. If, for some frequency where the Fourier transform does not vanish along the entire progression, this space average is nonzero, or if the average is zero but a certain recurrence set, in the sense of Atkinson's theorem, intersects a distinguished one-parameter subgroup, then the assumed translation--modulation identity forces exponential growth of the Fourier transform along some sequence of points. This contradicts the rapid decay required of a Schwartz function.</description>

      <title>A Kernel-Based Approach for Modelling Gaussian Processes with Functional Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.11023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are ubiquitous tools for modeling and predicting continuous processes in physical and engineering sciences. This is partly due to the fact that one may employ a Gaussian process as an interpolator while facilitating straightforward uncertainty quantification at other locations. In addition to training data, it is sometimes the case that available information is not in the form of a finite collection of points. For example, boundary value problems contain information on the boundary of a domain, or underlying physics lead to known behavior on an entire uncountable subset of the domain of interest. While an approximation to such known information may be obtained via pseudo-training points in the known subset, such a procedure is ad hoc with little guidance on the number of points to use, nor the behavior as the number of pseudo-observations grows large. We propose and construct Gaussian processes that unify, via reproducing kernel Hilbert space, the typical finite training data case with the case of having uncountable information by exploiting the equivalence of conditional expectation and orthogonal projections in Hilbert space. We show existence of the proposed process and establish that it is the limit of a conventional GP conditioned on an increasing number of training points. We illustrate the flexibility and advantages of our proposed approach via numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, variational quantum algorithms have garnered significant attention as a candidate approach for near-term quantum advantage using noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this article we introduce kernel descent, a novel algorithm for minimizing the functions underlying variational quantum algorithms. We compare kernel descent to existing methods and carry out extensive experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness. In particular, we showcase scenarios in which kernel descent outperforms gradient descent and quantum analytic descent. The algorithm follows the well-established scheme of iteratively computing classical local approximations to the objective function and subsequently executing several classical optimization steps with respect to the former. Kernel descent sets itself apart with its employment of reproducing kernel Hilbert space techniques in the construction of the local approximations, which leads to the observed advantages.</description>

      <title>On domination for (non-symmetric) Dirichlet forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary aim of this article is to investigate the domination relationship between two $L^2$-semigroups using probabilistic methods. According to Ouhabaz's domination criterion, the domination of semigroups can be transformed into relationships involving the corresponding Dirichlet forms. Our principal result establishes the equivalence between the domination of Dirichlet forms and the killing transformation of the associated Markov processes, which generalizes and completes the results in \cite{Y962} and \cite{Y96}. Based on this equivalence, we provide a representation of the dominated Dirichlet form using the bivariate Revuz measure associated with the killing transformation and further characterize the sandwiched Dirichlet form within the broader Dirichlet form framework. In particular, our findings apply to the characterization of operators sandwiched between the Dirichlet Laplacian and the Neumann Laplacian. For the local boundary case, we eliminate all technical conditions identified in the literature \cite{AW03} and deliver a complete representation of all sandwiched operators governed by a Robin boundary condition determined by a specific quasi-admissible measure. Additionally, our results offer a comprehensive characterization of related operators in the non-local Robin boundary case, specifically resolving an open problem posed in the literature \cite{OA21}.</description>

      <title>Bimodule Quantum Markov Semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of bimodule quantum Markov semigroups within the framework of quantum Fourier analysis. We introduce the concepts of bimodule detailed balance conditions and bimodule KMS symmetry, which not only generalize the classical notions of detailed balance but also expose interesting structures of quantum channels. We demonstrate that the evolution of densities governed by the bimodule quantum Markov semigroup with bimodule detailed balance is the gradient flow for the relative entropy with respect to the hidden density. Consequently, we obtain a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality and a Talagrand inequality with respect to a hidden density from higher dimensional structure. Furthermore, we establish a Poincar\'{e} inequality for irreducible inclusions and relative ergodic bimodule quantum semigroups.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and stability of the Lagrange representation of the n-D wave equation via boundary triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Lagrange representation of the wave equation with generalized Laplacian $\operatorname{div} T \nabla$. We allow the coefficients -- the Young modulus $T$ and the density $\rho$ -- to be $\mathrm{L}^{\infty}$ or even nonlocal operators. Moreover, the Lipschitz boundary of the domain $\Omega$ can be split into several parts admitting Dirichlet, Neumann and/or Robin-boundary conditions of displacement, velocity and stress. We show well-posedness of this classical model of the wave equation utilizing boundary triple theory for skew-adjoint operators. In addition we show semi-uniform stability of solutions under slightly stronger assumptions by means of a spectral result.</description>

      <title>Bimodule KMS Symmetric Quantum Markov Semigroups and Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The bimodule KMS symmetry of a bimodule quantum Markov semigroup extends the classical KMS symmetry of a quantum Markov semigroup. Compared with (bimodule) GNS symmetry, the (bimodule) KMS symmetry retains significantly more of the underlying noncommutativity. In this paper, we study bimodule KMS symmetric quantum Markov semigroups and introduce directional matrices for such semigroups, which reduce to diagonal matrices in the GNS symmetric setting. Using these directional matrices, we establish a corresponding gradient-flow structure. As a consequence, we obtain both a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality and a Talagrand inequality for bimodule KMS symmetric quantum Markov semigroups.</description>

      <title>Linear dynamics of random products of weighted shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to study the dynamics of random products of weighted shifts on a separable Fr\'echet sequence space. That is, given a measure-preserving dynamical system $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu, \tau)$, a Fr\'echet sequence space $X$ with a basis $(e_n)_{n \geq 0}$, and a strongly measurable map $T : \Omega \to \mathcal{B}(X)$ taking values in a finite set of weighted shifts on $X$, we study the dynamics of the sequence $(T(\tau^{n-1}\omega) \dotsm T(\tau \omega) T(\omega))_{n \geq 1}$ for almost every $\omega \in \Omega$. After proving criteria to determine whether this sequence is universal, weakly mixing or mixing for almost every $\omega \in \Omega$, we study some examples on the spaces $X = \ell_p$, $X = c_0$ and $X = H(\mathbb{C})$ involving two shifts, first in the commuting case and then in the non-commuting one.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in C$^*$-algebras: tensor products of state spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the Namioka-Phelps minimal and maximal tensor products of compact convex sets arising as state spaces of C$^*$-algebras, and, relatedly, study entanglement in (infinite dimensional) C$^*$-algebras. The minimal Namioka-Phelps tensor product of the state spaces of two C$^*$-algebras is shown to correspond to the set of separable (= un-entangled) states on the tensor product of the C$^*$-algebras. We show that these maximal and minimal tensor product of the state spaces agree precisely when one of the two C$^*$-algebras is commutative. This confirms an old conjecture by Barker in the case where the compact convex sets are state spaces of C$^*$-algebras.
  The Namioka-Phelps tensor product of the trace simplexes of two C$^*$-algebras is shown always to be the trace simplex of the tensor product of the C$^*$-algebras. This can be used, for example, to show that the trace simplex of (any) tensor product of C$^*$-algebras is the Poulsen simplex if and only if the trace simplex of each of the C$^*$-algebras is the Poulsen simplex or trivial (and not all trivial).</description>
