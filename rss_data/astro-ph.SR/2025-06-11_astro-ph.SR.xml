      <title>Spectroscopic and kinematic analyses of a warm survivor of a D6 supernova</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SDSSJ163712.21+363155.9 is a candidate hyper-runaway star, first identified from its unusual spectrum in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which exhibits oxygen, magnesium, and silicon lines redshifted by several $100\,$km/s, leading to the suggestion it was ejected from a thermonuclear supernova. We have acquired GTC OSIRIS spectroscopy of SDSSJ1637+3631 establishing a warm ($T_\mathrm{eff}=15680\pm250\,$K) carbon+oxygen dominated atmosphere, that is also abundant in the intermediate mass elements silicon, sulphur, and calcium. We interpret SDSSJ1637+3631 as the donor to an accreting white dwarf that exploded in a dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation (D6) type Ia supernova, where the current composition is consistent with a CO white dwarf core, enriched with intermediate mass elements from deposited supernova ejecta. While SDSSJ1637+3631 has a low-precision Gaia parallax, our spectroscopic surface gravity ($\log g=6.3\pm0.3\,$dex) helps constrain its tangential velocity to $1950^{+810}_{-530}\,$km/s, providing additional support to the D6 mechanism. Under the assumption that SDSSJ1637+3631 is a D6 survivor, we construct a kinematic model combining all astrometric, spectroscopic, and photometric information, but also including the structure and gravitational potential of the Milky Way. Our model localises the ejection site to the inner few kpc of the Galactic disc (though excluding the Galactic centre), with an ejection speed of $1870^{+360}_{-300}\,$km/s, and a $4.5^{+0.4}_{-0.5}\,$Myr time of flight.</description>

      <title>AstroSat/UVIT Study of NGC 663: first detection of Be+sdOB systems in a young star cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Be stars are rapidly rotating stars surrounded by a disc; however, the origin of these remains unclear. Mass and angular momentum transfer in close binaries account for the rapid rotation of a major fraction of Be stars, supported by the previous detection of low-mass stripped companions to them. The stripped companions can be helium burning subdwarf OB-type stars (sdOBs), and white dwarfs (WDs). Aims. The main objective of this study is to characterise the identified Be stars in the young open cluster NGC 663, and search for possible hot companions. Methods. We present the first ultraviolet (UV) photometric study of NGC 663 using far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV) data from UVIT/AstroSat as a part of the UOCS series (XVIII). We identified 23 previously known Be stars in the cluster. Further, we utilised the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting technique to derive the fundamental parameters and to search for UV-bright companions of the identified Be stars. Results. Our study reveals that 19 out of 23 Be stars show a significant UV excess, indicating the presence of hot companions. Here, we report the first detection of high-mass sdOB companions to Be stars, with 69.5% of them found in binaries within a cluster, offering direct evidence of binary interactions. Conclusions. This study showcases the key role of binary interactions in the formation of Be stars in clusters and provides insights into massive star evolution.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Subsurface Flows in Solar Active Regions During the May 2024 Storm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In May 2024, the Sun exhibited intense magnetic activity, marked by numerous high-intensity flares resulting from the interaction and merging of NOAA ARs 13664 and 13668 in the southern hemisphere and AR 13663 in the northern hemisphere. Notably, AR 13664 displayed an extended lifetime, remaining visible after a full solar rotation and continuing to produce significant flaring activity. In this study, we investigate the evolution of sub-photospheric plasma flows associated with these ARs during their disk passage using ring-diagram analysis of SDO/HMI Dopplergrams. We analyze flow divergence, vorticity, and kinetic helicity across depths from the surface to 25 Mm, revealing pronounced temporal and depth-dependent variations. Our observations indicate that the majority of flares occur on the days when the Normalized Helicity Gradient Variance, a measure of kinetic helicity spread, peaks or on the following day. Furthermore, we examine the relationship between subsurface flow dynamics and surface magnetic properties of these complex active regions to understand the interaction between them.</description>

      <title>The VMC Survey -- LIV. Anomalous Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds Period-Luminosity relations in the near-infrared bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous Cepheids (ACs) are less studied metal-poor pulsating stars ([Fe/H]&lt;-1.5) compared to Classical Cepheids (CCs) and RR Lyrae stars. They follow distinct Period-Luminosity (PL) and Period-Wesenheit (PW) relations and pulsate in either the fundamental (F) or first overtone (1O) mode. Our goal is to assess the precision and accuracy of AC-based distances and evaluate their potential for establishing an independent distance scale. We derive new PL and PW relations for F-mode, 1O-mode, and, for the first time, combined F+1O ACs in the Magellanic Clouds. We study their wavelength dependence and apply the relations to estimate distances to Local Group stellar systems hosting ACs, while also confirming AC classifications. Our analysis is based on near-infrared time-series photometry in the Y, J, and Ks bands for about 200 ACs in the Magellanic Clouds from the VISTA survey of the Magellanic Clouds system (VMC, 2009-2018). VMC data are complemented with optical photometry from Gaia DR3 and OGLE-IV, which also provide periods and pulsation modes. Custom light-curve templates were used to derive precise intensity-averaged magnitudes for 118 ACs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and 75 in the Small Magellanic Cloud. These data were used to derive multi-band PL and PW relations, calibrated using the geometric LMC distance from eclipsing binaries. We find that PL relation slopes increase and dispersions decrease with wavelength. Using Gaia parallaxes, we determine the LMC distance modulus and the LMC-SMC relative distance. We also confirm the AC nature of several new candidates in Galactic Globular Clusters and derive a distance modulus for the Draco dSph galaxy of 19.425+/-0.048 mag. A 0.1 mag discrepancy with RR Lyrae-based distances may reflect metallicity effects. Future spectroscopic surveys and Gaia DR4 will help refine the AC distance scale and quantify metallicity impacts.</description>

      <title>Precise Age For The Binary HD 21278 In The Young Alpha Persei Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the double-lined spectroscopic binary HD 21278 that contains one of the brightest main sequence stars in the young $\alpha$ Persei open cluster. We analyzed new spectra and reanalyzed archived spectra to measure precise new radial velocity curves for the binary. We also obtained interferometric data using the CHARA Array at Mount Wilson to measure the sky positions of the two stars and the inclination of the $\sim$ 2 milliarcsecond orbit. We determine that the two stars have masses of $5.381 \pm 0.084 M_{\odot}$ and $3.353 \pm 0.064 M_{\odot}$. From isochrone fits, we find the cluster's age to be $49 \pm 7$ Myr (using PARSEC models) or $49.5 \pm 6$ Myr (MIST models). Finally, we revisit the massive white dwarfs that are candidate escapees from the $\alpha$ Persei cluster to try to better characterize the massive end of the white dwarf initial-final mass relation. The implied progenitor masses challenge the idea that Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs are made by single stars with masses near $8 \msun$.</description>

      <title>The Evolution Of Rotating Supermassive Pop III Stars On The Main Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of billion-solar-mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the first billion years of cosmic history challenges conventional theories of black hole formation and growth. Simultaneously, recent JWST observations revealing exceptionally high nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratios in galaxies at high redshifts raise critical questions about rapid chemical enrichment mechanisms operating in the early universe. Supermassive stars (SMSs) with masses of 1000 to 10000 M$_{\odot}$ are promising candidates to explain these phenomena, but existing models have so far neglected the pivotal role of stellar rotation. Here, we present the first comprehensive evolutionary models of rotating Pop III SMSs computed using the GENEC stellar evolution code, including detailed treatments of rotation-induced chemical mixing, angular momentum transport, and mass loss driven by the $\Omega\Gamma$ limit. We demonstrate that rotation significantly enlarges the convective core and extends stellar lifetimes by up to 20%, with moderate enhancement of mass-loss rates as stars approach critical rotation thresholds. Our results further indicate that the cores of SMSs rotate relatively slowly (below $\sim 200$ km s$^{-1}$), resulting in dimensionless spin parameters $a* &lt; 0.1$ for intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) remnants that are notably lower than theoretical maximum spins. These findings highlight rotation as a key factor in determining the structural evolution, chemical yields, and black hole spin properties of SMSs, providing critical insights to interpret observational signatures from the high-redshift universe.</description>

      <title>Switchbacks near Boundaries of Small-scale Magnetic Flux Ropes in the Young Solar Wind from Parker Solar Probe Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission has revealed frequent occurrences of switchbacks (SBs) and small-scale magnetic flux ropes (SMFRs) as prominent structures within the solar wind. These mesoscale features are observed across all heliocentric distances, with heightened activity in the young solar wind, such as successive SMFRs, blobs, and SBs using PSP in situ observations. One study, in particular, focuses on SMFRs observed during the intervals of PSP co-rotating with the Sun, which suggests a similar source of the observed solar wind. In this letter, we identified SBs at the boundaries of SMFRs as a regularly observed phenomenon and found instances where SBs and SMFRs co-occur, with the significance level $\alpha&lt;0.05$. The SMFR-related SBs - observed at the leading and trailing edges of an SMFR - exhibit well-organized axial co-orientations, with their polarity flipping, meaning the radial direction remains constrained while the transversal field reverses. Furthermore, the axial field directions of SMFRs-related SBs appear to be more closely connected than to another SB that is spatially closer and are linked to the SMFR orientation. Our analysis of their relative geometry, which examines the alignment between SBs and the SMFR axis, reveals a distinct tendency emphasizing their correlation, further supporting the idea that the axes of SMFR-related SBs are presumably determined by the SMFR orientation. Observations suggest that a fraction of SBs is spatially and temporally associated with SMFRs, implying that processes related to SMFR boundaries may contribute to SB formation, or that SBs tend to develop in magnetic environments shaped by SMFRs.</description>

      <title>Total Power and Low-energy Cut-off Time Evolution of Solar Flare Accelerated Electrons Using X-Ray Observations and Warm-Target Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A primary characteristic of solar flares is the efficient acceleration of electrons to nonthermal deka-keV energies. While hard X-Ray (HXR) observation of bremsstrahlung emission serves as the key diagnostic of these electrons. In this study, we investigate the time evolution of flare-accelerated electrons using the warm-target model. This model, unlike the commonly used cold-target model, can determine the low-energy cut-off in the nonthermal electron distribution, so that the energetics of nonthermal electrons can be deduced more accurately. Here, we examine the time-evolution of nonthermal electrons in flares well-observed by the RHESSI and the Solar Orbiter (SolO, using the STIX instrument) spacecrafts. Using spectroscopic and imaging HXR observations, the time evolution of the low-energy cut-off of the accelerated electron distribution, the total power of nonthermal electrons, total rate of nonthermal electrons, and excess thermal emission measure from the nonthermal electrons, are investigated. We find that the time profile of the low-energy cut-off of the accelerated electron distribution shows a high-low-high trend around the HXR bursts of flares, while the time evolution of the total rate of injected electrons shows a low-high-low behavior. Although the total power of nonthermal electrons is sensitive to the cut-off energy, the temporal variation of the flare power follows the temporal variation of the acceleration rate. We further find that the highest contribution of the excess thermal emission measure coming from thermalization of injected electrons takes place around the hard X-ray peak.</description>

      <title>High-resolution Observations of a C9.3 White-light Flare and Its Impact on the Solar Photosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of a C9.3 white-light flare using high-resolution observations from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST). The flare occurred near the eastern solar limb on September 11, 2023, within NOAA AR 13431, and produced beam electrons with energies just below 50 keV as observed by the the Hard X-ray Imager (HXI) onboard the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S). Two white-light flare kernels were detected in the TiO band, connected by filamentary brightenings aligned with penumbral fibrils, suggesting a photospheric contribution to the white-light emission. Notably, the impact of the flare on the solar photosphere was characterized by sudden vortex flows and significant amplification of magnetic field in the white-light flare kernel region. We infer that this impact is driven by the propagation of flare-generated Alfv\'en wave pulses, which deposited energy into the photosphere. These observations support the potential role of the Alfv\'en wave mechanism in driving energy transport and heating during white-light flares.</description>

      <title>Driven phase-mixed Alfv\'en waves in a partially ionized solar plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase mixing has long been understood to be a viable mechanism for expediting the dissipation of Alfv\'en wave energy resulting in the subsequent heating of the solar atmosphere. To fulfil the conditions necessary for phase mixing to occur, we consider the cross-field gradient in the Alfv\'en speed as a free parameter in our model. Using a single-fluid description of a partially ionized chromospheric plasma, we explore the efficiency of damping of shear Alfv\'en waves subject to phase mixing when a pulse wave driver is employed. Our results demonstrate a strong dependence of the dissipation length of shear Alfv\'en waves on both the ionization degree of the plasma and the gradient of the Alfv\'en speed. When assessing the efficiency of phase mixing across various inhomogeneities, our findings indicate that waves originating from a pulse driver exhibit initially identical heating rates as those generated by a continuous wave driver. One key difference observed was that Alfv\'en pulses possess a lower overall decay rate due to a change in damping profile from exponential to algebraic. This discrepancy arises from the absence of a consistent injection of energy into the base of the domain, that preserves longitudinal gradients of the magnetic field perturbations more effectively. These findings demonstrate the importance of understanding the relations between the wave driver, damping mechanisms, and propagation dynamics in resolving the atmospheric heating problem.</description>

      <title>Understanding the complex morphology of a CME: multi-view analysis and numerical modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although all coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that propagate into the heliosphere should contain a magnetic flux rope (MFR) component, the majority do not exhibit the expected white-light MFR morphology of a leading edge plus cavity. This different appearance could be the result of distortion of the internal magnetic structure, merging with other structures, or simply projection effects. These factors complicate the interpretation of CMEs. This complexity is exemplified by a CME observed on 28 March 2022. The event originated from a single eruption, evolving as a textbook CME in the low corona but appearing as a complex two-MFR structure in white-light observations. Why? To answer this question, we performed a multi-view data and modeling analysis to describe the CME coronal evolution. The thermodynamic MHD model, CORHEL-CME, helps reveal the magnetic configuration of this CME and also reveals that the ambient field plays a crucial role in shaping the complex structure of the CME during early evolution. Our research underscores the importance of integrating multiview observations with physics-based models to gain a deeper insight into the development of complex CMEs.</description>

      <title>The interplay of the parametric instability and MRI in oscillatory shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of warped disks is governed by internal, oscillatory shear flows driven by their distorted geometry. However, these flows are known to be vigorously unstable to a hydrodynamic parametric instability. In many warped systems this might coexist and compete with the magnetorotational instability. The interplay of these phenomena and their combined impact on the internal flows has not been studied. To this end we perform three-dimensional, magneto+hydrodynamic unstratified shearing box simulations with an oscillatory radial forcing function, to mimic the effects of a warped disk. In the hydrodynamic study we find that the parametric instability manifests as strong, vertical `elevator' flows which resist the sloshing motion. Above a critical forcing amplitude, these also emerge in our magnetized runs and dominate the vertical stress, although they are partially weakened by the MRI and hence the system equilibrates with larger radial sloshing flows. Below this critical forcing, the MRI effectively quenches the parametric instability. In all cases we find that the internal stresses are anisotropic in character and better described by a viscoelastic relationship with the shearing flows. Unfortunately, these important effects are typically unresolved in global simulations of warped disks and are simplified in analytically tractable models. The incorporation of such complex, warp-amplitude-dependent, viscoelastic stresses will sensitively regulate the laminar flow response, and inevitably modify the detailed spatio-temporal evolution of warped systems.</description>

      <title>Responses of a Coronal Hole to a Fast Flare-Driven Coronal Wave</title>

Abstract: Coronal waves, significant solar phenomena, act as diagnostic tools for scientists studying solar atmosphere properties. Here, we present a novel observation detailing how a coronal wave event, associated with an X5.0 class flare, influenced the properties of an adjacent coronal hole through interaction. The coronal wave was observed in both extreme ultraviolet observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory and Lyman-alpha observations from the Solar Disk Imager aboard the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory. Utilizing the method of differential emission measure, we found that as the coronal wave passed through, the adjacent coronal hole experienced an increase in temperature from 1.31 to 1.43 MK and a rise in density from $\sim$1.62$\times10^{8}$ to 1.76$\times10^{8}$ cm$^{-3}$ within the rising period of $\sim$7 minutes. Subsequently, after the wave passed, the entire coronal hole transitioned to a new state with a slight temperature increase and a 14$\%$ decrease in density, with more pronounced changes observed at the coronal hole's boundary. Taking into account the impacts of radiative loss and heat conduction, the coronal wave was estimated to provide an average energy of 2.2$\times10^{8}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ to the coronal hole during the short rising period. This study highlights the identification of the coronal wave in both extreme ultraviolet and Lyman-alpha observations, shedding light on the significant energy input, particularly within the coronal hole. These findings provide new insights into better understanding kinematics of fast coronal waves, energy transfer processes open versus closed magnetic topologies, and the possible acceleration of solar winds.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the hidden potential of pulsar astronomy</title>

Abstract: Pulsars have traditionally been used for research into fundamental physics and astronomy. In this paper, we investigate the expanding applications of radio pulsars in societal and industrial domains beyond their conventional scientific roles. We describe emerging applications in positioning, navigation, timing and synchronization, random number generation, space weather monitoring, public engagement, antenna calibration techniques, and leveraging extensive pulsar data sets generated by large-scale observatories. Such pulsar data sets have already been used to demonstrate quantum-computing algorithms.
  We evaluate the potential for compact radio receiver systems for pulsar detection by describing optimal observing bands. We show that relatively simple and compact receiver systems can detect the brightest pulsar, Vela. The equivalent of an ~4m-diameter dish with a small bandwidth operating around 700 MHz would be able to detect many more pulsars. Such a detector would be able to localise itself to around 10 km using pulsar navigation techniques.
  The space weather community requires direct measurements of the integrated electron density at a range of solar elongations. The only method to get model-independent values is through pulsar observations and we explore the possibility of measuring dispersion measures (DMs) and rotation measures with a range of telescopes (observing from low to mid-frequencies) as well as using a typical model to predict the variation of the DM as a function of solar radii. We review how pulsars can be used to produce random sequences and demonstrate that such sequences can be produced using the scintillation properties of pulsars as well as from pulse jitter.</description>

      <title>An environmental analysis of supernova iPTF13bvn with HST and MUSE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searches for supernovae (SNe) progenitors have relied on a direct detection of the star in fortuitous pre-explosion images. We propose an alternative method, using a combination of photometric stellar population fitting alongside integral-field-unit (IFU) spectroscopic analysis of the ionised gas to fully explore the SN environment and constrain the progenitor properties. Isochrone fitting of HST/WFC3 observations reveals the environment of iPTF13bvn contains two stellar populations with unique age ($\tau=\log{t [years]}$) and extinction ($A_V$) values, with the closest agreement found between past progenitor studies of iPTF13bvn and our oldest stellar population (P2): $\tau_{P2}=6.97^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$, a corresponding initial mass $M_{initial,P2} = 20.0 M_\odot$ and $A_{V,P2}=0.53^{+0.10}_{-0.08}$ mag. Further analysis with VLT/MUSE IFU-spectroscopic observations reveals no bright H II regions associated with iPTF13bvn, suggesting no immediate ongoing star formation. Extinctions derived from the ionised gas are a minimum of ~2.5 times higher than the resolved stellar population values, assisting in building a 3D picture of the environment. An analysis of the distribution of spaxel extinctions reveals increased variability in the environment of iPTF13bvn, on the edge of a spiral arm. Our study highlights the complex relationship between stars, gas and dust and how, when used in a holistic environmental analysis, they can begin to resolve degeneracies that have plagued past progenitor investigations. Specifically for iPTF13bvn, our results support a binary progenitor and a growing consensus for binarity as the predominant mass-loss mechanism for Type Ib SNe progenitors.</description>

      <title>Dense Matter in Neutron Stars with eXTP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this White Paper, we present the potential of the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry (eXTP) mission to constrain the equation of state of dense matter in neutron stars, exploring regimes not directly accessible to terrestrial experiments. By observing a diverse population of neutron stars - including isolated objects, X-ray bursters, and accreting systems - eXTP's unique combination of timing, spectroscopy, and polarimetry enables high-precision measurements of compactness, spin, surface temperature, polarimetric signals, and timing irregularity. These multifaceted observations, combined with advances in theoretical modeling, pave the way toward a comprehensive description of the properties and phases of dense matter from the crust to the core of neutron stars. Under development by an international Consortium led by the Institute of High Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the eXTP mission is planned to be launched in early 2030.</description>

      <title>IRAS 16475-4609: A Young Compact HII Region Sculpting Its Molecular Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a near-infrared spectroscopic and imaging analysis of the star-forming region IRAS 16475-4609, based on TripleSpec/SOAR spectroscopy and NEWFIRM/CTIO imaging, complemented by archival radio and sub-millimeter data. Our spectroscopic analysis indicates that the central source is an early B-type star (B0-B0.7V) powering a compact HII region characterized by strong HI and HeI recombination lines, and molecular H$_2$ emission. We derive a distance of 3.51$\pm$0.74 kpc, consistent with the position of the Scutum-Crux near arm at Galactic longitudes of $\sim$340$^\circ$. At this distance, the ionized gas traced by Brackett-$\gamma$ emission has a radius of 0.27$\pm$0.06 pc, placing the source in a transition phase between ultra-compact and compact HII regions. From radio data, we estimate an ionizing photon flux of N$_{ly}$=(2.3$\pm$0.3)$\times10^{47}$ photons s$^{-1}$, and an electron temperature of T$_e$=(5.4$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^3$ K for the ionized gas. The analysis also reveals an obscured high-density molecular clump southwest of the HII region, coincident with an ATLASGAL sub-millimeter peak, indicating a potential site of ongoing and triggered star formation as the ionization front advances into the surrounding molecular material. These results suggest that IRAS 16475-4609 is a young high-mass star-forming region with stellar feedback actively shaping its environment, offering valuable insight into the early evolution of compact HII regions.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Species Atmospheric Escape Model with Excited Hydrogen and Helium: Application to HD209458b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric escape shapes exoplanet evolution and star-planet interactions, with He I 10830 \AA\ absorption serving as a key tracer of mass loss in hot gas giants. However, transit depths vary significantly across observed systems for reasons that remain poorly understood. HD209458b, the archetypal hot-Jupiter, exhibits relatively weak He I 10830 \AA\ and H$\alpha$ absorption, which has been interpreted as evidence for a high H/He ratio (98/2), possibly due to diffusive separation. To investigate this possibility and other processes that control these transit depths, we reassess excitation and de-excitation rates for metastable helium and explore the impact of diffusion processes, stellar activity, and tidal forces on the upper atmosphere and transit depths using a model framework spanning the whole atmosphere. Our model reproduces the observed He I transit depth and H$\alpha$ upper limit, showing strong diffusive separation. We match the observations assuming a photoelectron efficiency of 20-40\%, depending on the composition of the atmosphere, corresponding to mass-loss rates of $1.9-3\times10^{10}$ g/s. We find that the He I 10830 \AA\ transit depth is sensitive to both stellar activity and diffusion processes, while H$\alpha$ is largely unaffected due to its strong dependence on Lyman-$\alpha$ excitation. These differences may help explain the system-to-system scatter seen in population-level studies of the He I line. While He I data alone may not tightly constrain mass-loss rates or temperatures, they do confirm atmospheric escape and help narrow the viable parameter space when interpreted with physically motivated models. Simultaneous observations of He I, H$\alpha$, and stellar activity indicators provide powerful constraints on upper atmosphere dynamics and composition, even in the absence of full transmission spectra.</description>

      <title>The effect of plasma expansion on the dispersion properties of MHD waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08248v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we employ the set of ideal expanding magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations within the Expanding Box Model (EBM) framework to theoretically characterize the effects of radial solar wind expansion on its characteristic linear MHD waves. Through the analytical derivation of dispersion relations by a first-order expansion of the MHD-EBM equations, we explore the changes in wave propagation across a range of heliocentric distances on the linear magnetohydrodynamic modes: the Alfv\'en mode and the fast and slow magnetosonic modes, as obtained from the ideal MHD-EBM equations. Our findings reveal a spatial dependence in the derived dispersion relations that aligns with both the literature and the traditional ideal MHD case in the non-expanding limit, thereby helping to bridge the gap between theory and observation in solar wind dynamics. We observe a general decrease in wave frequencies as the plasma expands farther from the Sun. This decrease is reflected in the dispersion relations through the radial decrease of both the Alfv\'en and sound speeds, which decrease proportionally to $1/R$ and $1/R^{\gamma - 1}$, respectively, where $\gamma$ is the plasma polytropic index. The fast magnetosonic mode frequency and phase speed are significantly affected by the polytropic index value. We consider three models for the polytropic index evolution in the expanding solar wind: a constant (quasi-adiabatic) case, a radially decreasing profile in the outer heliosphere, and a model incorporating thermodynamic heating effects. Notably, we find that in the case of a decreasing polytropic index, the fast magnetosonic mode experiences an acceleration in the distant heliosphere, highlighting the significant influence of expansion on solar wind dynamics.</description>

      <title>Submillimeter and Mid-Infrared Variability of Young Stellar Objects in the M17 HII Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of young stellar object (YSO) variability at submillimeter and mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelengths for the M\,17 \ion{H}{2} region, using 3.5 years monitoring data from the JCMT Transient Survey at $450$ and $850\,\mu$m and 9 years mid-IR monitoring data from the NEOWISE mission. Our study encompasses observations of 198 and 164 bright submillimeter peaks identified within the deep JCMT coadded maps at 450 and $850\,\mu$m, and 66 YSOs seen by NEOWISE W2 that were previously identified in mid-IR observations. We find one robust linear submillimeter variable, an intermediate mass protostar, with a $4\%$ peak flux change in 3.5 years of JCMT monitoring that sets a lower limit of $16\%$ luminosity increase for the source. At mid-IR wavelengths, our analysis reveals secular and stochastic variability in 22 YSOs, with the highest fraction of secular variability occurring at the earliest evolutionary stage. This mid-IR fractional variability as a function of evolutionary stage result is similar to what has previously been found for YSO variability within the Gould Belt and the intermediate-mass star formation region M17\,SWex, though overall less variability is detected in M\,17 in submillimeter and mid-IR. We suspect that this lower detection of YSO variability is due to both the greater distance to M\,17 and the strong feedback from the \ion{H}{2} region. Our findings showcase the utility of multiwavelength observations to better capture the complex variability phenomena inherent to star formation processes and demonstrate the importance of years-long monitoring of a diverse selection of star-forming environments.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the Visual Binary TOI-6883AB and its dynamical implications for the planetary companion TOI-6883Ab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that TOI-6883 is a physically bound visual binary system composed of two solar-type stars, TOI-6883A (TIC 393818343) and TOI-6883B (TIC 393818340), initially regarded as a single star hosting the exoplanet TOI-6883b. Gaia DR3 astrometry shows that both stars have nearly identical parallaxes 10.6 mas, consistent proper motions, and a projected separation of 616 AU, confirming their binary nature. Using astrometric and photometric data, we estimate the stellar masses, physical separation, and an orbital period of 15,000 years. The system is energetically bound. We revise the planet designation to TOI-6883Ab to reflect stellar multiplicity. We evaluate the impact of the binary companion on planetary stability and find the planet's orbit to be long-term stable, although Kozai-Lidov perturbations remain possible. Further astrometric and photometric follow-up will be essential to better constrain the binary orbit and assess potential dynamical influences on the planetary architecture.</description>

      <title>The Evolutionary Path of Star-Forming Clumps in Hi-GAL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star formation (SF) studies are benefiting from the huge amount of data made available by recent large-area Galactic plane surveys conducted between 2 {\mu}m and 3 mm. Fully characterizing SF demands integrating far-infrared/sub-millimetre (FIR/sub-mm) data, tracing the earliest phases, with near-/mid-infrared (NIR/MIR) observations, revealing later stages characterized by YSOs just before main sequence star appearance. However, the resulting dataset is often a complex mix of heterogeneous and intricate features, limiting the effectiveness of traditional analysis in uncovering hidden patterns and relationships. In this framework, machine learning emerges as a powerful tool to handle the complexity of feature-rich datasets and investigate potential physical connections between the cold dust component traced by FIR/sub-mm emission and the presence of YSOs. We present a study on the evolutionary path of star forming clumps in the Hi-GAL survey through a multi-step approach, with the final aims of (a) obtaining a robust and accurate set of features able to well classify the star forming clumps in Hi-GAL based on their evolutionary properties, (b) establishing whether a connection exists between the cold material reservoir in clumps, traced by FIR/sub-mm emission, and the already formed YSOs, precursors of stars. For these purposes, our designed experiments aim at testing whether the FIR/sub-mm properties related to clumps are sufficient to predict the clump evolutionary stage, without considering the direct information about the embedded YSOs at NIR/MIR. Our machine learning-based method involves a four-step approach, based on feature engineering, data handling, feature selection and classification. Our findings suggest that FIR/sub-mm and NIR/MIR emissions trace different evolutionary phases of star forming clumps, highlighting the complex and asynchronous nature of the SF process.</description>

      <title>A New Spectral Class of Brown Dwarfs at the Bottom of the IMF in IC 348</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous study, we used JWST to identify three new brown dwarfs in the center of a nearby star-forming cluster, IC 348. The faintest object had an estimated mass of 3-4 $M_{\rm Jup}$, making it a contender for the least massive brown dwarf confirmed with spectroscopy. Two of the new brown dwarfs also exhibited absorption features from an unidentified aliphatic hydrocarbon, which were not predicted by atmospheric models and were not previously detected in atmospheres outside of the solar system. We have used JWST to perform a deeper survey for brown dwarfs across a larger field in IC 348. We have identified 39 brown dwarf candidates in NIRCam images and have obtained spectra for 15 of them with NIRSpec, nine of which are classified as substellar members of the cluster. The faintest new members have mass estimates of $\sim2$ $M_{\rm Jup}$, providing a new constraint on the minimum mass of the IMF. Two new members ($\sim2$ and 10 $M_{\rm Jup}$) exhibit large excess emission from circumstellar disks, demonstrating that they harbor the raw materials for planet formation. Finally, eight of the nine new brown dwarfs and one known member that is newly observed with NIRSpec show the aforementioned hydrocarbon features. Among the total of 11 brown dwarfs in IC 348 that have hydrocarbon detections, the features are stronger at fainter magnitudes, indicating that the hydrocarbon is a natural constituent of the atmospheres of the coolest newborn brown dwarfs. We propose a new spectral class "H" that is defined by the presence of the 3.4 $\mu$m fundamental band of the hydrocarbon.</description>

      <title>Tidally Delayed Spin-Down of Very Low Mass Stars</title>

Abstract: Very low-mass main-sequence stars reveal some curious trends in observed rotation period distributions that require abating the spin-down that standard rotational evolution models would otherwise imply. By dynamically coupling magnetically mediated spin-down to tidally induced spin-up from close orbiting substellar companions, we show that tides from sub-stellar companions may explain these trends. In particular, brown dwarf companions can delay the spin-down and explain the dearth of field, late-type M dwarfs with intermediate rotation periods. We find that tidal forces also strongly influence stellar X-ray activity evolution, so that methods of gyrochronological aging must be generalized for stars with even sub-stellar companions. We also discuss how the theoretical predictions of the spin evolution model can be used with future data to constrain the population distribution of companion orbital separations.</description>

      <title>The NEMESIS Catalogue of Young Stellar Objects for the Orion Star Formation Complex. I. General description of data curation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08486</link>

Abstract: The past decade has seen a rise in the use of Machine Learning methods in the study of young stellar evolution. This trend has led to a growing need for a comprehensive database of young stellar objects (YSO) that goes beyond survey-specific biases and that can be employed for training, validation, and refining the physical interpretation of machine learning outcomes. We reviewed the literature focused on the Orion Star Formation complex (OSFC) to compile a thorough catalogue of previously identified YSO candidates in the region including the curation of observables relevant to probe their youth. Starting from the NASA/ADS database, we assembled YSO candidates from more than 200 peer-reviewed publications. We collated data products relevant to the study of YSOs into a dedicated catalogue, which was complemented with data from large photometric and spectroscopic surveys and in the Strasbourg astronomical Data Center. We also added significant value to the catalogue by homogeneously deriving YSO infrared classification labels and through a comprehensive curation of labels concerning sources' multiplicity. Finally, we used a panchromatic approach to derive the probabilities that the sources in our catalogue were contaminant extragalactic sources or giant stars. We present the NEMESIS catalogue of YSOs for the OSFC, which includes data collated for 27879 sources covering the whole mass spectrum and the various stages of pre-Main Sequence evolution from protostars to diskless young stars. The catalogue includes a collection of panchromatic photometric data processed into spectral energy distributions, stellar parameters, infrared classes, equivalent widths of emission lines related to YSOs accretion and star-disk interaction, and absorption lines such as lithium and lines related to source's gravity, X-ray emission observables, photometric variability observables, and multiplicity labels.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional simulations of accretion disks in pre-CE systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02933v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Before a binary system enters into a common envelope (CE) phase, accretion from the primary star onto the companion star through Roche Lobe overflow (RLOF) will lead to the formation of an accretion disk, which may generate jets. Accretion before and during the CE may alter the outcome of the interaction. Previous studies have considered different aspects of this physical mechanism. Here we study the properties of an accretion disk formed via 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the RLOF mass transfer between a 7 M$_\odot$, red supergiant star and a 1.4 M$_\odot$, neutron star companion. We simulate only the volume around the companion for improved resolution. We use a 1D implicit MESA simulation of the evolution of the system during 30,000 years between the on-set of the RLOF and the CE to guide the binary parameters and the mass-transfer rate, while we simulate only 21 years of the last part of the RLOF in 3D using an ideal gas isothermal equation of state. We expect that a pre-CE disk under these parameters will have a mass of $\sim 5\times 10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$ and a radius of $\sim$40 R$_\odot$ with a scale height of $\sim$5 R$_\odot$. The temperature profile of the disk is shallower than that predicted by the formalism of Shakura and Sunyaev, but more reasonable cooling physics would need to be included. We stress test these results with respect to a number of physical and numerical parameters, as well as simulation choices, and we expect them to be reasonable within a factor of a few for the mass and 15% for the radius. We also contextualize our results within those presented in the literature, in particular with respect to the dimensionality of simulations and the adiabatic index. We discuss the measured accretion rate in the context of the Shakura and Sunyaev formalism and debate the viscous mechanisms at play, finishing with a list of prospects for future work.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Heating in 1D, 2D, and 3D core-collapse supernovae: characterizing the explosion of high-compactness stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive stars can end their lives with a successful supernova explosion (leaving behind a neutron star or, more rarely, a black hole), or a failed explosion that leaves behind a black hole. The density structure of the pre-collapse progenitor star already encodes much of the information regarding the outcome and properties of the explosion. However, the complexity of the collapse and subsequent shock expansion phases prevents drawing a straightforward connection between the pre-collapse and post-explosion properties. In order to derive such a connection several explodability studies have been performed in recent years. However, different studies can predict different explosion outcomes. In this article, we show how compactness, which is related to the average density of the star's core, has an important role in determining the efficiency of neutrino heating, and therefore the outcome of the explosion. Commonly, high-compactness progenitors are assumed to yield failed explosions, due to their large mass accretion rates, preventing the shock from expanding. We show by analyzing $\sim$ 150 2D FLASH and Fornax simulations and 20 3D Fornax simulations that this is not the case. Instead, due to the rapid increase of neutrino heating with compactness, high-compactness progenitors lead to successful shock revival. We also show that 1D+ simulations that include $\nu$-driven convection using a mixing-length theory approach correctly reproduce this trend. Finally, we compare 1D+ models, which we show can reproduce some aspects of multi-D simulations with reasonable accuracy, with other widely used 1D models in the literature.</description>

      <title>Transient and steady convection in two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulate thermal convection in a two-dimensional square box using the no-slip condition on all boundaries, and isothermal bottom and top walls and adiabatic sidewalls. We choose 0.1 and 1 for the Prandtl number $Pr$ and vary the Rayleigh number $Ra$ between $10^6$ and $10^{12}$. We particularly study the temporal evolution of integral transport quantities towards their steady states. Perhaps not surprisingly, the velocity field evolves more slowly than the thermal field, and its steady state -- which is nominal in the sense that large-amplitude low-frequency oscillations persist around plausible averages -- is reached exponentially. We study these oscillation characteristics. The transient time for the velocity field to achieve its nominal steady state increases almost linearly with the Reynolds number. For large $Ra$, the Reynolds number itself scales almost as $Ra^{2/3} Pr^{-1}$, and the Nusselt number as $Ra^{2/7}$.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Electric Dipole Moment of AlCl by Stark Level Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the measurement of the electric dipole moment of aluminum monochloride (AlCl) using a cryogenic buffer-gas beam source. Using Stark shift spectroscopy, we derive values for the dipole moments in the body-fixed frame of the two lowest vibrational states for the $X^1\Sigma^+$ electronic state, $\mu_X(v''=0) = -1.679$ D and $\mu_X(v'' = 1) = -1.761$ D, and for the $A^1\Pi$ state, $\mu_A(v' = 0) = -1.030$ D and $\mu_A(v' = 1) = -1.052$ D. We also show that the ab initio calculations of the dipole moment and $T_e$ energy of AlCl are sensitive to the level of treatment of the spin-orbit orbit coupling. We further lay out the implications of these results for astrophysical models of stellar and planetary evolution that have used a substitute value for the dipole moment of AlCl until now.</description>

      <title>Expectation for the MeV Gamma-Ray Emission from Pair-Instability Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) are predicted thermonuclear explosions of massive stars with helium core masses exceeding $\sim 65M_\odot$ and synthesize substantial amounts of radioactive $\mathrm{^{56}Ni}$ ($M(\mathrm{^{56}Ni})\sim60M_\odot$ in extreme cases). To investigate their observational signatures, we developed a multi-D Monte Carlo radiation transport code, assuming spherical symmetry in the background medium and the photon sources distribution, and performed simulations of gamma-ray and hard X-ray emissions from the decay chain $\mathrm{^{56}Ni}\to\mathrm{^{56}Co}\to\mathrm{^{56}Fe}$. We find that key gamma-ray lines (847 and 1238 keV) from $\mathrm{^{56}Co}$ decay in the $130M_\odot$ helium core model can be detected up to 300-400 Mpc by next-generation MeV gamma-ray telescopes. In contrast, the signals from the $100M_\odot$ model remain below the detection limits. Our results provide the template for gamma-ray follow-up observations of PISNe. Considering theoretical predictions and observational constraints, we estimate PISN event rates within 300 Mpc to be approximately 0.01-0.1 events per year, highlighting their rarity but also emphasizing their feasibility as targets for future gamma-ray observations over the decade.</description>

      <title>A transiting giant planet in orbit around a 0.2-solar-mass host star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planet formation models suggest that the formation of giant planets is significantly harder around low-mass stars, due to the scaling of protoplanetary disc masses with stellar mass. The discovery of giant planets orbiting such low-mass stars thus imposes strong constraints on giant planet formation processes. Here, we report the discovery of a transiting giant planet orbiting a $0.207 \pm 0.011 M_{\odot}$ star. The planet, TOI-6894 b, has a mass and radius of $M_P = 0.168 \pm 0.022 M_J (53.4 \pm 7.1 M_{\oplus})$ and $R_P = 0.855 \pm 0.022 R_J$, and likely includes $12 \pm 2 M_{\oplus}$ of metals. The discovery of TOI-6894 b highlights the need for a better understanding of giant planet formation mechanisms and the protoplanetary disc environments in which they occur. The extremely deep transits (17% depth) make TOI-6894 b one of the most accessible exoplanetary giants for atmospheric characterisation observations, which will be key for fully interpreting the formation history of this remarkable system and for the study of atmospheric methane chemistry.</description>
