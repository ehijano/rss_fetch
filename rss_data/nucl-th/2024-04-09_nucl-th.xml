      <title>Equation of State of Hot Neutron Star Matter using Finite Range Simple Effective Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equation of state of hot neutron star matter of n+p+e+$\mu$ composition in $\beta$-equilibrium is studied for both neutrino-free isothermal and neutrino-trapped isentropic conditions, using the formalism where the thermal evolution is built upon its zero-temperature predictions in a self-consistent manner. The accuracy of the parabolic approximation, often used in the finite temperature calculation of hot neutron star matter, is verified by comparing with the results obtained from the exact evaluation in the neutrino-free neutron star matter. The equation of state of neutrino-trapped isentropic matter at low entropic condition, relevant to the core-collapsing supernovae, is formulated. In the isentropic matter, the particle fractions and equation of state have marginal variance as entropy per particle varies between 1 to 3 (in the unit of k$_B$), but the temperature profile shows marked variation. The isentropes are found to be much less sensitive to the nuclear matter incompressibility, but have a large dependence on the slope parameter L. The bulk properties of the neutron stars predicted by the isentropic equation of state for different entropy are calculated. A model calculation for the early stage evolution of the protoneutron star to neutron star configuration is also given.</description>

      <title>Shape transition and coexistence in Te isotopes studied with the quadrupole collective Hamiltonian based on a relativistic energy density functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolution and coexistence of shape and the related collective states of even-even Te isotopes are investigated within the quadrupole collective model that is based on the nuclear density functional theory. By means of the constrained self-consistent mean-field calculations performed within the relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov method with a choice of an energy density functional and a pairing force, parameters of the triaxial quadrupole collective Hamiltonian are completely determines. The collective model produces for the near mid-shell nuclei, e.g., $^{116}$Te and $^{118}$Te, low-energy and low-spin excited states, including the $0^+_2$ state, that can be interpreted as the intruder states associated with the strongly deformed prolate minimum in the potential energy surface, along with the $0^+_1$ ground state that is attributed to the normal state based on a weakly oblate deformed global minimum. The collective model calculation suggests the lowering of the $0^+_2$ energy level toward neutron mid-shell, as observed experimentally. The sensitivity of the mean-field and spectroscopic results to the choice of the pairing strength is also analyzed, and it is shown that by increasing the pairing strength description of the low-lying states of the near mid-shell nuclei is improved.</description>

      <title>Variational Optimization for Constructing Inverse Potentials of Proton-Proton Scattering: A Phase Function Method Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: The phase-shift analysis for proton-proton scattering has been studied by various research groups using the realistic potentials to be comprised of various internal interactions based on an exchange of pions and mesons, involving a large number of parameters. Purpose: The goal of the research is to construct inverse potentials for various l-channels of proton-proton (pp) elastic scattering using the 3-parameter Morse function in combination with atomic Hulthen by utilizing the phase function method and variational optimization technique. Methodology: The implementation of variational optimization begins with randomly assigning initial values to the Morse model parameters. Utilizing the Morse + Hulthen potential as input, the phase equations for various l-channels are numerically solved using the RK-5 method for obtaining the simulated Scattering Phase Shift (SPS). Mean Squared error between simulated and expected SPS has been chosen as the cost function. Variational optimization proceeds iteratively by adjusting potential parameters and re-evaluating the cost function until convergence is achieved. Results: All the obtained scattering phase shifts for various l-channels have been found to converge to a mean squared error &lt;= 0.3. The computed cross-sections matched the experimental ones to less than 1% for energies up to 25 MeV. The scattering parameters are also found to closely match the experimental data. Conclusion: The inverse potentials constructed for various l-channels using Morse + atomic Hulthen are on par with the currently available high-precision realistic potentials.</description>

      <title>From chiral EFT to perturbative QCD: a Bayesian model mixing approach to symmetric nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraining the equation of state (EOS) of strongly interacting, dense matter is the focus of intense experimental, observational, and theoretical effort. Chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) can describe the EOS between the typical densities of nuclei and those in the outer cores of neutron stars while perturbative QCD (pQCD) can be applied to properties of deconfined quark matter, both with quantified theoretical uncertainties. However, describing the complete range of densities between nuclear saturation and an almost-free quark gas with a single EOS that has well-quantified uncertainties is a challenging problem. In this work, we argue that Bayesian multi-model inference from $\chi$EFT and pQCD can help bridge the gap between the two theories: we combine the Gaussian random variables that constitute the theories' predictions for the pressure as a function of the density in symmetric nuclear matter. We do this using two Bayesian model mixing procedures: a pointwise approach, and a correlated approach implemented via a Gaussian process (GP), and present results for the pressure and speed of sound in each. The second method produces a smooth $\chi$EFT-to-pQCD EOS. Without input data in the intermediate region, the choice of prior on the EOS, encoded through the GP kernel, as the prior on the EOS function space significantly affects the result in that region. We also discuss future extensions and applications to neutron star matter guided by recent EOS constraints from nuclear theory, nuclear experiment, and multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Thermal fluctuations of matter composition and quark nucleation in compact stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. At the extreme densities reached in the core of neutron stars, it is possible that quark deconfined matter is produced. The formation of this new phase of strongly interacting matter is likely to occur via a first-order phase transition for the typical temperatures reached in astrophysical processes. The first seeds of quark matter would then form through a process of nucleation within the metastable hadronic phase. Aims. Here we address the role of the thermal fluctuations in the hadronic composition on the nucleation of two-flavour quark matter. Methods. At finite temperature, thermodynamic quantities in a system fluctuate around average values. Being nucleation a local process, it is possible that it occurs in a subsystem whose composition makes the nucleation easier. We will consider the total probability of the nucleation as the product between the probability that a subsystem has a certain hadronic composition different from the average in the bulk, and the nucleation probability in that subsystem. Results. We will show how those fluctuations of the hadronic composition can increase the efficiency of nucleation already for temperatures $\sim (0.1-1)$ keV. However, for temperatures $\lesssim (1-10)$ MeV, the needed overpressure exceeds the maximum pressure reached in compact stars. Finally, for even larger temperatures the process of nucleation can take place, even taking into account finite size effects.</description>

      <title>Integral identities and universal relations for solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that any nonlinear field theory giving rise to static solutions with finite energy like, e.g., topological solitons, allows us to derive a continuous infinity of integral identities which any such solution has to obey. These integral identities can always be understood as being generated by field transformations and their related Noether currents. We also explain why all integral identities generated by coordinate transformations become trivial for Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) solitons, i.e., topological solitons which saturate a topological energy bound. Finally, we consider applications of these identities to a broad class of nonlinear scalar theories, including the Skyrme model. More concretely, we find nontrivial integral identities that can be seen as model-independent relations between certain physical properties of the solitons in such theories, and we comment on the possible connection between these new relations and those already found in the context of astrophysical compact objects. We also demonstrate the usefulness of said identities to estimate the precision of the numerical calculation of soliton observables.</description>

      <title>Entanglement suppression and low-energy scattering of heavy mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently entanglement suppression was proposed to be one possible origin of emergent symmetries. Here we test this conjecture in the context of heavy meson scatterings. The low-energy interactions of $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ and $D^{(*)} D^{(*)}$ are closely related to the hadronic molecular candidates $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$, respectively, and can be described by a nonrelativistic effective Lagrangian manifesting heavy-quark spin symmetry, which includes only constant contact potentials at leading order. We explore entanglement suppression in a tensor-product framework to treat both the isospin and spin degrees of freedom. Using the $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ as inputs, we find that entanglement suppression indeed leads to an emergent symmetry, namely, a light-quark spin symmetry, and as such the $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ or $D^{(*)} D^{(*)}$ interaction strengths for a given total isospin do not depend on the total angular momentum of light (anti)quarks. The $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ are predicted to have five and one isoscalar partner, respectively, while the corresponding partner numbers derived solely from heavy-quark spin symmetry are three and one, respectively. The predictions need to be confronted with experimental data and lattice QCD results to further test the entanglement suppression conjecture.</description>

      <title>Nuclear charge radii of germanium isotopes around $N$ = 40</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collinear laser spectroscopy measurements were performed on $^{68-74}$Ge isotopes ($Z = 32$) at ISOLDE-CERN, by probing the $4s^2 4p^2 \, ^3\!P_1 \rightarrow 4s^2 4p 5s \, ^3\!P_1^o$ atomic transition (269~nm) of germanium. Nuclear charge radii are determined via the measured isotope shifts, revealing a larger local variation than the neighboring isotopic chains. Nuclear density functional theory with the Fayans functionals Fy($\Delta r$,HFB) and Fy(IVP), and the SV-min Skyrme describes the experimental data for the differential charge radii $\delta\langle r^{2} \rangle$ and charge radii $R_{\rm c}$ within the theoretical uncertainties. The observed large variation in the charge radii of germanium isotopes is better accounted for by theoretical models incorporating ground state quadrupole correlations. This suggests that the polarization effects due to pairing and deformation contribute to the observed large odd-even staggering in the charge radii of the Ge isotopic chain.</description>

      <title>Study of the timelike electromagnetic form factors of the $\Lambda_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the reaction of electron-positron annihilation into $\Lambda_c^+\bar{\Lambda}_c^-$ is investigated. The $\Lambda_c^+\bar{\Lambda}_c^-$ scattering amplitudes are obtained by solving the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. The contact, annihilation, and two pseudoscalar-exchange potentials are taken into account in the spirit of the chiral effective field theory. The amplitudes of $e^+e^-\to \Lambda_c^+\bar{\Lambda}_c^-$ are constructed by the distorted wave Born approximation method, with the final state interactions of the $\Lambda_c^+\bar{\Lambda}_c^-$ re-scattering implemented. By fitting to the experimental data, the unknown couplings are fixed, and high-quality solutions are obtained. With these amplitudes, the individual electromagnetic form factors in the timelike region, $G_E^{\Lambda_c}$, $G_M^{\Lambda_c}$, and their ratio, $G_E^{\Lambda_c}/G_M^{\Lambda_c}$, are extracted. Both modulus and phases are predicted. These individual electromagnetic form factors reveal new insights into the properties of the $\Lambda_c$. The separated contributions of the Born term, contact, annihilation, as well as the two pseudoscalar exchange potentials to the electromagnetic form factors are isolated. It is found that the Born term dominates the whole energy region. The contact term plays a crucial role in the enhancement near the threshold, and the annihilation term is essential in generating the fluctuation of the electromagnetic form factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational form factors of charmonium. Our method is based on a Hamiltonian formalism on the light front known as basis light-front quantization. The charmonium mass spectrum and light-front wave functions were obtained from diagonalizing an effective Hamiltonian that incorporates confinement from holographic QCD and one-gluon exchange interaction from light-front QCD. We proposed a quantum many-body approach to construct the hadronic matrix elements of the energy momentum tensor $T^{++}$ and $T^{+-}$, which are used to extract the gravitational form factors $A(Q^2)$ and $D(Q^2)$. The obtained form factors satisfy the known constraints, e.g. von Laue condition. From these quantities, we also extract the energy, pressure and invariant mass squared distributions of the system. We find that hadrons are multi-layer systems. We also find that there is a tachyonic core within charmonium.</description>

Abstract: Simulating key static and dynamic properties of matter -- from creation in the Big Bang to evolution into sub-atomic and astrophysical environments -- arising from the underlying fundamental quantum fields of the Standard Model and their effective descriptions, lies beyond the capabilities of classical computation alone. Advances in quantum technologies have improved control over quantum entanglement and coherence to the point where robust simulations are anticipated to be possible in the foreseeable future. We discuss the emerging area of quantum simulations of Standard-Model physics, challenges that lie ahead, and opportunities for progress in the context of nuclear and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Three ways to decipher the nature of exotic hadrons: multiplets, three-body hadronic molecules, and correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past two decades, a plethora of hadronic states beyond the conventional quark model of $q\bar{q}$ mesons and $qqq$ baryons have been observed experimentally, which motivated extensive studies to understand their nature and the non-perturbative strong interaction. Since most of these exotic states are near the mass thresholds of a pair of conventional hadrons, the prevailing picture is that they are primarily hadronic molecules. In principle, one can verify the molecular nature of these states by thoroughly comparing their masses, decay widths, and production rates in a particular picture with experimental data. However, this is difficult or impossible. First, quantum mechanics allows for the mixing of configurations allowed by symmetries and quantum numbers. Second, data are relatively scarce because of their small production rates and the many difficulties in the experimental measurements. As a result, other alternatives need to be explored. This review summarizes three such approaches that can help disentangle the nature of the many exotic hadrons discovered. In the first approach, based on the molecular interpretations for some exotic states, we study the likely existence of multiplets of hadronic molecules related by various symmetries, such as isospin symmetry, SU(3)-flavor symmetry, heavy quark spin/flavor symmetry, and heavy antiquark diquark symmetry. In the second approach, starting from some hadronic molecular candidates, one can derive the underlying hadron-hadron interactions. With these interactions, one can study related three-body systems and check whether three-body bound states/resonances exist. In the third approach, one can turn to the femtoscopy technique to derive the hadron-hadron interactions, hence inaccessible. This technique provided an unprecedented opportunity to understand the interactions between unstable hadrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Batalin-Vilkovisky function is a central component in the modern formulation of the background field method and the physical applications derived from it. In the present work we report on novel lattice results for this particular quantity, obtained by capitalizing on its equality with the Kugo-Ojima function in the Landau gauge. The results of the lattice simulation are in very good agreement with the predictions derived from a continuum analysis based on the corresponding Schwinger-Dyson equations. In addition, we show that an important relation connecting this function with the ghost propagator is fulfilled rather accurately. With the aid of these results, we carry out the first completely lattice-based determination of the process-independent strong running interaction, employed in a variety of phenomenological studies.</description>

      <title>Superallowed nuclear beta decays and precision tests of the Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00044v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For many decades, the main source of information on the top-left corner element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark mixing matrix $V_{ud}$ were superallowed nuclear beta decays with an impressive 0.01\% precision. This precision, apart from experimental data, relies on theoretical calculations in which nuclear structure-dependent effects and uncertainties play a prime role. This review is dedicated to a thorough reassessment of all ingredients that enter the extraction of the value of $V_{ud}$ from experimental data. We tried to keep balance between historical retrospect and new developments, many of which occurred in just five past years. They have not yet been reviewed in a complete manner, not least because new results are a-coming. This review aims at filling this gap and offers an in-depth yet accessible summary of all recent developments.</description>

      <title>Non-hydrodynamic response in QCD-like plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quark-gluon plasma's (QGP) properties at non-hydrodynamic and non-perturbative regimes remain largely unexplored. Here, we examine the response functions describing how a QGP-like plasma responds to initial energy-momentum disturbance in both static and Bjorken-expanding plasma at non-hydrodynamic gradient using the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation-time approximation (RTA). We show that the resulting response functions are remarkably similar in both static and expanding backgrounds at non-hydrodynamic gradients. While non-hydrodynamic response can not be described by the conventional first-order and second-order theories, its behavior is reasonably captured by the extended version of hydrodynamics proposed by us (arXiv: 2208.01046). The potential sensitivity of the Euclidean correlator to non-hydrodynamic response is also illustrated.</description>

      <title>Effect of the equation of state for dilute neutron matter on the composition of the inner crust of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The composition of the inner crust of neutron stars is usually studied using phenomenological interactions such as Skyrme energy-density functionals. But most of these functionals do not agree well with ab-initio calculations of very dilute neutron matter. In this work, we study the inner crust of neutron stars in the model of phase coexistence of dense neutron-rich nuclear clusters and dilute neutron gas, and we investigate how employing a realistic microscopic equation of state to the neutron gas alters the composition. Our results indicate that with a functional that reproduces the correct equation of state of neutron matter at moderate densities, one can obtain a good description of the crust even if the functional does not have the correct behavior at extremely low density.</description>

      <title>Impact of Hot Inner Crust on Compact Stars at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conducted a study on the thermal properties of stellar matter with the nuclear energy density functional BCPM. This functional is based on microscopic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock calculations and has demonstrated success in describing cold neutron stars. To enhance its applicability in astrophysics, in this study we extend the BCPM equation of state to finite temperature for $\beta$-stable neutrino-free matter, taking into consideration the hot inner crust. Such an equation of state holds significant importance for hot compact objects, particularly those resulting from a binary neutron star merger event. Our exploration has shown that with increasing temperature there is a fast decrease of the crust-core transition density, suggesting that for hot stars it is not realistic to assume a fixed value of this density. The microscopic calculations also reveal that the presence of nuclear clusters persists up to $T=7.21$ MeV, identified as the limiting temperature of the crust. Above this threshold, the manifestation of clusters is not anticipated. Below this temperature, clusters within the inner crust are surrounded by uniform matter with varying densities, allowing for the distinction between the upper and lower transition density branches. Moreover, we computed mass--radius relations of neutron stars, assuming an isothermal profile for $\beta$-stable neutron star matter at various temperature values. Our findings highlight the significant influence of the hot inner crust on the mass--radius relationship, leading to the formation of larger and more inflated neutron stars. Consequently, under our prescription, the final outcome is a unified equation of state at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Reconciling the HESS J1731-347 constraints with Parity doublet model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of a central compact object (CCO) within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347, characterized by a mass of approximately $0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17} M_{\odot}$ and a radius of about $10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km, has opened up a new window for the study of compact objects. This CCO is particularly intriguing because it is the lightest and smallest compact object ever observed, raising questions and challenging the existing theories. To account for this light compact star, a mean-field model within the framework of parity doublet structure is applied to describe the hadron matter. Inside the model, part of the nucleon mass is associated with the chiral symmetry breaking while the other part is from the chiral invariant mass $m_0$ which is insensitive to the temperature/density. The value of $m_0$ affects the nuclear equation of state for uniform nuclear matter at low density and exhibits strong correlations with the radii of neutron stars.
  We point out that HESS J1731-347 can be explained as the lightest neutron star for $m_0 \simeq 850$\,MeV.</description>

      <title>Un-screened forces in Quark-Gluon Plasma?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the correlator of temporal Wilson lines at non-zero temperature in 2+1 flavor lattice QCD with the aim to define the heavy quark-antiquark potential at non-zero temperature. For temperatures $153~{\rm MeV} \leq T \leq 352~{\rm MeV}$ the spectral representation of this correlator is consistent with a broadened peak in the spectral function, position or width of which then defines the real or imaginary parts of the heavy quark-antiquark potential at non-zero temperature, respectively. We find that the potential's real part is not screened contrary to the widely-held expectations. We comment on how this fact may modify the picture of quarkonium melting in the quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Shallow Bound States and Hints for Broad Resonances with Quark Content $\bar{b}\bar{c}ud$ in $B$-$\bar{D}$ and $B^*$-$\bar{D}$ Scattering from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02925v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first determination of the energy dependence of the $B$-$\bar{D}$ and $B^*$-$\bar{D}$ isospin-0, $S$-wave scattering amplitudes both below and above the thresholds using lattice QCD, which allows us to investigate rigorously whether mixed bottom-charm $\bar{b}\bar{c}ud$ tetraquarks exist as bound states or resonances. The scattering phase shifts are obtained using L\"uscher's method from the energy spectra in two different volumes. To ensure that no relevant energy level is missed, we use large, symmetric $7 \times 7$ and $8 \times 8$ correlation matrices that include, at both source and sink, $B^{(*)}$-$\bar{D}$ scattering operators with the lowest three or four possible back-to-back momenta in addition to local $\bar{b}\bar{c}ud$ operators. We fit the energy dependence of the extracted scattering phase shifts using effective-range expansions. We observe sharp peaks in the $B^{(*)}$-$\bar{D}$ scattering rates close to the thresholds, which are associated with shallow bound states, either genuine or virtual, a few MeV or less below the $B^{(*)}$-$\bar{D}$ thresholds. In addition, we find hints for resonances with masses of order $100$ MeV above the thresholds and decay widths of order $200$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Testing effective field theory with the most general neutron decay correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Built on the seminal works by Jackson-Treiman-Wyld and Ebel-Feldman, we derive the most general free neutron differential decay rate where all massive particles (neutron, proton and electron) are polarized. This introduces 33 new correlations in addition to the 18 existing ones, which over-constrain the coupling constants in the low-energy effective field theory of charged weak interactions, and thus provides stringent tests of the validity of the theory framework itself. We classify the correlation coefficients in terms of their Standard Model limit and discrete symmetries, and study their expansion with respect to the new physics coupling strengths, supplemented by the experiment-independent $\mathcal{O}(\alpha)$ virtual electromagnetic radiative corrections.</description>
