      <title>DAWN: Designing Distributed Agents in a Worldwide Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed them from basic conversational tools into sophisticated entities capable of complex reasoning and decision-making. These advancements have led to the development of specialized LLM-based agents designed for diverse tasks such as coding and web browsing. As these agents become more capable, the need for a robust framework that facilitates global communication and collaboration among them towards advanced objectives has become increasingly critical. Distributed Agents in a Worldwide Network (DAWN) addresses this need by offering a versatile framework that integrates LLM-based agents with traditional software systems, enabling the creation of agentic applications suited for a wide range of use cases. DAWN enables distributed agents worldwide to register and be easily discovered through Gateway Agents. Collaborations among these agents are coordinated by a Principal Agent equipped with reasoning strategies. DAWN offers three operational modes: No-LLM Mode for deterministic tasks, Copilot for augmented decision-making, and LLM Agent for autonomous operations. Additionally, DAWN ensures the safety and security of agent collaborations globally through a dedicated safety, security, and compliance layer, protecting the network against attackers and adhering to stringent security and compliance standards. These features make DAWN a robust network for deploying agent-based applications across various industries.</description>

      <title>The $s$-Energy and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Averaging dynamics drives countless processes in physics, biology, engineering, and the social sciences. In recent years, the $s$-energy has emerged as a useful tool for bounding the convergence rates of time-varying averaging systems. We derive new bounds on the $s$-energy, which we use to resolve a number of open questions in the areas of bird flocking, opinion dynamics, and distributed motion coordination. We also use our results to provide a theoretical validation for the idea of the "Overton Window" as an attracting manifold of viable group opinions. Our new bounds on the $s$-energy highlight its dependency on the connectivity of the underlying networks. In this vein, we use the $s$-energy to explain the exponential gap in the convergence rates of stationary and time-varying consensus systems.</description>

      <title>Advancing Agentic Systems: Dynamic Task Decomposition, Tool Integration and Evaluation using Novel Metrics and Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the development of autonomous agentic systems by enabling dynamic, context-aware task decomposition and automated tool selection. These sophisticated systems possess significant automation potential across various industries, managing complex tasks, interacting with external systems to enhance knowledge, and executing actions independently. This paper presents three primary contributions to advance this field:
  - Advanced Agentic Framework: A system that handles multi-hop queries, generates and executes task graphs, selects appropriate tools, and adapts to real-time changes.
  - Novel Evaluation Metrics: Introduction of Node F1 Score, Structural Similarity Index (SSI), and Tool F1 Score to comprehensively assess agentic systems.
  - Specialized Dataset: Development of an AsyncHow-based dataset for analyzing agent behavior across different task complexities.
  Our findings reveal that asynchronous and dynamic task graph decomposition significantly enhances system responsiveness and scalability, particularly for complex, multi-step tasks. Detailed analysis shows that structural and node-level metrics are crucial for sequential tasks, while tool-related metrics are more important for parallel tasks. Specifically, the Structural Similarity Index (SSI) is the most significant predictor of performance in sequential tasks, and the Tool F1 Score is essential for parallel tasks. These insights highlight the need for balanced evaluation methods that capture both structural and operational dimensions of agentic systems. Additionally, our evaluation framework, validated through empirical analysis and statistical testing, provides valuable insights for improving the adaptability and reliability of agentic systems in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Designing robot swarms: a puzzle, a problem, and a mess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Framing an issue as a puzzle, problem, or mess is an illustrative approach to characterizing the issue's complexity within organizational theory and systems thinking. We use this approach to characterize the issue of designing collective behaviors for robot swarms and discuss how various research goals have shaped the current state of the field. We contextualize our discussion at these three levels by highlighting relevant literature. Our aim is to emphasize key challenges that arise in the development of robot swarms for real-world applications and to motivate further work on promising research directions.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Collaborative Execution in Mission-Oriented Drone Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mission-oriented drone networks have been widely used for structural inspection, disaster monitoring, border surveillance, etc. Due to the limited battery capacity of drones, mission execution strategy impacts network performance and mission completion. However, collaborative execution is a challenging problem for drones in such a dynamic environment as it also involves efficient trajectory design. We leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to manage the challenge in this study, letting each drone learn to collaboratively execute tasks and plan trajectories based on its current status and environment. Simulation results show that the proposed collaborative execution model can successfully complete the mission at least 80% of the time, regardless of task locations and lengths, and can even achieve a 100% success rate when the task density is not way too sparse. To the best of our knowledge, our work is one of the pioneer studies on leveraging MARL on collaborative execution for mission-oriented drone networks; the unique value of this work lies in drone battery level driving our model design.</description>

      <title>$\textbf{EMOS}$: $\textbf{E}$mbodiment-aware Heterogeneous $\textbf{M}$ulti-robot $\textbf{O}$perating $\textbf{S}$ystem with LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous multi-robot systems (HMRS) have emerged as a powerful approach for tackling complex tasks that single robots cannot manage alone. Current large-language-model-based multi-agent systems (LLM-based MAS) have shown success in areas like software development and operating systems, but applying these systems to robot control presents unique challenges. In particular, the capabilities of each agent in a multi-robot system are inherently tied to the physical composition of the robots, rather than predefined roles. To address this issue, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework designed to enable effective collaboration among heterogeneous robots with varying embodiments and capabilities, along with a new benchmark named Habitat-MAS. One of our key designs is $\textit{Robot Resume}$: Instead of adopting human-designed role play, we propose a self-prompted approach, where agents comprehend robot URDF files and call robot kinematics tools to generate descriptions of their physics capabilities to guide their behavior in task planning and action execution. The Habitat-MAS benchmark is designed to assess how a multi-agent framework handles tasks that require embodiment-aware reasoning, which includes 1) manipulation, 2) perception, 3) navigation, and 4) comprehensive multi-floor object rearrangement. The experimental results indicate that the robot's resume and the hierarchical design of our multi-agent system are essential for the effective operation of the heterogeneous multi-robot system within this intricate problem context.</description>

      <title>An invariance principle based concentration result for large-scale stochastic pairwise interaction network systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study stochastic pairwise interaction network systems whereby a finite population of agents, identified with the nodes of a graph, update their states in response to both individual mutations and pairwise interactions with their neighbors. The considered class of systems include the main epidemic models -such as the SIS, SIR, and SIRS models-, certain social dynamics models -such as the voter and anti-voter models-, as well as evolutionary dynamics on graphs. Since these stochastic systems fall into the class of finite-state Markov chains, they always admit stationary distributions. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of these stationary distributions in the limit as the population size grows large while the interaction network maintains certain mixing properties. Our approach relies on the use of Lyapunov-type functions to obtain concentration results on these stationary distributions. Notably, our results are not limited to fully mixed population models, as they do apply to a much broader spectrum of interaction network structures, including, e.g., Erd\"oos-R\'enyi random graphs.</description>

      <title>Selective Reincarnation: Offline-to-Online Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 'Reincarnation' in reinforcement learning has been proposed as a formalisation of reusing prior computation from past experiments when training an agent in an environment. In this paper, we present a brief foray into the paradigm of reincarnation in the multi-agent (MA) context. We consider the case where only some agents are reincarnated, whereas the others are trained from scratch -- selective reincarnation. In the fully-cooperative MA setting with heterogeneous agents, we demonstrate that selective reincarnation can lead to higher returns than training fully from scratch, and faster convergence than training with full reincarnation. However, the choice of which agents to reincarnate in a heterogeneous system is vitally important to the outcome of the training -- in fact, a poor choice can lead to considerably worse results than the alternatives. We argue that a rich field of work exists here, and we hope that our effort catalyses further energy in bringing the topic of reincarnation to the multi-agent realm.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Agentic Workflow Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), with their exceptional ability to handle a wide range of tasks, have driven significant advancements in tackling reasoning and planning tasks, wherein decomposing complex problems into executable workflows is a crucial step in this process. Existing workflow evaluation frameworks either focus solely on holistic performance or suffer from limitations such as restricted scenario coverage, simplistic workflow structures, and lax evaluation standards. To this end, we introduce WorFBench, a unified workflow generation benchmark with multi-faceted scenarios and intricate graph workflow structures. Additionally, we present WorFEval, a systemic evaluation protocol utilizing subsequence and subgraph matching algorithms to accurately quantify the LLM agent's workflow generation capabilities. Through comprehensive evaluations across different types of LLMs, we discover distinct gaps between the sequence planning capabilities and graph planning capabilities of LLM agents, with even GPT-4 exhibiting a gap of around 15%. We also train two open-source models and evaluate their generalization abilities on held-out tasks. Furthermore, we observe that the generated workflows can enhance downstream tasks, enabling them to achieve superior performance with less time during inference. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/WorFBench.</description>
