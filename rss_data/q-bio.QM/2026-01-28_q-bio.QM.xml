      <title>LabelKAN -- Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Inter-Label Learning: Avian Community Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global biodiversity loss is accelerating, prompting international efforts such as the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to direct resources toward halting species declines. A key challenge in achieving this goal is having access to robust methodologies to understand where species occur and how they relate to each other within broader ecological communities. Recent deep learning-based advances in joint species distribution modeling have shown improved predictive performance, but effectively incorporating community-level learning, taking into account species-species relationships in addition to species-environment relationships, remains an outstanding challenge. We introduce LabelKAN, a novel framework based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to learn inter-label connections from predictions of each label. When modeling avian species distributions, LabelKAN achieves substantial gains in predictive performance across the vast majority of species. In particular, our method demonstrates strong improvements for rare and difficult-to-predict species, which are often the most important when setting biodiversity targets under frameworks like GBF. These performance gains also translate to more confident predictions of the species spatial patterns as well as more confident predictions of community structure. We illustrate how the LabelKAN leads to qualitative and quantitative improvements with a focused application on the Great Blue Heron, an emblematic species in freshwater ecosystems that has experienced significant population declines across the United States in recent years. Using the LabelKAN framework, we are able to identify communities and species in New York that will be most sensitive to further declines in Great Blue Heron populations.</description>

      <title>Descriptive and risk analysis of vehicle movements linked to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome and porcine epidemic diarrhea transmission in US commercial swine farms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicle movements, including vehicle cabs and trailers, play a role in disseminating disease in swine production. However, there are many information gaps about vehicle movements patterns that increase the probability of disease transmission, which is crucial in developing better preventive strategies. In this study we described the movement pattern of vehicle cabs and trailers and identified risk factors for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) and porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) farm's infectious status. We collected global positioning system (GPS) movement data from vehicle cabs and trailers for 18 months and basic information for 6621 farms in the U.S. For the vehicle movement data, we estimated 66 variables and evaluate their association with farms PRRS and PED status. Our univariate analysis showed that 56 variables were significant associated (p &lt; 0.05) to PED and PRRS farm status. Within these variables, vehicle visit frequency and previous exposition to positive farms were the main risk factors for both diseases. Otherwise, increased vehicle cab and trailer loyalty for farm shipments and vehicle cleaning and disinfection events were protective factors. In the multivariate model, each additional weekly visit by a vehicle cab that had been exposed to a positive farm one day before the shipment was associated with a 234\% and 243\% increase in the odds of a farm testing PRRS- and PED-positive, respectively. Our analysis revealed that vehicle contact history play a crucial role in the transmission of PRRS and PED. These findings can provide insights to develop more target strategies aimed at reducing the transmission and outbreaks linked to vehicle movements in swine production.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Large-Scale Cheminformatics Using a Byte-Offset Indexing Architecture for Terabyte-Scale Data Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of large-scale chemical databases represents a critical bottleneck in modern cheminformatics research, particularly for machine learning applications requiring high-quality, multi-source validated datasets. This paper presents a case study of integrating three major public chemical repositories: PubChem (176 million compounds), ChEMBL, and eMolecules, to construct a curated dataset for molecular property prediction. We investigate whether byte-offset indexing can practically overcome brute-force scalability limits while preserving data integrity at hundred-million scale. Our results document the progression from an intractable brute-force search algorithm with projected 100-day runtime to a byte-offset indexing architecture achieving 3.2-hour completion-a 740-fold performance improvement through algorithmic complexity reduction from O(NxM) to O(N+M). Systematic validation of 176 million database entries revealed hash collisions in InChIKey molecular identifiers, necessitating pipeline reconstruction using collision-free full InChI strings. We present performance benchmarks, quantify trade-offs between storage overhead and scientific rigor, and compare our approach with alternative large-scale integration strategies. The resulting system successfully extracted 435,413 validated compounds and demonstrates generalizable principles for large-scale scientific data integration where uniqueness constraints exceed hash-based identifier capabilities.</description>

      <title>XIMP: Cross Graph Inter-Message Passing for Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is central to drug discovery, yet graph neural networks often underperform in data-scarce regimes and fail to surpass traditional fingerprints. We introduce cross-graph inter-message passing (XIMP), which performs message passing both within and across multiple related graph representations. For small molecules, we combine the molecular graph with scaffold-aware junction trees and pharmacophore-encoding extended reduced graphs, integrating complementary abstractions. While prior work is either limited to a single abstraction or non-iterative communication across graphs, XIMP supports an arbitrary number of abstractions and both direct and indirect communication between them in each layer. Across ten diverse molecular property prediction tasks, XIMP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in most cases, leveraging interpretable abstractions as an inductive bias that guides learning toward established chemical concepts, enhancing generalization in low-data settings.</description>

      <title>GPCR-Filter: a deep learning framework for efficient and precise GPCR modulator discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) govern diverse physiological processes and are central to modern pharmacology. Yet discovering GPCR modulators remains challenging because receptor activation often arises from complex allosteric effects rather than direct binding affinity, and conventional assays are slow, costly, and not optimized for capturing these dynamics. Here we present GPCR-Filter, a deep learning framework specifically developed for GPCR modulator discovery. We assembled a high-quality dataset of over 90,000 experimentally validated GPCR-ligand pairs, providing a robust foundation for training and evaluation. GPCR-Filter integrates the ESM-3 protein language model for high-fidelity GPCR sequence representations with graph neural networks that encode ligand structures, coupled through an attention-based fusion mechanism that learns receptor-ligand functional relationships. Across multiple evaluation settings, GPCR-Filter consistently outperforms state-of-the-art compound-protein interaction models and exhibits strong generalization to unseen receptors and ligands. Notably, the model successfully identified micromolar-level agonists of the 5-HT\textsubscript{1A} receptor with distinct chemical frameworks. These results establish GPCR-Filter as a scalable and effective computational approach for GPCR modulator discovery, advancing AI-assisted drug development for complex signaling systems.</description>
