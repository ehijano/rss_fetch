      <title>Increasing risk of oppressive heatwaves over India in the future warming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the increasing frequency of heatwaves, particularly focusing on extreme (high temperature, low humidity) and oppressive (high temperature, high humidity) heatwaves, and their impacts on human mortality. We find that both types of heatwaves are increasing, with oppressive heatwaves showing a faster rate of growth. Importantly, oppressive heatwaves are more strongly correlated with heat-stress-related human deaths than extreme heatwaves, indicating they pose a greater health risk. Using climate model simulations, we project a significant increase in the number of oppressive heatwave days under future warming scenarios. Under 1.5{\deg}C global warming, oppressive heatwaves will increase five-fold by the end of the century (2070-2100), relative to the historical period (1975-2005). Under 2{\deg}C warming, this increase rises to eight-fold, with an almost two-fold increase in oppressive heatwaves compared to the 1.5{\deg}C scenario. Extreme heatwave days, in contrast, remain relatively constant. Limiting warming to 1.5{\deg}C could reduce the likelihood of oppressive and extreme heatwaves by 44% and 25%, respectively, compared to a 2{\deg}C warming world. These findings highlight the urgent need for adaptation strategies, particularly in densely populated regions, to mitigate the health risks of rising heatwave intensity and frequency.</description>

      <title>A discrete adjoint method for deterministic and probabilistic eikonal-equation-based inversion of traveltime for velocity and source location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic traveltime tomography represents a popular and useful tool for unravelling the structure of the subsurface across the scales. In this work we address the case where the forward model is represented by the eikonal equation and derive a formalism to solve the inverse problem where gradients are calculated efficiently using the discrete adjoint state method. Our approach provides gradients with respect to both velocity structure and source locations, allowing us to perform a consistent joint inversion. The forward problem is solved using a second-order fast-marching method, which provides a strategy to efficiently solve the adjoint problem. Our approach allows for arbitrary positions of both sources and receivers and for a refined grid around the source region to reduce errors in computed traveltimes. We show how gradients computed using the discrete adjoint method can be employed to perform either deterministic inversion, i.e., solving an optimization problem, or for a probabilistic (Bayesian) approach, i.e., obtaining a posterior probability density function. We show applications of our methodology on a set of synthetic examples both in 2D and 3D using the L-BFGS algorithm for the deterministic case and the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm for the probabilistic case.</description>

      <title>Quantifying risk of a noise-induced AMOC collapse from northern and tropical Atlantic Ocean variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) exerts a major influence on global climate. There is much debate about whether the current strong AMOC may collapse as a result of anthropogenic forcing and/or internal variability. Increasing the noise in simple salt-advection models can change the apparent AMOC tipping threshold. However, it's not clear if 'present-day' variability is strong enough to induce a collapse. Here, we investigate how internal variability affects the likelihood of AMOC collapse. We examine internal variability of basin-scale salinities and temperatures in four CMIP6 pre-industrial simulations. We fit this to an empirical, process-based AMOC box model, and find that noise-induced AMOC collapse (defined as a decade in which the mean AMOC strength falls below 5 Sv) is unlikely for pre-industrial CMIP6 variability unless external forcing shifts the AMOC closer to a threshold. However, CMIP6 models seem to underestimate present-day Atlantic Ocean variability, and stronger variability substantially increases the likelihood of noise-induced collapse, especially if forcing brings the AMOC close to a stability threshold. Surprisingly, we find a case where forcing temporarily overshoots a stability threshold but noise decreases the probability of collapse. Accurately modelling internal decadal variability is essential for understanding the increased uncertainty in AMOC projections.</description>
