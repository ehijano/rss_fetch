      <title>Pair correlation function of vorticity in a coherent vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the correlations of vorticity fluctuations inside a coherent vortex resulting from the inverse energy cascade in two-dimensional turbulence. The presence of a coherent flow, which is a differential rotation, suppresses small-scale fluctuations of the flow, which are created by an external force, and lead to the fact that these fluctuations can be considered as non-interacting and, therefore, examined in a linear approximation. We calculate the pair correlation function of vorticity and demonstrate that it has a power-law behavior both in space and in time. The obtained results allow us to start a systematic study of the effects associated with the nonlinear interaction of fluctuations, which play an essential role on the periphery of a coherent vortex. Our results are also applicable to the statistics of a passive scalar in a strong shear flow.</description>

      <title>Asymmetrical temporal dynamics of topological edge modes in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice with Kerr nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical bistability and oscillating phases exist in a Sagnac interferometer and a single ring resonator made of $\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinear medium where the refractive indices are modulated by the light intensity due to the Kerr nonlinearity. An array of coupled nonlinear ring resonators behave similarly but with more complexity due to the presence of the additional couplings.Here, we theoretically demonstrate the bifurcation of topological edge modes which leads to optical bistability in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice with the Kerr nonlinearity. Additionally, we demonstrate periodic and chaotic switching behaviors in an oscillating phase resulting from the coupling between the topological edge mode and bulk modes with different chiralities, i.e., clockwise and counter-clockwise circulations.</description>

      <title>From spectral to scattering form factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel indicator for chaotic quantum scattering processes, the scattering form factor (ScFF). It is based on mapping the locations of peaks in the scattering amplitude to random matrix eigenvalues, and computing the analog of the spectral form factor (SFF). We compute the spectral and scattering form factors of several non-chaotic systems. We determine the ScFF associated with the phase shifts of the leaky torus, closely related to the distribution of the zeros of Riemann zeta function. We compute the ScFF for the decay amplitude of a highly excited string states into two tachyons. We show that it displays the universal features expected from random matrix theory - a decline, a ramp and a plateau - and is in general agreement with the Gaussian unitary ensemble. It also shows some new features, owning to the special structure of the string amplitude, including a "bump" before the ramp associated with gaps in the average eigenvalue density. The "bump" is removed for highly excited string states with an appropriate state dependent unfolding. We also discuss the SFF for the Gaussian $\beta$- ensemble, writing an interpolation between the known results of the Gaussian orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic ensembles.</description>
