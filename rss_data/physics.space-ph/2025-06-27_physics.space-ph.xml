      <title>Evidence of the Earth's inner radiation belts during the low Solar and geomagnetic activity obtained with the STEP-F instrument</title>

Abstract: Purpose: The subject of research is the spatio-temporal charged particles in the Earth's magnetosphere outside the South Atlantic magnetic Anomaly during the 11-year cycle of solar activity minimum. The work aims at searching for and clarifying the sustained and unstable new spatial zones of enhanced subrelativistic electron fluxes at the altitudes of the low Earth orbit satellites.
  Design/methodology/approach: Finding and ascertainment of new radiation belts of the Earth were made by using the data analysis from the D1e channel of recording the electrons of energies of $\Delta E_e =180$-510 keV and protons of energies $\Delta E_p=3.5$-3.7 MeV of the position-sensitive silicon matrix detector and onto the solid angle of view of the detector head of the instrument was used.
  Findings: A sustained structure of three electron radiation belts in the Earth's magnetosphere was found at the low solar and geomagnetic activity in May 2009. The two belts are known since the beginning of the space age as the Van Allen radiation belts, and an additional permanent layer is formed around the drift shell with the McIlwaine parameter of $L\approx1.65$. On some days in May 2009, the two new inner radiation belts were observed simultaneously, one of those latter being recorded between the investigated sustained belt at $L\approx1.65$ and the Van Allen inner belt at $L\approx2.52$.
  Conclusions: The new found inner radiation belts are recorded in a wide range of geographic longitudes, both at the ascending and descending nodes of the satellite orbit.

      <title>$\alpha$ Effect and Magnetic Diffusivity $\beta$ in Helical Plasma under Turbulence Growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transport coefficients $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in plasma systems with varying Reynolds numbers while maintaining a unit magnetic Prandtl number. {The $\alpha$ and $\beta$ tensors parameterize the turbulent electromotive force (EMF) in terms of the large-scale magnetic field ${\bf \overline{B}}$ and current density ${\bf \overline{}}$ as follows : $\langle {\bf u}\times {\bf b} \rangle = \alpha {\bf \overline{B}}-\beta {\nabla\times \bf \overline{B}}$.} In astrophysical plasmas, high fluid Reynolds numbers ($Re$) and magnetic Reynolds numbers ($Re_\mathrm{M}$) drive turbulence, where $Re$ governs flow dynamics and $Re_\mathrm{M}$ controls magnetic field evolution. The coefficients $\alpha_{\text{semi}}$ and $\beta_{\text{semi}}$ are obtained from large-scale magnetic field data as estimates of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ tensors, while $\beta_{\text{theo}}$ is derived from turbulent kinetic energy data. The reconstructed large-scale field $\overline{B}$ agrees with simulations, confirming consistency among $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\overline{B}$ in weakly nonlinear regimes. This highlights the need to incorporate magnetic effects under strong nonlinearity. To clarify $\alpha$ and $\beta$, we introduce a field structure model, identifying $\alpha$ as the electrodynamic induction effect and $\beta$ as the fluid-like diffusion effect. The agreement between our method and direct simulations suggests that plasma turbulence and magnetic interactions can be analyzed using fundamental physical quantities. Moreover, $\alpha_{\text{semi}}$ and $\beta_{\text{semi}}$, which successfully reproduce the numerically obtained magnetic field, provide a benchmark for future theoretical studies.</description>

Abstract: Modeling the internal structure of self-gravitating solid and liquid bodies presents a challenge, as existing approaches are often limited to either overly simplistic constant-density approximations or more complex numerical equations of state. We present a detailed analysis of a tractable and physically motivated model for perfectly elastic, spherically symmetric self-gravitating bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium. The model employs a logarithmic equation of state (logotropic EOS) with a non-zero initial density and constant bulk modulus. Importantly, scaling properties of the model allow all solutions to be derived from a single, universal solution of an ordinary differential equation, resembling the Lane-Emden and Chandrasekhar models. The model provides new insights into stability issues and reveals oscillatory asymptotic behavior in the mass-radius relation, including the existence of both a maximum mass and a maximum radius. We derive useful, simple analytical approximations for key properties, such as central overdensity, moment of inertia, binding energy, and gravitational potential, applicable to small, metallic bodies like asteroids and moons. These new approximations could aid future research, including space mining and the scientific characterization of small Solar System bodies.</description>
