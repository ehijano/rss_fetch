      <title>Stability Mechanisms of Unconventional Stoichiometric Crystals Exampled by Two-Dimensional Na2Cl on Graphene under Ambient Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compounds harboring active valence electrons, such as unconventional stoichiometric compounds of main group elements including sodium, chlorine, and carbon, have conventionally been perceived as unstable under ambient conditions, requiring extreme conditions including extra-high pressure environments for stability. Recent discoveries challenge this notion, showcasing the ambient stability of two-dimensional Na2Cl and other unconventional stoichiometric compounds on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) membranes. Focusing on the Na2Cl crystal as a case study, we reveal a mechanism wherein electron delocalization on the aromatic rings of graphene effectively mitigates the reactivity of Na2Cl, notably countering oxygen-induced oxidation--a phenomenon termed the Surface Delocalization-Induced Electron Trap (SDIET) mechanism. Theoretical calculations also show a substantial activation energy barrier emerges, impeding oxygen infiltration into and reaction with Na2Cl. The remarkable stability was further demonstrated by the experiment that Na2Cl crystals on rGO membranes remain almost intact even after prolonged exposure to a pure oxygen atmosphere for 9 days. The discovered SDIET mechanism presents a significant leap in stabilizing chemically active substances harboring active valence electrons under ambient conditions. Its implications transcend unconventional stoichiometric compounds, encompassing main group and transition element compounds, potentially influencing various scientific disciplines.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Influence of Solvation on the Electrochemical Double Layer of Salt / Solvent Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling electrolytes accurately on both a nanoscale and cell level can contribute to improving battery chemistries.[Armand and Tarascon, Nature, 2008, 451, 652-657] We previously presented a thermodynamic continuum model for electrolytes.[arXiv:2010.14915] In this paper we include solvation interactions between the ions and solvent, which alter the structure of the electochemical double layer (EDL). We are able to combine a local solvation model -- permitting examination of the interplay between electric forces and the ion-solvent binding -- with a full electrolyte model. Using this, we can investigate double layer structures for a wide range of electrolytes, especially including highly concentrated solutions. We find that some of the parameters of our model significantly affect the solvent concentration at the electrode surface, and thereby the rate of solvent decomposition. Firstly, an increased salt concentration weakens the solvation shells, making it possible to strip the solvent in the EDL before the ions reach the surface. The strength of the ion-solvent interaction also affects at which potential difference the solvation shells removed. We are therefore able to qualitatively predict EDL structures for different electrolytes based on parameters like molecule size, solvent binding energy and salt concentration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an X-ray based stimulated Raman approach to control the preparation of optically dark electronic states in generic molecular systems. Leveraging on the unique properties of core-level excited states, we demonstrate that optically forbidden transitions between singlet states, or between singlet and triplet states are made accessible. Two molecular systems are studied as a test-bed of the proposed approach, and its experimental feasibility is eventually discussed.</description>

      <title>The graphene-water interface is acidic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water's ability to autoionize into hydroxide and hydronium ions profoundly influences surface properties, rendering interfaces either basic or acidic. While it is well-established that the water-air interface is acidic, a critical knowledge gap exists in technologically relevant surfaces like the graphene-water interface. Here we use machine learning-based simulations with first-principles accuracy to unravel the behavior of the hydroxide and hydronium ions at the graphene-water interface. Our findings reveal that the graphene-water interface is acidic, with the hydronium ion predominantly residing in the first contact layer of water. In contrast, the hydroxide ion exhibits a bimodal distribution, found both near the surface and towards the interior layers. Analysis of the underlying electronic structure reveals strong polarization effects, resulting in counterintuitive charge rearrangement. Proton propensity to the graphene-water interface challenges the interpretation of surface experiments and is expected to have far-reaching consequences for ion conductivity, interfacial reactivity, and proton-mediated processes.</description>

      <title>Schr\"{o}dingerNet: A Universal Neural Network Solver for The Schr\"{o}dinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have facilitated numerically accurate solution of the electronic Schr\"{o}dinger equation (SE) by integrating various neural network (NN)-based wavefunction ansatzes with variational Monte Carlo methods. Nevertheless, such NN-based methods are all based on the Born-Oppenheimer approximation (BOA) and require computationally expensive training for each nuclear configuration. In this work, we propose a novel NN architecture, Schr\"{o}dingerNet, to solve the full electronic-nuclear SE by defining a loss function designed to equalize local energies across the system. This approach is based on a rotationally equivariant total wavefunction ansatz that includes both nuclear and electronic coordinates. This strategy not only allows for the efficient and accurate generation of a continuous potential energy surface at any geometry within the well-sampled nuclear configuration space, but also incorporates non-BOA corrections through a single training process. Comparison with benchmarks of atomic and molecular systems demonstrates its accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Thermal quasi-particle theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widely used thermal Hartree-Fock (HF) theory is generalized to include the effect of electron correlation while maintaining its quasi-independent-particle framework. An electron-correlated internal energy (or grand potential) is defined by the second-order finite-temperature many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), which then dictates the corresponding thermal orbital (quasi-particle) energies in such a way that all thermodynamic relations are obeyed. The associated density matrix is of the one-electron type, whose diagonal elements take the form of the Fermi-Dirac distribution functions, when the grand potential is minimized. The formulas for the entropy and chemical potential are unchanged from those of Fermi-Dirac or thermal HF theory. The theory thus postulates a finite-temperature extension of the second-order Dyson self-energy of one-particle many-body Green's function theory and can be viewed as a second-order, diagonal, frequency-independent, thermal inverse Dyson equation. At low temperature, the theory approaches finite-temperature MBPT of the same order, but it outperforms the latter at intermediate temperature by including additional electron-correlation effects through orbital energies. A physical meaning of these thermal orbital energies (including that of thermal HF orbital energies, which has been elusive) is proposed.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure and optical properties of halide double perovskites from a Wannier-localized optimally-tuned screened range-separated hybrid functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Halide double perovskites are a chemically-diverse and growing class of compound semiconductors that are promising for optoelectronic applications. However, the prediction of their fundamental gaps and optical properties with density functional theory (DFT) and {\it ab initio} many-body perturbation theory has been a significant challenge. Recently, a nonempirical Wannier-localized optimally-tuned screened range-separated hybrid (WOT-SRSH) functional has been shown to accurately produce the fundamental band gaps of a wide set of semiconductors and insulators, including lead halide perovskites. Here we apply the WOT-SRSH functional to five halide double perovskites, and compare the results with those obtained from other known functionals and previous $GW$ calculations. We also use the approach as a starting point for $GW$ calculations and we compute the band structures and optical absorption spectrum for Cs\textsubscript{2}Ag{Bi}Br\textsubscript{6}, using both time-dependent DFT and the $GW$-Bethe-Salpeter equation approach. We show that the WOT-SRSH functional leads to accurate fundamental and optical band gaps, as well as optical absorption spectra, consistent with spectroscopic measurements, thereby establishing WOT-SRSH as a viable method for the accurate prediction of optoelectronic properties of halide double perovskites.</description>

      <title>Surface potentials of conductors in electrolyte solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When we place conducting bodies in electrolyte solutions, their surface potential $\Phi_s$ appears to be much smaller in magnitude than the intrinsic one $\Phi_0$ and normally does not obey the classical electrostatic boundary condition of a constant surface potential expected for conductors. In this paper, we demonstrate that an explanation of these observations can be obtained by postulating that diffuse ions condense at the "wall" due to a reduced permittivity of a solvent.
  For small values of $\Phi_0$ the surface potential responds linearly. On increasing $\Phi_0$ further $\Phi_s$ augments nonlinearly and then saturates to a constant value. Analytical approximations for $\Phi_s$ derived for these three distinct modes show that it always adjusts to salt concentration, which is equivalent to a violation of the constant potential condition. The latter would be appropriate for highly dilute solutions, but only if $\Phi_0$ is small. Surprisingly, when the plateau with high $\Phi_s$ is reached, the conductor surface switches to a constant charge density condition normally expected for insulators. Our results are directly relevant for conducting electrodes, mercury drops, colloidal metallic particles and more.</description>

      <title>Advancing Molecular Machine (Learned) Representations with Stereoelectronics-Infused Molecular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular representation is a foundational element in our understanding of the physical world. Its importance ranges from the fundamentals of chemical reactions to the design of new therapies and materials. Previous molecular machine learning models have employed strings, fingerprints, global features, and simple molecular graphs that are inherently information-sparse representations. However, as the complexity of prediction tasks increases, the molecular representation needs to encode higher fidelity information. This work introduces a novel approach to infusing quantum-chemical-rich information into molecular graphs via stereoelectronic effects. We show that the explicit addition of stereoelectronic interactions significantly improves the performance of molecular machine learning models. Furthermore, stereoelectronics-infused representations can be learned and deployed with a tailored double graph neural network workflow, enabling its application to any downstream molecular machine learning task. Finally, we show that the learned representations allow for facile stereoelectronic evaluation of previously intractable systems, such as entire proteins, opening new avenues of molecular design.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Optoelectronic Processes in Colloidal 2D Multi-Layered MAPbBr3 Perovskite Nanosheets: Funneling, Recombination and Self-Trapped Excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi two-dimensional (2D) colloidal synthesis made quantum confinement readily accessible in perovskites, generating additional momentum in perovskite LED research and lasing. Ultrathin perovskite layers exhibit high exciton binding energies and beneficial charge transport properties interesting for solar cells. In 2D perovskites, the combination of layers with different thickness helps to direct charge carriers in a targeted manner toward thicker layers with a smaller bandgap. However, detailed knowledge about the mechanisms by which excitons and charge carriers funnel and recombine in these structures is lacking. Here, we characterize colloidal 2D methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites with a broad combination of layers (n = 3 to 10, and bulk fractions with n &gt; 10) in one stack by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence, which gives comprehensive insights into the complexity of funneling and recombination processes. We find that after photoexcitation second- and third-order processes dominate in MAPbBr3 nanosheets, which indicates exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) and Auger recombination. Long-lived excitons in thin layers (e.g., n = 5, Eb = 136 meV) funnel into high n with t = 10-50 ps, which decreases their exciton binding energy below kB T = 26 meV ( T = 300K) and leads to radiative recombination. Parallel and consecutive funneling compete with exciton trapping processes, making funneling an excellent tool to overcome exciton self-trapping when high-quality n-n interfaces are present. Free charge carriers in high n regions on the other hand facilitate radiative recombination and EEA is bypassed, which is desirable for LED and lasing applications.</description>

Abstract: In the field of chemistry, where nuclear motion has traditionally been a focal point, we now explore the ultra-rapid electronic motion spanning attoseconds to femtoseconds, demonstrating that it is equally integral and relevant to the discipline. The advent of ultrashort attosecond pulse technology has revolutionized our ability to directly observe electronic rearrangements in atoms and molecules, offering a time-resolved insight into these swift processes. Prominent examples include Auger-Meitner decay and Interparticle Coulombic Decay (ICD). However, the real challenge lies in interpreting these observations, where theoretical models are indispensable.
  Building upon the analytical framework introduced in Phys. Rev. A 101, 043414 (2020), which analyzed the spectra of electrons emitted during electronic decay processes from a purely electronic perspective, our paper represents a significant advancement. We extend this theoretical base to include nuclear dynamics, utilizing the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to deepen our understanding of the intricate interaction between electronic and nuclear motion in these processes.
  We illustrate the impact of incorporating nuclear degrees of freedom in several theoretical cases characterized by different numbers of vibrational bound states in both the electronic resonance and the electronic final state. This approach not only clarifies complex spectral features and unusual peak shapes but also demonstrates a method for extracting the energy differences between multiple vibrational resonance states through their distinctive interference patterns.</description>

Abstract: Electronic resonances are metastable states that can decay by electron loss. They are ubiquitous across various fields of science, such as chemistry, physics, and biology. However, current theoretical and computational models for resonances cannot yet rival the level of accuracy achieved by bound-state methodologies. Here, we generalize selected configuration interaction (SCI) to treat resonances using the complex absorbing potential (CAP) technique. By modifying the selection procedure and the extrapolation protocol of standard SCI, the resulting CAP-SCI method yields resonance positions and widths of full configuration interaction quality. Initial results for the shape resonances of \ce{N2-} and \ce{CO-} reveal the important effect of high-order correlation, which shifts the values obtained with CAP-augmented equation-of-motion coupled-cluster with singles and doubles by more than \SI{0.1}{\eV}. The present CAP-SCI approach represents a cornerstone in the development of highly-accurate methodologies for resonances.</description>

      <title>Information gain at the onset of habituation to repeated stimuli</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12812v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological and living systems process information across spatiotemporal scales, exhibiting the hallmark ability to constantly modulate their behavior to ever-changing and complex environments. In the presence of repeated stimuli, a distinctive response is the progressive reduction of the activity at both sensory and molecular levels, known as habituation. Here, we solve a minimal microscopic model devoid of biological details to show that habituation is driven by negative feedback provided by a slow storage mechanism. Crucially, an intermediate level of habituation is associated with a steep increase in the information that the system collects on the external input over time. We find that the region characterized both by maximal information gain and by the onset of habituation can be retrieved if the system tunes its parameters to minimize dissipation and maximize information at the same time. We test our dynamical predictions against experimentally recorded neural responses in a zebrafish larva subjected to repeated looming stimulation. Our work makes a fundamental step towards uncovering the core mechanisms that shape habituation in biological systems, elucidating its information-theoretic and functional role.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantitative Structure Property Relationship studies aim to define a mapping between molecular structure and arbitrary quantities of interest. This was historically accomplished via the development of descriptors which requires significant domain expertise and struggles to generalize. Thus the field has morphed into Molecular Property Prediction and been given over to learned representations which are highly generalizable. The paper introduces fastprop, a DeepQSPR framework which uses a cogent set of molecular level descriptors to meet and exceed the performance of learned representations on diverse datasets in dramatically less time. fastprop is freely available on github at github.com/JacksonBurns/fastprop.</description>

      <title>Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz for the Preparation and Detection of Long-Lived Singlet States in NMR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing efficient and robust quantum control strategies is vital for developing quantum technologies. One recent strategy is the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) sequence that alternatively propagates under two noncommuting Hamiltonians, whose control parameters can be optimized to generate a gate or prepare a state. Here, we describe the design of the QAOA sequence and their variants to prepare long-lived singlet states (LLS) from the thermal state in NMR. With extraordinarily long lifetimes exceeding the spin-lattice relaxation time constant $T_1$, LLS have been of great interest for various applications, from spectroscopy to medical imaging. Accordingly, designing sequences for efficiently preparing LLS in a general spin system is crucial. Using numerical analysis, we study the efficiency and robustness of the QAOA sequences over a wide range of errors in the control parameters. Using a two-qubit NMR register, we conduct an experimental study to benchmark QAOA sequences against other prominent methods of LLS preparation and observe the significantly superior performance of the QAOA sequences.</description>
