      <title>Re-routing game: The inadequacy of mean-field approach in modeling the herd behavior in path switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordination of vehicle routes is a feasible way to ease traffic congestions amid a fixed road infrastructure. Nevertheless, even the optimal route configurations are provided to individual drivers, it is hard to achieve as greedy drivers may switch to other routes for a lower individual cost. Recent research uses mean-field cavity approach from the studies of spin glasses to analyze the impact of path switching in optimized transportation networks. However, this method only provides a mean-field approximation, which does not take into account the collective herd behavior in path switching due to un-coordinated individual decisions. In this study, we propose an exhaustive cavity approach to investigate the impact of un-coordinated path switching in a re-routing game and reveal that greedy drivers' decision can be highly correlated which leads to the failure of mean-fielded approaches. Our theoretical results fits well with simulations, and our developed framework can be generalized to analyze other games with multiple players and rounds. Our results shed light on the impact of herd behavior of un-coordinated human drivers in suppressing congestions through path coordination.</description>

      <title>Gender disparities in the dissemination and acquisition of scientific knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has challenged the widespread belief that gender inequities in academia would disappear simply by increasing the number of women. More complex causes might be at play, embodied in the networked structure of scientific collaborations. Here, we aim to understand the structural inequality between male and female scholars in the dissemination of scientific knowledge. We use a large-scale dataset of academic publications from the American Physical Society (APS) to build a time-varying network of collaborations from 1970 to 2020. We model knowledge dissemination as a contagion process in which scientists become informed based on the propagation of knowledge through their collaborators. We quantify the fairness of the system in terms of how women acquire and diffuse knowledge compared to men. Our results indicate that knowledge acquisition and diffusion are slower for women than expected. We find that the main determinant of women's disadvantage is the gap in the cumulative number of collaborators, highlighting how time creates structural disadvantages that contribute to marginalize women in physics. Our work sheds light on how the dynamics of scientific collaborations shape gender disparities in knowledge dissemination and calls for a deeper understanding on how to intervene to improve fairness and diversity in the scientific community.</description>

      <title>Exploring Covid-19 Spatiotemporal Dynamics: Non-Euclidean Spatially Aware Functional Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When it came to Covid-19, timing was everything. This paper considers the spatiotemporal dynamics of the Covid-19 pandemic via a developed methodology of non-Euclidean spatially aware functional registration. In particular, the daily SARS-CoV-2 incidence in each of 380 local authorities in the UK from March to June 2020 is analysed to understand the phase variation of the waves when considered as curves. This is achieved by adapting a traditional registration method (that of local variation analysis) to account for the clear spatial dependencies in the data. This adapted methodology is shown via simulation studies to perform substantially better for the estimation of the registration functions than the non-spatial alternative. Moreover, it is found that the driving time between locations represents the spatial dependency in the Covid-19 data better than geographical distance. However, since driving time is non-Euclidean, the traditional spatial frameworks break down; to solve this, a methodology inspired by multidimensional scaling is developed to approximate the driving times by a Euclidean distance which enables the established theory to be applied. Finally, the resulting estimates of the registration/warping processes are analysed by taking functionals to understand the qualitatively observable earliness/lateness and sharpness/flatness of the Covid-19 waves quantitatively.</description>
