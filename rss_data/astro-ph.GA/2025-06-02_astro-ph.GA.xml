      <title>Gas meets Kozai: the influence of a gas-rich accretion disc on hierarchical triples undergoing von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) consist of a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) embedded in a region with both high gas and stellar densities: the gas is present as a thin accretion disc that fuels the central SMBH, while the stars form a dense, roughly isotropic nuclear star cluster. The binaries present in such a cluster could be considered naturally as triples, with the SMBH as a third object, and their dynamics also depend on the interaction with the gas-rich disc. In this paper, we study the evolution of such a binary on an inclined orbit with respect to the disc. The binary experiences both eccentricity excitation via the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) effect and drag forces from each time it penetrates the disc. We find that, as the outer orbital inclination decreases, the evolution of inner orbital separation can transition from a regime of gradual hardening to a regime of rapid softening. As such binaries grow wider, their minimum pericentre distances (during ZLK oscillations) decrease. We show that a simple geometric condition, modulated by the complex ZLK evolution, dictates whether a binary expands or contracts due to the interactions with the AGN disc. Our results suggest that the interaction with gas-rich accretion disc could enhance the rate of stellar mergers and formation of gravitational wave sources, as well as other transients. The treatment introduced here is general and could apply, with the proper modifications, to hierarchical triples in other gas-rich systems.</description>

      <title>The Density Distribution of Compressively-Forced Supersonic Turbulence Depends on the Driving Correlation Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersonic turbulence plays a critical role in shaping astrophysical systems, from molecular clouds to the circumgalactic medium. Key properties of this turbulence include the Mach number, driving scale, and nature of the driving mechanism, which can be solenoidal (divergence-free), compressive (curl-free), or a mix of the two. A less studied property is the correlation time of the driving accelerations, $\tau_{\rm a}.$ While this timescale has a minimal impact on solenoidally-driven turbulence, we show that it has a strong impact on compressively-driven turbulence. Using high-resolution simulations with tracer particles, we analyze the evolution of density fluctuations, focusing on the PDF of the logarithmic density, $s$, and its rate of change, $\frac{ds}{dt},$ and the conditional statistics of $\frac{ds}{dt}$ and $\frac{d^2s}{dt^2}$. When the driving correlation time is comparable to the eddy turnover time, $\tau_{\rm a} \approx \tau_{\rm e},$ compressive driving leads to the formation of large, low-density voids in which the variance of $\frac{ds}{dt}$ is large. These are directly linked to sustained accelerated expansions, which results in a strong correlation between density and the divergence of the driving acceleration field. In contrast, when $\tau_{\rm a} \approx 0.1 \, \tau_{\rm e}$, compressive driving does not produce such voids, resulting in a narrower, less skewed distribution. We show using analytical estimates that $\tau_{\rm a}$ is may be significantly less than $\tau_{\rm e}$ in supernova-driven turbulence, highlighting the need to better understand the role of the driving correlation time in shaping the density structure of turbulent astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>The Dipole Instability in Gravitational $N$-body Systems: A Natural Explanation for Lopsidedness and Off-Centered Nuclei in Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the stability of isotropic, spherical, self-gravitating systems with a double-power law density profile. Systems with rapid transitions between the inner and outer slopes are shown to have an inflection in their isotropic distribution function (DF), where ${\rm d} f/{\rm d} E &gt; 0$, thereby violating Antonov's stability criterion. Using high-resolution $N$-body simulations, we show that the resulting instability causes the growth of a rotating dipole (or $l=1$) mode. The inflection feature in the DF responds to the mode by promoting its growth, driving the instability. The growth of the dipole results in a torque that dislodges the original cusp from its central location, and sets it in motion throughout the central region. Once the mode goes non-linear, it saturates, together with the cusp, into a long-lived soliton (the $l=1$ equivalent of a bar in a disk galaxy), which maintains its sloshing motion through the center of the halo along a slowly precessing, elliptical orbit. Concurrently, the soliton traps increasingly more particles into libration, and the exchange of energy and angular momentum with these trapped particles works towards eroding the bump in the distribution function. We point out similarities between the dipole mode and the bump-on-tail instability in electrostatic plasmas, and highlight a potential connection with core stalling and dynamical buoyancy in systems with a cored density profile. Finally, we discuss the astrophysical implications in terms of lopsidedness and off-center nuclei in galaxies.</description>

      <title>The role of bars in triggering active galactic nuclei galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bars are considered an efficient mechanism for transporting gas toward the central regions of galaxies, potentially enhancing nuclear activity. However, the extent to which bars influence active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and whether their efficiency varies with environment, remain open questions. In this study, we aim to quantify the role of bars in triggering AGNs by comparing the AGN fraction in barred and non-barred galaxies across different environments. We constructed a sample from the Galaxy Zoo DECaLS catalog, ensuring a control selection where both samples share similar distributions in stellar mass, redshift, magnitude, concentration index, and local density parameter. AGNs were identified using spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, yielding 1330 barred AGNs and 1651 unbarred AGNs. We use the [OIII]5007 luminosity (Lum[OIII]) and the accretion rate parameter R as indicators of nuclear activity. Based on these, we applied criteria to distinguish powerful from weak AGNs, allowing a more precise assessment of the bar's impact on the supermassive black hole. Our analysis reveals that barred galaxies tend to host a higher fraction of powerful AGNs. From Lum[OIII], we find that more active nuclei reside in massive, blue galaxies with young stellar populations. We also observe a slight tendency for barred galaxies to host less massive black holes accreting more efficiently. The classification of strong and weak bars shows that more prominent bars correlate with higher nuclear activity. While this trend shows no significant differences in intermediate-density environments, it becomes evident in both low- and high-density regions, where galaxies with strong bars show enhanced AGN activity.</description>

      <title>Towards an observationally motivated AGN dusty torus model -- II. The roles of density distribution and chemical composition of the dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several models of nuclear dust in active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been presented in the literature to determine its physical and geometrical properties, usually assuming the dust density distribution as the main aspect producing differences in the mid-infrared (MIR) emission of AGNs. We present a study of the MIR emission of nearby AGNs by exploring the effects of dust distribution and chemical composition on the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using radiative transfer simulations. Our model grid includes smooth, clumpy, and two-phase dust distributions, combined with two dust compositions: the interstellar medium (ISM) dust composition including large grains (up to $\rm{10 \ \mu m}$), and the oxide/silicate-based composition from Reyes-Amador et al. (2024). A synthetic SED library was generated and analysed both on a model-to-model basis and with observed MIR spectra from 68 AGNs. We found that dust density distribution and dust composition significantly influence the spectral shapes and silicate features at $10$ and $\rm{18 \ \mu m}$, especially at edge-on orientations. The smooth distribution produces stronger and broader silicate absorption features, while the clumpy distribution generates stronger features in emission. The two-phase distributions exhibit intermediate characteristics depending on the clumpiness fraction ($f_{\text{cl}}$) and filling factor ($f_{\text{fill}}$). The ISM dust composition with large grains is more suited to reproduce the observed features and a higher fraction of good fits, particularly with Type-2 SEDs, independently of dust density distributions. The Reyes-Amador et al. (2024) composition provides a larger number of good fits with Type-1 SEDs for $f_{\text{cl}} \leq 0.5$, and with Type-2 SEDs for $f_{\text{cl}} \geq 0.9$. This work shows that no single dust distribution or composition reproduces all observations.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Galaxy Overdensities and Ionized Bubbles on Ly$\alpha$ Emission $z\sim7.0\mbox{--}8.5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ly$\alpha$ spectroscopy with {\it JWST} is opening a new window on the sizes of ionized bubbles through the reionization epoch. Theoretical expectations suggest typical bubble radii should be 0.6--1.5 pMpc at $z\simeq 7$, assuming neutral hydrogen fractions of the intergalactic medium in the range $\overline{x}_{\rm HI}$=0.5--0.7. Here we investigate this picture using {\it JWST} to characterize the environment and Ly$\alpha$ emission of 292 galaxies at $7.0&lt;z&lt;8.5$ across 5 fields spanning a comoving volume of $1.3\times10^6$ Mpc$^3$. If the reionization predictions are correct, we should see overdensities and strong Ly$\alpha$ emission clustered in redshift windows of d$z=0.04-0.08$ and angular scales of 5--11 arcmin. We detect Ly$\alpha$ emission in 36 out of 292 galaxies, including nine new Ly$\alpha$ detections, two of which (in the UDS field) show extremely large equivalent widths (EW = $200_{-78}^{+50}$ A and $284_{-75}^{+56}$ A). We identify 13 significant (4--11$\times$) galaxy overdensities using redshifts from NIRCam grism and NIRSpec. Strong Ly$\alpha$ emitters are almost uniformly found in the overdensities, with nearly all located between the center and back of the structures. The overdensities that host the strong Ly$\alpha$ emitters span typical line-of-sight distances (d$z\sim 0.14$) and angular scales ($\sim 8$ arcmin) that are comparable to the predicted bubble sizes at $z\simeq 7$. We discuss evidence that the EGS is mostly ionized along a 24 pMpc sightline at $z\simeq 7.0-7.6$, based on the presence of 3 overdense structures and 10 Ly$\alpha$ emitters in this volume, and find such a large ionized region would pose tension with standard reionization models.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Gas Velocity Dispersion in Discs from $z\sim8$ to $z\sim0.5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Together optical/near infrared integral field spectroscopy and resolved sub-millimetre interferometry data have mapped the ionised and molecular gas motions in nearly one thousand galaxies at redshifts $z&gt;0.5$. While these measurements have revealed a number of key properties about the evolution of disc structure and kinematics, heterogenous techniques and samples have led to disparate findings - especially when comparing different dynamical tracers (e.g., H$\alpha$, [C$\scriptstyle\rm~II$], CO). In this paper we present a literature compilation of 237 disc galaxies with measurements of velocity dispersion and rotational velocity between $z=0.5-8$, a subset of 63 galaxies have measurements of molecular gas fractions. We explore the connection between disc velocity dispersion measurements over 8 Gyrs as traced by multiple phases with the expectations from Toomre stability models. When sample properties are taken into account (e.g., stellar mass, tracer) there is little evolution in disc dispersions between $z\sim1.5-8$, consistent with expectations from model assumptions. We find ionised gas dispersions are higher by $\sim2\times$ from molecular gas dispersions at a fixed gas mass. These results are sensitive to the molecular gas tracer with results from [C$\scriptstyle\rm~II$] showing mixed behaviour indicative of its multi-phase origin. The [C$\scriptstyle\rm~II$] kinematics can be reconciled with molecular and ionised gas tracers when star-formation rates are taken into account.</description>

      <title>Major Mergers Mean Major Offset: Drivers of Intrinsic Scatter in The $M_{GCS}-M_h$ Scaling Relation for Massive Elliptical Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we determine the total globular cluster (GC) counts and globular cluster system (GCS) total mass estimates for 27 extremely massive elliptical galaxies. The GC 2D spatial distributions of these galaxies were created from photometry of HST images using DOLPHOT in the near-IR wavelength range. The projected radial density profiles of these GCSs were determined using a Voronoi tessellation-based technique introduced in our previous paper. We then plot these galaxies on the GCS - halo mass relation alongside previously studied galaxies in the literature. The relation now extends across seven decades of halo mass. We find that the 1:1 slope of this relation holds out to the highest mass galaxies, although extremely massive BCG galaxies are shifted to higher GCS masses than their lower-mass galaxy counterparts. We find a negative correlation with massive galaxies' offset from the GCS - halo mass relation and the steepness of their GCS density profiles, and that this is being driven by the red GC populations. We suggest that the biggest influence in intrinsic scatter in the GCS - halo mass relation for massive galaxies is through a few major mergers resulting in accretion of massive satellites with old, red GC populations, rather than many accretions of small satellites with younger, blue GC populations.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the Hybrid Response of Photoionized Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoionized gases are prevalent throughout the universe. In such gases, the ion concentration typically exhibits two response modes to radiation: a positive response in the low-ionization state and a negative response in the high-ionization state. Here, we report the discovery of a widespread misalignment at the boundary between the above two response modes, and identify a third mode-the hybrid response-through time-dependent photoionization simulations. This phenomenon arises from the asynchrony among the ionization rate, recombination rate, and ion column density. Among these, only the ionization rate can respond instantaneously to changes in radiation. Consequently, the initial rate of change in the column density of \( N_i \) ion is given by \( -N_i I_i + N_{i-1} I_{i-1} \). However, this quantity is typically nonzero at the peak of \( N_i \), leading to a misalignment between the boundaries of positive and negative responses. Such hybrid effects introduce additional complexity in the interpretation of gas properties, highlighting the need for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Inferring Obscured Cosmic Black Hole Accretion History from AGN Found by JWST/MIRI CEERS Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the black hole accretion history (BHAH) of obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) identified from the JWST CEERS survey by Chien et al. (2024) using mid-infrared (MIR) SED fitting. We compute black hole accretion rates (BHARs) to estimate the black hole accretion density (BHAD), $\rho_{L_{\mathrm{disk}}}$, across $0 &lt; z &lt; 4.25$. MIR luminosity functions (LFs) are also constructed for these sources, modeled with modified Schechter and double power law forms, and corresponding BHAD, $\rho_{\mathrm{LF}}$, is derived by integrating the LFs and multiplying by the luminosity. Both $\rho_{\mathrm{LF}}$ extend to luminosities as low as $10^7 \, L_{\odot}$, two orders of magnitude fainter than pre-JWST studies. Our results show that BHAD peaks between redshifts 1 and 3, with the peak varying by method and model, $z \approx 1$--2 for $\rho_{L_{\mathrm{disk}}}$ and the double power law, and $z \approx 2$--3 for the modified Schechter function. A scenario where AGN activity peaks before cosmic star formation would challenge existing black hole formation theories, but our present study, based on early JWST observations, provides an initial exploration of this possibility. At $z \sim 3$, $\rho_{\mathrm{LF}}$ appears higher than X-ray estimates, suggesting that MIR observations are more effective in detecting obscured AGNs missed by X-ray observations. However, given the overlapping error bars, this difference remains within the uncertainties and requires confirmation with larger samples. These findings highlight the potential of JWST surveys to enhance the understanding of co-evolution between galaxies and AGNs.</description>

      <title>Correcting for the effects of the point spread function in intra-halo light measurements and application to deep Hyper Suprime-Cam data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intra-halo light (IHL) is the diffuse stellar component that surrounds galaxies, groups, and clusters. Its formation is intimately linked to the hierarchical assembly of the system, making it a key tracer of galaxy evolution. However, the low surface brightness (LSB) of the IHL makes it challenging to detect and also to distinguish from the point spread function (PSF) effect of the telescope. In this paper, we present two independent techniques that, when combined, provide a statistically robust estimation of the IHL component in galaxy groups and clusters. The first technique corrects for the PSF-scattering effect to obtain unbiased LSB measurements, while the second fits an exponential model to the IHL component using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) optimiser algorithm. To test our methodology, we build a set of 5440 Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program Public Data Release 3 (HSC-SSP PDR3) mock observations of Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) groups, each containing an IHL component with a flux fraction ($\mathrm{f_{IHL}}$) ranging from 0.01 to 0.5. Our results demonstrate the importance of properly removing the PSF-scattered flux, especially at lower $\mathrm{f_{IHL}}$. Without the PSF correction, our IHL model overestimates the true flux by up to a factor of 100, and the effective radius by up to a factor of 10. Finally, we apply our methodology to real observations and estimate the $\mathrm{f_{IHL}}$ of the GAMA group G400138 using HSC-PDR3 UD data in the $\textit{g,r}$ and $\textit{i}$-bands, finding median IHL fractions of: $\mathrm{f_{g,IHL}}$ $\sim$ 0.19$^{+0.09}_{-0.01}$, $\mathrm{f_{r,IHL}}$ $\sim$ 0.08$^{+0.06}_{-0.02}$ and $\mathrm{f_{i,IHL}}$ $\sim$ 0.06$^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$.</description>

      <title>Chemical tagging of tidal tail star candidates of NGC 6362</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inner Milky Way disk globular cluster NGC~6362 appears to exhibit tidal tails composed of stars that have proper motions and positions in the color-magnitude diagram similar to those of cluster stars. Because recent results seem also to show that these stars are distributed across the regions least affected by interstellar absorption and reproduce the observed composite star field density map, we carried out a detailed spectroscopic analysis of a number of chemical element abundances of tidal tail star candidates in order to investigate the relationship of them with NGC~6362. From European Southern Observatory's VLT@FLAMES spectra we found that the red giant branch stars selected as cluster's tidal tail stars do not have overall metallicities nor abundances of Mg, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Ni and Ba similar to the cluster's ones. Moreover, they are mainly alike to stars that belong to the Milky Way thick disk, some of them could be part of the thin disk and a minor percentage could belong to the Milky Way halo star population. On the other hand, since the resulting radial velocities do not exhibit a distribution function similar to that of cluster's stars, we concluded that looking for kinematic properties similar to those of the cluster would not seem to be an approach for selecting cluster's tidal tail stars as suitable as previously thought.</description>

      <title>Dense gas tracers in and between spiral arms: from Giant Molecular Filaments to star-forming clumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant Molecular Filaments are opportune locations in our Galaxy to study the star-forming interstellar matter and its accumulation on spatial scales comparable to those now becoming available for external galaxies. We mapped the emission of HCN(1$-$0), HCO$^+$(1$-$0), and N$_2$H$^+$(1$-$0) towards two of these filaments, one associated with the Sagittarius arm and one with an interarm area. Using the data alongside the COHRS $^{12}$CO(3$-$2), the CHIMPS $^{13}$CO(3$-$2), and $\textit{Herschel}$-based column density maps, we evaluate the dense gas tracer emission characteristics and find that although its filling factor is the smallest among the studied species, N$_2$H$^+$ is the best at tracing the truly dense gas. Significant differences can be seen between the $^{13}$CO, HCN, and $N$(H$_2$)$_{\mathrm{dust}}$ levels of the arm and interarm, while the N$_2$H$^+$ emission is more uniform regardless of location, meaning that the observed variations in line ratios like N$_2$H$^+$/HCN or N$_2$H$^+$/$^{13}$CO are driven by species tracing moderate-density gas and not the star-forming gas. In many cases, greater variation in molecular emission and ratios exist between regions inside a filament than between the arm and interarm environments. The choice of measure of the dense gas and the available spatial resolution have deep impact on the multi-scale view of different environments inside a galaxy regarding molecular emissions, ratios, and thus the estimated star formation activity.</description>

      <title>Systematically Measuring Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies. VIII. Misfits, Miscasts, and Miscreants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We re-examine the 7,070 candidate ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in the SMUDGes survey and provide classifications based on their visual morphology. Among the more interesting cases, we identify objects along a low surface brightness galaxy merger sequence (ongoing mergers (8) and post-mergers (7)) and a distinct set of dwarf ring galaxies (29). The ring galaxies are hypothesized to be the result of nearly polar-axis collisions, but the responsible companions are undetected. We also highlight objects in the catalog that appear to be tidally affected (68), thereby cautioning that their cataloged parameters may be unreliable. Finally, we identify contaminants of various types in the catalog, leaving 6,553 as viable undisturbed UDG candidates. We discuss all categories and provide example images of the more interesting ones.</description>

      <title>The effects of the spin and quadrupole moment of SgrA* on the orbits of S stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the astrometric and spectroscopic data of stars orbiting the central black hole in our galaxy (Sgr A*) offers a promising way to measure relativistic effects. In principle, the "no-hair" theorem can be tested at the Galactic Center by monitoring the orbital precession of S-stars due to the angular momentum (spin) and quadrupole moment of Sgr A*. Closer-in stars, more strongly affected by the black hole's rotation, may be required. GRAVITY+ could detect such stars that are currently too faint for GRAVITY. We aim to analytically and numerically characterize orbital reorientations induced by spin-related effects of Sgr A* up to the second post-Newtonian (2PN) order. We use the two-timescale method to derive the 2PN analytical expressions of the secular evolution of the orbital parameters that are related to the observer. To study the interaction between the orbital and spin orientations, we introduce observer-independent quantities that offer insight into the Kerr geometry. We also use the post-Newtonian code OOGRE to simulate hypothetical stars orbiting closer to Sgr A*, where spin and quadrupole effects are stronger. This enables comparison with our analytical predictions. We exhibit three orbital-timescale precession rates that encode the in-plane pericenter shift and the out-of-plane redirection of the osculating ellipse. We provide the 2PN expressions of these precession rates and express the orbit-integrated associated angular shifts of the pericenter and of the ellipse axes. We relate these orbital-timescale precession rates to the secular-timescale precession of the orbital angular momentum around the black hole spin axis. We consider that the theoretical insight we provide in this article will be useful in constraining the spin effect of Sgr A* with GRAVITY+ observations.</description>

      <title>pySTARBURST99: The Next Generation of STARBURST99</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: STARBURST99 is a population synthesis code tailored to predict the integrated properties or observational characteristics of star-forming galaxies. Here we present an update to STARBURST99 where we port the code to python, include new evolutionary tracks both rotating and non-rotating at a range of low metallicity environments. We complement these tracks with a corresponding grid of new synthetic SEDs. Additionally we include both evolutionary and spectral models of stars up to 300-500Msol. Synthesis models made with the python version of the code and new input stellar models are labelled pySTARBURST99. We make new predictions for many properties, such as ionising flux, SED, bolometric luminosity, wind power, hydrogen line equivalent widths and the UV beta-slope. These properties are all assessed over wider coverage in metallicity, mass and resolution than in previous versions of STARBURST99. A notable finding from these updates is an increase in H I ionising flux of 0.3 dex in the first 2Myr when increasing the upper mass limit from 120 to 300Msol. Changing metallicity has little impact on H I in the first 2Myr (range of 0.015 dex from Z = 0.02 to 0.0) but lower metallicities have higher H I by 1 dex (comparing Z = 0.02 to 0.0004) at later times, with Z = 0.0 having even higher H I at later times. Rotating models have significantly higher H I than their equivalent non-rotating models at any time after 2Myr. Similar trends are found for He I and He II, bolometric luminosity and wind momentum, with more complex relations found for hydrogen line equivalent widths and UV beta-slopes.</description>

      <title>Universal Radial Scaling of Large-Scale Black Hole Accretion for Magnetically Arrested And Rocking Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion onto supermassive black holes (BHs) can launch relativistic jets that inject energy and momentum into their surroundings. Understanding how such feedback shapes large-scale accretion is key to bridging observations from galactic scales (e.g., the Bondi radius, $r_{\rm B}$) down to event horizon scales ($r_{\rm g}$), spanning 5-6 orders of magnitude. We tackle this challenge by varying the spatial scale separation across 2-4 orders of magnitude and performing some of the longest contiguous 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations to date ($t \lesssim 4\times10^6 r_{\rm g}/c$), of Bondi-like accretion of rotating, non-relativistic gas with weak vertical magnetic fields onto a rapidly spinning BH, achieving inflow equilibrium out to $r \gtrsim 10^3 r_{\rm g}$. We find that, regardless of scale separation or ambient gas rotation, all simulations reach a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state where the BH becomes magnetically saturated. In this state, the mass inflow rate follows a universal radial scaling: $\dot{M}_{\rm in}(r) \sim r^s$ with $s = 0.66 \pm 0.03$. The MAD state self-regulates through jets, outflows, and magnetic flux eruptions that can disrupt coherent angular momentum inflow, giving rise to a rocking accretion disk (RAD) state. This RAD state features chaotically oriented inflows, weak intermittent jets, and a steeper inflow slope of $s = 0.87 \pm 0.05$. The MAD and RAD BH accretion rates become comparable at typical scale separations, $r_{\rm B}/ r_{\rm g} \gtrsim 10^5$. Weaker RAD outflows allow large-scale inflows to resume, restoring the MAD state and enabling a recurring MAD-RAD cycle. These cycles can last tens of Bondi timescales, $t_{\rm B} \sim 0.2\,\text{Myr} \times (r_{\rm B}/10^{5} r_{\rm g})^{3/2} \times (M_{\rm BH}/10^9M_\odot)$, potentially setting the duty cycle of jetted AGN outbursts, such as in M87*.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic simulations of black hole evolution in AGN discs II: inclination damping for partially embedded satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of black holes on orbits with small inclinations ($i &lt; 2^\circ$) to the gaseous discs of active galactic nuclei. We perform 3D adiabatic hydrodynamic simulations within a shearing frame, studying the damping of inclination by black hole-gas gravitation. We find that for objects with $i&lt;3H_0R_0^{-1}$, where $H_0R_0^{-1}$ is the disc aspect ratio, the inclination lost per midplane crossing is proportional to the inclination preceding the crossing, resulting in a net exponential decay in inclination. For objects with $i&gt;3H_0R_0^{-1}$, damping efficiency decreases for higher inclinations. We consider a variety of different AGN environments, finding that damping is stronger for systems with a higher ambient Hill mass: the initial gas mass within the BH sphere-of-influence. We provide a fitting formula for the inclination changes as a function of Hill mass. We find reasonable agreement between the damping driven by gas gravity in the simulations and the damping driven by accretion under a Hill-limited Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton prescription. We find that gas dynamical friction consistently overestimates the strength of damping, especially for lower inclination systems, by at least an order of magnitude. For regions in the AGN disc where coplanar binary black hole formation by gas dissipation is efficient, we find that the simulated damping timescales are especially short with $\tau_d &lt; 10P_\mathrm{SMBH}$. We conclude that as the timescales for inclination damping are shorter than the expected interaction time between isolated black holes, the vast majority of binaries formed from gas capture should form from components with negligible inclination to the AGN disc.</description>

      <title>Very-wide-orbit planets from dynamical instabilities during the stellar birth cluster phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gas giant planets have been detected on eccentric orbits several hundreds of astronomical units in size around other stars. It has been proposed that even the Sun hosts a wide-orbit planet of 5-10 Earth masses, often called Planet Nine, which influences the dynamics of distant Trans-Neptunian objects. However, the formation mechanism of such planets remains uncertain. Here we use numerical simulations to show that very wide-orbit planets are a natural byproduct of dynamical instabilities that occur in planetary systems while their host stars are still embedded in natal stellar clusters. A planet is first brought to an eccentric orbit with an apoastron of several hundred au by repeated gravitational scattering by other planets, then perturbations from nearby stellar flybys stabilise the orbit by decoupling the planet from the interaction with the inner system. In our Solar System, the two main events likely conducive to planetary scattering were the growth of Uranus and Neptune, and the giant planets instability. We estimate a 5-10% likelihood of creating a very wide-orbit planet if either happened while the Sun was still in its birth cluster, rising to 40% if both were. In our simulated exoplanetary systems, the trapping efficiency is 1-5\%. Our results imply that planets on wide, eccentric orbits occur at least $10^{-3}$ per star.</description>

      <title>Photometric redshift estimation for emission line galaxies of DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys by CNN-MLP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) are crucial for cosmological studies, particularly in understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe and the role of dark energy. ELGs form an essential component of the target catalogue for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), a major astronomical survey. However, the accurate selection of ELGs for such surveys is challenging due to the inherent uncertainties in determining their redshifts with photometric data. In order to improve the accuracy of photometric redshift estimation for ELGs, we propose a novel approach CNN-MLP that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). This approach integrates both images and photometric data derived from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 10. By leveraging the complementary strengths of CNNs (for image data processing) and MLPs (for photometric feature integration), the CNN-MLP model achieves a $\sigma_{\mathrm{NMAD}}$ (normalised median absolute deviation) of 0.0140 and an outlier fraction of 2.57%. Compared to other models, CNN-MLP demonstrates a significant improvement in the accuracy of ELG photometric redshift estimation, which directly benefits the target selection process for DESI. In addition, we explore the photometric redshifts of different galaxy types (Starforming, Starburst, AGN, Broadline). Furthermore, this approach will contribute to more reliable photometric redshift estimation in ongoing and future large-scale sky surveys (e.g. LSST, CSST, Euclid), enhancing the overall efficiency of cosmological research and galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Long-term investigation of an open cluster Berkeley 65</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a decade-long investigation of a poorly studied cluster, Berkeley 65 (Be 65), using deep optical data from the telescopes of ARIES, Nainital Observatory. We estimate its radius ($R_{cluster}$ = 1.6$^{'}$, aspect ratio of $\sim$1.1), distance (2.0 $\pm$ 0.1 kpc) and age ($\sim$160 Myrs). A clear turn-off point at $\sim$1.7 M$_\odot$ in the mass function suggests the escape of low-mass stars, and the lower photometric mass compared to the dynamical mass indicates ongoing disruption due to external forces. Our long-baseline optical photometric data also identifies 64 periodic and 16 non-periodic stars in this region. We have presented the light curves and the classification of those variables. The periodic stars have periods ranging from $\sim$0.05 days to $\sim$3.00 days and amplitude ranges from $\sim$8 mmag to $\sim$700 mmag. The nonperiodic stars show variation from $\sim$30 mmag to $\sim$500 mmag. The periodic stars include main-sequence pulsating variables such as Slow Pulsating B-type, $\delta$ Scuti, RR Lyrae, and $\gamma$ Doradus. We report a detached binary system and rotating variables similar to BY Draconis-type stars exhibiting variable brightness caused by starspots, chromospheric activity, and magnetic field-related phenomena.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Fuzzy Dark Matter Inside Radial Critical Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the strong gravitational lensing properties of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos, focusing on the magnification properties near radial critical curves (CCs). Using simulated lenses we compute magnification maps for a range of axion masses and halo configurations. We show that FDM produces enhanced central magnification and secondary CCs that are not easily reproduced by standard cold dark matter (CDM), even when including subhalos. The strength and scale of these effects depend primarily on the de~Broglie wavelength, governed by the axion and halo masses. We find that axion masses in the range $m_\psi \sim 10^{-22}$--$10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}$ in galaxy-mass halos lead to distinctive magnification distributions. Our results suggest that observations of highly magnified, compact sources near radial arcs, such as quasars or supernovae, could serve as a powerful test for the presence of FDM.</description>

      <title>A White Paper on The Multi-Messenger Science Landscape in India</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multi-messenger science using different observational windows to the Universe such as Gravitational Waves (GWs), Electromagnetic Waves (EMs), Cosmic Rays (CRs), and Neutrinos offer an opportunity to study from the scale of a neutron star to cosmological scales over a large cosmic time. At the smallest scales, we can explore the structure of the neutron star and the different energetics involved in the transition of a pre-merger neutron star to a post-merger neutron star. This will open up a window to study the properties of matter in extreme conditions and a guaranteed discovery space. On the other hand, at the largest cosmological scales, multi-messenger observations allow us to study the long-standing problems in physical cosmology related to the Hubble constant, dark matter, and dark energy by mapping the expansion history of the Universe using GW sources. Moreover, the multi-messenger studies of astrophysical systems such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes of different masses, all the way up to a high redshift Universe, will bring insightful understanding into the physical processes associated with them that are inaccessible otherwise. This white paper discusses the key cases in the domain of multi-messenger astronomy and the role of observatories in India which can explore uncharted territories and open discovery spaces in different branches of physics ranging from nuclear physics to astrophysics.</description>

We investigate the binary fraction of RSGs in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and Triangulum Galaxy (M33) using photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), which offers high spatial resolution to resolve more RSGs. A preliminary step involves identifying a reliable and complete RSG sample using the F110W $-$ F160W versus F160W diagram, yielding 2,612 RSGs from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey of M31 3,294 RSGs from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury: Triangulum Extended Region (PHATTER) survey of M33. These samples suggest total RSG populations in M31 and M33 of 6,563 and 7,572, respectively. These estimates significantly exceed previous ones from the ground-based observations, an increase attributed to the superior spatial resolution of the HST. The stellar parameters of these RSGs, including effective temperature ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}$), radius ($R$), and luminosity ($L$), are derived by fitting their spectral energy distribution (SED) across optical and near-infrared bands. Binary candidates are identified by detecting ultraviolet (UV) excesses in their SEDs compared to the single-star RSG model prediction. The binary fraction is determined to be 33.4% $\pm$ 0.9% for M31 and 30.9% $\pm$ 0.8% for M33. For more luminous RSGs with log $L/L_{\odot} &gt; 4.0$, the binary fraction decreases to 31.6% $\pm$ 1.9% in M31 and increases to 34.7% $\pm$ 1.8% in M33, respectively. These results are in good agreement with predictions from the BPASS binary evolution model.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of Infall and Accretion Shocks in the Outer Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-spatial-resolution observations of disks around young stars suggest planetary systems begin forming early, during the protostellar phase (&lt; 1 Myr) when stars accrete most of their mass via infall from the surrounding cloud. During this era shocks are expected to be ubiquitous around the gaseous accretion disk due to supersonic infall that strikes the disk. We investigate the role of shocks using a theoretical and modeling framework we call the shock twist-angle Keplerian (STAK) disk, connecting the disk and infalling envelope gas via a shock using general physical principles. Briefly, at the shock, energy is dissipated while angular momentum is conserved, so that the infalling gas must change direction sharply, yielding a bend or twist in the streamlines. The model's pre-shock gas follows free-fall parabolic trajectories, while the post-shock gas is on lower-energy, elliptical orbits.
  We construct synthetic observations and find that the deviations from circular Keplerian orbits are detectable in Doppler-shifted molecular spectral lines using radio interferometers such as ALMA. Specifically, the STAK model leads to line emission intensity and velocity-moment maps that are asymmetric and offset with respect to the disk structure traced by the dust continuum. We examine archival ALMA data for the class 0/I protostar L1527 and find the C$^{18}$O velocity moment map has features resembling the disk plus envelope emission that naturally arise when the two are connected by a shock. Thus, spectral line observations having sub-km/s spectral resolution and angular resolution sufficient to fully resolve the disk can reveal protostars' envelope-disk shocks.</description>

      <title>Diversity of Cold Worlds: A Near Complete Spectral Energy Distribution for 2MASS J04151954-0935066 using JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24591</link>

Abstract: We present the a near complete spectral energy distribution (SED) for an extrasolar world: the T8 brown dwarf 2MASS~J04151954$-$0935066. Spanning from optical to mid-infrared (0.7--20.4 micron) wavelengths, the SED for this substellar atmosphere is constructed from new JWST NIRSpec G395H ($R\sim$2700) and Magellan FIRE echelle ($R\sim$8000) near-infrared spectra, along with MIRI mid-infrared photometry complemented by spectra from Keck I, IRTF, Magellan, AKARI, Spitzer and photometry from various surveys and missions. The NIRSpec G395H spectrum reveals strong molecular absorptions from NH$_{3}$, CH$_{4}$, H$_{2}$S, CO$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$O at approximately 3.00, 3.35, 3.95, 4.25, and 5.00 micron respectively, along with the presence of a CO absorption feature detected mainly at $\sim$ 4.6 micron. We detect no absorption of near-infrared K I doublets in the $R\sim8000$ FIRE spectra. In the mid-infrared IRS spectrum, we tentatively identify a new CO$_{2}$ feature at 14--16 micron. The comprehensive SED allows us to empirically constrain bolometric luminosity, effective temperature, mass and radius. Additionally, we demonstrate that the NIRSpec G395H resolution, the highest allowable by JWST, enables a precise radial velocity measurement of $47.1\pm1.8$ km s$^{-1}$ for the object, in agreement with previous measurements.</description>

      <title>Identification of New Candidate Be/X-Ray Binary Systems in the Small Magellanic Cloud via Analysis of S-CUBED Source Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has long been known that a large population of Be/X-ray Binaries (BeXRBs) exists in the Milky Way's neighboring dwarf galaxy, the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), due to a recent period of intense star formation. Since 2016, efforts have been made to monitor this population and identify new BeXRBs through the Swift SMC Survey (S-CUBED). S-CUBED's weekly observation cadence has identified many new BeXRBs that exist within the SMC, but evidence suggests that more systems exist that have thusfar escaped detection. A major challenge in identifying new BeXRBs is their transient nature at high-energy wavelengths, which prevents them from being detected via their X-ray emission characteristics when not in outburst. In order to identify sources that may have been missed due to a long period of quiescence, it becomes necessary to devise methods of detection that rely on wavelengths at which BeXRBs are more persistent emitters. In this work, we attempt to use archival analysis of infrared, optical, and ultraviolet observations to identify new candidate BeXRBs that have been overlooked within the S-CUBED source catalog. Using X-ray/optical selection of source properties, unsupervised clustering, SED-fitting to VizieR archival measurements, and ultraviolet light curve analysis, we are able to identify six new candidate BeXRB systems that otherwise would have been missed by automated analysis pipelines. Using these results, we demonstrate the use of ultraviolet through near-infrared observational data in identifying candidate BeXRBs when they cannot be identified using their X-ray emission.</description>

      <title>Cyclostationary signals in LISA: a practical application to Milky Way satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the primary sources of gravitational waves (GWs) anticipated to be detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are Galactic double white dwarf binaries (DWDs). However, most of these binaries will be unresolved, and their GWs will overlap incoherently, creating a stochastic noise known as the Galactic foreground. Similarly, the population of unresolved systems in the Milky Way's (MW) satellites is expected to contribute to a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Due to their anisotropy and the annual motion of the LISA constellation, both the Galactic foreground and the satellite SGWB fall into the category of cyclostationary processes. Leveraging this property, we develop a purely frequency-based method to study LISA's capability to detect the MW foreground and SGWBs from the most promising MW satellites. We analyze both mock data generated by an astrophysically motivated SGWB spectrum, and realistic ones from a DWD population generated via binary population synthesis. We are able to recover or put constrains on the candidate foregrounds, reconstructing -- in the presence of noise uncertainties -- their sky distribution and spectrum. Our findings highlight the significance of the interplay between the astrophysical spectrum and LISA's sensitivity to detect the satellites' SGWB. Considering an astrophysically motivated prior on the satellite positions improves their detectability, which becomes otherwise challenging in the presence of the Galactic foreground. Furthermore, we explore the potential to observe a hypothetical satellite located behind the Galactic disk. Our results suggest that a Large Magellanic Cloud-like satellite could indeed be observable by LISA.</description>

      <title>Chemical Abundances in the Leiptr Stellar Stream: A Disrupted Ultra-faint Dwarf Galaxy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical abundances of stellar streams can be used to determine the nature of a stream's progenitor. Here we study the progenitor of the recently discovered Leiptr stellar stream, which was previously suggested to be a tidally disrupted halo globular cluster. We obtain high-resolution spectra of five red giant branch stars selected from the Gaia DR2 STREAMFINDER catalog with Magellan/MIKE. One star is a clear non-member. The remaining four stars display chemical abundances consistent with those of a low-mass dwarf galaxy: they have a low mean metallicity, $\langle{\rm[Fe/H]}\rangle = -2.2$; they do not all have identical metallicities; and they display low [$\alpha$/Fe] $\sim 0$ and [Sr/Fe] and [Ba/Fe] $\sim -1$. This pattern of low $\alpha$ and neutron-capture element abundances is only found in intact dwarf galaxies with stellar mass $\lesssim 10^5 M_\odot$. Although more data are needed to be certain, Leiptr's chemistry is consistent with being the lowest-mass dwarf galaxy stream without a known intact progenitor, possibly in the mass range of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. Leiptr thus preserves a record of one of the lowest-mass early accretion events into the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Exploring the mysterious high-ionization source powering [Ne V] in high-z analog SBS0335-052 E with JWST/MIRI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nearby blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs) share similar properties with objects from the Epoch of Reionization revealed by JWST, in terms of low stellar mass, low metallicity and high specific star-formation rate. Thus, they represent ideal local laboratories for detailed multi-wavelength studies to understand their properties and the mechanisms shaping them. We report the first JWST MIRI/MRS observations of the BCD SBS 0335-052 E, analyzing MIR emission lines tracing different levels of ionization (e.g., [NeII], [SIV], [NeIII], [OIV], [NeV]) of the ionized gas. SBS 0335-052 E MIR emission is characterized by a bright point source, located in one of the youngest and most embedded stellar clusters ($t\sim3$ Myr, $A_V\sim15$), and underlying extended high-ionization emission (i.e., [OIV], [NeV]) from the surroundings of the older and less dusty stellar clusters ($t&lt; 20 $ Myr, $A_V\sim8$). From the comparison with state-of-the-art models, we can exclude shocks, X-ray binaries, and old stellar populations as the main sources of the high ionization. Interestingly, a 4-16% contribution of a $\sim10^5$ M$_\odot$ intermediate massive black hole (IMBH) is needed to justify the strong [NeV]/[NeII] and would be consistent with optical/UV line ratios from previous studies. However, even IMBH models cannot explain the strongest [OIV]/[NeIII]. Also, star-forming models (regardless of including X-ray binaries) struggle to reproduce even the lower ionization line ratios (e.g., [SIV]/[NeII]) typically observed in BCDs. Overall, while current models suggest the need to account for an accreting IMBH in this high-$z$ analog, limitations still exist in predicting high-ionization emission lines (I.P. $&gt;54$ eV) when modeling these low-metallicity environments, thus other sources of ionization cannot be fully ruled out.</description>

      <title>SHELLQs. Bridging the gap: JWST unveils obscured quasars in the most luminous galaxies at z &gt; 6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unprecedented sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a surprisingly abundant population of mildly obscured, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the epoch of reionization (EoR). However, the link between these objects and classical unobscured quasars remains a mystery. Here we report the discovery of obscured quasars hosted by the most luminous galaxies at $z &gt; 6$, possibly bridging the gap between the two AGN populations. The 13 objects presented here were originally selected from a rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) imaging survey over $&gt;$1000 deg$^2$, and were known to have luminous ($&gt;10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$) narrow Ly$\alpha$ emission. With JWST/NIRSpec follow-up observations, we found that 7 out of 11 objects with narrow Ly$\alpha$ exhibit a broad component in H I Balmer lines and He I lines, but not in [O III] and other forbidden lines. Mild dust obscuration ($0 &lt; A_V &lt; 3$) is inferred from the Balmer decrements. The estimated intrinsic luminosities suggest that our broad line (BL) objects are the long-sought UV-obscured counterparts of luminous quasars in the EoR. They host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses $10^{7.8 - 9.1} M_\odot$, undergoing sub-Eddington to Eddington accretion. Most of the BL objects are spatially unresolved, and are close to "little red dots" with their blue rest-UV and red rest-optical colors. We estimate the AGN number density among similarly luminous Ly$\alpha$ emitters to be larger than $2 \times 10^{-8}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. This density is comparable to that of classical quasars with similar continuum luminosities, suggesting that a substantial fraction of active SMBHs are obscured in the EoR and have been overlooked in past rest-UV surveys.</description>

      <title>Quasar absorption outflows on galactic scales: Insights from DESI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Absorption outflows in quasars play an important role in understanding active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback and their influence on galaxy evolution. The unprecedented spectral data provided by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) opens new avenues to explore these outflows. We analyze five low-ionization absorption outflow systems in four intermediate-redshift quasars ($2 &lt; z &lt; 3$) using the data obtained by DESI in order to characterize their physical properties and energetics, and also to assess their role in AGN feedback. We use the spectra from DESI's Early Data Release to determine the ionic column densities, total hydrogen column densities, electron number densities, and ionization parameters via photoionization modeling and absorption line analysis. We derive the outflows' distance from the AGN, and its kinematic properties: mass-flow rates, kinetic luminosity, and momentum flux. Our study identifies five distinct mini-broad absorption line outflow systems, hosted by four quasars. The identified outflows exhibit hydrogen column densities of $\log (N_H) = 20.0-20.7$[cm$^{-2}$], ionization parameters of $\log (U_H) = -2.7$ to $-2.1$, and electron number densities of $\log (n_e) =1.45-2.85$[cm$^{-2}$]. The distances of the outflows from the central source are between 4.5 to 31 kpc, and the kinetic luminosities range from $2\times10^{-6}$ to $5\times10^{-3}$ of the Eddington luminosity. The outflows in J1407 and J1032 show the largest kinetic luminosities, with momentum flux ratios ($\dot{p} / \dot{p}_{rad}$) of about 2 and 0.2, respectively. Our findings highlight the vital role of DESI data in uncovering the diversity and significance of quasar outflows in galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ly$\alpha$ Emission from Diffuse Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00450v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ly$\alpha$ emission has emerged as a powerful tool for probing diffuse gas within the large-scale structure of the universe. In this paper, we investigate cosmic Ly$\alpha$ emission by post-processing cosmological simulations from \texttt{IllustrisTNG} and \texttt{THESAN} project. Specifically, we calculate the Ly$\alpha$ emission from galaxies, circum-galactic medium (CGM) and inter-galactic medium (IGM) across various redshifts. Our results show that IGM alone is significantly under the current observational upper limits. Meanwhile, CGM overshoots the observed galaxy contribution at $z \lesssim 0.5$ indicating that either the escape fraction for the inner CGM is less than unity or the current photoionization equilibrium treatment with an approximate self-shielding prescription is less accurate. The galaxy component also overshoots at low redshift, indicating that the escape fraction has strong evolution caused by an evolving halo mass function and dust growth distribution, that agrees with observationally inferred escape fractions. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the Ly$\alpha$ emission from diffuse gas (CGM+IGM) peaked at $z \sim 4$ and diminishes toward lower redshift. The Ly$\alpha$ emission from diffuse gas mainly originates through the collisional excitation of hot plasma. By comparing models with observation, our predicted Ly$\alpha$ emission from diffuse gas remains $\sim 6$ times fainter than the observed cosmic Ly$\alpha$ emission at $z=1-3$. However, future large telescopes may hold great promise to detect Ly$\alpha$ emission from diffuse gas toward $z&gt;3$.</description>

      <title>Breaking boundaries: extending the orbit-averaged Fokker-Planck equation inside the loss cone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04178v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we present a new formulation of loss cone theory as a reaction-diffusion system, which accounts for loss cone events through a sink term and can be orbit-averaged. It can recover the standard approach based on boundary conditions, and is derived from a simple physical model that overcomes many of the classical theoretical constraints. We test our formulation by computing the relaxed distribution of disruptive orbits in phase space, that has a simple analytic form and matches the pericentre of tidal disruption events at disruption predicted by steady-state models, comparably well or better than other available formulas. This formulation of the problem is particularly suitable for including more physics in tidal disruptions and the analogous problem of gravitational captures, e.g. strong scatterings, gravitational waves emission, physical stellar collisions, and repeating partial disruptions -- that can all act on timescale shorter than two-body relaxation and might cause the tension between the observed vs theoretically predicted popultation of tidal disruptions.</description>

      <title>Open Superclusters II. Discovery of an Inactive Supercluster Including a New Star Cluster in the Solar Neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number of known star clusters, associations, and moving groups in the vicinity of the Sun has increased significantly due to the use of Gaia data. We investigated the existence and properties of open superclusters (OSC) within 500 pc of the Sun, with a particular focus on a newly identified OSC, designated HC8. Using advanced Gaia-derived astrometric data and star cluster catalogs, we identify and analyze member stars of various clusters, deriving key parameters such as ages, distances, extinctions, and kinematic properties. Our findings reveal that HC8, a previously unrecognized OSC, encompasses several young clusters, including the newly discovered cluster Duvia~1. We provide a detailed examination of HC8's star formation history and its spatial and kinematic characteristics. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the existence of highly populated primordial groups and enhances our understanding of the formation and evolution of star clusters in the Galaxy.</description>

Abstract: Intensive reverberation mapping monitoring programs combine ground-based photometric observations from different telescopes, requiring intercalibration of lightcurves to reduce systematic instrumental differences. We present a new iterative algorithm to calibrate photometric time-series data of active galactic nuclei (AGN) using 100s of comparison stars on the same images, building upon the established method of ensemble photometry. The algorithm determines telescope-specific and epoch-specific correction parameters, and simultaneously computes a multi-component noise model to account for underestimated uncertainties based on the scatter in the comparison star data, effectively identifying problematic epochs, telescopes, and stars. No assumptions need to be made about the AGN variability shape, and the algorithm can in principle be applied to any astronomical object. We demonstrate our method on lightcurves taken with ten 1-m telescopes from the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) robotic telescope network. Comparing our results to other intercalibration tools, we find that the algorithm can more accurately quantify the uncertainties in the data. We describe additional corrections that can be made for particularly bluer AGNs like Fairall 9, arising due to systematic effects dependent on star colour.</description>
