      <title>AutoBS: Autonomous Base Station Deployment Framework with Reinforcement Learning and Digital Twin Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces AutoBS, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for optimal base station (BS) deployment in 6G networks. AutoBS leverages the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm and fast, site-specific pathloss predictions from PMNet to efficiently learn deployment strategies that balance coverage and capacity. Numerical results demonstrate that AutoBS achieves 95% for a single BS, and 90% for multiple BSs, of the capacity provided by exhaustive search methods while reducing inference time from hours to milliseconds, making it highly suitable for real-time applications. AutoBS offers a scalable and automated solution for large-scale 6G networks, addressing the challenges of dynamic environments with minimal computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Joint Power Allocation and Phase Shift Design for Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces-aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems with MARL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems offer high spectral efficiency (SE) through multiple distributed access points (APs). However, the large number of antennas increases power consumption. We propose incorporating stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) into CF mMIMO systems as a cost-effective, energy-efficient solution. This paper focuses on optimizing the joint power allocation of APs and the phase shift of SIMs to maximize the sum SE. To address this complex problem, we introduce a fully distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm. Our novel algorithm, the noisy value method with a recurrent policy in multi-agent policy optimization (NVR-MAPPO), enhances performance by encouraging diverse exploration under centralized training and decentralized execution. Simulations demonstrate that NVR-MAPPO significantly improves sum SE and robustness across various scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative repair scheme for Zigzag MSR codes with optimal repair bandwidth, enabling the repair of any h failed nodes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first optimal cooperative repair scheme for Zigzag MSR codes. Compared to previous cooperative repair schemes for MSR codes, our scheme significantly reduces the size of the finite field to Fq,q&gt;=n+1.</description>

      <title>On Designing Novel ISI-Reducing Single Error Correcting Codes in an MCvD System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intersymbol Interference (ISI) has a detrimental impact on any Molecular Communication via Diffusion (MCvD) system. Also, the receiver noise can severely degrade the MCvD channel performance. However, the channel codes proposed in the literature for the MCvD system have only addressed one of these two challenges independently. In this paper, we have designed single Error Correcting Codes in an MCvD system with channel memory and noise. We have also provided encoding and decoding algorithms for the proposed codes, which are simple to follow despite having a non-linear code construction. Finally, through simulation results, we show that the proposed single ECCs, for given code parameters, perform better than the existing codes in the literature in combating the effect of ISI in the channel and improving the average Bit Error Rate (BER) performance in a noisy channel.</description>

      <title>On Performance of FAS-aided Covert Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of deploying the fluid antenna system (FAS) on the performance of covert communications. In particular, we focus on a scenario where a transmitter seeks to covertly communicate with a receiver, while a warden attempts to detect the transmission. Both the receiver and the warden are assumed to utilize planar FAS. We derive compact analytical expressions for the covertness outage probability (COP), defined as the complement of the sum of false alarm (FA) and missed detection (MD) probabilities. By determining the optimal detection threshold that maximizes the COP, we characterize the success probability for the legitimate transmission, highlighting the trade-off between covertness and transmission success. Our numerical results confirm that while deploying FAS at the warden enhances its detection ability compared to fixed-position antennas (FPAs), equipping the receiver with FAS rather than FPAs significantly improves reception quality, leading to more reliable transmission.</description>

      <title>The entropy profiles of a definable set over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A definable set $X$ in the first-order language of rings defines a family of random vectors: for each finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, let the distribution be supported and uniform on the $\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $X$. We employ results from the model theory of finite fields to show that their entropy profiles settle into one of finitely many stable asymptotic behaviors as $q$ grows. The attainable asymptotic entropy profiles and their dominant terms as functions of $q$ are computable. This generalizes a construction of Mat\'u\v{s} which gives an information-theoretic interpretation to algebraic matroids.</description>

      <title>Harmonious Coexistence between Aloha and CSMA: Novel Dual-channel Modeling and Throughput Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scarcity of the licensed spectrum is forcing emerging Internet of Things (IoT) networks to operate within the unlicensed spectrum. Yet there has been extensive observation indicating that performance deterioration and significant unfairness would arise, when newly deployed Aloha-based networks coexist with incumbent Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)-based WiFi networks, especially without proper adjustment of packet transmission times. Therefore, ensuring harmonious cohabitation between Aloha and CSMA networks is of paramount importance. How to properly tune system parameters to guarantee harmonious coexistence between these two networks, nevertheless, remains largely unexplored. To address the above open issue, this paper proposed a novel dual-channel analytical framework to characterize the throughput performance of the cohabitation between slotted Aloha and CSMA networks. To achieve harmonious coexistence, the total throughput of the coexisting network under a given desired throughput proportion is optimized by tuning the packet transmission time of CSMA nodes and transmission probabilities. The optimization results indicate that the packet transmission time of CSMA nodes should be set slightly less than that of Aloha nodes. The proposed framework is further applied to enhance the network throughput and fairness of the cohabitation of LTE Unlicensed and WiFi networks.</description>

      <title>Moderate-length lifted quantum Tanner codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce new families of quantum Tanner codes, a class of quantum codes which first appeared in the work of Leverrier and Z\'emor. These codes are built from two classical Tanner codes, for which the underlying graphs are extracted from coverings of 2D geometrical complexes, and the local linear codes are tensor-product of cyclic or double-circulant linear codes. We present several explicit families, and identify instances of moderate length quantum codes which are degenerate, have low check weight, and for which the distance surpasses the square root of the code length. Among them, we report the existence of a $[[96,2,12]]$ code, for which half of the checks are of weight 8 and the other half of weight 4.</description>

      <title>Orders between channels and implications for partial information decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The partial information decomposition (PID) framework is concerned with decomposing the information that a set of random variables has with respect to a target variable into three types of components: redundant, synergistic, and unique. Classical information theory alone does not provide a unique way to decompose information in this manner and additional assumptions have to be made. Recently, Kolchinsky proposed a new general axiomatic approach to obtain measures of redundant information, based on choosing an order relation between information sources (equivalently, order between communication channels). In this paper, we exploit this approach to introduce three new measures of redundant information (and the resulting decompositions) based on well-known preorders between channels, thus contributing to the enrichment of the PID landscape. We relate the new decompositions to existing ones, study some of their properties, and provide examples illustrating their novelty. As a side result, we prove that any preorder that satisfies Kolchinsky's axioms yields a decomposition that meets the axioms originally introduced by Williams and Beer when they first propose the PID.</description>

      <title>Localized and Distributed Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces with Lossy Interconnections: Modeling and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a key technology to control the communication environment in future wireless networks. Recently, beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) emerged as a generalization of RIS achieving larger coverage through additional tunable impedance components interconnecting the RIS elements. However, conventional RIS and BD-RIS can effectively serve only users in their proximity, resulting in limited coverage. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we investigate distributed RIS, whose elements are distributed over a wide region, in opposition to localized RIS commonly considered in the literature. The scaling laws of distributed BD-RIS reveal that it offers significant gains over distributed conventional RIS and localized BD-RIS, enabled by its interconnections allowing signal propagation within the BD-RIS. To assess the practical performance of distributed BD-RIS, we model and optimize BD-RIS with lossy interconnections through transmission line theory. Our model accounts for phase changes and losses over the BD-RIS interconnections arising when the interconnection lengths are not much smaller than the wavelength. Numerical results show that the performance of localized BD-RIS is only slightly impacted by losses, given the short interconnection lengths. Besides, distributed BD-RIS can achieve orders of magnitude of gains over conventional RIS, even in the presence of low losses.</description>

      <title>A Measure of Synergy based on Union Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The partial information decomposition (PID) framework is concerned with decomposing the information that a set of (two or more) random variables (the sources) has about another variable (the target) into three types of information: unique, redundant, and synergistic. Classical information theory alone does not provide a unique way to decompose information in this manner and additional assumptions have to be made. One often overlooked way to achieve this decomposition is using a so-called measure of union information - which quantifies the information that is present in at least one of the sources - from which a synergy measure stems. In this paper, we introduce a new measure of union information based on adopting a communication channel perspective, compare it with existing measures, and study some of its properties. We also include a comprehensive critical review of characterizations of union information and synergy measures that have been proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Optimization for Rotatable Antenna Enabled Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08411v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS)/movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology to fully exploit the spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). In this paper, we propose a new rotatable antenna (RA) model, as a simplified implementation of six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA), to improve the performance of wireless communication systems. Different from conventional fixed antenna, the proposed RA system can independently and flexibly change the three-dimensional (3D) orientation/boresight of each antenna by adjusting its deflection angles to achieve desired channel realizations. Specifically, we study an RA-enabled uplink communication system, where the receive beamforming and the deflection angles of all RAs are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the users. In the special single-user and free-space propagation setup, the optimal deflection angles are derived in closed form with the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) beamformer applied at the base station (BS). In the general multi-user and multi-path setup, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to alternately optimize the receive beamforming and the deflection angles in an iterative manner. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed RA-enabled system can significantly outperform other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Dual-Polarized Beyond Diagonal RIS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) is a family of RIS architectures more flexible than conventional RIS. While BD-RIS has been primarily analyzed assuming uni-polarized systems, modern wireless deployments are dual-polarized. To address this gap, this paper investigates the fundamental limits of dual-polarized BD-RIS-aided systems. We derive the scaling laws governing the performance of BD-RIS and the Pareto frontier of the trade-off between performance and circuit complexity enabled by BD-RIS. Theoretical results show that the group-connected RIS with group size 2 provides remarkable gains over conventional RIS in both Rayleigh and line-of-sight (LoS) channels, while maintaining a reduced circuit complexity.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-Assisted Covert Communication via Qubit Depolarizing Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider entanglement-assisted communication over the qubit depolarizing channel under the security requirement of covert communication, where not only the information is kept secret, but the transmission itself must be concealed from detection by an adversary. Previous work showed that $O(\sqrt{n})$ information bits can be reliably and covertly transmitted in $n$ channel uses without entanglement assistance. However, Gagatsos et al. (2020) showed that entanglement assistance can increase this scaling to $O(\sqrt{n}\log(n))$ for continuous-variable bosonic channels. Here, we present a finite-dimensional parallel, and show that $O(\sqrt{n}\log(n))$ covert bits can be transmitted reliably over $n$ uses of a qubit depolarizing channel. The coding scheme employs "weakly" entangled states such that their squared amplitude scales as $O(1/\sqrt{n})$.</description>

      <title>New Protocols for Conference Key and Multipartite Entanglement Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We approach two interconnected problems of quantum information processing in networks: Conference key agreement and entanglement distillation, both in the so-called source model where the given resource is a multipartite quantum state and the players interact over public classical channels to generate the desired correlation. The first problem is the distillation of a conference key when the source state is shared between a number of legal players and an eavesdropper; the eavesdropper, apart from starting off with this quantum side information, also observes the public communication between the players. The second is the distillation of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states by means of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) from the given mixed state. These problem settings extend our previous paper [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 68(2):976-988, 2022], and we generalise its results: using a quantum version of the task of communication for omniscience, we derive novel lower bounds on the distillable conference key from any multipartite quantum state by means of non-interacting communication protocols. Secondly, we establish novel lower bounds on the yield of GHZ states from multipartite mixed states. Namely, we present two methods to produce bipartite entanglement between sufficiently many nodes so as to produce GHZ states. Next, we show that the conference key agreement protocol can be made coherent under certain conditions, enabling the direct generation of multipartite GHZ states.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Coordination Rates in Multi-User Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11893</link>

Abstract: The optimal coordination rates are determined in three primary settings of multi-user quantum networks, thus characterizing the minimal resources required in order to simulate a joint quantum state among multiple parties. We study the following models: (1) a cascade network with rate-limited entanglement, (2) a broadcast network, which consists of a single sender and two receivers, (3) a multiple-access network with two senders and a single receiver. We establish the necessary and sufficient conditions on the asymptotically-achievable communication and entanglement rates in each setting. At last, we show the implications of our results on nonlocal games with quantum strategies.</description>

      <title>To Switch or Not to Switch? Balanced Policy Switching in Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) -- finding the optimal behaviour (also referred to as policy) maximizing the collected long-term cumulative reward -- is among the most influential approaches in machine learning with a large number of successful applications. In several decision problems, however, one faces the possibility of policy switching -- changing from the current policy to a new one -- which incurs a non-negligible cost, and in the decision one is limited to using historical data without the availability for further online interaction. Despite the inevitable importance of this offline learning scenario, to our best knowledge, very little effort has been made to tackle the key problem of balancing between the gain and the cost of switching in a flexible and principled way. Leveraging ideas from the area of optimal transport, we initialize the systematic study of policy switching in offline RL. We establish fundamental properties and design a Net Actor-Critic algorithm for the proposed novel switching formulation. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on multiple robot control benchmarks of the Gymnasium and traffic light control from SUMO-RL.</description>

      <title>Effective Distance of Higher Dimensional HGPs and Weight-Reduced Quantum LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02193v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction plays a prominent role in the realization of quantum computation, and quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes are believed to be practically useful stabilizer codes. While qLDPC codes are defined to have constant weight parity-checks, the weight of these parity checks could be large constants that make implementing these codes challenging. Large constants can also result in long syndrome extraction times and bad error propagation that can impact error correction performance. Hastings recently introduced weight reduction techniques for qLDPC codes that reduce the weight of the parity checks as well as the maximum number of checks that acts on any data qubit. However, the fault tolerance of these techniques remains an open question. In this paper, we analyze the effective distance of the weight-reduced code when single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuits are considered for error correction. We prove that there exists single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuits that largely preserve the effective distance of the weight-reduced qLDPC codes. In addition, we also show that the distance balancing technique introduced by Evra et al. preserves effective distance. As a corollary, our result shows that higher-dimensional hypergraph product (HGP) codes, also known as homological product codes corresponding to the product of 1-complexes, have no troublesome hook errors when using any single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuit.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of Sample-averaged Q-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a key approach for training agents in complex and uncertain environments. Incorporating statistical inference in RL algorithms is essential for understanding and managing uncertainty in model performance. This paper introduces a generalized framework for time-varying batch-averaged Q-learning, termed sample-averaged Q-learning (SA-QL), which extends traditional single-sample Q-learning by aggregating samples of rewards and next states to better account for data variability and uncertainty. We leverage the functional central limit theorem (FCLT) to establish a novel framework that provides insights into the asymptotic normality of the sample-averaged algorithm under mild conditions. Additionally, we develop a random scaling method for interval estimation, enabling the construction of confidence intervals without requiring extra hyperparameters. Extensive numerical experiments across classic stochastic OpenAI Gym environments, including windy gridworld and slippery frozenlake, demonstrate how different batch scheduling strategies affect learning efficiency, coverage rates, and confidence interval widths. This work establishes a unified theoretical foundation for sample-averaged Q-learning, providing insights into effective batch scheduling and statistical inference for RL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Extendible quantum measurements and limitations on classical communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unextendibility of quantum states and channels is inextricably linked to the no-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics, it has played an important role in understanding and quantifying entanglement, and more recently it has found applications in providing limitations on quantum error correction and entanglement distillation. Here we generalize the framework of unextendibility to quantum measurements and define $k$-extendible measurements for every integer $k\ge 2$. Our definition provides a hierarchy of semidefinite constraints that specify a set of measurements containing every measurement that can be realized by local operations and one-way classical communication. Furthermore, the set of $k$-extendible measurements converges to the set of measurements that can be realized by local operations and one-way classical communication as $k\to \infty$. To illustrate the utility of $k$-extendible measurements, we establish a semidefinite programming upper bound on the one-shot classical capacity of a channel, which outperforms the best known efficiently computable bound from [Matthews and Wehner, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 60, pp. 7317-7329 (2014)] and also leads to efficiently computable upper bounds on the $n$-shot classical capacity of a channel.</description>
