      <title>Generating functions of $q$-chromatic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and a linear form $\lambda \in \mathbb{Z}_{ &gt; 0 }^V$, Bajo et al. (2025) introduced the $q$-chromatic polynomial $\chi_G^\lambda(q,n) := \sum q^{\sum_{v \in V} \lambda_v c(v)}$ where the sum is over all proper colorings $c: V \to [n] := \{ 1, 2, \dots, n \}$; they showed that $\chi_G^\lambda(q,n)$ is a polynomial in $[n]_q := 1 + q + \dots + q^{ n-1 } $ with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}(q)$. For $d \in \mathbb{Z}_{&gt;0}$ and the linear form given by $(d,d^2,\ldots,d^d)$, we show that the $q$-chromatic polynomial distinguishes labeled graphs with vertex set $[d]$. Using permutation statistics introduced by Chung--Graham (1995), called $G$-statistics, and polyhedral geometry, we give the multivariate integer point transform for the region of proper colorings of a given graph $G$. This integer point transform allows us to find the generating function for the $q$-chromatic polynomial with respect to any linear form. We further specialize these results to the linear form $(1, 1, \dots, 1)$, which allows us to write the $q$-chromatic polynomial in the $q$-binomial basis, clarifying expressions found by Bajo et al. Moreover, we show that $G$-statistics are compatible with the theory of order polytopes used by Bajo et al. and Chow (1999). This yields further properties for the generating function of $q$-chromatic polynomial with linear form $(1, 1, \dots, 1)$, where certain coefficients of the numerator polynomial are palindromic polynomials in $q$.</description>

      <title>Decompositions of graphs with degree constraints relative to prescribed subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite simple undirected graph $G$, let $T_1(G)$ denote the subset of vertices of $G$ such that every vertex of $T_1(G)$ belongs to at least one subgraph isomorphic to a graph obtained by connecting a single vertex to two vertices of $K_4 - e$. Define $T_0(G) = V(G) \setminus T_1(G)$, and let $a,b \colon V(G) \longrightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$ be arbitrary functions. In this paper, we prove that if $d_G(u) \ge a(u) + b(u) + h(u)$, where $h(u) \in \{0,1\}$ for $u \in T_h(G)$, then there exists a partition $(S, T)$ of $V(G)$ such that $d_{S}(u) \ge a(u)$ for every $u \in S$ and $d_{T}(u) \ge b(u)$ for every $u \in T$. This result extends the theorem of Stiebitz~[\textit{J. Graph Theory}, 23 (1996), 321--324]. Moreover, we establish an analogous result in the case where $T_1(G)$ consists of vertices belonging to at least one $K_{2,3}$, thereby extending the findings of Hou et al.~[\textit{Discrete Math.}, 341 (2018), 3288--3295].</description>

      <title>Claw-free bricks that every $b$-invariant edge is solitary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is a brick if it is 3-connected and $G-\{u,v\}$ has a perfect matching for any two distinct vertices $u$ and $v$ of $G$. Lucchesi and Murty proposed a problem concerning the characterization of bricks, distinct from $K_4$, $\overline{C_6}$ and the Petersen graph, in which every $b$-invariant edge is solitary. In this paper, we present a characterization of this problem when the bricks are claw-free.</description>

      <title>Efficient graph similarity assessment method based on vectors of topological indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring similarity between complex objects is a fundamental task in many scientific fields. When objects are represented as graphs, graph similarity/distance measures offer a powerful framework for quantifying structural resemblance. Those comparative measures play a key role in domains such as network science, chemoinformatics, and social network analysis. While methods like graph edit distance and graph kernels are widely used, they can be computationally intensive or fail to capture fine structural variations, since they require graphs without any structural uncertainty. Another class of methods is based on using topological indices to encode structural information of the graphs, followed by the application of distance or similarity measures for real numbers to obtain corresponding graph-level metrics. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of distance/similarity measures which are based on multiple topological indices. Since they are generally computed in polynomial time, our method is computationally efficient in practice. We demonstrate its effectiveness through comparisons and show that it captures subtle structural information meaningfully. Additionally, we explore its applicability in two domains: analyzing random graph models in network theory and assessing molecular similarity among isomers in chemoinformatics. These preliminary results suggest that our approach holds promise for graph comparison across disciplines.</description>

      <title>The maximum sum of sizes of non-empty cross $L$-intersecting families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n$, $r$, and $k$ be positive integers such that $k, r \geq 2$, $L$ a non-empty subset of $[k]$, and $\mathcal{F}_i \subseteq \binom{[n]}{k}$ for $1 \leq i \leq r$. We say that non-empty families $\mathcal{F}_1, \mathcal{F}_2, \ldots, \mathcal{F}_r$ are $r$-cross $L$-intersecting if $\left| \bigcap_{i=1}^r F_i \right| \in L$ for every choice of $F_i \in \mathcal{F}_i$ with $1 \leq i \leq r$. They are called pairwise cross $L$-intersecting if $|A \cap B| \in L$ for all $A \in \mathcal{F}_i$, $B \in \mathcal{F}_j$ with $i \neq j$. If $r=2$, we simply say cross $L$-intersecting instead of $2$-cross $L$-intersecting or pairwise cross $L$-intersecting. In this paper, we determine the maximum possible sum of sizes of non-empty cross $L$-intersecting families $\mathcal{F}_1$ and $\mathcal{F}_2$ for all admissible $n$, $k$, and $L$, and we characterize all the extremal structures. We also establish the maximum value of the sum of sizes of families $\mathcal{F}_1, \dots, \mathcal{F}_r$ that are both pairwise cross $L$-intersecting and $r$-cross $L$-intersecting, provided $n$ is sufficiently large and $L$ satisfies certain conditions. Furthermore, we characterize all such families attaining the maximum total size.</description>

      <title>Congruence families modulo powers of $7$ for $4$-colored generalized Frobenius partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2012, Peter Paule and Cristian-Silviu Radu proved an infinite family of Ramanujan type congruences for $2$-colored Frobenius partitions $c\phi_2$ introduced by George Andrews. Recently, Frank Garvan, James Sellers and Nicolas Smoot showed that this family of congruences is equivalent to the family of congruences for $(2,0)$-colored Frobenius partitions $c\psi_{2,0}$ introduced by Brian Drake and by Yuze Jiang, Larry Rolen and Michael Woodbury for the general case. Motivated by Garvan, Sellers and Smoot's work, Rong Chen and Xiao-Jie Zhu found modular transformations relating the $c\psi_{k,\beta}$ for fixed $k$ and varying $\beta$. As an example, they proved a family of congruences for $c\psi_{3,1/2}$ following Paule and Radu's work and then proved the equivalence between $c\psi_{3,1/2}$ and $c\phi_3=c\psi_{3,3/2}$. In the present paper, we give a new example of Chen and Zhu's framework for $c\psi_{4,\beta}$. Our proof is considerably simpler.</description>

      <title>A structure theorem for rooted connectivity in bidirected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, bidirected graphs have received increasing attention from the graph theory community with both structural and algorithmic results. Bidirected graphs are a generalization of directed graphs, consisting of an undirected graph together with a map assigning each endpoint of every edge either sign $+$ or $-$. The connectivity properties of bidirected graphs are more complex than those of directed graphs and not yet well understood. In this paper, we show a structure theorem about rooted connectivity in bidirected graphs in terms of directed graphs. As applications, we prove Lov\'asz' flame theorem, Pym's theorem and a strong variant of Menger's theorem for a class of bidirected graphs and provide counterexamples in the general case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we construct a Steiner system with the parameters $S(3,6,42)$, settling one of the smallest open parameter sets of Steiner $3$-designs. Furthermore, we establish the existence of rotational Steiner quadruple systems on $46$ and $92$ points.
  Our construction method is based on extending Steiner $2$-designs using prescribed extension groups. We also consider extensions to designs of higher strength. The article includes a table and a discussion of the status of all admissible parameters for Steiner $3$-designs on at most $50$ points.</description>

      <title>Diameter Bounds for Friends-and-Strangers Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider two $n$-vertex graphs $X$ and $Y$, where we interpret $X$ as a social network with edges representing friendships and $Y$ as a movement graph with edges representing adjacent positions. The friends-and-strangers graph $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ is a graph on the $n!$ permutations $V(X)\to V(Y)$, where two configurations are adjacent if and only if one can be obtained from the other by swapping two friends located on adjacent positions.
  Friends-and-strangers graphs were first introduced by Defant and Kravitz, and generalize sliding puzzles as well as token swapping problems. Previous work has largely focused on their connectivity properties. In this paper, we study the diameter of the connected components of $\mathsf{FS}(X, Y)$. Our main result shows that when the underlying friendship graph is a star with $n$ vertices, the friends-and-strangers graph has components of diameter $O(n^4)$. This implies, in particular, that sliding puzzles are always solvable in polynomially many moves. Our work also provides explicit efficient algorithms for finding these solutions.
  We then extend our results to general graphs in two ways. First, we show that the diameter is polynomially bounded when both the friendship and the movement graphs have large minimum degree. Second, when both the underlying graphs $X$ and $Y$ are Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graphs, we show that the distance between any pair of configurations is almost always polynomially bounded under certain conditions on the edge probabilities.</description>

      <title>On the multiplicity of matching polynomial roots and $\theta$-critical graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The matching polynomial of a graph encodes rich combinatorial information through its roots. We determine the maximum multiplicity of a non-zero matching polynomial root and characterize all graphs attaining the bound. We also generalize the result to any fixed $\theta$, where the graphs attaining the bound are related to $\theta$-critical graphs. Inspired by these graphs, we give a constructive answer to Godsil's question. Finally, we show the existence of $1$-critical tree of order $n$ for all $n\ge 9$ and $1$-critical graph of order $n$ for all $n\ge 5$, and describe a method to construct $1$-critical graphs from existing ones.</description>

      <title>Balanced player arrangement in rotating court games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a game involving a team with $n$ players, $k$ of which wear shirts marked with a letter $A$, while the others with a letter $B$, and such that only $s$ people play, while the remaining $n-s$ wait outside the court. At certain times the players rotate, and one player enters the court while another one leaves, each player keeping the same neighbors at all times. The house rules want at least $t$ players wearing a shirt with the letter $A$ in the court at each rotation. We show that this can be achieved if and only if $nt\leq ks$. We use classical work on balanced words dating back to Christoffel and Smith.</description>

      <title>Ramsey sequences with bounded clique size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sequence of graphs $ \{G_k\} $ is a Ramsey sequence if for every positive integer $ k $, the graph $ G_k $ is a proper subgraph of $ G_{k+1} $, and there exists an integer $n &gt; k$ such that every red-blue coloring of $ G_n $ contains a monochromatic copy of $ G_k $. Among the wide range of open problems in Ramsey theory, an interesting open question is ``Does there exist an ascending sequence $\{G_k\}$ with $\lim_{k \to \infty} \chi(G_k) = \infty$ and $\lim_{k \to \infty} \omega(G_k) \neq \infty$ that is a Ramsey sequence?". In this paper, we solve this problem by constructing a Ramsey sequence $\{G_k\}$ with a bounded clique number such that $\lim_{k \to \infty} \chi(G_k) = \infty$. Furthermore, using the observation that any monotonic increasing sequence of graphs that contains a Ramsey sequence as a subgraph is also Ramsey, we can generate infinitely many Ramsey sequences using this example.</description>

      <title>An Ohba-like Result for Flexible List Coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromatic-choosablility is a notion of fundamental importance in list coloring. A graph $G$ is chromatic-choosable when its chromatic number, $\chi(G)$, is equal to its list chromatic number $\chi_{\ell}(G)$. Flexible list coloring was introduced by Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k, Norin, and Postle in 2019 in order to address a situation in list coloring where we still seek a proper list coloring, but each vertex may have a preferred color assigned to it, and for those vertices we wish to color as many of them with their preferred colors as possible. In flexible list coloring, the list flexibility number of $G$, denoted $\chi_{\ell flex}(G)$, serves as the natural analogue of $\chi_{\ell}(G)$. In 2002, Ohba famously showed that for any graph $G$, there exists an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\chi(K_p \vee G) = \chi_{\ell}(K_p \vee G)$ whenever $p \geq N$. Since $\chi(G) \leq \chi_{\ell}(G) \leq \chi_{\ell flex}(G)$, it is natural to ask whether this result holds if $\chi_{\ell}$ is replaced with $\chi_{\ell flex}$. In this paper we not only show that this result doesn't hold in general if $\chi_{\ell}$ is replaced with $\chi_{\ell flex}$, but we also give a characterization of the graphs for which it does hold.</description>

Abstract: In a recent paper (2024) M. Buratti and M.E:Muzychuck have established some lower bounds on the number of non isomorphic cyclic Steiner Triple Systems of order $v\equiv 1$ (mod $6$). We complete their result to the case $v\equiv 3$ (mod $6$). For each odd $k &gt; 3$ we also find lower bounds for the number of non isomorphic cyclic $k$-cycle systems of a complete graph.</description>

      <title>Generalized additive bases and difference bases for Cartesian product of finite abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite group $G$ and positive integer $g$, a $g$-additive basis is a subset of $G$ whose pairwise sums cover each element of $G$ at least $g$ times, with $g$-difference bases defined similarly using pairwise differences. While prior work focused on $1$-additive and $1$-difference bases, recent works of Kravitz and Schmutz--Tait explored $g$-additive and $g$-difference bases in finite abelian groups. This paper investigates such bases in $G^n$, the Cartesian product of a finite abelian group $G$. We construct $g$-additive and $g$-difference bases in $G^n$, which lead to asymptotically sharp upper bounds on the minimal sizes of such bases. Our proofs draw on ideas from additive combinatorics and combinatorial design theory.</description>

      <title>The nonsymmetric shuffle theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shuffle conjecture of Haglund et al. expresses the symmetric function $\nabla e_n$ as a sum over labeled Dyck paths. Here $\nabla$ is an operator on symmetric functions defined in terms of its diagonal action on the basis of modified Macdonald polynomials. The shuffle conjecture was later refined by Haglund-Morse-Zabrocki to the compositional shuffle conjecture, expressing $\nabla C_\alpha$ as a sum over labeled Dyck paths with touchpoints specified by $\alpha$, where $C_\alpha$ is a compositional Hall-Littlewood polynomial. Carlsson-Mellit settled both versions by developing the theory of a variant of the DAHA called the double Dyck path algebra.
  In a recent paper, we discovered a notion of nonsymmetric plethsym which led us to a construction of modified nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials $\mathsf{H}_{\eta|\lambda}(\mathbf{x};q,t)$. These polynomials Weyl symmetrize to their symmetric counterparts and are conjecturally atom positive. Here we introduce a nonsymmetric version $\boldsymbol{\nabla}$ of $\nabla$, now acting diagonally on the basis given by the functions $\mathsf{H}_{\eta|\lambda}(\mathbf{x};q,t)$. Weaving together our theory with results of Carlsson-Mellit and Mellit, we establish a nonsymmetric version of the compositional shuffle theorem, which equates $\boldsymbol{\nabla}^{-1}$ applied to a nonsymmetric version $\mathsf{C}_\alpha$ of $C_\alpha$ with a sum over flagged labeled Dyck paths with touchpoints given by $\alpha$. This combinatorial sum is conjecturally atom positive, refining the known Schur positivity of its symmetric counterpart.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resonance varieties, the holonomy Lie algebra, and the holonomy Chen Lie algebra associated with the Orlik-Solomon algebra of a matroid provide an algebraic lens through which to examine the rich combinatorial structure of matroids and their geometric realizations as complex hyperplane arrangements. In this survey paper, we emphasize the commonalities between these objects but also the possible ways in which realizable and non-realizable matroids differ, leading to some open questions.</description>

      <title>Edge inducibility via local directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the edge inducibility problem. This is a common refinement of both the well known Kruskal--Katona theorem and the inducibility question introduced by Pippenger and Golumbic.
  Our first result is a hardness result. It shows that for any graph $G$, there is a related graph $G'$ whose edge inducibility determines the vertex inducibility of $G$. Moreover, we determine the edge inducibility of every $G$ with at most $4$ vertices, and make some progress on the cases $G=C_5,P_6$. Lastly, we extend our hardness result to graphs with a perfect matching that is the unique fractional perfect matching. This is done by introducing locally directed graphs, which are natural generalizations of directed graphs.</description>

      <title>Sequence Reconstruction Problem for Ternary Deletion Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sequence reconstruction problem was proposed by Levenshtein in 2001. In this model, a sequence from a code is transmitted over several channels, and the decoder receives the distinct outputs from each channel. The main problem is to determine the minimum number of channels required to reconstruct the transmitted sequence. In the combinatorial context, the sequence reconstruction problem is equivalent to finding the value of $N_q(n,d,t)$, defined as the size of the largest intersection of two metric balls of radius $t$, where the distance between their centers is at least $d$ and the sequences are $q$-ary sequences of the length $n$. Levenshtein first discussed this problem in the uncoded sequence setting and determined the value of $N_q(n,1,t)$ for any $n\geqslant t$. Moreover, Gabrys and Yaakobi studied this problem in the context of binary one-deletion-correcting codes and determined the value of $N_2(n,2,t)$ for $t\geqslant 2$.
  In this paper we study this problem for $3$-ary sequences of length $n$ over the deletion channel, where the transmitted sequence belongs to a one-deletion-correcting code and there are $t$ deletions in every channel. Specifically, we determine $N_3(n,2,t)$ for $t\geqslant 2$.</description>

      <title>Representation Theoretic Bases for the $\Delta$-Springer Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a descent monomial basis of $\Delta$-Springer modules $R_{n,\lambda,s}$, first defined by Griffin. Our construction simultaneously generalizes the descent basis for the Garsia-Procesi module $R_\lambda$ studied by Carlsson-Chou and Hanada, as well as the descent basis for the generalized coinvariant algebras $R_{n,k}$ studied by Haglund-Rhoades-Shimozono. This basis is deeply connected with a combinatorial object called battery-powered tableaux, introduced by Gillespie-Griffin. We highlight the representation theoretic properties of this monomial basis by using it to give a direct combinatorial proof of the graded Frobenius character of $R_{n,\lambda,s}$ in terms of battery-powered tableaux, a fact which has only the geometric proof of Gillespie-Griffin.
  We also conjecture a higher Specht basis of $R_{n,\lambda,s}$, generalizing the higher Specht basis of the coinvariant ring defined in Ariki-Terasoma-Yamada. This construction coincides with the Gillespie-Rhoades higher Specht basis for $R_{n,k}$. We give a proof for when $\lambda = (\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$ is a partition of two rows.</description>

      <title>Spectral Tur\'an-type problems for the $\alpha$-spectral radius of hypergraphs with degree stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $r$-pattern $P$ is defined as an ordered pair $P=([l],E)$, where $l$ is a positive integer and $E$ is a set of $r$-multisets with elements from $[l]$. An $r$-graph $H$ is said to be $P$-colorable if there is a homomorphism $\phi$: $V(H)\rightarrow [l]$ such that the $r$-multiset $\{\phi(v_{1}),\ldots,\phi(v_{r})\}$ is in $E$ for every edge $\{v_{1},\ldots,v_{r}\}\in E(H)$. Let $Col(P)$ denote the family of all $P$-colorable $r$-graphs. This paper establishes spectral extremal results for $\alpha$-spectral radius of hypergraphs using analytic techniques. We show that for any family $\mathcal{F}$ of $r$-graphs
  that is degree-stable with respect to $Col(P)$, spectral
  Tur\'an-type problems can be effectively reduced to spectral extremal problems within $Col(P)$. As an application, we determine the maximum $\alpha$-spectral radius ($\alpha\geq1$) among all $n$-vertex $F^{(r)}$-free $r$-graphs, where $F^{(r)}$ represents the $r$-expansion of the color critical graph $F$. We also characterize the corresponding extremal hypergraphs. Furthermore, leveraging the spectral method, we derive a corresponding edge Tur\'an extremal result. More precisely, we show that if $\mathcal{F}$ is degree-stable with respect to $Col(P)$, then every $\mathcal{F}$-free edge extremal hypergraph must be a $P$-colorable hypergraph.</description>

      <title>Delsarte duality on subspaces and applications to rank-metric codes and q-matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay between the lattice of F_{q^m}-subspaces and the lattice of F_{q^m}-subspaces of an F_{q^m}-vector space. Introducing notions of weight and defect relative to an F_q-subspace, we analyze the sequence of maximum non-zero defects. We establish a correspondence between subspaces of positive defect and their Delsarte duals, enabling explicit characterizations of the associated sequences of maximum non-zero defects. Our framework unifies several classes of subspaces studied in finite geometry and connects them to linear rank-metric codes by providing a new geometric interpretation of code duality. Building on these results, we characterize classes of rank-metric codes closed under duality, including MRD, near MRD, quasi-MRD, and a new family of (n, k)-MRD codes. Finally, we explore applications to q-matroids, by studying the problem of F_{q^m}-representability for direct sums of uniform q-matroids and describing their rank generating functions.</description>

      <title>Advances in the Shannon Capacity of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies several research directions concerning the Shannon capacity of graphs. Building on Schrijver's recent framework, we establish sufficient conditions under which the Shannon capacity of a polynomial in graphs equals the corresponding polynomial of the individual capacities, thereby simplifying their evaluation. We derive exact values and new bounds for the Shannon capacity of two families of graphs: the q-Kneser graphs and the Tadpole graphs. Furthermore, we construct graphs whose Shannon capacity is never attained by the independence number of any finite power of these graphs, including a countably infinite family of connected graphs with this property. We further prove an inequality relating the Shannon capacities of the strong product of graphs and their disjoint union, leading to streamlined proofs of known bounds.</description>

      <title>Discrete flat disks: rigid quadrangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by a question of Ferrari in the physics context of JT gravity, we introduce and enumerate a combinatorial family of quadrangulations of the disk, called rigid quadrangulations. These form a subclass of the flat quadrangulations in the sense that every inner vertex has degree 4, and therefore it can be viewed as a discrete model of flat metrics on the disk. Our main result is a bijection between rigid quadrangulations and certain colorful integer-labeled quadrangulations of the sphere, together with a dictionary relating a variety of natural statistics on both sides. Adaptions of the bijection to various boundary conditions allow us to import recent enumerative results for colorful quadrangulation obtained by Bousquet-M\'elou and Elvey Price. We discuss some consequences of the enumeration of rigid quadrangulations for a flat version of JT gravity at finite cutoff, and comment on potential scaling limits.</description>

      <title>A tree bijection for rigid quadrangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the counting problem of rigid quadrangulations, recently introduced by Budd and proven to be in bijection with colorful quadrangulations. The generating function for the latter has been derived in an algebraic manner by Bousquet-M\'elou and Elvey Price, which therefore also counts rigid quadrangulations. In this paper we will provide a direct, bijective proof, for this generating function. We will relate the rigid quadrangulations to some naturally appearing trees, decorated with certain natural data. By some slight bijective manipulation of the data, we get a decorated tree, for which the generating function can be found. This result opens the door to better understand the geometry of random rigid quadrangulations (and maybe even of random colorful quadrangulations), by studying the corresponding decorated trees. These properties are relevant the formulation of UV complete JT-gravity, following the work of Ferrari.</description>

      <title>There are siblings of $\chi$ which are permutations for $n$ even</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $1$ be the all-one vector and $\odot$ denote the component-wise multiplication of two vectors in $\mathbb F_2^n$. We study the vector space $\Gamma_n$ over $\mathbb F_2$ generated by the functions $\gamma_{2k}:\mathbb F_2^n \to \mathbb F_2^n, k\geq 0$, where $$ \gamma_{2k} = S^{2k}\odot(1+S^{2k-1})\odot(1+S^{2k-3})\odot\ldots\odot(1+S) $$ and $S:\mathbb F_2^n\to\mathbb F_2^n$ is the cyclic left shift function. The functions in $\Gamma_n$ are shift-invariant and the well known $\chi$ function used in several cryptographic primitives is contained in $\Gamma_n$. For even $n$, we show that the permutations from $\Gamma_n$ with respect to composition form an Abelian group, which is isomorphic to the unit group of the residue ring $\mathbb F_2[X]/(X^n +X^{n/2})$. This isomorphism yields an efficient theoretic and algorithmic method for constructing and studying a rich family of shift-invariant permutations on $\mathbb F_2^n$ which are natural generalizations of $\chi$. To demonstrate it, we apply the obtained results to investigate the function $\gamma_0 +\gamma_2+\gamma_4$ on $\mathbb F_2^n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first three papers, we conducted a series of discussions on the statistics of strict partitions and Rogers-Ramanujan partitions, specifically the sequences of odd length (denoted as $\mathrm{sol}$) and its extensions. We established bijections for some Rogers-Ramanujan type identities. This paper will continue that series of work, and first we will use the bijective method to re-establish several parameterized Rogers-Ramanujan type identities, which appeared in the recent work of Hao-Kuai-Xia and Li-Wang. Moreover, we focus on the work of Chen-Yin and parameterize their main results, where the $\mathrm{sol}$ has evolved.</description>

      <title>Totally positive Toeplitz matrices: classical and modern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By a theorem of Edrei, an infinite, normalised totally nonnegative upper-triangular Toeplitz matrices is determined by a pair of nonnegative parameter sequences, the `Schoenberg parameters', where nonzero parameters correspond to the roots and poles of a naturally associated generating function. These totally nonnegative Toeplitz matrices and their parameters also arise in the classification of characters of the infinite symmetric group by later work of Thoma. Moreover the Schoenberg parameters have an asymptotic interpretation in terms of irreducible representations of S_n and their Young diagrams by Vershik-Kerov. In this article we consider infinite totally positive Toeplitz matrices as limits of finite ones, and we obtain two further asymptotic descriptions of the Schoenberg parameters that are now related to quantum cohomology of the flag variety as n goes to infinity. One is related to asymptotics of normalised quantum parameters, and the other to asymptotics of the Chern classes of the tautological line bundles. We also describe the asymptotics of (quantum) Schubert classes in terms of the Schoenberg parameters. Our limit formulas relate to and were motivated by a tropical analogue of this theory that we survey. In the tropical setting one finds an asymptotic relationship between the `tropical Schoenberg parameters' and the weight map from Lusztig's parametrisation of the canonical basis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The service rate region of a coded distributed storage system is the set of all achievable data access requests under the capacity constraints. This paper investigates the service rate regions of systematic Hamming codes using hypergraph theory and derives bounds for the maximal achievable service rate of individual data objects. We establish upper bounds on the sum of service rates of data symbols indexed by a subset of systematic nodes in a systematic binary Hamming code, and explore the achievability of these bounds. Additionally, for non-systematic binary Hamming codes, we conclude that the aggregate service rate is limited by the number of columns of odd weight in the associated generator matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the central problems in additive combinatorics is to determine how large a subset of the first $N$ integers can be before it is forced to contain $k$ elements forming an arithmetic progression. Around 25 years ago, Gowers proved the first reasonable upper bounds in this problem for progressions of length four and longer. In this work, Gowers initiated the study of "higher-order Fourier analysis", which has developed over the past couple of decades into a rich theory with numerous other combinatorial applications. I will report on some very recent progress in higher-order Fourier analysis and how it has led to the first ever quantitative improvement on Gowers's upper bounds when $k\geq 5$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the number of distance queries needed to identify certain properties of a hidden tree $T$ on $n$ vertices. A distance query consists of two vertices $x,y$, and the answer is the distance of $x$ and $y$ in $T$. We determine the number of queries an optimal adaptive algorithm needs to find two vertices of maximal distance up to an additive constant, and the number of queries needed to identify the hidden tree asymptotically. We also study the non-adaptive versions of these problems, determining the number of queries needed exactly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that if a tile in $\mathbb Z^d$ has prime size $p$, then it must be spectral. The proof is by contradiction, it is simply shown that the tiling complement of such a tile can not annihilate all $p$-subgroups. In addition, with a simple transformation we prove that any $p$ points in general linear positions in $\mathbb Z^d$ must be both tiling and spectral if $d\ge p-1$.</description>

      <title>A counterexample to an isomorphism problem for power monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a (multiplicatively written) monoid. The family $\mathcal{P}_{\text{fin},1}(H)$ of finite subsets of $H$ containing the identity element is itself a monoid when endowed with setwise multiplication induced by $H$. Tringali and Yan proved that two monoids $H_1$ and $H_2$ contained in a special class of commutative, cancellative monoids are isomorphic if and only if $\mathcal{P}_{\text{fin},1}(H_1)$ and $\mathcal{P}_{\text{fin},1}(H_2)$ are. Moreover, they raised the question whether the same holds in the general setting of cancellative monoids. We show that if $H_1$ and $H_2$ are (commutative) valuation monoids with trivial unit groups and isomorphic quotient groups, then $\mathcal{P}_{\text{fin},1}(H_1)\simeq\mathcal{P}_{\text{fin},1}(H_2)$. This provides a negative answer to Tringali and Yans question already within the class of valuation submonoids of the additive group $\mathbb{Z}^2$.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Hyperplane Rounding for Max-Cut and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm over Certain Regular Graph Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a strong interest in finding challenging instances of NP-hard problems, from the perspective of showing quantum advantage. Due to the limits of near-term NISQ devices, it is moreover useful if these instances are small. In this work, we identify two graph families ($|V|&lt;1000$) on which the Goemans-Williamson algorithm for approximating the Max-Cut achieves at most a 0.912-approximation. We further show that, in comparison, a recent quantum algorithm, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (depth $p=1$), is a 0.592-approximation on Karloff instances in the limit ($n \to \infty$), and is at best a $0.894$-approximation on a family of strongly-regular graphs. We further explore construction of challenging instances computationally by perturbing edge weights, which may be of independent interest, and include these in the CI-QuBe github repository.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide explicit formulas for computing the motivic Chern and Hirzebruch classes of degeneracy loci, especially those coming from the symplectic and odd orthogonal Grassmannians. The Chern--Schwartz--MacPherson classes, K-theory classes, and Cappell--Shaneson L-classes arise as specializations of the motivic Chern and Hirzebruch classes. Our result is the analogue of the result of Anderson--Chen--Tarasca for the degeneracy loci from the ordinary Grassmannians. As applications, we obtain the motivic Chern and Hirzebruch classes of orthogonal and symplectic orbit closures in flag varieties.</description>

      <title>A family of non-uniform distributions on the set of parking functions generated by random permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a rather natural family of non-uniform distributions on $PF_n$, $n\in\mathbb{N}$, the set of parking functions of length $n$. One of the motivations for this comes from a similar situation in the context of integer partitions. For a permutation $\sigma\in S_n$ and for $j\in[n]$, let $I_{n,&lt;j}(\sigma)$ denote the number of inversions in $\sigma$ that involve the number $j$ and a number less than $j$. Let $\tilde I_{n,&lt;j}(\sigma)=I_{n,&lt;j}(\sigma)+1$. The map $(\sigma,\tau)\to\left(\tilde I_{n,&lt;\tau_1}(\sigma),\cdots, \tilde I_{n,&lt; \tau_n}(\sigma)\right)$ maps $S_n\times S_n$ onto $PF_n$. Consider the family of distributions $P_n^{(q)}\times P_n$, $q\in(0,\infty)$, on $S_n\times S_n$, where $P_n$ is the uniform distribution on $S_n$ and $P_n^{(q)}$ is the Mallows distribution with parameter $q$ on $S_n$. The Mallows distributions are defined by exponential tilting via the inversion statistic. For each $q&gt;0$, the above map along with the distribution $P_n^{(q)}\times P_n$ induces an exchangeable distribution $\mathcal{P}_n^{(q)}$ on $PF_n$. We study the asymptotic behavior of two fundamental statistics of parking functions under the family of distributions $\mathcal{P}_n^{(q)}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given infinite cardinals $\theta\leq \kappa$, we ask for the minimal VC-dimension of a cofinal family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq[\kappa]^{&lt;\theta}$. We show that for $\theta=\omega$ and $\kappa=\aleph_n$ it is consistent with ZFC that there exists such a family of VC-dimension $n+1$, which is known to be the lower bound. For $\theta&gt;\omega$ we answer this question completely, demonstrating a strong dichotomy between the case of singular and regular $\theta$. We furthermore answer some relative and generalized versions of the above question for singular $\theta$, and answer a related question which appears in \cite{BBNKS}.</description>

Abstract: Answering a question of Michael Bleicher and Paul Erd\H{o}s, we show that there exists a lacunary sequence of positive integers such that finite sums of reciprocals of its terms attain all rational numbers from a non-empty open interval. We also study several stronger variants of their original problem: determining the value of the optimal lacunarity parameter, representing rationals infinitely many times, finding such lacunary sequences with arbitrarily large jumps, and relating the maximal length of a filled interval to a prescribed lacunarity parameter.</description>

      <title>Exact structures and maximal canonically Jordan recoverable subcategories for modules over type $A$ algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On one hand, exact structures were introduced by D. Quillen in the '70s. They can be defined as collections of short exact sequences in a fixed abelian category satisfying additional properties.
  On the other hand, in a recent work, A. Garver, R. Patrias, and H. Thomas introduced Jordan recoverability. Given a bounded quiver $(Q,R)$, a full additive subcategory of $\operatorname{rep}(Q,R)$ is said to be Jordan recoverable if any $X \in \mathscr{C}$ can be recovered, up to isomorphism, from the Jordan form of its generic nilpotent endomorphisms. Such a subcategory $\mathscr{C}$ is said to be canonically Jordan recoverable if, moreover, there exists a precise algebraic procedure that allows one to get back $X \in \mathscr{C}$ from that same Jordan form data.
  We introduce a new family of operators, called Gen-Sub operators $\operatorname{GS}_\mathcal{E}$, parametrized by the exact structures $\mathcal{E}$ of abelian categories. After showing some properties of those operators in hereditary abelian categories, by focusing on the setting of modules over type $A$ quivers endowed with the diamond exact structure $\mathcal{E}_\diamond$, we establish that the maximal canonically Jordan recoverable subcategories are precisely of the form $\operatorname{GS}_{\mathcal{E}_\diamond}(T)$ for some tilting object $T$.</description>

      <title>Dold-Gauss Congruences, Norm Descent, and Rational Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Witt--Hadamard calculus for Euler products that unifies the classical Gauss congruences with their modern refinement, the Dold congruences. Within this framework we prove \emph{norm descent}: Dold congruences are functorial under finite extensions and preserved by prime--ideal norms $N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}$, yielding integer ghosts from algebraic ones. We extend the theory from $\mathbb{Z}$ to Dedekind domains, and show that integrality is stable under both Hadamard and Witt products. Two rigidity theorems lie at the core: a \emph{cyclotomic residues theorem}, asserting that if the logarithmic derivative has only cyclotomic poles then integrality forces rationality; and a stronger \emph{Dold$^{+}$ rigidity theorem}, showing that any algebraic series satisfying refined Dold congruences is necessarily rational. These results sharpen the Gauss--Dold picture: ordinary congruences enforce integrality, while the strengthened form collapses algebraic cases to rational ones. Applications include prime--ideal ladders in number fields and exact product laws for dynamical zeta functions, illustrated for subshifts of finite type and circle doubling.</description>

      <title>The Popular Dimension of Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study popular matchings in three classical settings: the house allocation problem, the marriage problem, and the roommates problem. In the popular matching problem, (a subset of) the vertices in a graph have preference orderings over their potential matches. A matching is popular if it gets a plurality of votes in a pairwise election against any other matching. Unfortunately, popular matchings typically do not exist. So we study a natural relaxation, namely popular winning sets which are a set of matchings that collectively get a plurality of votes in a pairwise election against any other matching. The $\textit{popular dimension}$ is the minimum cardinality of a popular winning set, in the worst case over the problem class.
  We prove that the popular dimension is exactly $2$ in the house allocation problem, even if the voters are weighted and ties are allowed in their preference lists. For the marriage problem and the roommates problem, we prove that the popular dimension is between $2$ and $3$, when the agents are weighted and/or their preferences orderings allow ties. In the special case where the agents are unweighted and have strict preference orderings, the popular dimension of the marriage problem is known to be exactly $1$ and we prove the popular dimension of the roommates problem is exactly $2$.</description>

Abstract: The hat guessing number is a graph invariant based on a hat guessing game introduced by Winkler. Using a new vertex decomposition argument involving an edge density theorem of Erd\H{o}s for hypergraphs, we show that the hat guessing number of all outerplanar graphs is less than $2^{125000}$. We also define the class of layered planar graphs, which contains outerplanar graphs, and we show that every layered planar graph has bounded hat guessing number.</description>

      <title>Dimension identities, almost self-conjugate partitions, and BGG complexes for Hermitian symmetric pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An almost self-conjugate (ASC) partition has a Young diagram in which each arm along the diagonal is exactly one box longer than its corresponding leg. Classically, the ASC partitions and their conjugates appear in two of Littlewood's symmetric function identities. These identities can be viewed as Euler characteristics of BGG complexes of the trivial representation, for classical Hermitian symmetric pairs. In this paper, we consider partitions in which the arm-leg difference is an arbitrary constant $m$. By viewing these partitions as highest weights, we establish an infinite family of dimension identities between $\mathfrak{gl}_n$- and $\mathfrak{gl}_{n+m}$-modules. We then interpret this result in the context of blocks in parabolic category $\mathcal{O}$: in particular, we exhibit six infinite families of congruent blocks whose corresponding posets of highest weights consist of the partitions in question. These posets, in turn, lead to generalizations of the Littlewood identities and their corresponding BGG complexes. Our results in this paper shed light on the surprising combinatorics underlying the work of Enright and Willenbring (2004).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06283v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A subset $S$ of an abelian group $G$ is called $3$-$\mathrm{AP}$ free if it does not contain a three term arithmetic progression. Moreover, $S$ is called complete $3$-$\mathrm{AP}$ free, if it is maximal w.r.t. set inclusion. One of the most central problems in additive combinatorics is to determine the maximal size of a $3$-$\mathrm{AP}$ free set, which is necessarily complete. In this paper we are interested in the minimum size of complete $3$-$\mathrm{AP}$ free sets. We define and study saturation w.r.t. $3$-$\mathrm{AP}$s and present constructions of small complete $3$-$\mathrm{AP}$ free sets and $3$-$\mathrm{AP}$ saturating sets for several families of vector spaces and cyclic groups.</description>

      <title>Lattice Points and Rational $q$-Catalan Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each pair of coprime integers $a$ and $b$ we have a rational $q$-Catalan number $\operatorname{Cat}(a,b)_q=\binom{a+b}{a}_q/[a+b]_q$. It is known that this is a polynomial in $q$ with nonnegative integer coefficients, but the nature of these coefficients is still mysterious. Our current understanding is based on the rational shuffle conjecture that was conjectured by Bergeron, Garsia, Leven and Xin in 2014 and proved by Mellit in 2016, based on earlier work with Carlsson. This theorem realizes $\operatorname{Cat}(a,b)_q$ as the generating function for the statistic "area $-\ \mathrm{dinv}+\frac{(a-1)(b-1)}{2}$" defined on rational Dyck paths. However, this statistic is difficult to work with and leaves some phenomena unexplained. For example, it does not prove the conjecture that the difference $\operatorname{Cat}(a,c)_q-\operatorname{Cat}(a,b)_q$ has nonnegative coefficients whenever $\gcd(a,b)=\gcd(a,c)=1$ and $b&lt;c$. The current paper proposes to look at lattice points instead of Dyck paths. Our idea is to fix $a$ and express everything in terms of the weight lattice $\mathrm{L}$ and root lattice $\mathrm{R}$ of type $A_{a-1}$. Based on ideas of Paul Johnson, we conjecture the existence of certain "Johnson statistics" $J:\mathrm{R}\to\mathbb{Z}$ and we prove this conjecture for $a\le 20$. We show that these statistics satisfy many remarkable properties including a $q$-analogue of Brion's theorem for simplices.</description>

      <title>Paintability of $r$-chromatic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11888v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The online list coloring game is a two-player graph-coloring game played on a graph $G$ as follows. On each turn, a Lister reveals a new color $c$ at some subset $S \subseteq V(G)$ of uncolored vertices, and then a Painter chooses an independent subset of $S$ to which to assign $c$. As the game is played, the revealed colors at each vertex $v \in V(G)$ form a color set $L(v)$, often called a list. The paintability of $G$ measures the minimum value $k$ for which Painter has a strategy to complete a coloring of $G$ in such a way that $|L(v)| \leq k$ for each vertex $v \in V(G)$. The paintability of a graph is an upper bound for its list chromatic number, or choosability.
  The online list coloring game is a special case of the DP-painting game, which is defined similarly using the setting of DP-coloring. In the DP-painting game, the Lister reveals correspondence covers of a graph $G$ rather than colors, and the Painter chooses independent subsets of these covers. The DP-painting game has a parameter known as DP-paintability which is analogous to paintability.
  In this paper, we consider upper bounds for the paintability and DP-paintability of a graph $G$ with large maximum degree $\Delta$ and chromatic number at most some fixed value $r$. We prove that the paintability of $G$ is at most $\left(1 - \frac{1}{4r+1} \right ) \Delta + 2$ and that the DP-paintability of $G$ is at most $\Delta - \Omega( \sqrt{\Delta \log \Delta})$. We prove our first upper bound using Alon-Tarsi orientations, and we prove our second upper bound by considering the strict type-$3$ degeneracy parameter recently introduced by Zhou, Zhu, and Zhu.</description>

      <title>A classification of $1$-homogeneous distance-regular graphs with positive intersection number $a_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a graph with diameter at least two. Then $\Gamma$ is said to be $1$-homogeneous (in the sense of Nomura) whenever for every pair of adjacent vertices $x$ and $y$ in $\Gamma$, the distance partition of the vertex set of $\Gamma$ with respect to both $x$ and $y$ is equitable, and the parameters corresponding to equitable partitions are independent of the choice of $x$ and $y$. Assume that $\Gamma$ is $1$-homogeneous distance-regular with intersection number $a_1&gt;0$ and diameter $D\geqslant 5$. Define $b=b_1/(\theta_1+1)$, where $b_1$ is the intersection number and $\theta_1$ is the second largest eigenvalue of $\Gamma$. We show that if intersection number $c_2$ is at least $2$, then $b\geqslant 1$ and one of the following (i)--(vi) holds: (i) $\Gamma$ is a regular near $2D$-gon, (ii) $\Gamma$ is a Johnson graph $J(2D,D)$, (iii) $\Gamma$ is a halved $\ell$-cube with $\ell \in \{2D,2D+1\}$, (iv) $\Gamma$ is a folded Johnson graph $\bar{J}(4D,2D)$, (v) $\Gamma$ is a folded halved $(4D)$-cube, (vi) the valency of $\Gamma$ is bounded by a function of $b$. Using this result, we characterize $1$-homogeneous graphs with classical parameters and $a_1&gt;0$, as well as tight distance-regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Strong Bounds for Skew-Corner-Free Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to matrix multiplication algorithms, Pratt asked (ITCS'24) how large a subset of $[n] \times [n]$ could be without containing a skew-corner: three points $(x,y), (x,y+h),(x+h,y')$ with $h \ne 0$. We prove any skew corner-free set has size at most $\exp(-\Omega(\log^{1/12} n))\cdot n^2$, nearly matching the best known lower bound of $\exp(-O(\sqrt{\log n}))\cdot n^2$ by Beker (arXiv'24). Our techniques generalize those of Kelley and Meka's recent breakthrough on three-term arithmetic progression (FOCS'23), answering a question of Beker (arXiv'24). We note that a similar bound was obtained concurrently and independently by Mili\'cevi\'c (arXiv'24).</description>

      <title>TAR reconfiguration for vertex set parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper surveys results about token addition and removal (TAR) reconfiguration for several well-known vertex set parameters including domination, power domination, standard zero forcing, and PSD zero forcing. We also expand the range of parameters to which universal $X$-set TAR graph results apply, for $X$-sets and their TAR graphs introduced in [B. Bjorkman, C. Bozeman, D. Ferrero, M. Flagg, C. Grood, L. Hogben, B. Jacob, C. Reinhart, Power domination reconfiguration, arXiv:2201.01798] and [N.H. Bong, J. Carlson, B. Curtis, R. Haas, L. Hogben, Isomorphisms and properties of TAR reconfiguration graphs for zero forcing and other $X$-set parameters, \emph{Graphs Combin.} {39} (2023), Paper No. 86]. Here we examine which of the $X$-set axioms are needed for which results. The main results apply to skew zero forcing and vertex covering, and results about TAR reconfiguration graphs of these parameters are presented. While $X$-sets are defined for parameters that take the minimum cardinality over the $X$-sets of a graph, and $X$-set results are restricted to such minimizing parameters, our expansion of the universal perspective allows these results to be applied to parameters that take the maximum value among relevant sets, called $Y$-sets. Maximizing parameters to which the main results apply include independence number, (upper) irredundance number, and (upper) zero forcing irredundance number, and failed zero forcing number; TAR reconfiguration results are presented for these parameters. We also show that the equivalence of connectedness in certain token jumping reconfiguration graphs and certain TAR reconfiguration graphs for independent sets established in [M. Kami\'nski, P. Medvedev, M. Milani\v c. Complexity of independent set reconfiguration problems. {\em J. Theoretical Computer Science} 439 (2012), 9--15.] extends to $X$-set and $Y$-set parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If taken seriously, the advice in the title leads to interesting combinatorics. Consider $N$ people moving between $M$ rooms as follows: at each step, simultaneously, the smartest person in each room moves to a different room of their choice, while no one else moves. The process repeats. In this paper we determine which configurations are reachable, from which other configurations, and provide bounds on the number of moves. Namely, let $G(N,M)$ be the directed graph with vertices representing all $M^N$ configurations and edges representing possible moves. We prove that the graph $G(N,M)$ is weakly connected, and that it is strongly connected if and only if $M\geq N+1$ (one extra room for maneuvering is both required and sufficient). For $M\leq N$, we show that the graph has a giant strongly connected component with $\Theta(M^N)$ vertices and diameter $\mathcal O(N^2)$.</description>

      <title>A Study On The Graph Formulation Of Union Closed Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Union Closed Conjecture is one of the most renowned problems in Combinatorics. Its appeal lies in the simplicity of its statement contrasted with the potential complexity of its resolution. The conjecture posits that, in any union-closed family of sets, there exists at least one element that appears in at least half of the sets within the family.
  We establish the graph-theoretic version of certain set-theoretic results by connecting the set-based and graph-based formulations. We then prove a theorem in which we investigate the conjecture for graphs, focusing on their decompositions and the position of certain pendant vertices. As a result, we extend the validity of the conjecture to a broader class of graph structures.</description>

      <title>Interaction graphs of isomorphic automata networks II: universal dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An automata network with $n$ components over a finite alphabet $Q$ of size $q$ is a discrete dynamical system described by the successive iterations of a function $f:Q^n\to Q^n$. In most applications, the main parameter is the interaction graph of $f$: the digraph with vertex set $[n]$ that contains an arc from $j$ to $i$ if $f_i$ depends on input $j$. What can be said on the set $\mathbb{G}(f)$ of the interaction graphs of the automata networks isomorphic to $f$? It seems that this simple question has never been studied. In a previous paper, we prove that the complete digraph $K_n$, with $n^2$ arcs, is universal in that $K_n\in \mathbb{G}(f)$ whenever $f$ is not constant nor the identity (and $n\geq 5$). In this paper, taking the opposite direction, we prove that there exist universal automata networks $f$, in that $\mathbb{G}(f)$ contains all the digraphs on $[n]$, excepted the empty one. Actually, we prove that the presence of only three specific digraphs in $\mathbb{G}(f)$ implies the universality of $f$, and we prove that this forces the alphabet size $q$ to have at least $n$ prime factors (with multiplicity). However, we prove that for any fixed $q\geq 3$, there exists almost universal functions, that is, functions $f:Q^n\to Q^n$ such that the probability that a random digraph belongs to $\mathbb{G}(f)$ tends to $1$ as $n\to\infty$. We do not know if this holds in the binary case $q=2$, providing only partial results.</description>

Abstract: By "geodesic" we mean any sequence of vertices $(v_1,v_2,...,v_k)$ of a graph $G$ that constitute a shortest path from $v_1$ to $v_k$. We propose a novel, natural algorithm to enumerate all geodesics of $G$, and pit it (using Mathematica) against the standard procedure for the task. The distance matrix $D(G)$ plays a crucial role in this. In fact, part of our article is devoted to survey its many uses in related tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent study by Tenner, the concept of the interval poset of a permutation was introduced to effectively represent all intervals and their inclusions within a permutation. In this paper, we present a new geometric viewpoint on interval posets. We establish a one-to-one cor- respondence between the set of interval posets for permutations of size n and a specific subset of dissections of a convex polygon with n sides. Through this correspondence, we investigate various intriguing subsets of interval posets and uncover their connections with specific polygon dissections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The codegree ${\rm codeg}(\mathcal{P})$ of a lattice polytope $\mathcal{P}$ is a fundamental invariant in discrete geometry. In the present paper, we investigate the codegree of the stable set polytope $\mathcal{P}_G$ associated with a simple graph $G$. Specifically, we establish the inequalities \[ \omega(G) + 1 \leq {\rm codeg}(\mathcal{P}_G) \leq \chi(G) + 1, \] where $\omega(G)$ and $\chi(G)$ denote the clique number and the chromatic number of $G$, respectively. Furthermore, an explicit formula for {\rm codeg}(\mathcal{P}_G) is given when $G$ is either a line graph or an $h$-perfect graph. Finally, as an application of these results, we provide upper and lower bounds on the regularity of the toric ring associated with $\mathcal{P}_G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02974v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The (right) $q$-deformed rational numbers was introduced by Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko, and its left variant, whose numerators and denominators are essentially the normalized Jones polynomials of rational links, by Bapat, Becker and Licata. These notions are based on continued fractions and the $q$-deformed modular group $\operatorname{PSL}_q(2,\mathbb{Z})$-actions. In this paper, we introduce the \textit{$q$-transpose} for matrices in $\operatorname{PSL}_q(2,\mathbb{Z})$ to refine the basic perspective of the theory. For example, we present a new proof and a refinement of a theorem of Leclere and Morier-Genoud stating that the trace of $A \in \operatorname{PSL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ is always palindromic and sign coherent. We also show arithmetic/combinatorial results on left $q$-deformed rationals (e.g., the criterion for their palindromicity). Finally, we discuss the connection to the conjecture of Kantarc{\i} O\u{g}uz on circular fence posets.</description>

      <title>On $\mathcal{F}$-multicolor Tur\'{a}n number of hypergraph graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ruzsa-Szemer\'{e}di $(6,3)$-problem can be equivalently stated as determining the maximum number of edge-disjoint triangles on $n$ vertices such that no triangle is formed by edges originating from three distinct triangle-copies. Gowers and Janzer extended the result to uniform hypergraphs by showing that there exist at least $n^{k-o(1)}$ edge-disjoint copies of $K_r^{(k)}$ with no $K_r^{(k)}$ formed by edges from distinct $K_r^{(k)}$-copies. Recently, Imolay, Karl, Nazy and V\'{a}li explored a broader question: for two simple graphs $F$ and $G$, determine the maximum number of edge-disjoint copies of $F$ in a set of $n$ vertices such that there is no copy of $G$ whose edges come from different $F$-copies. This maximum number, denoted by $ex_F(n,G)$, is termed the {\em $F$-multicolor Tur\'{a}n number} of $G$. In this paper, we first show that for $k$-uniform hypergraphs $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{F}$, $ex_{\mathcal{F}}(n,\mathcal{G})=o(n^k)$ if and only if there exists a homomorphism from $\mathcal{G}$ to $\mathcal{F}$, which extends a key result by Imolay et al. We also establish the corresponding supersaturation and blow-up phenomena. In the non-degenerate regime, we show that $\frac{n^k}{v(F)^k}+o(n^{k-1})\leq ex_{\mathcal{F}}(n,\mathcal{G})\leq e(\mathcal{F})^{-1}ex(n,\mathcal{G})+o(n^k)$. In particular, $ex_{\mathcal{F}}(n,\mathcal{G})=e(\mathcal{F})^{-1}ex(n,\mathcal{G})+o(n^k)$ holds if $\mathcal{F}$ is a complete $k$-part $k$-uniform hypergraph with parts of equal size. For degenerate case, we show that $ex_{\mathcal{F}}(n,\mathcal{G})=n^{k-o(1)}$ whenever $\mathcal{G}$ contains $H_3^{(k)}$ as a subgraph, where $H_3^{(k)}$ denotes a $k$-uniform hypergraph on $k+1$ vertices with three edges.</description>

      <title>The Stamp Folding Problem From a Mountain-Valley Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23661v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A strip of square stamps can be folded in many ways such that all of the stamps are stacked in a single pile in the folded state. The stamp folding problem asks for the number of such foldings and has previously been studied extensively. We consider this problem with the additional restriction of fixing the mountain-valley assignment of each crease in the stamp pattern. We provide a closed form for counting the number of legal foldings on specific patterns of mountain-valley assignments, including a surprising appearance of the Catalan numbers. We describe results on upper and lower bounds for the number of ways to fold a given mountain-valley assignment on the strip of stamps, provide experimental evidence suggesting more general results, and include conjectures and open problems.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the set of the smallest eigenvalues attained by $3$-colorable graphs is dense in $(-\infty, -\lambda^*)$, where $\lambda^* = \rho^{1/2} + \rho^{-1/2} \approx 2.01980$ and $\rho$ is the positive real root of $x^3 = x + 1$. As a consequence, in the context of spherical two-distance sets, our result precludes any further refinement of the forbidden-subgraph method through the chromatic number of signed graphs.</description>

For each of these families, we establish analogs of the classical Luzin and Eggleston theorems, showing that functions measurable with respect to these families can be reduced to continuous functions on products of perfect sets. Furthermore, we provide a method for reducilng sequences of such functions to continuity, which allows us to generalize Laver's extension of Halpern-L\"auchli and Harrington theorems.</description>

      <title>The peak algebra in noncommuting variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12868v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-known descent-to-peak map $\Theta_{\mathrm{QSym}}$ for the Hopf algebra of quasisymmetric functions, $\mathrm{QSym}$, and the peak algebra $\Pi$ were originally defined by Stembridge in 1997. We introduce their noncommutative analogues, the labelled descent-to-peak map $\Theta_{\mathrm{NCQSym}}$ for the Hopf algebra of quasisymmetric functions in noncommuting variables, $\mathrm{NCQSym}$, and the peak algebra in noncommuting variables $\mathrm{NC}\Pi$. Then, we define the Hopf algebra of Schur $Q$-functions in noncommuting variables. We show that our generalizations possess many properties analogous to their classical counterparts. Furthermore, we show that the coefficients in the expansion of certain elements of $\mathrm{NC}\Pi$ in the monomial basis of $\mathrm{NCQSym}$ satisfy the generalized Dehn-Sommerville equation of Bayer and Billera. In the end, we give representation-theoretic interpretations of the descent-to-peak map for the Hopf algebras of symmetric functions and noncommutative symmetric functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper will show when a rooted path tree of a finite directed rooted graph has only finitely many orbits under the action of its undirected automorphism group (i.e. when it is cocompact). This will allow us to specify which trees are almost isomorphic to cocompact trees. We will provide an algorithm that will determine this, thus mostly answering question (1) from arXiv:2212.07205.</description>

      <title>Positive combinatorial formulae for involution matrix loci and orbit harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11747v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}_{n,a}$ be the set consisting of involutions in symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ with exactly $a$ fixed points and apply the orbit harmonics method to obtain a graded $\mathfrak{S}_n$-module $R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a})$. Liu, Ma, Rhoades, and Zhu figured out a signed combinatorial formula for the graded Frobenius image $\mathrm{grFrob}(R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a});q)$ of $R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a})$. Our goal is to cancel these signs. Finally, we find two positive combinatorial formulae for $\mathrm{grFrob}(R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a});q)$, yielding potential ways to find a linear basis for $R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a})$ and find a statistic $\mathrm{stat}:\mathcal{M}_{n,a}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$ to interpret the Hilbert series $\mathrm{Hilb}(R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a});q)$ of $R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set partition is $c$-uniform if every block has size $c$. Two families of $c$-uniform partitions of a finite set are said to be cross $t$-intersecting if two partitions from different families share at least $t$ blocks. In this paper, we establish some product-type extremal results for such cross $t$-intersecting families. Our results yield an Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem and a Hilton-Milner theorem for uniform set partitions. Additionally, cross $t$-intersecting families with the maximum sum of their sizes are also characterized.</description>

      <title>From finding a spanning subgraph $H$ to an $H$-factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A typical Dirac-type problem in extremal graph theory is to determine the minimum degree threshold for a graph $G$ to have a spanning subgraph $H$, e.g. the Dirac theorem. A natural following up problem would be to seek an $H$-factor, which a spanning set of vertex-disjoint copies of $H$. In this short note, we present a method of obtaining an upper bound on the minimum degree threshold for an $H$-factor from one for finding a spanning copy of $H$.
  As an application, we proved that, for all $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and $\ell$ sufficiently large, any oriented graph $G$ on $\ell m$ vertices with minimum semi-degree $\delta^0(G) \ge (3/8+ \varepsilon) k \ell$ contains a $C_\ell$-factor, where $C_\ell$ is an arbitrary orientation of a cycle on $\ell$ vertices. This improves a result of Wang, Yan and Zhang.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new combinatorial proofs of Nicomachus's Theorem for the sum of the third powers of the first n natural numbers. The key step is that we define a 4-dimensional block which comprises unit hyper-cubes. In our first proof we assemble 4 copies of this block to construct a rectangular solid. In our second proof we partition the block into two parts, then map and reassemble them into a solid whose shape is a step triangle along two coordinate axes, and is likewise on the other two. For corollaries we present a q-analogue of this identity using taxicab distance, and we interpret q-analogues from 4 different (sets of) authors, using taxicab distances from different starting points.</description>

      <title>Gromov's Approximating Tree and the All-Pairs Bottleneck Paths Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a pointed metric space $(X,\mathsf{dist}, w)$ on $n$ points, its Gromov's approximating tree is a 0-hyperbolic pseudo-metric space $(X,\mathsf{dist}_T)$ such that $\mathsf{dist}(x,w)=\mathsf{dist}_T(x,w)$ and $\mathsf{dist}(x, y)-2 \delta \log_2n \leq \mathsf{dist}_T (x, y) \leq \mathsf{dist}(x, y)$ for all $x, y \in X$ where $\delta$ is the Gromov hyperbolicity of $X$. On the other hand, the all pairs bottleneck paths (APBP) problem asks, given an undirected graph with some capacities on its edges, to find the maximal path capacity between each pair of vertices. In this note, we prove:
  $\bullet$ Computing Gromov's approximating tree for a metric space with $n+1$ points from its matrix of distances reduces to solving the APBP problem on an connected graph with $n$ vertices.
  $\bullet$ There is an explicit algorithm that computes Gromov's approximating tree for a graph from its adjacency matrix in quadratic time.
  $\bullet$ Solving the APBP problem on a weighted graph with $n$ vertices reduces to finding Gromov's approximating tree for a metric space with $n+1$ points from its distance matrix.</description>

      <title>The action of component groups on irreducible components of Springer fibers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple Lie group. Consider a nilpotent element $e\in \mathfrak{g}$. Let $Z_G(e)$ be the centralizer of $e$ in $G$, and let $A_e:= Z_G(e)/Z_G(e)^{o}$ be its component group. Write $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$ for the set of irreducible components of the Springer fiber $\mathcal{B}_e$. We have an action of $A_e$ on $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$. When $\mathfrak{g}$ is exceptional, we give an explicit description of $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$ as an $A_e$-set. For $\mathfrak{g}$ of classical type, we describe the stabilizers for the $A_e$-action. With this description, we prove a conjecture of Lusztig and Sommers. These results suggest relations (first proposed by Lusztig) between Springer fibers and cells in Weyl groups.</description>

      <title>Transfinite hypercentral iterated wreath product of integral domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting with an integral domain $D$ of characteristic $0$, we consider a class of iterated wreath product $W_n$ of $n$ copies of $D$. In order that $W_n$ be transfinite hypercentral, it is necessary to restrict to the case of wreath products defined by way of numerical polynomials. We also associate to each of these groups a Lie ring, providing a correspondence preserving most of the structure. This construction generalizes a result of \cite{netreba} which characterizes the Lie algebras associated to the Sylow \(p\)-subgroups of the symmetric group \(\Sym(p^n)\). As an application, we explore the normalizer chain $\lbrace\mathbf{N}_{i}\rbrace_{i\geq -1}$ starting from the canonical regular abelian subgroup $T$ of $W_n$. Finally, we characterize the regular abelian normal subgroups of $\mathbf{N}_0$ that are isomorphic to $D^n$.</description>

Abstract: We study a model of colored multiwebs, which generalizes the dimer model to allow each vertex to be adjacent to \(n_v\) edges. These objects can be formulated as a random tiling of a graph with partial dimer covers. We examine the case of a cycle graph, and in particular we describe the local correlations of tiles in this setting.</description>

      <title>Noise Sensitivity and Learning Lower Bounds for Hierarchical Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works explore deep learning's success by examining functions or data with hierarchical structure. To study the learning complexity of functions with hierarchical structure, we study the noise stability of functions with tree hierarchical structure on independent inputs. We show that if each function in the hierarchy is $\varepsilon$-far from linear, the noise stability is exponentially small in the depth of the hierarchy.
  Our results have immediate applications for agnostic learning. In the Boolean setting using the results of Dachman-Soled, Feldman, Tan, Wan and Wimmer (2014), our results provide Statistical Query super-polynomial lower bounds for agnostically learning classes that are based on hierarchical functions.
  We also derive similar SQ lower bounds based on the indicators of crossing events in critical site percolation. These crossing events are not formally hierarchical as we define but still have some hierarchical features as studied in mathematical physics.
  Using the results of Abbe, Bengio, Cornacchiam, Kleinberg, Lotfi, Raghu and Zhang (2022), our results imply sample complexity lower bounds for learning hierarchical functions with gradient descent on fully connected neural networks.
  Finally in the Gaussian setting, using the results of Diakonikolas, Kane, Pittas and Zarifis (2021), our results provide super-polynomial lower bounds for agnostic SQ learning.</description>

      <title>Maximal Achievable Service Rates of Codes and Connections to Combinatorial Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16983v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the service-rate region (SRR) of distributed storage systems that employ linear codes. We focus on systems where each server stores one code symbol, and a user recovers a data symbol by accessing any of its recovery groups, subject to per-server capacity limits. The SRR--the convex polytope of simultaneously achievable request rates--captures system throughput and scalability. We first derive upper and lower bounds on the maximum request rate of each data object. These bounds hold for all linear codes and depend only on the number of parity checks orthogonal to a particular set of codeword coordinates associated with that object, i.e., the equations used in majority-logic decoding, and on code parameters. We then check the bound saturation for 1) all non-systematic codes whose SRRs are already known and 2) systematic codes. For the former, we prove the bounds are tight. For systematic codes, we show that the upper bound is achieved whenever the supports of minimum-weight dual codewords form a 2-design. As an application, we determine the exact per-object demand limits for binary Hamming codes. Our framework provides a new lens to address the SRR problem through combinatorial design theory.</description>

      <title>Empirical Analysis Of Heuristic and Approximation Algorithms for the The Mutual-Visibility Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01076v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The NP-complete mutual-visibility (MV) problem currently lacks empirical analysis on its practical behaviour despite theoretical studies. This paper addresses this gap by implementing and evaluating three distinct algorithms -- a direct random heuristic, a hypergraph-based approximation, and a genetic algorithm -- on diverse synthetic graph datasets, including those with analytically known $\mu(G)$ values and general graph models. Our results demonstrate that for smaller graphs, the algorithms consistently achieve MV set sizes aligning with theoretical bounds. However, for larger instances, achieved solution sizes notably diverge from theoretical limits; this, combined with the absence of tight bounds, complicates absolute quality assessment. Nevertheless, validation on known optimal graphs showed the Genetic Algorithm and other heuristics empirically performing best among tested methods.</description>

Abstract: Diagrammatic Monte Carlo methods provide robust routines for accurate computations of correlated electronic systems in the thermodynamical limit. Recently, its versatility was extended to SU(N) Hubbard model, where the core is a novel dynamical programming approach to the summation of all connected Feynman diagrams. We present several generalizations of it with more interaction vertices and symmetry broken terms. The framework treats SU(N) symmetry breaking both from nonuniform, flavor-dependent chemical potentials and from spontaneously broken phases induced by shift parameters. We also provide an end-to-end GPU acceleration path with dedicated CUDA C++ optimizations independent of a previous CUDA acceleration approach, where the parallelization strategy is different. We performed detailed numerical study of new algorithms involved in this article and exposed numerical instabilities of connected determinant formalism, which we solved in multiple ways. Together, these advances establish a scalable, high-performance DiagMC toolbox for multi-flavor correlated systems with and without symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of quadrics via Ehrhart theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of the d-dimensional non-degenerate quadric hypersurface of characteristic p &gt; 2 is a rational function of p composed from the Ehrhart polynomials of integer polytopes. In consequence, we prove that the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of quadrics of fixed characteristic is a decreasing function of dimension and recover results of Trivedi and Gessel-Monsky on the behaviour of said Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity as a function of characteristic.</description>

      <title>Diameter bounds for finite simple Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove strong and explicit diameter bounds for finite simple Lie algebras, which parallel Babai's conjecture for finite simple groups. Specifically, we show that any nonabelian finite simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ over $\mathbf{F}_p$ has diameter $O((\log |\mathfrak{g}|)^D)$ for $D \approx 3.11$ with respect to any generating set. For absolutely simple classical Lie algebras over $\mathbf{F}_p$, we establish the sharper bound $O(\log |\mathfrak{g}|)$ when the Lie type is fixed and the generators are chosen uniformly at random.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of non-finite CL-shellable posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shellable complexes are homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres of possibly different dimensions, so that the (co)homology of the constant functor over the complex is concentrated in those degrees. In this work, we introduce the concept of a stable functor -- a local weakening of fibrancy -- over a shellable poset, which ensures the vanishing of the (co)homology of such a functor in specific degrees. The methods are based on a model category structure on the category of functors indexed by a filtered poset and the combinatorial structure of shellable posets. Our techniques work over non-finite and non-pure posets and employ a description of (co)homology via explicit fibrant replacements. Applications include acyclicity criteria for Mackey functors, computation of cohomology of $j$-th exterior powers over arrangement lattices, and homological decompositions for Bianchi groups $\Gamma_d$ for $d=1,2,7$ and $11$.</description>

      <title>Reinforced Generation of Combinatorial Structures: Applications to Complexity Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18057v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore whether techniques from AI can help discover new combinatorial structures that improve on known limits on efficient algorithms. Specifically, we use AlphaEvolve (an LLM coding agent) to study two settings:
  a) Average-case hardness for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set: We improve a recent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional) lower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on random 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by constructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ nodes, using AlphaEvolve. Additionally, via analytical arguments we strengthen the upper bounds to settle the computational hardness of these questions up to an error in the third decimal place.
  b) Worst-case Hardness of Approximation for MAX-k-CUT: We obtain new inapproximability results, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate MAX-4-CUT and MAX-3-CUT within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using AlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves upon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current best gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of improving the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP, rather than a gadget reduction from "standard" H{\aa}stad-style PCPs.
  A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction produced by AlphaEvolve is costly (often requiring exponential time). In both settings above, our results were enabled by using AlphaEvolve itself to evolve the verification procedure to be faster (sometimes by $10,000\times$). We conclude with a discussion of norms by which to assess the assistance from AI in developing proofs.</description>

      <title>Modularity from $q$-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1975, G. E. Andrews challenged the mathematics community to address L. Ehrenpreis' problem, which was to directly prove the modularity of the Rogers-Ramanujan $q$-series' summatory forms. This question is important because many different $q$-series appearing in combinatorics, representation theory, and physics often seem to be "mysteriously" modular, yet there is no general test to confirm this directly from the exotic $q$-series expressions. In this note, we solve this general problem using $q$-series algebra and $q$-series systems of differential equations. Specifically, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which a vector of holomorphic $q$-series on $|q|&lt;1$ forms a vector-valued modular function. This result offers a clear and conceptual path to modularity for "strange" $q$-series.</description>
