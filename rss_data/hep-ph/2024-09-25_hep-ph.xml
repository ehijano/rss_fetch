      <title>Electroweak Quantum Numbers in the $D_4$ Root System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce four fundamental quantum numbers based on the $D_4$ root system, giving a unified description of quarks and leptons. These numbers will make it possible to define electric charge in a simple way. By postulating a fundamental symmetry given by the binary tetrahedral group acting on this root system, we can easily prove conservation of electric charge. Also, possible electroweak interactions are given by a simple rule where the 24-cell acts on itself by quaternion multiplication. The three generations of fermions in the Standard Model are hereby identified with the three imaginary dimensions of the quaternions.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of the SMEFT to dimension eight: Fermionic interactions I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the third of a series of works (arxiv:2106.05291, arxiv:2205.03301) aimed at renormalizing the Standard Model effective field theory at one loop and to order $1/\Lambda^4$, with $\Lambda$ being the new physics cut-off. On this occasion, we concentrate on the running of two-fermion operators induced by pairs of dimension-six interactions. We work mostly off-shell, for which we obtain and provide a new and explicitly hermitian basis of dimension-eight Green's functions. All our results can be accessed in https://github.com/SMEFT-Dimension8-RGEs .</description>

      <title>Solar Neutrinos and the Strongest Oscillation Constraints on Scalar NSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar non-standard neutrino interactions (sNSI) is a scenario where neutrinos can develop a medium dependent contribution to their mass due to a new scalar mediator. This scenario differs from the commonly discussed vector mediator case in that the oscillation effect scales with density rather than density and neutrino energy. Thus the strongest oscillation constraint comes from solar neutrinos which experience the largest density in a neutrino oscillation experiment. We derive constraints on all the sNSI parameters as well as the absolute neutrino mass scale by combining solar and reactor data and find solar neutrinos to be $&gt;1$ order of magnitude more sensitive to sNSI than terrestrial probes such as long-baseline experiments.</description>

      <title>Impact of parity violation on quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement (QE) and Bell inequalities (BI) have been extensively studied for interactions that conserve parity (P), while their interplay with P-violating ones remains underexplored. We find P violation leads to a preference for particular spin combinations and has significant effects on QE and the extent of BI violation. Within the quantum field theory (QFT) framework, for spin-0 particles decaying into two fermions, parameters for the concurrence and the BI for the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt case are found to be $\sqrt{1 - \alpha^2}$ and $2 \sqrt{2 - \alpha^2}$, respectively, where $-1\leq \alpha\ \leq 1$ quantifies the size of P violation. For spin-1 particle decays, we find that P-violating interactions introduce effects similar to those in the spin-0 case. Without knowledge from the QFT, for the spin-0 case, the general form of density matrices requires measuring only one parameter for P-conserving decays and three otherwise. For spin-1 cases, there would be nine parameters in general. We further study the overlooked effect on QE and BI induced by the magnetic field in detectors and find it essential for a genuine test of P and CP symmetries.</description>

      <title>Infrared Anomalous Dimensions at Three-Loop in the SM from Conserved Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the infrared structure of the Standard Model (SM) restricted to the first generation of fermions, including the full SM gauge group, up to three-loop order, and determine the resulting cusp and collinear anomalous dimensions for all gauge groups and particles of the theory. We observe that starting from three loops, the resulting cusp anomalous dimensions include terms involving two distinct couplings, contrary to previous claims in the literature. We give a detailed explanation of this observation and explore the origin of these terms. We provide a supplementary file where all infrared anomalous dimensions calculated in this work are collected. Our results are consistent with the existing literature wherever comparisons are possible.</description>

      <title>The Hubble Tension: Relativistic Dark Matter Production from Long-lived Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tension between direct measurements of the Hubble constant and those stemming from Cosmic Microwave Background probes has triggered a multitude of studies. The connection between cosmology and particle physics has shown to be a valuable approach to addressing the Hubble tension. In particular, increasing the number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early universe helps alleviate the problem. In this work, we write down effective field theory describing relativistic dark matter production in association with neutrinos leading to a larger $H_0$. We derive limits on the effective energy scale that governs this relativistic production of dark matter as a function of the dark matter mass for fermion, vector, and scalar dark matter fields. In particular, scalar dark matter particles are more effective in increasing the effective number of relativistic species. Also, if they have weak scale masses, then the relativistic production of dark matter should be governed by Planck scale effective operators in order to alleviate the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Dirac Equation Solution with Generalized tanh-Shaped Hyperbolic Potential: Application to Charmonium and Bottomonium Mass Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we advance the understanding of the fundamental interactions by using a generalized tanh shaped hyperbolic potential to investigate bound state solutions of the Dirac equation. Using the Nikiforov Uvarov method, we derive energy eigenvalues and radial wave functions in various quantum states, with the results expressed in terms of hypergeometric polynomials. The results of our analysis indicate that the energy eigenvalues are strongly correlated with the potential parameters and covered several fundamental potential models used to expose a nontrivial behaviour that occurred within quantum systems. Further, using this potential to model mass spectra of charmonium and bottomonium, we show that results for the calculated quark mass spectra align closely with experimentally observed values, reflecting the veracity and accuracy of the approach. This close correspondence between calculated and experimental spectra highlights this potential model's efficacy in describing heavy quarkonium systems. The insights gained from this study reinforce the applicability of this potential model in quantum mechanics and particle physics and lay a foundation for its extension to other quantum systems, suggesting a feasible avenue for future research.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Gravitational Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving analysis of strong interaction quantum field equations is used to complete a unified treatment of pion, kaon, nucleon electromagnetic and gravitational form factors. Findings include a demonstration that the pion near-core pressure is roughly twice that in the proton, so both are significantly greater than that of a neutron star; parton species separations of the nucleon's three gravitational form factors, in which, inter alia, the glue-to-quark ratio for each form factor is seen to take the same constant value, independent of momentum transfer; and a determination of proton radii orderings, with the mechanical (normal force) radius being less than the mass-energy radius, which is less than the proton charge radius. This body of predictions should prove useful in an era of anticipated experiments that will enable them to be tested.</description>

      <title>Partial-wave projection of relativistic three-body amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the integral equations for partial-wave projected three-body scattering amplitudes, starting from the integral equations for three-body amplitudes developed for lattice QCD analyses. The results, which hold for generic three-body systems of spinless particles, build upon the recently derived partial-wave projected one-particle exchange, a primary component of the relativistic framework proven to satisfy S matrix unitarity. We derive simplified expressions for factorizable short-distance interactions, $\mathcal{K}_{3}$, in two equivalent formalisms - one symmetric under particle interchange and one asymmetric. For the asymmetric case, we offer parameterizations useful for amplitude analysis. Finally, we examine toy models for $3\pi$ systems at unphysically heavy pion masses with total isospins 0,1, and 2.</description>

      <title>Twist-2 distribution amplitudes of $a_{0}(980)$ and $a_{0}(1450)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on QCD sum rules, we investigate the twist-2 distribution amplitudes of the scalar mesons $a_{0}(980)$ and $a_{0}(1450)$. We have derived the moments for these scalar mesons, composed of two constituent valence quarks, to the first order by selecting appropriate correlation functions. Subsequently, we have determined the first two Gegenbauer coefficients of these scalar mesons, employing these moments, we further analyze the twist-2 light-cone distribution amplitudes for the $a_{0}$ meson. The paper concludes with an examination of the weak decay widths for the transitions $B,D\rightarrow a_{0}$.</description>

      <title>Quark Stars as Hideouts For Color-spin-locked Quark Matter: Implications for Powering High-energy Electromagnetic Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ground state of moderately dense cold quark matter is investigated within the framework of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. It is found that in the regime of weak and intermediate diquark coupling strength, the color-spin-locked (CSL) phase could be most favored, and the density range where CSL phase survives is determined by two quark chemical potentials: one corresponding to the chiral phase transition and the other for the emergence of the gapless color-flavor-locked (CFL) condensate. Based on the theoretical hypothesis that the quark star could be the hideout for CSL quark matter, an interesting scenario is proposed that the phase transition to the CSL phase could occur in the cooling process of a proper quark star. The CSL quark matter is an electromagnetic superconductor of Type-I, and a complete Meissner effect is expected. However, the analysis for this sizable superconductor indicates that most of the magnetic field is frozen inside the star with a critical strength, while in some special cases, a small fraction could be expelled from a thin layer near the surface in a short time. An analysis on energetics and time scale is performed to investigate if this expulsion of magnetic flux could power or induce high-energy electromagnetic emissions.</description>

      <title>Interplay and Correlations Between Quark and Lepton Observables in Modular Symmetry Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first combined analysis of quark and lepton observables in flavour models based on modular invariance. The analysis is performed within a specific model with modular $2O$ symmetry. Unlike previous studies, which analyzed observables in the quark and lepton sectors separately, our work unifies their treatment under a single framework governed by a common complex modulus $\tau$ and twelve real parameters. The model is in good agreement with experimental data, while also predicting unmeasured lepton observables such as the leptonic Dirac CP-violation (CPV) phase, the two Majorana CPV phases, the lightest neutrino mass $m_1$ in normal ordering, and the effective masses $m_\beta$ and $m_{\beta\beta}$, which are measured in beta decay and neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments. These predictions fall within ranges that can be tested by current and future experiments, providing a concrete opportunity to probe the considered modular symmetry framework. Our results show that the $2O$ modular symmetry offers a natural, minimal-parameter explanation for quark and lepton mixing, revealing important correlations between the observables in the two sectors. This unified analysis opens new directions for investigations in neutrino and precision flavor physics.</description>

Abstract: The seven-gluon two-loop full-color Yang-Mills amplitude is presented in a compact analytic form where we use the methods of four-dimensional unitarity cuts to obtain the polylogarithmic pieces and augmented recursion to obtain the rational pieces. Furthermore, an $n$-point form for the full-color polylogarithmic piece is presented. We use these results to probe for potential relations amongst the two-loop partial amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete groups are widely used in the expression of flavor symmetries of leptons. In this paper, we employ a novel mathematical object called group-algebra (GA) to describe symmetries of the leptonic mass matrices. A GA element is constructed by a discrete group with continuous parameters. For a GA element, there is an equivalent symmetry which can be continuous, discrete, and hybrid. According to the equivalence between a GA element and other symmetries, we perform a classification of 198 nontrivial elements of the GA generated by the group $S_{4}$. Based on the results of the classification, the phenomenological consequences of the $S_{4}$ GA are illustrated.</description>

We take special effort to derive the chiral kinetic theory in seven-dimensional phase space from the eight-dimensional chiral kinetic theory. We give the seven-dimensional chiral kinetic theory up to second order of semiclassical expansion. We find some new second-order contributions compared with other approaches.</description>

Abstract: With the neutrino experiments advancing towards high-precision measurements and greater emphasis on reducing systematic uncertainties, embedding the single-pion production models, a major component of the hadronic activity observed in the neutrino oscillation experiments, into the Monte Carlo simulations is crucial. This work presents the measurements of the struck nucleon's Fermi motion with the transverse kinematic imbalance approach by analyzing the charged-current neutral pion production on carbon nucleus in MINER$\nu$A. A minimal tuning of GENIE and NuWro based on their default models shows an improvement in the prediction of single $\pi^0$ production. The prediction describes the data more accurately in the higher momentum tail however, discrepancies between the predictions and data below the Fermi peak highlight the limitations in current nuclear models used in the Monte Carlo generators.</description>

      <title>Boosted top quark inspired leptoquark searches at the muon collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15992v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proposed muon collider presents a promising avenue to explore various classes of beyond the Standard Model (BSM) particles. In this paper, we investigate the discovery prospects of the scalar leptoquark (LQ) $S_1$ at a muon collider. We consider two benchmark center-of-mass (C.O.M.) energy scenarios: 5 TeV and 10 TeV. We assume that the LQ decays into a top quark and a muon. The collider analysis for an LQ decaying into a top quark is distinct from that of lighter quarks. A TeV-scale LQ decaying into a top quark can produce an exotic, boosted fat-jet signature. In addition to the usual searches based on pair production of LQs, we also examine the single production mode, which depends on the $S_1 t \mu$ coupling. We demonstrate that systematically combining the pair and single production modes significantly enhances the discovery potential of the LQ at the muon collider. Our signal topology includes at least one hadronically decaying top fat-jet and two oppositely charged muons, thereby enabling the incorporation of the single production mode. We show that even with single production alone, it is possible to probe LQs as heavy as 4.5 TeV (9.0 TeV) in the 5 TeV (10 TeV) C.O.M. scenario for $\mathcal{O}(1)$ couplings.</description>

      <title>Two-Loop Five-Point One-Mass Amplitudes in the Spinor-Helicity Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Processes involving electroweak vector bosons in association with jets are crucial for precision studies of the Standard Model at the Large Hadron Collider. Accurate predictions for the process $pp\rightarrow V(\rightarrow\bar\ell\ell)jj$ at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO), as well as N$^3$LO ones for the process with one fewer jet, require two-loop five-point one-mass amplitudes. These exhibit a significant increase in complexity compared to their massless counterparts. We present results for the partonic processes $\bar qQ\bar Qq\bar\ell\ell$ and $\bar qggq\bar\ell\ell$, with a forthcoming package for phenomenology. The present recalculation is based on the previous analytic results from ref. [1]. For the first time, we express two-loop five-point one-mass amplitudes in the spinor-helicity formalism. We achieve three orders of magnitude smaller expressions compared to previous results. This will facilitate phenomenological studies and help clarify mathematical properties of the amplitude.</description>

      <title>Charged Higgs Boson Mass Bounds in 2HDM-II: Impact of Vector-Like Quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the phenomenology of charged Higgs bosons ($H^\pm$) and Vector-Like Quarks (VLQs), specifically the top-like $T$, within the Two Higgs Doublet Model Type-II (2HDM-II). We consider both a singlet VLQ $(T)$ and a doublet $(TB)$ scenario, demonstrating that the presence of VLQs influences the scalar sector, particularly by alleviating the stringent mass constraints on $H^\pm$ imposed by $B$-physics observables such as $B\to X_s\gamma$. This relaxation arises from modifications in the couplings between $H^\pm$ and Standard Model (SM) quarks, with the magnitude of the effect differing between the singlet and doublet cases. We further analyse the constraints from the oblique parameters $S$ and $T$ on VLQ mixing angles.</description>

      <title>Evidence of collinear factorization breaking due to collinear-to-soft Glauber exchanges for a $2 \to 3$ exclusive process at leading twist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit an exclusive process, namely the photoproduction of a $\pi^{0}\gamma$ pair with large invariant mass, which violates collinear factorization. We explicitly demonstrate that this is due to the fact that there exists diagrams with gluon exchange in $t$ channel, contributing at the leading power, for which Glauber gluons are trapped. This is caused by the pinching of the contour integration of both the plus and minus light-cone components of the Glauber gluon momentum. We argue that this leads to the observed ``endpoint-like'' divergence of the convolution integral at leading order and leading power when collinear factorization is na\"ively assumed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the generation of baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU) following the first-order electroweak phase transition. Our study indicates that the presence of CP-violating operators can lead to the generation of the helical magnetic field, which further induces the growth of the lepton asymmetry and the generation of the BAU as the Universe cools down. This process can yield the observed BAU when the new physics scale is lower than 700 GeV.</description>

      <title>Going against the flow: Revealing the QCD degrees of freedom in hadronic collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In collisions between heavy nuclei, such as those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, hydrodynamic models have successfully related measured azimuthal momentum anisotropies to the transverse shape of the collision region. For an elliptically shaped interaction area, the hydrodynamic pressure gradient is greater along the minor axis, resulting in increased particle momentum in that direction - a phenomenon known as positive elliptic flow. In this paper, we demonstrate that in smaller systems, such as proton-proton and peripheral ion-ion collisions, microscopic models for final state interactions, can produce anisotropies where the elliptic flow is negative - that is, the momentum is largest along the major axis, contrary to hydrodynamic predictions. We present results from two distinct microscopic models: one based on repulsion between string-like fields and another based on effective kinetic theory. Negative elliptic flow is a solid prediction of the string interaction model while in the model based on kinetic theory it is linked to a finite interaction range. Consequently, an experimental determination of the sign of elliptic flow, will provide novel insights into the degrees of freedom governing strong nuclear interactions in high-energy collisions and the way in which they interact.</description>

      <title>Higher twist corrections to doubly-charmed baryonic $B$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryonic two-body $B$ mesons decays have been measured experimentally for some time, which provides an excellent ground for studying the QCD of baryonic $B$ decays. In this work, we investigate the two-body doubly-charmed baryonic $B$ decays in the perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach including higher twist contributions to the light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs). The charmed baryon LCDAs are included up to the twist four and the effect of the subleading component of the $B$ meson LCDAs is studied for details. With the inclusion of these higher-power contributions, the PQCD results on rates can explain the current experimental data well. Moreover, we note that the SU(3) symmetry breaking is important in the concerned processes and play an essential role in understanding the measurements of $\mathcal{B}(\overline{B}^0\to \Lambda_c^+\overline \Lambda_c^-)$ and $ \mathcal{B}({B}^-\to\Xi_c^0\overline \Lambda_c^-)$. We also evaluate the angular asymmetries for the first time, which have neither been measured experimentally nor calculated theoretically. All these predictions can be tested in future.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field effects on electroweak phase transition and baryon asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the early universe, the first-order phase transition may occur in the background of magnetic fields, leading to baryon number asymmetry through chiral anomaly. We have numerically simulated the first-order electroweak phase transition in the background of a magnetic field in a three-dimensional lattice, discovered the phenomenon of Higgs condensation, and for the first time given the relationship between baryon number asymmetry and magnetic field strength. The magnetic field strength required to achieve the matter-antimatter asymmetry by the evolution of magnetohydrodynamics is about $10^{-17}\sim10^{-14}$ Gauss at present depending on the correlation length of the helical magnetic field. Our research provides a strong basis for explaining the baryon number asymmetry with cosmic magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>General vacuum stability of orbifold gauge breaking and application to asymptotic grand unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the vacuum stability of gauge symmetry breaking in five dimensions, compactified on the $S_1/(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}'_2)$ orbifold. We consider $SU(N)$, $Sp(N)$, $SO(2N)$ and $SO(2N+1)$ theories in the bulk, and provide an exhaustive classification of possible parity assignments that lead to stable orbifolds and of the corresponding symmetry breaking patterns. We use these results in the search for viable asymptotic grand unification theories (aGUT), testing the stability criteria on models based on $SU(6)$ and $SU(8)$. As a result, we identify two viable aGUTs: a unique $SU(6)$ pathway down to the Standard Model, and one $SU(8)$ model leading to an intermediate Pati-Salam partial unification.</description>

      <title>Heavy $K^*$ mesons with open charm from $KD^{(*)}D^*$ interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In view of the recent discovery of $T_{cc}$, which can be described as a $DD^*$ molecular state, we perform a study of the $KDD^*$ system, and its extension to studying $KD^*D^*$, where $D^*D^*$ is bound as a spin 1 $T_{cc}$-like state, to search for the possible existence of exotic mesons with the open flavors $ccs$ being part of their quark configuration. Considering the additional attractive interactions present in the $KD$ and $KD^*$ subsystems, where the states $D^*_{s0}(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ are generated, we solve the Faddeev equations considering the fixed-center approximation for the mentioned three-body systems and find the existence of two doubly charmed $K^*$-like mesons, $K_{cc}^*(4309)$ and $K_{cc}^*(4449)$, with quantum numbers $I(J^P)=1/2\,(1^-)$. Considering the respective three-body thresholds of the two systems, both $K_{cc}$-states are bound by around $60$ MeV. An experimental confirmation will bring evidence for the existence of a degree of exoticity beyond charm +2.</description>

      <title>Implication of Jet Physics from MeV Line Emission of GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12977v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrarelativistic jets are believed to play an important role in producing prompt emission and afterglow of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), but the nature of the jet is poorly known owing to the lack of decisive features observed in the prompt emission. The discovery of an emission line evolving from about 37 to 6 MeV in the brightest-of-all-time GRB 221009A provides an unprecedented opportunity to probe GRB jet physics. The time evolution of the central energy of the line with power-law index $-1$ is naturally explained by the high-latitude curvature effect. Under the assumption that the line emission is generated in the prompt emission by $e^\pm$ pair production, cooling, and annihilation in the jet, we can strictly constrain jet physics with observed line emission properties. We find that the radius of the emission region is $r\gtrsim10^{16}$ cm. The narrow line width of $\sim10\%$ requires that the line emission occurs within $\sim10\%$ of the dynamical time, which further implies short timescales of pair cooling to the nonrelativistic state and pair annihilation, as well as a slightly clumpy emission region. If the jet's Lorentz factor is $\Gamma\gtrsim400$, the fast cooling requirement needs an energy density of magnetic field in the jet much larger than that of prompt gamma rays, i.e., a magnetically dominated jet. The temporal behavior of line flux suggests some angle dependence of line emission. We also discuss the difficulties of other scenarios for the observed emission line.</description>

      <title>Search for Dark Matter Annihilation to gamma-rays from SPT-SZ selected Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10189v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We search for dark matter annihilation from galaxy clusters in the energy range from 1-300 GeV using nearly 16 years of Fermi-LAT data. For this purpose, we use 350 galaxy clusters selected from the 2500 $\rm{deg^2}$ SPT-SZ survey. We model the dark matter distribution using the NFW profile for the main halo along with the Einasto profile for the substructure. The largest signal is seen for the cluster SPT-CL J2021-5257 with a significance of around $3\sigma$. The best-fit dark matter mass and annihilation cross-section for this cluster are equal to $(60.0 \pm 11.8)$ GeV and $\langle \sigma v \rangle= (6.0 \pm 0.6) \times 10^{-25} \rm{cm^3 s^{-1}}$ for the $\bar{b} b$ annihilation channel. However, this central estimate is in conflict with the limits on annihilation cross-section from dwarf spheroidal galaxies, and hence cannot be attributed to dark matter annihilation. Three other clusters show significance between $2-2.5\sigma$, whereas all the remaining clusters show null results. The most stringent 95\% c.l. upper limit for the WIMP annihilation cross-section among all the clusters is from SPT-CL J0455-4159, viz. $\langle \sigma v \rangle = 6.44 \times 10^{-26} \text{cm}^3 \text{s}^{-1}$ for $m_{\chi} = 10$ GeV and $b\bar{b}$ annihilation channel.</description>

      <title>Field redefinition and its impact in relativistic hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the impact of field redefinition on the spectrum of linearized perturbations in relativistic hydrodynamics. We demonstrate that while the hydrodynamic modes remain unaffected by local field redefinition, the non-hydrodynamic modes are sensitive to it and can be eliminated through an appropriate all-order redefinition. This leads to a new hydro frame, where the spectrum contains only hydrodynamic modes. We further show that the resulting stress tensor may have an infinite series in momentum space, with a convergence radius linked to the eliminated non-hydrodynamic mode, illustrating its control over the validity of the hydrodynamic expansion. In certain special cases, higher-order terms in the stress tensor under field redefinition may cancel, indicating that non-hydrodynamic modes are mere artefacts of the fluid variable choice and hold no physical significance, even if they appear to violate physical constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use algebraic geometry to study the anomaly-free representations of an arbitrary gauge Lie algebra for 4-dimensional spacetime fermions. For irreducible representations, the problem reduces to studying the Lie algebras $\mathfrak{su}_n$ for $n\geq 3$. We show that there exist equivalence classes of such representations that are in bijection with the rational points on a projective variety that are dense in a region of the underlying real variety diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{n-3}$. It follows that the chiral ones overwhelm the non-chiral ones for $n \geq 5$. We present an efficient algorithm to find explicit anomaly-free irreducible representations and discuss the generalization to reducible representations.</description>

      <title>Hubble-Induced Phase Transitions: Gravitational-Wave Imprint of Ricci Reheating from Lattice Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves offer an unprecedented opportunity to look into the violent high-energy processes happening during the reheating phase of our Universe. We consider a Hubble-induced phase transition scenario as a source of a post-inflationary stochastic background of gravitational waves and analyse the main characteristics of its spectrum for the first time via numerical methods. The output of a large number of fully-fledged classical lattice simulations is condensed in a set of parametric formulas that describe key features of the gravitational wave spectrum, such as its peak amplitude and characteristic frequency, and avoid the need for further time-consuming simulations. The signal from such stochastic background is compared to the prospective sensitivity of future gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Impact of Low ell's on Large Scale Structure Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We scrutinize the reported lensing anomaly of the CMB by considering several phenomenological modifications of the lensing consistency parameter, $A_{\rm L}$. Considering Planck spectra alone, we find statisically significant evidence for scale dependence (`running') of $A_{\rm L}$. We then demonstrate that the anomaly is entirely driven by Planck's low multipoles, $\ell \leq 30$. When these data points are excluded a joint analysis with several other datasets clearly favors $\Lambda$CDM over the extended $\Lambda \rm CDM+A_L$ model.
  Not only that the lensing anomaly and low $\ell$ anomaly of the CMB go away in this case, but also the $S_8$ tension is ameliorated, and only the Hubble tension persists.</description>

      <title>Scrutinizing black hole stability in cubic vector Galileon theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a subclass of generalized Proca theories where a cubic vector Galileon term breaks the $U(1)$ gauge invariance, it is known that there are static and spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solutions endowed with nonvanishing temporal and longitudinal vector components. Such hairy BHs are present for a vanishing vector-field mass ($m=0$) with a non-zero cubic Galileon coupling $\beta_3$. We study the linear stability of those hairy BHs by considering even-parity perturbations in the eikonal limit. In the angular direction, we show that one of the three dynamical perturbations has a nontrivial squared propagation speed $c_{\Omega,1}^2$, while the other two dynamical modes are luminal. We could detect two different unstable behaviors of perturbations in all the parameter spaces of hairy asymptotically flat BH solutions we searched for. In the first case, an angular Laplacian instability on the horizon is induced by negative $c_{\Omega,1}^2$. For the second case, it is possible to avoid this horizon instability, but in such cases, the positivity of $c_{\Omega,1}^2$ is violated at large distances. Hence these hairy BHs are generally prone to Laplacian instabilities along the angular direction in some regions outside the horizon. Moreover, we also encounter a pathological behavior of the radial propagation speeds $c_r$ possessing two different values of $c_r^2$ for one of the dynamical perturbations. Introducing the vector-field mass $m$ to cubic vector Galileons, however, we show that the resulting no-hair Schwarzschild BH solution satisfies all the linear stability conditions in the small-scale limit, with luminal propagation speeds of three dynamical even-parity perturbations.</description>

      <title>A background for thermal photons in heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present the transverse momentum spectra of prompt and decay photons in Au-Au collisions for $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 200 GeV, 62.4 GeV, 39 GeV, and 27 GeV. The major sources of the photons in Angantyr include hard processes, Parton showers, and resonance decay. The multiparton interactions and hadronic rescatterings significantly increase the photon yield. The model shows a good match with the available experimental data at high $p_T$. The difference in yield at low $p_T $ suggests that Quark Gluon Plasma of $T_{eff}$ = 0.167 GeV/c in central Au-Au collision at 200 GeV is formed, the new effective temperature is less than the ones extracted without removing background photons. At low $p_T$ the decay photon spectra scales with $(\frac{dN_{ch}}{d\eta})^{1.25}$, the scaling is independent of collision energy and system size. The scaling no longer holds at high $p_T$ and the spectra become beam energy dependent. The scaled $p_T$ spectra of p-p and d-Au collisions show an opposite trend at high $p_T$, their scaled yield is greater than the Au-Au collision at the same energy.</description>

      <title>Strange Stars Admixed with Mirror Dark Matter: Confronting Observations of XTE J1814-338</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a novel framework for explaining the mass and radius relationships of observed neutron stars by considering strange stars (SSs) admixed with mirror dark matter (MDM). We develop a theoretical model that incorporates non-commutative algebra to describe the interactions between ordinary strange quark matter (SQM) and MDM, which are predicted to form compact objects that could explain recent astrophysical data, including observations of PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0437-4715, and the central compact object in HESS J1731-347. Notably, we demonstrate that the exotic mass-radius measurement of XTE J1814-338 can be explained by the presence of a mirror SS with an ordinary SQM core. In contrast to other explanations based on boson stars, our SS+MDM model offers a natural explanation for this system. We provide detailed mass-radius comparisons with observational data and discuss future observations that could test the predictions of our model, offering new insights into neutron star structure and the role of dark matter in compact objects.</description>

      <title>Condensate decay in a radiation dominated cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the decay of a homogeneous condensate of a massive scalar field of mass \emph{m} into massless fields in thermal equilibrium in a radiation dominated cosmology. The model is a \emph{proxy} for the non-equilibrium dynamics of a misaligned axion condensate decaying into radiation. After consistent field quantization in the cosmological background, we obtain the causal equations of motion for a homogeneous condensate including the finite temperature self-energy corrections up to one loop. The dynamical renormalization group is implemented to obtain the time dependent relaxation rate that describes the decay dynamics of the condensate amplitude from stimulated emission and recombination of massless quanta in the medium. It is explicitly shown that a simple friction term in the equation of motion does not describe correctly the decay of the condensate. During the super-Hubble regime, relevant for ultralight dark matter, the condensate amplitude decays as $e^{-\frac{g^2}{10} t^2\,\ln(1/mt)}$. In the sub-Hubble regime the amplitude decays as $e^{-\gamma(t;T(t))/2}$ with $T(t)=T_0/a(t)$, therefore the finite temperature contribution to the decay rate vanishes fast during the expansion. A main conclusion is that a phenomenological friction term is inadequate to describe the decay in the super-Hubble regime, the decay function $\gamma(t)$ is always \emph{smaller} than that from a local friction term as a consequence of the cosmological expansion. For ultra light dark matter, the time scale during which transient dynamics is sensitive to cosmological expansion and a local friction term is inadequate, is much longer. A friction term always \emph{underestimates} the time scale of decay in the sub-Hubble case.</description>

      <title>Low-scale Mirror Standard Model Dark Matter and its Detection via Gravitational Waves and the Guitar Nebula</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What if the dark matter Sector is truly dark, self-interacting and unreachable by terrestrial experiments? How could we find hints of such dark sector if it is experimentally unreachable by any terrestrial experiment? In this work we study a low-mass-scale mirror Standard Model which can act as a model for dark matter, which interacts only gravitationally with the Standard Model particles. The mirror Standard Model sector particles can form mirror atoms and hadrons and all these stable particles can comprise a large part of the dark matter of the Universe. These mirror Standard Model particles acquire mass through a low-temperature dark first order phase transition. We examine in detail this dark phase transition and we indicate how stochastic gravitational waves can be generated through this transition. Such a phase transition can generate stochastic gravitational waves that can be detected by the future gravitational wave experiments. For the model we use, the produced energy spectrum of the gravitational waves can be detected by the SKA. Moreover, we propose a possible way to detect effects of the particle nature of dark matter, using observational data coming from the guitar nebula. We assume that the guitar nebula bow shock is generated by the interaction of the high speed neutron star that passes through the interstellar medium, which is assumed to be comprised by collisional dark matter and hydrogen. Our main proposal is that the opening angle of the bow shock can be directly related to the speed of sound of the dark matter particles, and a large angle of the bow shock could be a strong indicator that the interstellar medium is comprised by collisional dark matter and hydrogen gas. This is motivated by the Bosma effect which indicates that hydrogen is always in correlation with dark matter, and hydrogen gas is strongly present in the guitar nebula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phenomena of neutrino oscillations and flavour mixing by incorporating the gravitational effects through the Dirac equation in curved spacetime inside a spherically symmetric star. We show that the flavour transition probabilities of the neutrinos depend on the interior spacetime metric as they propagate out of the star. As a consequence, we show that one could distinguish between different possible equation of states of nuclear matter even for an isolated neutron star if one could determine the flavour composition of emitted neutrinos near the stellar surface.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium expectations for non-Gaussian fluctuations near a QCD critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the highly anticipated results from the Beam Energy Scan II program at RHIC being recently revealed, an understanding of particle-number fluctuations and their significance as a potential signature of a possible QCD critical point is crucial. Early works that embarked on this endeavor sought to estimate the fluctuations due to the presence of a critical point assuming they stay in equilibrium. From these results came the proposal to focus efforts on higher, non-Gaussian, moments of the event-by-event distributions, in particular of the number of protons. These non-Gaussian moments are especially sensitive to critical fluctuations, as their magnitudes are proportional to high powers of the critical correlation length. As the equation of state provides key input for hydrodynamical simulations of heavy-ion collisions, we estimate equilibrium fluctuations from the BEST equation of state (EoS) that includes critical features from the 3D Ising Model. In particular, the proton factorial cumulants and their dependence on non-universal mapping parameters is investigated within the BEST EoS. Furthermore, the correlation length, as a central quantity for the assessment of fluctuations in the vicinity of a critical point, is also calculated in a consistent manner with the scaling equation of state. An understanding of the equilibrium estimates of proton factorial cumulants will be useful for further comparison to estimates of out-of-equilibrium fluctuations in order to determine the magnitude of the observable fluctuations to be expected in heavy-ion collision experiments, in which the time spent near a critical point is short.</description>

      <title>Flavor Violating Di- Higgs Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Di-Higgs couplings to fermions of the form $h^{2}\overline{f}f$ are absent in the Standard Model, however, they are present in several physics Beyond Standard Model (BSM) extensions, including those with vector-like fermions. In Effective Field Theories (EFTs), such as the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT), these couplings appear at dimension 6 and can in general, be flavour-violating (FV). In the present work, we employ a bottom-up approach to investigate the FV in the lepton and quarks sectors through the di-Higgs effective couplings. We assume that all FV arises from this type of couplings and assume that the Yukawa couplings $Y_{ij}$ are given by their SM values, i.e. $Y_{ij} = \sqrt{2}m_{i}\delta_{ij}/v$. In the lepton sector, we set upper limits on the Wilson coefficients $C_{ll'}$ from $l \rightarrow 3l'$ decays, $l \rightarrow l\gamma$ decays, muonium oscillations, the $(g-2)_{\mu}$ anomaly, LEP searches, muon conversion in nuclei, FV Higgs decays, and $Z$ decays. We also make projections on some of these coefficients from Belle II, the Mu2e experiment and the LHC's High Luminosity (HL) run. In the quark sector, we set upper limits on the Wilson coefficients $C_{qq'}$ from meson oscillations and from $B$-physics searches. A key takeaway from this study is that current and future experiments should set out to measure the effective di-Higgs couplings $C_{ff'}$, whether these couplings are FV or flavour-conserving. We also present a matching between our formalism and the SMEFT operators and show the bounds in both bases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the Optomechanical Dark-matter INstrument (ODIN), based on a new method for the direct detection of low-mass dark matter. We consider dark matter interacting with superfluid helium in an optomechanical cavity. Using an effective field theory, we calculate the rate at which dark matter scatters off phonons in a highly populated, driven acoustic mode of the cavity. This scattering process deposits a phonon into a second acoustic mode in its ground state. The deposited phonon ($\mu$eV range) is then converted to a photon (eV range) via an optomechanical interaction with a pump laser. This photon can be efficiently detected, providing a means to sensitively probe keV scale dark matter. We provide realistic estimates of the backgrounds and discuss the technical challenges associated with such an experiment. We calculate projected limits on dark matter-nucleon interactions for dark matter masses ranging from 0.5 to 300 keV and estimate that a future device could probe cross-sections as low as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-32})$ cm$^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02592v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is currently no evidence for a baryon asymmetry in our Universe. Instead, cosmological observations have only demonstrated the existence of a quark-antiquark asymmetry, which does not necessarily imply a baryon asymmetric Universe, since the baryon number of the dark sector particles is unknown. In this paper we discuss a framework where the total baryon number of the Universe is equal to zero, and where the observed quark-antiquark asymmetry arises from neutron portal interactions with a dark sector fermion $N$ that carries baryon number. In order to render a baryon symmetric universe throughout the whole cosmological history, we introduce a complex scalar $\chi$, with opposite baryon number and with the same initial abundance as $N$. Notably, due to the baryon number conservation, $\chi$ is absolutely stable and could have an abundance today equal to the observed dark matter abundance. Therefore, in this simple framework, the existence of a quark-antiquark asymmetry is intimately related to the existence (and the stability) of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of collinear factorization in the exclusive photoproduction of a $ \pi ^{0}\gamma $ pair with large invariant mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the exclusive photoproduction of a $ \pi ^{0}\gamma $ pair with large invariant mass $ M^{2}_{\gamma \pi} $, which is sensitive to the exchange of either two quarks or two gluons in the $ t $-channel. In this paper, we show that the process involving two-gluon exchanges does not factorize in the Bjorken limit at the leading twist. This can be explicitly demonstrated by the fact that there exist diagrams, which contribute at the leading twist, for which Glauber gluons are trapped, due to the pinching of the contour integration of both the plus and minus component of the Glauber gluon momentum. For the same reason, $\pi^0$-nucleon scattering to two photons also suffers from the same issue. On the other hand, we stress that there are no issues with respect to collinear factorization for the quark channels. By considering an analysis of all potential reduced diagrams of leading pinch-singular surfaces, we argue that the quark channel is safe from Glauber pinches, and therefore, a collinear factorization in that case follows through without any problems. This means that processes where gluon exchanges are forbidden, such as the exclusive photoproduction of $ \pi ^{\pm}\gamma $ and $ \rho^{0,\,\pm} \gamma $, are unaffected by the factorization breaking effects we point out in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes~(PBHs) formed in the early Universe are well-motivated dark matter~(DM) candidates over a wide range of masses. These PBHs could emit detectable signals in the form of photons, electrons, and neutrinos through Hawking radiation. We consider the null observations of astrophysical $\bar{\nu}_{e}$ flux from several neutrino detectors and set new constraints on the PBHs as the dominant DM component to be above $6.4\times10^{15}\,{\rm g}$. We also estimate the expected constraints with JUNO for the prospects in the near future. Lastly, we note that the diffuse supernova neutrino background~(DSNB) is an unavoidable isotropic background. We thus estimate the sensitivity floor for PBH parameter space due to the DSNB and show that it is challenging for neutrino detectors to identify PBHs as they constitute 100\% of the DM above a mass of 9$\times10^{15}$g.</description>

      <title>Axion cogenesis without isocurvature perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion rotations can simultaneously explain the dark matter abundance and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe by kinetic misalignment and axiogenesis. We consider a scenario in which the Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking field is as large as the Planck scale during inflation and the axion rotation is initiated by the inflaton-induced potential immediately after the end of inflation. This is a realization of the cogenesis scenario that is free of problems with domain walls and isocurvature perturbations thanks to large explicit Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking at the Planck scale during inflation. The baryon asymmetry can be more efficiently produced by lepto-axiogenesis, in which case the axion mass is predicted to be larger than $O(0.1)$ meV. We also discuss a UV complete model in supersymmetric theories.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Generation of the Baryon Asymmetry from a Scale Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel baryogenesis scenario where the baryon asymmetry originates directly from a hierarchy between two fundamental mass scales: the electroweak scale $v$ and the Planck scale $M_P$, in the form of \begin{equation} Y_B \sim \sqrt{\frac{v}{M_P}} \, . \nonumber \end{equation} This relation straightforwardly gives the observed baryon yield today $Y_B$, which can be a hint for underlying fundamental physics. We provide an example of baryogenesis models that yield this relation. Our model is based on the neutrino-portal Affleck-Dine mechanism, which generates the asymmetry of the Affleck-Dine sector during the radiation-dominated era and subsequently transfers it to the baryon number before the electroweak phase transition. The observed baryon asymmetry is then a natural outcome of this scenario. The model is testable as it predicts the existence of a Majoron with a keV mass and an electroweak scale decay constant. The impact of the relic Majoron on the effective number of neutrinos ($\Delta N_{\rm eff}$) can be measured through near-future cosmic microwave background observations.</description>

      <title>Relic density and temperature evolution of a light dark sector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed a set of four fully coupled Boltzmann equations to precisely determine the relic density and temperature of dark matter by including three distinct sectors: dark matter, light scalar, and standard model sectors. The intricacies of heat transfer between dark matter (DM) and the standard model sector through a light scalar particle are explored, inspired by stringent experimental constraints on the scalar-Higgs mixing angle and the DM-scalar coupling. Three distinct sectors emerge prior to DM freeze-out, requiring fully coupled Boltzmann equations to accurately compute relic density. Investigation of forbidden, resonance, and secluded DM scenarios demonstrates significant deviations between established methods and the novel approach with fully coupled Boltzmann equations. Despite increased computational demands, this emphasizes the need for improved precision in relic density calculations, underlining the importance of incorporating these equations in comprehensive analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the form factors of the transitions $B_{(s)} \to D_{0}^{\ast}(2300),D_{s0}^{\ast}(2317),$ $ D_{s1}(2460) $ and $ D_{s1}(2536)$ in the covariant light-front quark model (CLFQM), where these final states are considered as P-wave excited charmed mesons. In order to obtain the form factors for the physical transition processes, we need to extend these form factors from the space-like region to the time-like region. The $q^{2}$-dependence for each transition form factor is also plotted. Then, combined with those form factors, the branching ratios of the two-body nonleptonic decays $B_{(s)}\to D^*_{(s)0}(2300,2317)M, D_{s1}(2460,2536)M$ with $M$ being a light pseudoscalar (vector) meson or a charmed meson are calculated by considering the QCD radiative corrections to the hadronic matrix elements with the QCD factorization approach. Most of our predictions are comparable to the results given by other theoretical approaches and the present available data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first systematic study of the relativistic axial-vector four-current distributions inside a nucleon. We show in particular that the slope of the axial form factor $G_A(Q^2)$ in the forward limit -- conventionally denoted as $R^2_A$ in the literature -- does not represent the three-dimensional mean-square axial radius in the Breit frame, but corresponds instead to a contribution to the mean-square spin radius. We derive explicit expressions for the latter in different frames and find in general additional contributions that depend on both the nucleon mass and the forward values of the axial-vector form factors $G_A(0)$ and $G_P(0)$. This provides an additional key motivation for on-going lattice QCD calculations and future experimental measurements of the induced pseudoscalar form factor $G_P(Q^2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16037v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the $U(1)_X$SSM, we delve into the flavor violation of $h \rightarrow bs$, where $h$ is identified with the SM-like Higgs boson discovered at the LHC. As the U(1) extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), the U(1)XSSM has new super fields such as right-handed neutrinos and three Higgs singlets. We conduct a thorough analysis of the underlying mechanisms and parameter dependencies of $h \rightarrow bs$ in the $U(1)_X$SSM. In the $U(1)_X$SSM, we discover that the Br$(h \rightarrow bs)$ for the Higgs decay to $bs$ could significantly differ from the expectation in the standard model (SM), depending on the values of the new parameters introduced in the model. Our research not only contributes to a deeper understanding of Higgs physics within the $U(1)_X$SSM, but also provides valuable guidance for new physics (NP).</description>

      <title>Analysis of experimental data on neutron decay for the possibility of the existence of the right vector boson $W_R$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03440v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of the latest most accurate experimental data on neutron decay for the possibility of the existence of the right vector boson $W_R$ was carried out. As the result of the analysis, it was found that there is an indication of the existence of the right vector boson $W_R$ with a mass of $M_{W_R} = 304_{-22}^{+28} \text{GeV}$ and a mixing angle with $W_L: \zeta= -0.038\pm0.014$. This result should be considered, on the one hand, as a challenge to experimental physics at colliders, where the upper limit on the mass of the right vector boson $W_R$ is significantly higher, and on the other hand, it indicates the need for even more accurate measurements of neutron decay and its theoretical analysis. Possible consequences are considered, assuming that the result can be confirmed. First, an extension of the Standard Model by introducing right vector bosons $W_R^{\pm},Z_R$ and right neutrinos would be required. Second, right neutrinos can be considered as candidates for dark matter.</description>

      <title>A Light QCD Axion with Hilltop Misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the cosmological evolution of a light QCD axion and identify the parameter space to obtain the correct relic dark matter abundance. The axion potential is flattened at the origin, corresponding to the only minimum, while it is unsuppressed at $\pi$. These potential features arise by assuming a mirror sector with the strong CP phase $\bar\theta$ shifted by $\pi$ compared to the SM sector, which allows the mirror axion potential to be tuned against the usual QCD axion potential. Before the QCD phase transition, assuming the mirror sector is decoupled and much colder than the SM thermal bath, the mirror sector potential dominates, causing the axion to initially roll to a temporary minimum at $\pi$. However, after the QCD phase transition, the potential minimum changes, and the axion relaxes from the newly created "hilltop" near $\pi$ to the CP-conserving minimum at the origin. As the axion adiabatically tracks this shift in the potential minimum through the QCD phase transition, with non-adiabatic evolution near $\pi$ and 0, it alters the usual prediction of the dark matter abundance. Consequently, this "hilltop" misalignment mechanism opens new regions of axion parameter space, with the correct relic abundance while still solving the strong CP problem, that could be explored in future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By solving the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, possible hadronic molecules in the $D^*\bar K$-$D\bar K^*$ coupled-channel system are investigated with the one-meson exchange potentials, where both vector and pseudoscalar mesons are considered as exchange particles. We find an S-wave virtual state with mass $M=2487$ MeV, and a resonance with $M=2759$ and width $\Gamma=18$ MeV. In the $D^* \bar K$ invariant mass distribution, the virtual state appears as a cusp at the $D^*\bar K$ threshold, while the resonance potentially manifests as a dip. In particular, we take into account the $D\bar K \pi$ three-body dynamics due to the on-shell pion exchange and the finite decay width for $\bar K^*$. Additionally, the SU(4) breaking effect in the coupling between charmed and light mesons is investigated in our work. Our results also indicate that the accurate measurement for the decay width of the $D\bar K^*$ resonance can help us to evaluate this effect in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the determination for the spin-parity quantum numbers of the $X(2370)$ meson at BESIII, we extend our dispersive analysis on hadronic ground states to excited states. The idea is to start with the dispersion relation which a correlation function obeys, and subtract the known ground-state contribution from the involved spectral density. Solving the resultant dispersion relation as an inverse problem with available operator-product-expansion inputs, we extract excited-state masses from the subtracted spectral density. This formalism is verified by means of the application to the series of $\rho$ resonances, which establishes the $\rho(770)$, $\rho(1450)$ and $\rho(1700)$ mesons one by one under the sequential subtraction procedure. Our previous study has suggested the admixture of the $f_0(1370)$, $f_0(1500)$ and $f_0(1710)$ mesons (the $\eta(1760)$ meson) to be the lightest scalar (pseudoscalar) glueball. The present work predicts that the $f_0(2200)$ ($X(2370)$) meson is the first excited scalar (pseudoscalar) glueball.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic strings, theoretical one-dimensional topological defects from the early universe, provide a valuable opportunity for exploring dark matter (DM) production and gravitational wave (GW) emission. Our study investigates the production of gauge bosons and GW emission from cosmic string decay, considering the constraints imposed by cosmological observations. We specifically examine how gauge bosons radiated from strings contribute to DM and dark radiation, with limits set by the observed DM abundance and cosmic microwave background data, respectively. Additionally, we analyze the gravitational wave spectrum of this model across both low and high frequencies. Notably, the spectrum typically follows a $f^{-1/3}$ pattern at high frequencies, beyond the pivot frequency $f_*$. We derive an analytical expression for the frequency $f_*$ and confirm its accuracy through numerical verification. Furthermore, we compare the GW spectrum of this model with the forecasted capabilities of future GW observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, the Big Bang Observer, and $\mu$Ares. Finally, we discuss how these considerations impact the model parameters, specifically the gauge boson mass and the energy scale of U(1) symmetry breaking, providing insights into how cosmic strings could enhance our understanding of DM and GW astronomy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theories of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking predict a strong first order cosmological phase transition: we compute the resulting signals, primordial black holes and gravitational waves. These theories employ one SM-neutral scalar, plus some extra model-dependent particle to get the desired quantum potential out of classical scale invariance. We consider models where the extra particle is a scalar singlet, or vectors of an extended U(1) or SU(2) gauge sector. In models where the extra particle is stable, it provides a particle Dark Matter candidate with freeze-out abundance that tends to dominate over primordial black holes. These can instead be DM in models without a particle DM candidate. Gravitational waves arise at a level observable in future searches, even in regions where DM cannot be directly tested.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study for the first time jet-medium interactions in heavy-ion collisions with introduction of saturation and Sudakov effects with parameters tuned for upcoming forward calorimeter acceptances in experiments, in particular the ALICE FoCal detector. We focus on $\gamma +$jet correlations by taking into account in-medium parton evolution using the BDIM equation that describes jet interactions with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) combined with vacuum-like emissions (VLE). We systematically introduce the early time gluon saturation dynamics through the small-$x$ Improved Transverse Momentum Dependent factorization (ITMD). For our purpose, we use Monte Carlo programs KATIE and TMDICE to generate hard events and in-medium parton evolution, respectively. We present results of azimuthal correlations and nuclear modification ratios to gauge the impact of the gluon saturation effects at early time for the in-medium jet energy loss.</description>

Abstract: The double-gluon hybrid meson configuration was recently proposed and investigated within QCD sum rules. In this talk, we discuss the color structures of the double-gluon hybrid meson and construct current operators with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$ for two of the structures. In the framework of QCD sum rules, we consider the condensates up to dimension-8 at the leading order of $\alpha_{s}$ for both charmonium and the bottomonium systems. The results indicate that the masses of the $1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$ charmonium double-gluon hybrid mesons are approximately $6.1-7.2$ GeV and $6.3-6.4$ GeV, respectively. As for the bottomonium systems, their masses fall within the range of $13.7-14.3$ GeV and $12.6-13.3$ GeV for the $1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$ channels, respectively. Additionally, the charmonium hybrids could be produced in the radiative decays of bottomonium mesons in BelleII experiment.</description>

      <title>Loop-level double-copy for massive fermions in the fundamental</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14861v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find that unitarity cuts and the duality between color and kinematics are sufficient constraints to bootstrap $D$-dimensional QCD scattering amplitudes starting from three-particle tree-level. Specifically, we calculate tree level amplitudes through six-points, as well as the four-point one-loop correction for massive fermions in the fundamental representation of the gauge group -- constructing a color-dual representation of the latter for the first time. To do so we clarify a prescription for functional kinematic ansatze involving fermionic matter. The advantages of color-dual calculation, familiar from particles in the adjoint, also apply here: only a small number of basis topologies must be constrained via physical information of the theory, and algebraic relations propagate this to a full solution. As all the QCD amplitudes we construct here are color-dual, they trivially generate $D$-dimensional amplitudes in gravitational theories via double-copy construction.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Spectral Method: From Atomic Orbitals to Classical Self-Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03798v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can classical systems be described analytically at all orders in their interaction strength? For periodic and approximately periodic systems, the answer is yes, as we show in this work. Our analytical approach, which we call the \textit{Quantum Spectral Method}, is based on a novel application of Bohr's correspondence principle, obtaining non-perturbative classical dynamics as the classical limit of \textit{quantum matrix elements}. A major application of our method is the calculation of self-force as the classical limit of atomic radiative transitions. We demonstrate this by calculating an adiabatic electromagnetic inspiral, along with its associated radiation, at all orders in the multipole expansion. Finally, we propose a future application of the Quantum Spectral Method to compute scalar and gravitational self-force in Schwarzschild, analytically.</description>

      <title>Significant impact of Galactic dark matter particles on annihilation signals from Sagittarius analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the gamma-ray signal from dark matter (DM) annihilation from analogues of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy in the Auriga cosmological simulations. For velocity-dependent annihilation cross sections, we compute emissions from simulated Sgr subhalos and from the Milky Way (MW) foreground. In addition to the annihilation signals from DM particles bound to Sgr, we consider for the first time the annihilation of DM particles bound to the MW that overlap spatially with Sgr. For p-wave models this contribution can enhance the signal by over an order of magnitude, while for d-wave models the enhancement can be over three orders of magnitude. For Sommerfeld and s-wave models, the corresponding emission does not significantly change. For the Sommerfeld model, the Sgr source can be visible above the MW foreground emission, while for s, p and d-wave models, the signal towards Sgr is most likely dominated by foreground MW emission. We interpret our results within the context of the observed gamma-ray emission from Sgr. We find that, given the background emission estimated from this region, the templates from simulations likely have spatial morphology that is too extended to explain the point-like emission that is observed.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction from self-interacting dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Merging compact objects such as binary black holes provide a promising probe for the physics of dark matter (DM). The gravitational waves emitted during inspiral potentially allow one to detect DM spikes around black holes. This is because the dynamical friction force experienced by the inspiralling black hole alters the orbital period and thus the gravitational wave signal. Aims. The dynamical friction arising from DM can potentially differ from the collisionless case when DM is subject to self-interactions. This paper aims to understand how self-interactions impact dynamical friction. Methods. To study the dynamical friction force, we use idealised N-body simulations, where we include self-interacting dark matter. Results. We find that the dynamical friction force for inspiralling black holes would be typically enhanced by DM self-interactions compared to a collisionless medium (ignoring differences in the DM density). At lower velocities below the sound speed, we find that the dynamical friction force can be reduced by the presence of self-interactions. Conclusions. DM self-interactions have a significant effect on the dynamical friction for black hole mergers. Assuming the Chandrasekhar formula may underpredict the deceleration due to dynamical friction.</description>

      <title>MURCA driven Bulk viscosity in neutrino trapped baryonic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine bulk viscosity, taking into account trapped neutrinos in baryonic matter, in the context of binary neutron star mergers. Following the merging event, the binary star can yield a remnant compact object with densities up to $5$ nuclear saturation density and temperature upto $50$ MeV resulting in the retention of neutrinos. We employ two relativistic mean field models, NL3 and DDME2, to describe the neutrino-trapped baryonic matter. The dissipation coefficient is determined by evaluating the Modified URCA interaction rate in the dense baryonic medium, and accounting for perturbations caused by density oscillations. We observe the resonant behavior of bulk viscosity as it varies with the temperature of the medium. The bulk viscosity peak remains within the temperature range of $\sim 13-50$ MeV, depending upon the underlying equation of states and lepton fractions. This temperature range corresponds to the relevant domain of binary neutron star mergers. We also note that in presence of neutrinos in the medium the bulk viscosity peak shifts towards higher temperature and the peak value of bulk viscosity also changes. The time scale of viscous dissipation is dictated by the beta-off-equilibrium susceptibilities derived from the nuclear equation of state. The resulting viscous decay time scale ranges from $32-100$ milliseconds, which aligns with the order of magnitude of the post-merger object's survival time in some specific scenarios.</description>

      <title>High energy neutrino production in gamma-ray bursts: dependence of the neutrino signal on the jet composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heavy nuclei can be synthetized or entrained in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with implications on the high-energy neutrino emission. By means of a Monte-Carlo algorithm, we model nuclear cascades and investigate their impact on the neutrino production considering kinetic dominated jets (in the internal shock model, including a dissipative photosphere) as well as Poynting flux dominated jets (for a jet model invoking internal-collision-induced magnetic reconnection and turbulence, ICMART). We find that the ICMART model allows for efficient nuclear cascades leading to an overall larger neutrino fluence than in the other two jet models. The survival of nuclei and inefficient nuclear cascades lead to an overall reduction of the neutrino fluence up to one order of magnitude. However, if nuclei are disintegrated, the neutrino fluence may be comparable to the one emitted from a jet loaded with protons. Exploring the parameter space of jet properties, we conclude that the composition and the bulk Lorentz factor have significant impact on the efficiency of nuclear cascades as well as the spectral shape of the expected neutrino fluence. On the other hand, the neutrino spectral distribution is less sensitive to the power-law index of the accelerated population of protons or heavier nuclei. For what concerns the diffuse emission of neutrinos from GRBs, we find that the uncertainty due to the jet composition can be at most comparable to the one related to the GRB cosmological rate.</description>

      <title>Robust Preference for Dynamical Dark Energy in DESI BAO and SN Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements released by DESI, when combined with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck and two different samples of Type Ia supernovae (Pantheon-Plus and DESY5) reveal a preference for Dynamical Dark Energy (DDE) characterized by a present-day quintessence-like equation of state that crossed into the phantom regime in the past. A core ansatz for this result is assuming a linear Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization $w(a) = w_0 + w_a (1-a)$ to describe the evolution of the DE equation of state (EoS). In this paper, we test if and to what extent this assumption impacts the results. To prevent broadening uncertainties in cosmological parameter inference and facilitate direct comparison with the baseline CPL case, we focus on 4 alternative well-known models that, just like CPL, consist of only two free parameters: the present-day DE EoS ($w_0$) and a parameter quantifying its dynamical evolution ($w_a$). We demonstrate that the preference for DDE remains robust regardless of the parameterization: $w_0$ consistently remains in the quintessence regime, while $w_a$ consistently indicates a preference for a dynamical evolution towards the phantom regime. This tendency is significantly strengthened by DESY5 SN measurements. By comparing the best-fit $\chi^2$ obtained within each DDE model, we notice that the linear CPL parameterization is not the best-fitting case. Among the models considered, the EoS proposed by Barboza and Alcaniz consistently leads to the most significant improvement.</description>

      <title>Exploring Relativistic World of Electromagnetism on Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is the theoretical structure of electromagnetism that led Einstein to special relativity. To foster an intuitive understanding of relativity's core idea, it is valuable to create a fully special relativistic computer simulation incorporating electromagnetic dynamics. In this paper, we provide a basic formulation for such an implementation. Specifically, the player observes the world via their past light cone and experiences the Lorentz force generated by the electromagnetic field at their spacetime location. The electromagnetic field at any given spacetime point is determined by the sublight-speed motion of individual point charges on the past light cone of that spacetime point.</description>

      <title>Chiral condensate in a holographic dilute nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study chiral condensate in cold nuclear matter on the basis of holographic theory, which would be dual to a baryon system in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in the confinement phase. Our model is a holographic model based on the D$3$/D$7$ branes. The magnitude of the chiral condensate obtained in our model is found to gradually increase with increasing baryon density $n$ within the range of the dilute nucleon gas, $n&lt;1$, where our model is available. This is a result for the chiral condensate in the holographic model as a function of $n$, which can be compared to the chiral perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes in the Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If primordial black holes (PBHs) of asteroidal mass make up the entire dark matter they could be detectable through their gravitational influence in the solar system. In this work, we study the perturbations that PBHs induce on the orbits of planets. Detailed numerical simulations of the solar system, embedded in a halo of PBHs, are performed. Using the Earth-Mars distance as an observational probe, we show that the perturbations are below the current detection limits and thus PBHs are not directly constrained by solar system ephemerides. We estimate that an improvement in the measurement accuracy by more than an order of magnitude or the extraction of signals well below the noise level are required to detect the gravitational influence of PBHs in the solar system in the foreseeable future.</description>
