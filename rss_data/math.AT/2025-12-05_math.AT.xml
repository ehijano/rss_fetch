      <title>Intrinsic tensor products and a Ganea-type extension of the five-term exact sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a right-exactness theorem for the cross-effects of bifunctors, and consequently for cosmash products, in Janelidze-M\'arki-Tholen semi-abelian categories. This result motivates an intrinsic definition of a bilinear product, a tensor-like operation on objects of a category, constructed in terms of limits and colimits. Given two objects in the category, their bilinear product is the abelian object obtained as the cosmash product in the category of two-nilpotent objects of the reflections of these objects. In many concrete cases, this operation, applied to a pair of abelian objects, captures a classical tensor product. We explain this by proving a recognition theorem, which states that any symmetric, bi-cocontinuous bifunctor on an abelian variety of algebras can be recovered as the bilinear product within a suitable semi-abelian variety, namely of algebras over a certain two-nilpotent operad. In other words, the extra structure carried by such a bifunctor on the abelian variety (for instance, a tensor product, known in the literature) is encoded by means of a surrounding semi-abelian variety whose abelian core is the original variety.
  We illustrate the construction with several examples, develop its basic properties, and compare it to the semi-abelian analogue of the Brown-Loday non-abelian tensor product. As an application, we present a categorical version of Ganea's six-term exact homology sequence. Finally, we characterise abelian extensions via internal action cores, yielding explicit descriptions of cosmash products and bilinear products in certain categories of representations.</description>

      <title>The Basic Reproduction Number for Petri Net Models: A Next-Generation Matrix Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02344v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The basic reproduction number ($R_0$) is an epidemiological metric that represents the average number of new infections caused by a single infectious individual in a completely susceptible population. The methodology for calculating this metric is well-defined for numerous model types, including, most prominently, Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The basic reproduction number is used in disease modeling to predict the potential of an outbreak and the transmissibility of a disease, as well as by governments to inform public health interventions and resource allocation for controlling the spread of diseases. A Petri Net (PN) is a directed bipartite graph where places, transitions, arcs, and the firing of the arcs determine the dynamic behavior of the system. Petri Net models have been an increasingly used tool within the epidemiology community. However, no generalized method for calculating $R_0$ directly from PN models has been established. Thus, in this paper, we establish a generalized computational framework for calculating $R_0$ directly from Petri Net models. We adapt the next-generation matrix method to be compatible with multiple Petri Net formalisms, including both deterministic Variable Arc Weight Petri Nets (VAPNs) and stochastic continuous-time Petri Nets (SPNs). We demonstrate the method's versatility on a range of complex epidemiological models, including those with multiple strains, asymptomatic states, and nonlinear dynamics. Crucially, we numerically validate our framework by demonstrating that the analytically derived $R_0$ values are in strong agreement with those estimated from simulation data, thereby confirming the method's accuracy and practical utility.</description>

      <title>Graphical configuration spaces, Contractads and Formality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite simple connected graph $\Gamma$, the graphical configuration space $\mathrm{Conf}_{\Gamma}(X)$ is the space of collections of points in $X$ indexed by the vertices of $\Gamma$, where points corresponding to adjacent vertices must be distinct. When $X=\mathbb{R}^d$ and the points are replaced by small disks, the resulting spaces for all possible graphs fit together into an algebraic structure that extends the little disks operad, called the little disks contractad $\mathcal{D}_d$. In this paper, we investigate the homotopical and algebraic properties of the little disks contractad $\mathcal{D}_d$. We construct and study Fulton-MacPherson compactifications of graphical configuration spaces, which provide a convenient model for $\mathcal{D}_d$ within the class of compact manifolds with boundary. Using these and wonderful compactifications, we prove that $\mathcal{D}_d$ is formal in the category of (Hopf) contractads for $d=1$, $d=2$, and for chordal graphs for any $d$. We also identify the first obstructions to coformality in the case of cyclic graphs. In addition, we give a combinatorial description of the cell structure of $\mathcal{D}_2$ and present applications to the study of graphical configuration spaces $\mathrm{Conf}_{\Gamma}(X)$ using the language of twisted algebras.</description>

      <title>A note on the hit problem for the polynomial algebra in the case of odd primes and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17908v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $P_h = \mathbb{F}_p[t_1,\dots,t_h]$ be the polynomial algebra over $\mathbb{F}_p$ ($p$ prime). We consider the hit problem: finding a minimal generating set for $P_h$ as a module over the mod $p$ Steenrod algebra $\mathscr{A}_p$, or equivalently, determining a basis for $\mathbb{F}_p \otimes_{\mathscr{A}_p} P_h$. This problem is related to the $\mathscr{A}_p$-module structure of $H^*(V; \mathbb{F}_p) \cong \Lambda(V^\sharp) \otimes P_h$, where $V$ is an elementary abelian $p$-group of rank $h$. Information about the hit problem aids in studying the Singer algebraic transfer $Tr_h^{\mathscr{A}_p}$, a homomorphism from $GL(h, \mathbb{F}_p)$-coinvariants related to $H^*(V; \mathbb{F}_p)$ to ${\rm Ext}_{\mathscr{A}_p}^{h,h+*}(\mathbb{F}_p, \mathbb{F}_p)$, which helps analyze Ext groups. This work studies $\mathscr{A}_p$-generators for $P_h$ when $p$ is an odd prime. As an application, we investigate the third algebraic transfer ($h=3$) in certain generic degrees. Our main result shows that this transfer is an isomorphism in these degrees.</description>

      <title>Stability of 0-dimensional persistent homology in enriched and sparsified point clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give bounds for dimension 0 persistent homology and codimension 1 homology of Vietoris--Rips, alpha, and cubical complex filtrations from finite sets related by enrichment (adding new elements), sparsification (removing elements), and aligning to a grid (uniformly discretizing elements). For enrichment we use barycentric subdivision, for sparsification we use a minimum separating distance, and for aligning to a grid we take the quotient when dividing each coordinate value by a fixed step size. We are motivated by applications presenting large and irregular datasets, and the development of persistent homology to better work with them. In particular, we consider an application to ecology, in which the state of an observed species is inferred through a high-dimensional space with environmental variables as dimensions. This ``hypervolume'' has geometry (volume, convexity) and topology (connectedness, homology), which are known to be related to the current and potentially future status of the species. We offer an approach for the analysis of hypervolumes with topological guarantees, complementary to current statistical methods, giving precise bounds between persistence diagrams of Vietoris--Rips and alpha complexes, and a duality identity for cubical complexes. Implementation of our methods, called TopoAware, is made available in C++, Python, and R, building upon the GUDHI library.</description>

      <title>Localization and flexibilization in symplectic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.06069v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the critical Weinstein infinity-category -- the result of stabilizing the category of Weinstein sectors and inverting subcritical morphisms -- and for every finite collection P of integers, construct a P-flexibilization endofunctor. Our main result is that P-flexibilization is an idempotent localization functor of the critical Weinstein infinity-category, allowing us to characterize the essential image of the endofunctor by a universal property. This localization has the effect of replacing every Weinstein sector with one in which P is invertible in the wrapped Fukaya category and hence is a symplectic analogue of topological localization of Bousfield and Sullivan, answering a question of Abouzaid and Seidel. When P = {0}, our construction recovers Cieliebak and Eliashberg's flexibilization procedure. Moreover, we show that P-flexibilization is symmetric monoidal as a functor of higher categories, and hence gives rise to a new way of constructing E-infinity-commutative algebra objects from symplectic geometry.</description>

      <title>Modular operads, iterated distributive laws and a nerve theorem for circuit algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20262v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circuit algebras are a symmetric version of Jones's planar algebras. They originated in quantum topology as a framework for encoding virtual crossings. Oriented circuit algebras are equivalent to wheeled props. This paper
  extends existing results for modular operads to construct a graphical calculus and monad for general circuit algebras and prove an abstract nerve theorem. Specialisations of these results to wheeled props follow as straightforward corollaries.
  The machinery used to prove these results relies on a subtle interplay between distributive laws and abstract nerve theory, and provides extra insights into the underlying structures.</description>
