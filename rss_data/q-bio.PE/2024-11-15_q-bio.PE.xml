      <title>How to quantify interaction strengths? A critical rethinking of the interaction Jacobian and evaluation methods for non-parametric inference in time series analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying interaction strengths between state variables in dynamical systems is essential for understanding ecological networks. Within the empirical dynamic modeling approach, multivariate S-map infers the interaction Jacobian from time series data without assuming specific dynamical models. This approach enables the non-parametric statistical inference of interspecific interactions through state space reconstruction. However, deviations in the biological interpretation and numerical implementation of the interaction Jacobian from its mathematical definition pose challenges. We mathematically reintroduce the interaction Jacobian using differential quotients, uncovering two problems: (1) the mismatch between the interaction Jacobian and its biological meaning complicates comparisons between interspecific and intraspecific interactions; (2) the interaction Jacobian is not fully implemented in the parametric Jacobian numerically derived from given parametric models, especially using ordinary differential equations. As a result, model-based evaluations of S-map methods become inappropriate. To address these problems, (1) we propose adjusting the diagonal elements of the interaction Jacobian by subtracting 1 to resolve the comparability problem between inter- and intraspecific interaction strengths. Simulations of population dynamics showed that this adjustment prevents overestimation of intraspecific interaction strengths. (2) We introduce an alternative parametric Jacobian and then cumulative interaction strength (CIS), providing a more rigorous benchmark for evaluating S-map methods. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the numerical gap between CIS and the existing parametric Jacobian is substantial in realistic scenarios, suggesting CIS as preferred benchmark. These solutions offer a clearer framework for developing non-parametric approaches in ecological time series analysis.</description>

      <title>Finding high posterior density phylogenies by systematically extending a directed acyclic graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian phylogenetics typically estimates a posterior distribution, or aspects thereof, using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. These methods integrate over tree space by applying local rearrangements to move a tree through its space as a random walk. Previous work explored the possibility of replacing this random walk with a systematic search, but was quickly overwhelmed by the large number of probable trees in the posterior distribution. In this paper we develop methods to sidestep this problem using a recently introduced structure called the subsplit directed acyclic graph (sDAG). This structure can represent many trees at once, and local rearrangements of trees translate to methods of enlarging the sDAG. Here we propose two methods of introducing, ranking, and selecting local rearrangements on sDAGs to produce a collection of trees with high posterior density. One of these methods successfully recovers the set of high posterior density trees across a range of data sets. However, we find that a simpler strategy of aggregating trees into an sDAG in fact is computationally faster and returns a higher fraction of probable trees.</description>

      <title>Pheromone-Guided Navigation of Potential Mates: A Distinct Exploration Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Animals, especially insects, navigate their environments using complex strategies that integrate responses to chemical signals such as pheromones. The relative importance an insect places on foraging, finding a mate or other tasks can significantly influence its movement patterns. This study uncovers the distinct exploration strategies that emerge when these priorities vary. A new model is introduced that explicitly treats a pair of insects and their response to each other's pheromones. The strategy results in dynamics that exhibit characteristic anomalous scaling in displacement and non-Gaussian distributions of position; specifically, compressed exponential distributions for the number of encounters and the total duration of encounters. Our model not only elucidates these emergent behaviours but also provides insight into optimizing encounter frequencies. These strategies can be inverted to design pheromone-based traps for luring target species to specific areas for removal. The model is also applicable more broadly to pairs of agents that both respond to the paths traced by themselves and each other.</description>

      <title>Lattice-based stochastic models motivate non-linear diffusion descriptions of memory-based dispersal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of memory and cognition in the movement of individuals (e.g. animals) within a population, is thought to play an important role in population dispersal. In response, there has been increasing interest in incorporating spatial memory effects into classical partial differential equation (PDE) models of animal dispersal. However, the specific detail of the transport terms, such as diffusion and advection terms, that ought to be incorporated into PDE models to accurately reflect the memory effect remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we propose a straightforward lattice-based model where the movement of individuals depends on both crowding effects and the historic distribution within the simulation. The advantage of working with the individual-based model is that it is straightforward to propose and implement memory effects within the simulation in a way that is more biologically intuitive than simply proposing heuristic extensions of classical PDE models. Through deriving the continuum limit description of our stochastic model, we obtain a novel nonlinear diffusion equation which encompasses memory-based diffusion terms. For the first time we reveal the relationship between memory-based diffusion and the individual-based movement mechanisms that depend upon memory effects. Through repeated stochastic simulation and numerical explorations of the mean-field PDE model, we show that the new PDE model accurately describes the expected behaviour of the stochastic model, and we also explore how memory effects impact population dispersal.</description>

      <title>High fitness paths can connect proteins with low sequence overlap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure and function of a protein are determined by its amino acid sequence. While random mutations change a protein's sequence, evolutionary forces shape its structural fold and biological activity. Studies have shown that neutral networks can connect a local region of sequence space by single residue mutations that preserve viability. However, the larger-scale connectedness of protein morphospace remains poorly understood. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have enabled us to computationally predict a protein's structure and quantify its functional plausibility. Here we build on these tools to develop an algorithm that generates viable paths between distantly related extant protein pairs. The intermediate sequences in these paths differ by single residue changes over subsequent steps - substitutions, insertions and deletions are admissible moves. Their fitness is evaluated using the protein language model ESM2, and maintained as high as possible subject to the constraints of the traversal. We document the qualitative variation across paths generated between progressively divergent protein pairs, some of which do not even acquire the same structural fold. The ease of interpolating between two sequences could be used as a proxy for the likelihood of homology between them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model in which particles belonging to two species proliferate with volume exclusion on an expanding surface. If the surface expands uniformly, we show that the domains formed by the two species present a critical behavior. We compute the critical exponents characterizing the decay of interfaces and the size distribution of domains using a mean-field theory. These mean-field exponents agree very accurately with those fitted in numerical simulations, suggesting that the theory is exact.</description>

      <title>Natural Averaging May Complement Known Biological Constraints in Bi-parental Reproduction's Advantages Over Mono-parental in Conserving Species Quantitative Traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15795v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Commonly recognized evolutionarily relevant effects of sexual reproduction include increased diversity, accelerated adaptation, and constrained accumulation of deleterious mutations, along with a secondary effect of species genotype homogenization. Still, strong published arguments prioritize the contribution of biological mechanisms underlying bi-parental reproduction to maintaining species identity above their contribution to diversity. Here, we contribute to the latter position. In an initial mathematical analysis and simulation, we show that in an environment where copying is prone to error, quantitative polygenic traits that are shared within a parents' generation are transmitted to future generations under bi-parental reproduction with less deviation than under asexual reproduction. Furthermore, we abstract away many biological details, and show that this trait conservation is a general statistical effect, driven by the very nature of mixing of parental traits, separately from DNA repair and from the reproductive failures, barriers and disadvantages induced by biological mechanisms. Since survival of ecosystem interaction networks depends on the ability of individuals to replace the networked function of failing, dying or absent members of the same species, more faithful inheritance of common traits helps sustain species and ecosystems. This sustaining effect may have contributed to the very evolution of sexual reproduction.</description>

      <title>Joint identifiability of ancestral sequence, phylogeny and mutation rates under the TKF91 model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of identifying jointly the ancestral sequence, the phylogeny and the parameters in models of DNA sequence evolution with insertion and deletion (indel). Under the classical TKF91 model of sequence evolution, we obtained explicit formulas for the root sequence, the pairwise distances of leaf sequences, as well as the scaled rates of indel and substitution in terms of the distribution of the leaf sequences of an arbitrary phylogeny. These explicit formulas not only strengthen existing invertibility results and work for phylogeny that are not necessarily ultrametric, but also lead to new estimators with less assumption compared with the existing literature. Our simulation study demonstrates that these estimators are statistically consistent as the number of independent samples tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Disease Incidence in a Stochastic SVIRS Model with Waning Immunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the long-term behaviour and incidence of a vaccine-preventable contact disease, under the assumption that both vaccine protection and immunity after recovery are not lifelong. The mathematical model is developed in a stochastic markovian framework. The evolution of the disease in a finite population is thus represented by a three-dimensional continuous-time Markov chain, which is versatile enough to be able to compensate for the loss of protection by including vaccination before the onset of the outbreak and also during the course of the epidemics.</description>
