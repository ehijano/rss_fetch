      <title>Automatic Forward Model Parameterization with Bayesian Inference of Conformational Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To quantify how well theoretical predictions of structural ensembles agree with experimental measurements, we depend on the accuracy of forward models. These models are computational frameworks that generate observable quantities from molecular configurations based on empirical relationships linking specific molecular properties to experimental measurements. Bayesian Inference of Conformational Populations (BICePs) is a reweighting algorithm that reconciles simulated ensembles with ensemble-averaged experimental observations, even when such observations are sparse and/or noisy. This is achieved by sampling the posterior distribution of conformational populations under experimental restraints as well as sampling the posterior distribution of uncertainties due to random and systematic error. In this study, we enhance the algorithm for the refinement of empirical forward model (FM) parameters. We introduce and evaluate two novel methods for optimizing FM parameters. The first method treats FM parameters as nuisance parameters, integrating over them in the full posterior distribution. The second method employs variational minimization of a quantity called the BICePs score that reports the free energy of `turning on` the experimental restraints. This technique, coupled with improved likelihood functions for handling experimental outliers, facilitates force field validation and optimization, as illustrated in recent studies (Raddi et al. 2023, 2024). Using this approach, we refine parameters that modulate the Karplus relation, crucial for accurate predictions of J-coupling constants based on dihedral angles between interacting nuclei. We validate this approach first with a toy model system, and then for human ubiquitin, predicting six sets of Karplus parameters. This approach, which does not rely on predetermined parameters, enhances predictive accuracy and can be used for many applications.</description>

      <title>Deep Bayesian Filter for Bayes-faithful Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State estimation for nonlinear state space models is a challenging task. Existing assimilation methodologies predominantly assume Gaussian posteriors on physical space, where true posteriors become inevitably non-Gaussian. We propose Deep Bayesian Filtering (DBF) for data assimilation on nonlinear state space models (SSMs). DBF constructs new latent variables $h_t$ on a new latent (``fancy'') space and assimilates observations $o_t$. By (i) constraining the state transition on fancy space to be linear and (ii) learning a Gaussian inverse observation operator $q(h_t|o_t)$, posteriors always remain Gaussian for DBF. Quite distinctively, the structured design of posteriors provides an analytic formula for the recursive computation of posteriors without accumulating Monte-Carlo sampling errors over time steps. DBF seeks the Gaussian inverse observation operators $q(h_t|o_t)$ and other latent SSM parameters (e.g., dynamics matrix) by maximizing the evidence lower bound. Experiments show that DBF outperforms model-based approaches and latent assimilation methods in various tasks and conditions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signal Extraction Against Non-Stationary Instrumental Noises with Deep Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sapce-borne gravitational wave antennas, such as LISA and LISA-like mission (Taiji and Tianqin), will offer novel perspectives for exploring our Universe while introduce new challenges, especially in data analysis. Aside from the known challenges like high parameter space dimension, superposition of large number of signals and etc., gravitational wave detections in space would be more seriously affected by anomalies or non-stationarities in the science measurements. Considering the three types of foreseeable non-stationarities including data gaps, transients (glitches), and time-varying noise auto-correlations, which may come from routine maintenance or unexpected disturbances during science operations, we developed a deep learning model for accurate signal extractions confronted with such anomalous scenarios. Our model exhibits the same performance as the current state-of-the-art models do for the ideal and anomaly free scenario, while shows remarkable adaptability in extractions of coalescing massive black hole binary signal against all three types of non-stationarities and even their mixtures. This also provide new explorations into the robustness studies of deep learning models for data processing in space-borne gravitational wave missions.</description>
