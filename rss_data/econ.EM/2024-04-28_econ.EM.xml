      <title>On the testability of common trends in panel data without placebo periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate and discuss the testability of the common trend assumption imposed in Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimation in panel data when not relying on multiple pre-treatment periods for running placebo tests. Our testing approach involves two steps: (i) constructing a control group of non-treated units whose pre-treatment outcome distribution matches that of treated units, and (ii) verifying if this control group and the original non-treated group share the same time trend in average outcomes. Testing is motivated by the fact that in several (but not all) panel data models, a common trend violation across treatment groups implies and is implied by a common trend violation across pre-treatment outcomes. For this reason, the test verifies a sufficient, but (depending on the model) not necessary condition for DiD-based identification. We investigate the finite sample performance of a testing procedure that is based on double machine learning, which permits controlling for covariates in a data-driven manner, in a simulation study and also apply it to labor market data from the National Supported Work Demonstration.</description>

      <title>Overidentification in Shift-Share Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the testability of identifying restrictions commonly employed to assign a causal interpretation to two stage least squares (TSLS) estimators based on Bartik instruments. For homogeneous effects models applied to short panels, our analysis yields testable implications previously noted in the literature for the two major available identification strategies. We propose overidentification tests for these restrictions that remain valid in high dimensional regimes and are robust to heteroskedasticity and clustering. We further show that homogeneous effect models in short panels, and their corresponding overidentification tests, are of central importance by establishing that: (i) In heterogenous effects models, interpreting TSLS as a positively weighted average of treatment effects can impose implausible assumptions on the distribution of the data; and (ii) Alternative identifying strategies relying on long panels can prove uninformative in short panel applications. We highlight the empirical relevance of our results by examining the viability of Bartik instruments for identifying the effect of rising Chinese import competition on US local labor markets.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Estimation of Riesz Representers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.00009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many causal parameters are linear functionals of an underlying regression. The Riesz representer is a key component in the asymptotic variance of a semiparametrically estimated linear functional. We propose an adversarial framework to estimate the Riesz representer using general function spaces. We prove a nonasymptotic mean square rate in terms of an abstract quantity called the critical radius, then specialize it for neural networks, random forests, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces as leading cases. Our estimators are highly compatible with targeted and debiased machine learning with sample splitting; our guarantees directly verify general conditions for inference that allow mis-specification. We also use our guarantees to prove inference without sample splitting, based on stability or complexity. Our estimators achieve nominal coverage in highly nonlinear simulations where some previous methods break down. They shed new light on the heterogeneous effects of matching grants.</description>

      <title>Testability of Reverse Causality Without Exogenous Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.05936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper shows that testability of reverse causality is possible even in the absence of exogenous variation, such as in the form of instrumental variables. Instead of relying on exogenous variation, we achieve testability by imposing relatively weak model restrictions and exploiting that a dependence of residual and purported cause is informative about the causal direction. Our main assumption is that the true functional relationship is nonlinear and that error terms are additively separable. We extend previous results by incorporating control variables and allowing heteroskedastic errors. We build on reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) embeddings of probability distributions to test conditional independence and demonstrate the efficacy in detecting the causal direction in both Monte Carlo simulations and an application to German survey data.</description>

      <title>What To Do (and Not to Do) with Causal Panel Analysis under Parallel Trends: Lessons from A Large Reanalysis Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-way fixed effects (TWFE) models are ubiquitous in causal panel analysis in political science. However, recent methodological discussions challenge their validity in the presence of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) and violations of the parallel trends assumption (PTA). This burgeoning literature has introduced multiple estimators and diagnostics, leading to confusion among empirical researchers on two fronts: the reliability of existing results based on TWFE models and the current best practices. To address these concerns, we examined, replicated, and reanalyzed 37 articles from three leading political science journals that employed observational panel data with binary treatments. Using six newly introduced HTE-robust estimators, we find that although precision may be affected, the core conclusions derived from TWFE estimates largely remain unchanged. PTA violations and insufficient statistical power, however, continue to be significant obstacles to credible inferences. Based on these findings, we offer recommendations for improving practice in empirical research.</description>
