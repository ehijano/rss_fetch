      <title>A functional exchange shunt in the umbilical cord: the role of coiling in solute and heat transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The umbilical cord plays a critical role in delivering nutrients and oxygen from the placenta to the fetus through the umbilical vein, while the two umbilical arteries carry deoxygenated blood with waste products back to the placenta. Although solute exchange in the placenta has been extensively studied, exchange within the cord tissue has not been investigated. Here, we explore the hypothesis that the coiled structure of the umbilical cord could strengthen diffusive coupling between the arteries and the vein, resulting in a functional shunt. We calculate the diffusion of solutes, such as oxygen, and heat in the umbilical cord to quantify how this shunt is affected by vascular configuration within the cord. We demonstrate that the shunt is enhanced by coiling and vessel proximity. Furthermore, our model predicts that typical vascular configurations of the human cord tend to minimise shunting, which could otherwise disrupt thermal regulation of the fetus. We also show that the exchange, amplified by coiling, can provide additional oxygen supply to the cord tissue surrounding the umbilical vessels.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Porous Microstructures: Automatic Design, Simulation, and Permeability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces an open-source computational framework for the generation and permeability evaluation of synthetic porous media. The proposed methodology integrates crystallographic and meshing tools to construct controlled microstructures with tunable porosity, facilitating seamless transitions from geometric modelling to computational domains for numerical simulations. The generated structures are analysed through fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations, leveraging the Entropically Damped Artificial Compressibility (EDAC) formulation in conjunction with the Discretization-Corrected Particle Strength Exchange (DC-PSE) method.
  A novel approach for the numerical estimation of the macroscopic permeability tensor is presented, employing a stochastic upscaling technique inspired by the volume averaging method. To validate the framework, we investigate the transition between creeping and non-Darcy flow regimes through parametric permeability studies, utilizing a one-dimensional approach for practical benchmarking.
  The results establish a foundation for experimental validation and provide insights into the customised design of porous structures for engineering and biomedical applications, offering a versatile tool for research in fluid transport and porous media mechanics.</description>

      <title>TRUSWorthy: Toward Clinically Applicable Deep Learning for Confident Detection of Prostate Cancer in Micro-Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While deep learning methods have shown great promise in improving the effectiveness of prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis by detecting suspicious lesions from trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS), they must overcome multiple simultaneous challenges. There is high heterogeneity in tissue appearance, significant class imbalance in favor of benign examples, and scarcity in the number and quality of ground truth annotations available to train models. Failure to address even a single one of these problems can result in unacceptable clinical outcomes.We propose TRUSWorthy, a carefully designed, tuned, and integrated system for reliable PCa detection. Our pipeline integrates self-supervised learning, multiple-instance learning aggregation using transformers, random-undersampled boosting and ensembling: these address label scarcity, weak labels, class imbalance, and overconfidence, respectively. We train and rigorously evaluate our method using a large, multi-center dataset of micro-ultrasound data. Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art deep learning methods in terms of accuracy and uncertainty calibration, with AUROC and balanced accuracy scores of 79.9% and 71.5%, respectively. On the top 20% of predictions with the highest confidence, we can achieve a balanced accuracy of up to 91%. The success of TRUSWorthy demonstrates the potential of integrated deep learning solutions to meet clinical needs in a highly challenging deployment setting, and is a significant step towards creating a trustworthy system for computer-assisted PCa diagnosis.</description>
