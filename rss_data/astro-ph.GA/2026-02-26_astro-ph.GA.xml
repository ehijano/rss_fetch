      <title>The DECam MAGIC Survey: Uncovering the Tidal Tails of the Crater II Dwarf Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crater II (CraII), a large and low-density dwarf spheroidal galaxy, has unusual observed properties that are difficult to reproduce in cold dark matter simulations. Ongoing tidal disruption may help explain the discrepancies, as evidenced by the recent discovery of tidal tails. Here we present metallicity-sensitive narrowband photometry of the Ca II H and K lines from the Dark Energy Camera, covering $128$ deg$^2$ across the center and identified tidal tails of CraII as part of the Mapping the Ancient Galaxy in CaHK (MAGIC) survey. Our combined photometric metallicity, color-magnitude, proper motion, and parallax selections identify 162 CraII candidates. Of these, 37 candidates are located in the tidal tails which extend at least $7^\circ$ ($\sim 95$ kpc) from the center of CraII, suggesting it has lost $\gtrsim 25$% of its initial stellar mass. We confirm low contamination rates with dedicated control fields and highlight the extremely low surface brightness stellar features that can be uncovered with CaHK data, as faint as $\sim 36$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$. We also make the first detection of a metallicity gradient ($-0.34\pm0.17~{\rm dex}~{\rm deg}^{-1}$) in the center of the galaxy and infer a stream width of $w\sim 0.8^\circ$, roughly 50% larger than the CraII half-light radius. The detection of candidates in the most distant CraII pointings from its center implies that the tidal tails extend beyond our footprint. We compare the CraII stream to $N$-body models with "cored" and "cuspy" dark matter halo progenitors, determining that CraII's density profile is still ambiguous and warrants further modeling.</description>

      <title>NOCTURNE. III. Unidentified variable emission in the nuclear regions of PKS 2153-69</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Historically, the study of the central regions of Type 1 AGN has been limited by the combination of the host galaxy spectrum with strong emission from the accretion disk and NLR/BLR, which prevented us from accurately probing the galactic and AGN properties in the central regions. Integral field spectroscopy allows us to correct for this effect and study both the unobscured cores of AGN host galaxies as well as the uncontaminated spectra of their central engines with unprecedented precision. Using MUSE WFM observations, in this work, we present a combined method for modelling and subtracting QSO light in type-1 AGN alongside results for one such source, PKS 2153-68 (z=0.028), both jetted and gamma-ray emitting. After separating the host galaxy and AGN spectra, we discuss the discovery of an unresolved and yet-to-be-identified high-velocity ($\sim$25000 km/s) short timescale ($\leq$1 yr) variable emission, unlike anything observed in other variable AGN.</description>

      <title>Galaxy and black hole coevolution in dark matter haloes not captured by cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star formation in galaxies is governed by internal and environmental processes, yet their relative roles are not well understood. In particular, uncertainties in measurements of active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies, combined with modeling limitations, obfuscate the impact of supermassive black hole feedback across environments and over time. Here we address this with a comprehensive analysis of ~60,000 nearby AGNs (z &lt; 0.15 and new environment and halo-mass measurements for ~500,000 AGN and non-AGN host galaxies. This benchmark enables unified comparisons with three prominent cosmological simulations--SIMBA, TNG, and EAGLE--and reveals major, contrasting shortcomings. Simulations fail to reproduce observed trends linking star formation, quiescence, AGN luminosity, stellar mass, and halo mass. While simulations qualitatively capture that AGNs are more common in low-mass halos than in rich groups or clusters, detailed host demographics diverge strongly from observations. Partial agreement exists in the stellar mass distribution within large-scale structures, yet all simulations overproduce quenched low-mass satellites in massive halos, while misrepresenting quenched fractions of massive central galaxies and those in low-density environments, which are sensitive to feedback implementation. Improved AGN physics and modeling of multi-phase gas cooling and flows are required to capture the observed interplay between black holes, galaxies, and halos.</description>

      <title>FRESCO: Constraining Dust Attenuation and Star-Formation Rates of $z\sim 2$ Star-Forming Galaxies with JWST Paschen and Ground-Based Balmer Emission Line Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new constraints on dust attenuation and star-formation rates (SFRs) for 77 galaxies at redshifts $z=1.43-2.65$, using Paschen emission line detections from the JWST FRESCO survey and ground-based Balmer line measurements from the MOSDEF survey. Using nebular and continuum emission maps, we find that Paschen emission covers a smaller area than continuum emission observed in the F210M (2.1 $\mu$m; rest-frame optical) and F444W (4.4 $\mu$m; rest-frame near-IR) bands, and is preferentially located toward galaxy outskirts. These results suggest that current star formation is concentrated in regions farther from galaxy centers than older stellar populations traced by the continuum, indicative of inside-out star formation. With a careful accounting of slit-loss corrections for ground-based measurements, we calculate nebular reddening and dust-corrected SFRs using the Balmer decrement (H$\alpha$/H$\beta$) and Paschen-to-Balmer line ratios (Pa$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$/H$\alpha$), assuming the Milky Way extinction curve. On average, Paschen-derived reddening and SFRs agree with Balmer-derived values; however, two galaxies exhibit significantly higher Paschen reddening and four show significantly higher Paschen SFRs. We find that non-unity dust covering fractions bias the Balmer decrement toward less reddened OB associations, while decrements involving the Paschen lines are less affected by this bias. These results highlight the enhanced sensitivity of the Paschen lines to the most heavily obscured OB associations in $z\sim2$ galaxies, particularly in galaxies with patchy dust geometries. Future studies using Paschen lines exclusively to measure nebular reddening will yield more robust constraints on the dustiest star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>Probing the magnetic fields and dust properties in the young embedded star-forming region AFGL 6366S using Near Infrared and Optical linear polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Near-Infrared (NIR) and Optical linear polarimetry towards the partially embedded cluster AFGL 6366S. The polarization ranges from 0.44-10.3 per cent in NIR and 0.16-11.22 per cent in Optical bands. The position angle spans $1^\circ - 179^\circ$ in both NIR and Optical bands. About 22 stars exhibit intrinsic polarization signatures. A polarization hole is evident towards the densest ($\sim 3.4 \times 10^{23} \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$) and warmest ($\sim 28.8 \mathrm{K}$) central cluster region. It is attributable to depolarization induced by Radiative Torque Disruption (RAT-D) of large grains and a modest contribution from magnetic-field tangling. The local magnetic field towards the cluster's central region is significantly misaligned with both the large-scale Galactic field and the long axis of the filament present in the region. The field morphology wraps around two dense molecular clumps of radii 0.34 pc and 0.22 pc and $\mathrm N(\mathrm H_2)$ = $(7.9 \pm 1.1) \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $(4.3 \pm 0.5) \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively. The clumps are embedded in the filamentary structure and represent locally accelerated stages of mass accumulation. Gravitationally driven mass flows, largely perpendicular to the local magnetic field, produce a U-shaped field curvature across the filament axis. The plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths towards the two clumps are $ 447.91 \pm 83.81 \mu\mathrm{G}$ and $396.66 \pm 73.64 \mu\mathrm{G}$. The corresponding mass-to-flux ratios ($\lambda \sim 1.34$ and $0.82$) indicate that one clump is magnetically supercritical and the other is subcritical. The Alfven Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M}_A$) $\sim$ 0.395 and 0.393 indicate that both the clumps are in sub-Alfv\'enic state.</description>

      <title>The MeerKAT 1.3 GHz Survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a radio-continuum survey of the LMC using the MeerKAT telescope, describe the full-Stokes products included in the first data release, and highlight some initial results. The observations are centred at 1.3 GHz with a bandwidth of 0.8 GHz. The imaging products comprise six fields of view, each encompassing $\sim$5$^\circ$ $\times$ 5$^\circ$ with the resulting images achieving a resolution of 8". The median broad-band Stokes~I image root-mean-square noise value is $\sim$11 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. The survey enables a variety of astrophysical studies, which we showcase with the presentation of a few findings. Within the LMC we identify a new supernova remnant candidate; present planetary nebulae and Wolf-Rayet stars without previous radio detections; and show the MeerKAT view of the well-known star-forming region 30 Doradus. We also present some examples of interesting foreground and background sources in the field, including the AB~Dor multiple-star system, a radio ring galaxy, a possible Odd Radio Circle, and a remarkable bent-tail radio galaxy.</description>

      <title>The turbulence driving mode in NGC7793 and NGC1313</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spatially resolved measurements of turbulence driving modes across entire extragalactic discs of NGC7793 and NGC1313, using Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) CO(J=2-1) observations at 13pc resolution. By applying a kernel-based analysis of density and velocity fluctuations, we map the turbulence driving parameter, b, which characterises the balance between solenoidal ($b\sim0.3$) and compressive ($b\sim1$) turbulent driving regimes. b is quantified as the ratio of the turbulent density fluctuations relative to the turbulent sonic Mach number, M. Both galaxies show predominantly solenoidal driving on average for the regions where we find valid results ($b\geq 0.33(\pm 0.05)^{+0.14}_{-0.10}$ in NGC7793; $b\geq 0.24(\pm 0.03)^{+0.10}_{-0.07}$ in NGC1313), noting that this is without including the influences of magnetic fields, making these measurements lower limits. We find substantial spatial variation of b, including localised regions of strongly compressive driving. NGC1313 exhibits higher turbulent Mach numbers and density dispersions than NGC7793, consistent with the disturbed morphology and recent satellite interaction in NGC1313. The turbulence in both NGC7793 and NGC1313 is supersonic ($3\lesssim M\lesssim 20$), and NGC1313 shows a radially decreasing trend of M with galactocentric radius. Radial trends indicate more solenoidal driving in the galaxy centres, potentially reflecting enhanced shear, and increasingly compressive modes in the outskirts. These results demonstrate that turbulence driving varies systematically with galactic environment and cannot be assumed uniform across discs. Our study applies a previously established method to larger scales and new data, linking local turbulence physics to global star formation regulation in galaxies, providing a new avenue for testing theoretical models with future integral field units and ALMA surveys.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Origin of the Star-Forming Main Sequence Based on a Volume-Limited Sample of ~25,000 Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the extensively debated star-forming main sequence (SFMS)-a tight correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass in both kiloparsec-resolved and integrated galaxies. We statistically explore the fundamental drivers of star formation at global scales, using a large volume-limited sample of 24,954 local star-forming galaxies to overcome the limitations of previous works. Based on the mid-infrared 12 micron luminosity, stellar mass, and g-r color, we estimate the molecular gas mass for the considered sample. At galaxy-wide scales, we establish global relations between the surface densities of the star formation rate, stellar mass, and molecular gas mass . These global density relations are connected with and follow similar trends as the resolved SFMS, the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, and the molecular gas main sequence (MGMS). Taking advantage of this large catalog, we show that the scatters in the global KS and MGMS relations are smaller than that of the global relation between the star formation rate surface density and stellar mass surface density, and their Pearson correlation coefficients are higher. More importantly, multivariate regression and partial correlation analyses demonstrate that the apparent correlation between the star formation rate surface density and stellar mass surface density is entirely mediated by the molecular gas surface density, with its best-fit parameters directly derivable from those of the KS and MGMS relations. Overall, our findings suggest that the correlation between stellar mass and molecular gas, as well as that between molecular gas and star formation, are more direct and fundamental. The star-forming main sequence thus appears to be a natural by-product of these two tighter relations.</description>

      <title>A Decade-Long Increasing Mid-Infrared Luminosity in Galaxy NGC6447: a Turning-On Candidate of Active Galactic Nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely expected that the obscured accretion stage can be the initial turning-on stage of active galactic nuclei from quiescent galaxies. We present mid-infrared light curves of NGC 6447 in 3.5$\mu$m and 4.6 $\mu$m bands observed by WISE/NEOWISE, which show an almost monotonic increasing trend of 1.2 mag over 14 years. The optical light curve from ASAS-SN during the same period is consistent with a constant showing no variability. The mid-infrared color evolution shows that the galaxy transitioned into an active galactic nucleus (AGN) in 2018. The SPHEREx spectrum reveals an increasing continuum resembling warm to hot dust emission from an AGN. NuSTAR detected an X-ray source with a 2-30 keV luminosity of $8.4\times10^{41}$ ergs/s at the lower boundary of AGN X-ray emission range, and a factor of &gt;7 variability in one year compared to the Swift upper limit. NGC 6447 was classified as a quiescent galaxy in the literature. The multi-wavelength timing and spectral properties of NGC 6447 are consistent with the expected AGN turning on event, where the obscuring material around the AGN central engine is gradually dispersed, revealing the central engine. This example shows that long-term infrared variability can be a powerful tool to find similar sources. Based on the sample selection statistics, we estimate the duration of the episodes of AGN accretion (duty cycle) signified by the turning-on event as $10^4$-$10^6$ yr.</description>

      <title>Performance assessment of the gPLUTO code for the numerical modeling of radio galaxy evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution tri-axial simulations are indispensable for realistically co-modeling the dynamical signatures and the radiative fingerprints of astrophysical jets, which are becoming increasingly important in modern computational studies of jet physics. However, such simulations impose extreme computational requirements that often exceed the capabilities of conventional CPU-based codes. GPU-accelerated simulations offer a transformative solution to mitigate these limitations. In this work, we present a detailed performance benchmarking of the recently developed GPU-enabled PLUTO code (gPLUTO), demonstrating runtime speed-ups ranging from an order of magnitude to (approximately) over 30 relative to CPU-only configurations. A direct comparison between computations of extragalactic jet propagation performed at different grid resolutions confirm the physical fidelity and production readiness of the gPLUTO code, while underscoring the importance of resolving the jet radius adequately to capture the jet dynamics accurately. Leveraging GPU-PLUTO's capabilities, we finally present an application by performing high-resolution simulations of giant radio galaxy jets (GRGs $\gtrsim 1$ Mpc), representing the first such well-resolved 3D study to our knowledge (resolving scales down to 500 pc). These simulations probe a range of environmental effects on GRG jets, clarifying their formation from central galaxies within host cosmic structures, rapid peripheral expansion, and the development of asymmetric cocoon morphologies.</description>

      <title>AVID: A Near-Major Post-Merger of Late-Type Dwarfs beneath a Regularly Rotating HI Disk (VCC 693)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the periphery of galaxy clusters, moderately high galaxy densities and velocity dispersions favour interactions and mergers that influence galaxy evolution prior to cluster infall. Observational studies of this phase in dwarfs remain rare. We present a high-resolution study of the merger remnant VCC 693 in the outskirts of Virgo cluster, using observations from the Atomic gas in Virgo Interacting Dwarf galaxies (AVID) project. We explore the origin of VCC 693 and the consequences of the merger on its star formation and structure through a joint analysis of VLA and FAST HI emission line observations, together with complementary optical imaging and spectroscopy. We employ hydrodynamical simulations to help interpret the observations. Our analysis favours a near-major merger between two dwarfs with a stellar mass ratio of 3:1-4:1, with one likely gas-poor progenitor (i.e., a damp merger). The optical appearance of VCC 693 is dominated by complex tidal structures throughout the system, whereas the HI gas has settled to a regular rotating disk. Compared with similar-mass dwarfs, the central star formation and gas-phase metallicity are moderately enhanced. The global star formation rate, HI gas content, and HI-to-optical size ratio of VCC 693 are broadly consistent with those of typical dwarfs of similar mass, albeit somewhat lower. Decomposition of the HI rotation curve into baryonic and dark matter indicates a high halo concentration, suggesting post-merger relaxation into a more centrally peaked configuration. Together with two recent studies of AVID post-merger systems, these results support the view that even major dwarf mergers can produce remnants with overall stellar structures indistinguishable from ordinary dwarfs, and that the environmental effects in cluster outskirts can promote damp or mixed mergers, constituting an integral part of galactic pre-processing.</description>

      <title>A Robust Analysis of QU-fitting Behavior for 800-1088 MHz and 1296-1440 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QU-fitting is a powerful tool for interpreting spectro-polarimetric radio continuum observations by linking them to physical models, enabling estimates of the magnetic fields in, for example, the Milky Way, galaxy clusters, and radio jets. We present a comprehensive investigation into the effectiveness and limitations of QU-fitting within the ASKAP POSSUM survey frequency ranges (800-1088 MHz and 1296-1440 MHz) with projections to other spectro-polarimetric radio observations. We simulate different physical polarization sources: Faraday simple, Burn slab, internal turbulence, external turbulence, and two-component models in the POSSUM frequencies, and assess their observational degeneracies and fit accuracies. Our results highlight the model-dependent nature of reliable fitting and identify specific regions of parameter space where model selection, and therefore characterization of the physical medium, becomes ambiguous. For QU-fitting we find the Bayes factor, computed using the marginal likelihood, outperforms more traditionally used goodness-of-fit metrics such as Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and chi-squared for model selection. We provide empirical relationships to delineate the boundaries where model distinguishability is impossible. Finally, we evaluate how accurately QU-fitting recovers model parameters and their associated uncertainties, thereby assessing its ability to correctly characterize the Faraday-rotating medium in both point and extended sources in Faraday depth space.</description>

      <title>Formation timescales for stellar bars in diverse galactic discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation of stellar bars using 145 simulations of disc galaxies embedded in live and static dark matter haloes. We use the exponential bar growth timescale, $\tau_{\rm bar}$, to quantify how disc structure and kinematics regulate the onset and rate of secular bar formation. We extend previous work to thicker and more turbulent discs, motivated by those observed at high redshift ($z&gt;1$). By revisiting several commonly used disc stability criteria - the Efstathiou-Lake-Negroponte parameter ($\epsilon_{\rm ELN}$), the Ostriker-Peebles ratio ($t_{\rm OP}$), and the disc stellar mass fraction within 2.2 disc scale radii ($f_{\rm disc}$) - we find that $\tau_{\rm bar}$, when expressed in terms of the disc's orbital period, follows a tight power law with each criteria. In Milky Way-like discs embedded in live haloes, bars form within a Hubble time if $f_{\rm disc} \geq 0.18$, $t_{\rm OP} \geq 0.27$, and $\epsilon_{\rm ELN} \leq 1.44$. We show discs with higher velocity dispersion experience delayed bar growth and introduce an empirical relation that correctly describes the bar formation timescales of all our live halo models. Bars in static haloes grow at roughly half the rate of those in live haloes and require substantially greater disc instability to do so.</description>

      <title>CALIMA: On-the-fly dust and PAH evolution for radiation-hydrodynamics galaxy formation simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) actively contribute to the thermodynamics, chemistry, and radiative state of the interstellar medium (ISM), yet most ISM models and galaxy simulations either exclude them altogether or adopt simplified treatments. We present CALIMA, a new module for dust and PAH formation and evolution in radiation-hydrodynamics simulations for RAMSES, designed to self-consistently couple dust physics to radiative transfer and non-equilibrium thermochemistry in a multiphase ISM. The model employs a two-size, two-composition dust framework with log-normal grain populations, explicitly evolving stellar dust injection, turbulence-informed gas-phase accretion, shattering, coagulation, thermal and non-thermal sputtering, and shock destruction, while PAHs are separate components with their own evolution. The evolving dust populations and radiation field determine local, wavelength-dependent opacities, photoelectric heating efficiencies, grain-assisted recombination, dust-gas collisional heating/cooling, and H$_2$ formation on both grains and PAHs. Updated treatments of thermal sputtering and collisional cooling that include finite grain sizes and modern ion-solid physics reduce sputtering rates at high temperatures and extend the regime where dust significantly cools hot gas. One-zone ISM tests show that dust and PAH evolution modifies classical thermal phase diagrams and C-bearing chemistry, while isolated disc galaxy simulations reveal environment-dependent variations in dust-to-metal ratio, small-to-large grain ratio, PAH fraction, and interstellar radiation field intensity that drive non-trivial structure in infrared emission, UV transparency, and H$_2$ formation. CALIMA provides a physically motivated framework to interpret dust- and PAH-based observables and to assess dust-mediated feedback in galaxy formation across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>The supersonic nature of jellyfish galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All gas-rich galaxies in cluster environments are expected to experience ram-pressure stripping from the intra-cluster medium. However, only a fraction of these develop ongoing star-formation in their stripped tail, becoming the so-called ``jellyfish'' galaxies. In this work we provide observational evidence that magnetic fields can signal differences in the extraplanar star formation and explore what are the physical conditions that lead to the formation of a jellyfish galaxy. We first focus on JO147, a jellyfish galaxy that features weak star formation activity in its tail. Using MeerKAT radio continuum observations, we discover polarized emission only in a small fraction of its tail, with an average fraction of $~10\%$, and a low Mach number $\mathcal{M}=1.3-1.6$, which suggests a possible association between magnetic field draping, shock-compression of the gas, and extraplanar star formation activity. Then, we test this scenario in a sample of 17 jellyfish galaxies from the GASP project. We combine dynamical models for their orbits within the host clusters with realistic cluster temperature profiles to infer their Mach number, and we find a positive correlation between it and the star formation activity in their tail. We conclude that supersonic motion is a necessary condition for triggering star formation in the stripped tails of jellyfish galaxies. Our findings provide empirical evidence that the critical factor preventing the stripped gas evaporation is the shock compression induced by the supersonic motion through the cluster. This process likely enhances the magnetic field surrounding the galaxy and the properties of the stripped material.</description>

      <title>The Dawes Review: A Decade of Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been 10 years since the initial discovery of Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs) in the Coma cluster and the revelation that large, low surface brightness galaxies may constitute a greater fraction of galaxies than first thought. This left an open question: Are UDGs something special, or just an extension of the previously known dwarf galaxy population? Seeking to answer this question, in the decade following, dedicated simulations have studied and proposed a myriad of formation pathways to create UDGs. Observations have then pushed the limits of world-class observatories to perform detailed studies of these galaxies in large numbers across the full range of environments in the local Universe. These observations stress test simulations and challenge previous galaxy formation wisdom, with UDGs posing many open puzzles beyond just their unknown formation mechanism. To provide a few pertinent examples: there is observational evidence that not all UDGs follow the standard stellar mass -- halo mass relationship; there is evidence for UDGs with extraordinarily high levels of alpha enhancement; and there is evidence that some UDGs are much more globular cluster rich than other dwarfs of similar stellar mass. In this Dawes review, we undertake the task of summarising the decade of science since the discovery of UDGs. We focus on the quiescent population of UDGs and review their general properties, their proposed formation scenarios, their internal properties and their globular cluster systems. We also provide a brief conjecture on some future directions for the next decade of UDG research.</description>

      <title>Probing Large-scale Structure and the Multi-Phase IGM at the Cosmic Noon -- Insights from a Joint Survey with Euclid, CSST, JPCam, and JUST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present scientific and technical justifications of a potential coordinated Euclid/CSST/JPCam/JUST survey of the Euclid Deep Field North (EDF-N), aimed at probing the multi-phase circumgalactic and intergalactic medium (CGM/IGM) at the cosmic noon over ~20 deg$^2$. The survey is structured around three connected goals: (1) improving photometric redshift (photo-z) accuracy through the combination of broad- and narrow-band photometry, enabling reliable identification of large-scale structures; (2) probing extended CGM emission with dedicated narrow-band imaging; and (3) mapping foreground IGM via absorption-line spectroscopy of background galaxies. Together, these components establish an integrated observational framework to investigate galactic ecosystems -- linking galaxies to their circumgalactic and intergalactic environments -- at cosmic noon. We show that the J-PAS-like narrow-band system used in JPCam substantially improves photo-z accuracies from only the Euclid/CSST broad-band data, especially for star-forming galaxies at z~1.0-1.4. This enables the identification of galaxy groups and (proto-)clusters directly from photo-z measurements. Stacked JPCam narrow-band imaging should also detect extended [O II]-emitting CGM halos. We then construct mock 3D gas distribution model and realistic galaxy catalog, and further construct mock CSST and JUST background galaxy spectra adding Lyalpha and Mg II absorptions. The reconstructed 3D H I field from CSST Lyalpha forest reliably recovers large-scale structures; however, our simulations indicate that detecting diffuse IGM Mg II absorption with JUST is infeasible, either through spectral stacking or via the two-point correlation function method. We conclude that constraining the metallicity of the diffuse IGM will require significantly deeper and higher-resolution spectroscopy expected from future facilities such as the 39 m E-ELT.</description>

      <title>Optical Spectroscopy of Dwarf Galaxies at $z\sim 0.15$ in the COSMOS Field: Star Formation and Dust Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic study of low-mass galaxies (LMGs;$10^8\leq\rm M_*/M_\odot\leq10^9$) at $z\sim0.15$ in COSMOS field, and compare it to a control sample of intermediate-mass galaxies (IMGs;$10^9\leq\rm M_*/M_\odot\leq10^{10}$) at $z\sim0.35$. We examine their star formation rates (SFRs), dust attenuation properties, and the relationship between nebular and stellar reddening. For both samples, SFRs derived from H$\alpha$ are strongly correlated with SFRs from fitting simple star formation histories (SFHs) to the galaxies' spectral energy distributions. In fitting a joint SFR-$\rm M_*$ relation, we obtain a slope of $\rm {\Delta log(SFR_{H\alpha})}/{\Delta log(M_*/M_\odot)}=1.01\pm0.03$, indicating that fair ensembles of SFHs for galaxies at these stellar masses are well-described by scale-free, self-similar forms. We also examine their dust attenuation properties and the relationship between nebular and stellar reddening, exploring how these quantities vary with stellar mass and specific SFR (sSFR). Nebular attenuation increases with stellar mass for IMGs but is lower and less mass-dependent in LMGs, consistent with their reduced dust content. In all cases, stellar continuum attenuation is lower than nebular attenuation, as expected from the two-component dust model. The nebular-to-stellar color excess ratio in both samples is consistent with the canonical factor of 2.27. The ratio is mass-independent, but rises with sSFR in IMGs and remains constant in LMGs. These results suggest that in LMGs, efficient dispersal of birth clouds keeps the differential attenuation approximately constant across sSFR. Thus, although LMGs follow the same global SFR-$\rm M_*$ scaling as massive galaxies, their lower dust content and feedback-maintained ISM produce distinct attenuation behavior relative to IMGs.</description>

      <title>Overlap Zoo Beta: A Catalogue of ~800 Occulting Pairs in the DESI Legacy Survey using Citizen Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overlapping galaxies, in which a foreground galaxy partially overlaps a background galaxy, offer a unique opportunity to measure dust attenuation, a key nuisance parameter in galaxy studies, empirically and in great detail by modelling the light of both the foreground and background galaxy and inferring the missing light in the overlapping region. However, the current catalogue of overlapping pairs is relatively limited in number compared to catalogues dedicated to individual galaxies. Expanding this catalogue is not only a necessity to facilitate further detailed dust studies beyond the few limited studies conducted thus far, but also to improve pair-to-pair variance and support automated identification through machine learning techniques. To achieve this, we utilise galaxies classified as "overlapping" from Galaxy Zoo DECaLS (GZD-1, -2, and -5), along with images from Data Release 10 (DR10) of the DESI Legacy Survey, in our individual citizen science project to classify these pairs directly using volunteers. This new catalogue will not only provide a wealth of targets for future dust studies but will also contribute to a deeper understanding of these pairs and dust as a whole.</description>

      <title>Stellar associations powering HII regions $\unicode{x2013}$ II. Escape fraction of ionizing photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Newly formed stars have a profound impact on their environment by depositing energy and momentum into the surrounding gas. However, only a fraction of the stellar feedback is retained in the cloud and observational constraints are needed to further our understanding of this process. In a sample of 19 nearby galaxies, we match HII regions from PHANGS$\unicode{x2013}$MUSE to their ionizing stellar source from PHANGS$\unicode{x2013}$HST and measure the percentage of ionizing radiation that is leaking into the surrounding diffuse ionized gas (DIG). Based on a catalogue, where each HII region is powered by a single young and massive stellar association, we measure a photon escape fraction of $f_\mathrm{esc}=82^{+12}_{-24}$ per cent. Comparable results are obtained when different procedures are used to match the ionized gas to its source. All samples we study contain a substantial fraction of objects (up to 20 per cent), where the stellar source is not sufficient to produce the H$\alpha$ flux observed from the nebula. Many of them are probably related to uncertain age estimates, but we also find numerous regions, where a significant fraction of the ionizing photon budget is contributed by stars that reside outside the boundaries of the HII region. This motivates the use of an alternative galaxy-wide approach, in which we include all HII regions and stellar sources, not just the ones that show a clear overlap. When summing up the ionization budget over entire galaxies, we measure slightly lower, but consistent values.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the absorbed atomic Universe with the [OI]63um line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of strongly absorbed [OI]63um in a sample of 12 DSFGs at 4.2&lt;z&lt;5.8 selected from the SPT survey. This is the first systematic survey of the [OI]63um fine-structure line at z&gt;4. Using ALMA Bands 9 and 10, we obtain spatially and spectrally resolved observations that probe the interstellar medium on sub-kpc scales. Despite reaching sensitivities 10-100x deeper than most previous studies, we detect [OI]63um in emission in only 2 sources at low significance, with the remaining galaxies yielding stringent non-detections over the full velocity range covered by robust detections of other far-infrared lines, including [CII] and [NII]205um. We identify several compact (0.05-0.2") regions having [OI]63um absorption against the far-infrared dust continuum, some of which are possibly reaching below rest-frame CMB radiation level. We also detect narrow, spatially localised [OI]63um emission "escape channels" preferentially detected in regions with weak or absent dust continuum emission. We predict that similar absorption effects may appear in the [CII] line, particularly when concentrating on the regions with the densest foreground material along the line of sight. The [OI]63um line appears to be originate from a mix of compact, high optical depth [OI]63um emitting regions and sub-thermally excited, oxygen-rich molecular clouds dispersed throughout high-redshift starbursts that are capable of absorbing the ground-state line emission. Combined with a comparison to cosmological radiation hydrodynamical simulations, this supports the interpretation that regions with higher gas and dust column densities may lead to weakening an intrinsically strong [OI]63um line emission. We argue that the high [OI]63um optical depth is the dominant effect causing the strong absorption, limiting the diagnostic power of this line to trace regions of massive star formation in high-redshift DSFGs.</description>

      <title>Recovering 3D Magnetic Turbulence from Single-Frequency Faraday Screens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistics of polarized synchrotron radiation carry information about the properties of the underlying turbulence. Different statistical measures constructed from observables probe turbulence properties in different ways. We consider a setup in which synchrotron radiation is emitted in a distant volume and then passes through a turbulent screen that induces Faraday rotation. Using both MHD simulations and synthetic turbulence spectra, we explore the spectrum of observed polarization directions measured at a single frequency as a diagnostic for recovering the statistics of turbulence in both the emitting region and the Faraday-rotation screen. We compare these results with our analytical expectations. We also compare the spectrum of polarization direction (SPD) with the wavelength-derivative diagnostic introduced and analytically explored by Lazarian \&amp; Pogosyan. We demonstrate that the SPD exhibits greater sensitivity to turbulence in the Faraday screen. We provide an observer-friendly criterion to determine whether the SPD samples turbulence in the synchrotron-emitting region or in the Faraday screen. These results open a practical pathway for extracting turbulence statistics from existing and forthcoming single-band radio polarimetry.</description>

      <title>SIRIUS: The relation between the diversity of dwarf galaxies and their formation histories</title>

Abstract: Low-mass dwarf galaxies ($M_{\rm vir} \lesssim 10^9\rm\ M_\odot$) are fundamental cosmological building blocks, yet the physical processes driving their structural diversity remain poorly understood. Recent numerical simulations have suggested a diversity in the stellar-to-halo mass ratio in this halo mass range, but either the number of samples obtained from the same simulation setup or the numerical resolution was limited. We performed high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations for eight galaxies with a dark matter halo mass of $\sim 10^9\rm\ M_{\odot}$ up to $t=1.2$ Gyr at which most gas in the galaxies has been expelled. Our samples have a scatter of an order of magnitude in the halo mass at the reionization epoch. The stellar-to-halo mass ratio expected at $z=0$ scatters nearly two orders of magnitude with $5\times10^{-5}$ to $2\times10^{-3}$. We also observed variation in the compactness of their stellar distributions. Some of our simulated galaxies exhibit a stellar half-mass radius of $\sim30$ pc, which is as small as that of ultra-compact dwarfs. The formation condition for such a compact stellar distribution is understood as an analog of the condition for the formation of dense, massive star clusters. We found that when the central gas surface density exceeds a critical threshold ($\Sigma_{\rm gas} \gtrsim 30\rm\ M_\odot \rm\ {pc}^{-2}$), the star formation becomes highly efficient and results in dense stellar systems. These results suggest that UCDs can form in situ even in isolated dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>CNN+FoF: application of deep learning to the identification of dark matter haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a deep-learning-based approach for identifying dark matter haloes in cosmological N-body simulations. Our framework consists of a volumetric Convolutional Neural Network to classify individual simulation particles as either halo or non-halo members, followed by a highly optimised and parallelised Friends-of-Friends clustering algorithm that groups the classified halo members into distinct haloes. The training data comprise simulations generated using GADGET-4, with labels obtained with the ROCKSTAR halo finder. Our models incorporate two main halo mass definitions, $M_{200\mathrm{b}}$ and $M_{\text{vir}}$, with similar performance. For haloes defined by the ROCKSTAR $M_{200\mathrm{b}}$ criterion, the classification network demonstrated stable performance across multiple simulation resolutions. For the highest resolution, it achieved over $98\%$ across all primary performance metrics when identifying halo particles. Furthermore, the FoF algorithm yielded halo catalogues with a purity generally exceeding $95\%$ and a stable completeness of $93\%$ for masses above $5\times10^{11} \, M_\odot$. Our pipeline recovered the centre-of-mass positions, velocities and halo masses with high fidelity, yielding a halo mass function consistent to within $5\%$ of the reference while faithfully reconstructing the internal density profiles. The primary objective of this study is to offer a faster and scalable alternative to conventional halo finders, achieving a speed-up of approximately one order of magnitude relative to ROCKSTAR, offering a promising pathway for modern simulation-based inference methods that rely on rapid and accurate structure identification.</description>

      <title>A Path to an All-Sky Survey with Roman</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A deep, space-based, all-sky near-infrared survey carried out with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope would constitute a foundational astronomical infrastructure for decades to come. In this white paper, we present a concrete and feasible path to imaging the entire sky at $\sim0.1''$ resolution, beginning with high-impact fields in Cycle 1 and scaling to ultra-wide coverage within the nominal mission. This first-epoch survey will reach $\mathrm{H}\sim25.5$ AB mag (5$\sigma$) and maximize synergies with contemporaneous observatories, while preserving substantial time for other ambitious Roman programs. We outline representative scheduling scenarios and an example Cycle 1 program that triples early Roman-LSST overlap and delivers high-value community data products such as LSST forced photometry, joint \textit{Gaia}-Roman astrometry, and catalogs of Galactic substructure, stong lenses, and other rare systems. The Cycle 1 program will lay the foundation for an eventual all-sky survey, while also delivering high-impact early science. We invite broad community participation in shaping and carrying out both the initial program and the long-term vision of an all-sky Roman survey.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Cosmic Voids: Structure, Galaxies, and Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structural, photometric, and dynamical evolution of cosmic voids and their galaxy populations from $z=2.09$ to the present, focusing on void size as a key evolutionary parameter. Using void catalogs from four Millennium Simulation snapshots and SDSS data at $z&lt;0.04$, we perform a unified analysis of void demographics, galaxy properties, and internal kinematics. Our analysis reveals clear evidence that cosmic voids exhibit a significant evolutionary trend of becoming progressively emptier toward low redshift, accompanied by a marked decline in the brightness and clustering of their galaxy populations. The void galaxy luminosity function evolves significantly: $M^{*}$ fades and $\alpha$ flattens with time, with large voids hosting brighter, more rapidly evolving galaxies than small voids. Stacked density profiles exhibit a universal shape when scaled by void radius, deepening and building more pronounced walls toward $z=0$. Galaxy spatial distributions reveal persistent size-dependent segregation, with galaxies in large voids lying farther from the center and more strongly clustered. Dynamical analysis of simulations shows coherent outward flows in all voids, with amplitudes decreasing toward $z=0$, providing a physical basis for observed redshift-space distortions. Comparison with SDSS broadly confirms these evolutionary trends but uncovers a non-zero central galaxy population in observed voids -- absent in $\Lambda$CDM predictions -- that may challenge current galaxy formation models in extreme underdensities. Future comparisons with additional simulations and deeper high-redshift surveys will provide stronger tests of $\Lambda$CDM in the most underdense regions.</description>

      <title>Conditional Image Diffusion with Interferometric Closure Invariants: Independent EHT Imaging of Centaurus~A and 3C~279</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present independent imaging analyses of Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of the active galactic nuclei in radio galaxy Centaurus~A and quasar 3C~279 using Generative Deep learning Image Reconstruction with Closure Terms (GenDIReCT), a recently developed machine-learning framework built on conditional diffusion models that uses interferometric closure invariants as primary observables. For Centaurus~A, our reconstruction reveals two prominent emission ridges ($\simeq 80\,\mu$as each) along the jet sheath with a brightness ratio of $1.4\pm 0.1$ and an opening angle of $12.3\pm 0.3$~deg. For 3C~279, we identify three distinct components in the image, with the southern jet ejecta on sub-parsec scale exhibiting a proper motion of $4.6\pm 1.0\,\mu$as over $\approx 5.39$ days away from the northern components, corresponding to an apparent superluminal velocity of $\simeq 10\pm 2$ times light speed. These measurements are consistent with those reported by the EHT Collaboration. The results are significant because we demonstrate that: (1) imaging from interferometric aperture synthesis data, especially in VLBI and most acutely in extremely sparse arrays like the EHT, remains a severely ill-posed and challenging inverse problem, yet closure invariants preserve robust morphological information that can strongly constrain structural features, and (2) more importantly, closure-invariant imaging largely avoids calibration systematics, thus providing a fundamentally independent view of spatial structure with very high angular resolution. The generative nature of GenDIReCT further allows us to sample and characterise clusters of plausible image solutions for each dataset. As a calibration-independent, generative imaging approach, GenDIReCT offers a robust and truly independent blind-imaging tool for current and future VLBI experiments.</description>

      <title>Bulk and turbulent gas motions in the interacting galaxy cluster Abell 3395 South observed with XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gas motions in the core region of the Abell~3395 South subcluster (A3395S) using high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with XRISM/Resolve. By analyzing the Fe~XXV He$\alpha$ emission line, we directly measure the line-of-sight bulk and turbulent velocities of the intracluster medium. We find that the one-dimensional turbulent velocity is low, at the level of $124\pm21~{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$, while a significant line-of-sight bulk velocity of $263\pm23~{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ is detected. The coexistence of low turbulence and finite bulk motion suggests that A3395S has not yet reached a dynamically relaxed state. These results are consistent with the non-detection of a radio halo in A3395S, implying that turbulent particle reacceleration is currently inefficient in the cluster core. This study demonstrates that high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with XRISM provides a powerful means to directly constrain intracluster medium dynamics in merging galaxy clusters, and it provides a reference for future comparative studies of A3395N and A3391 within the same large-scale structure.</description>

      <title>HATPI Pre-Perihelion Time-series Photometry of the Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HATPI is a recently commissioned time-domain facility at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile, that uses 64 wide-angle, 9.6 cm diameter lenses and back-illuminated CCDs, yielding a mosaic field-of-view of 7,100 square arcdegrees, observing the night sky at a cadence of 45 s and a spatial scale of 19.7 arcsec pixel$^{-1}$. In this paper, we present moving object time-series photometry with this facility, focusing on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. 3I/ATLAS was first robustly recovered by HATPI on the night of 2025 July 2 (one night after its discovery) at a Gaia $G$-band magnitude of $G = 17.796 \pm 0.082$ mag ($\pm 0.030$ mag systematic uncertainty). The comet then increased in brightness to $G = 14.071 \pm 0.073$ mag $\pm 0.030$ mag by 2025 Sep 13, after which it became unobservable by HATPI as it approached perihelion. Before 3I/ATLAS achieved a brightness of $G = 16.396 \pm 0.029$ mag $\pm 0.030$ mag on 2025 Aug 6, it could be detected when stacking all HATPI observations from a single night, while after this date it is sufficiently bright to detect in individual 45 s exposures. We do not detect evidence for significant short-time-scale variations in the brightness of 3I/ATLAS after Aug 6. Compared to other light curves in the literature, the HATPI photometry exhibits a somewhat steeper rise in brightness with decreasing heliocentric distance, $r_{H}$. The HATPI magnitudes are well-fit as a power law function of $r_{H}$, with an exponential index of $n = 5.167 \pm 0.095$, over the range $2.14$ AU $ &lt; r_{H} &lt; 4.44$ AU, compared to $n = 3.94 \pm 0.10$ when fitting together with other literature observations. We find that the phase function is constrained to $\beta = 0.0552 \pm 0.0032$ mag deg$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Classical, large scale 3D MHD simulations of interacting pulsar wind nebulae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetized rotating neutron stars, or pulsars, are a possible end product of massive star evolution. Their relativistic wind successively interacts with the supernova ejecta of their defunct progenitor, then with the circumstellar medium of the progenitor, and eventually with the interstellar medium. If a massive star is static with respect to its ambient medium, then its resulting circumstellar medium is elongated along the direction of the local magnetic field, and its supernova remnant transiently appears as a rectangle. The pulsar wind nebula forming in it is, in its turn, elongated, as long as the pulsar axis of rotation matches the direction of the local magnetization. In this work, we explore how the angle between the direction of the local magnetic field of the interstellar medium and the pulsar axis of rotation influences the shaping of its pulsar wind nebula with 3D MHD simulations are carried out with the PLUTO. We use those models to perform radiative transfer calculations to derive non-thermal radio emission maps of the pulsar wind nebulae. When the polar elongation of the pulsar develop, they bend in opposite directions under the effects of the cavity carved by the stellar wind and already filled by supernova ejecta. This induces a complex distribution of magnetized supernova ejecta and pulsar wind, resulting in various observable structures, appearing as rectangles, circles, or irregular oblong shapes, in the radio waveband. The angle between the direction of the pulsar rotation axis and that of the local ambient magnetization is a governing parameter for the shaping and non-thermal radio properties of the pulsar wind nebulae of static massive stars; however, the mixing of material, once the pulsar wind nebula is old (50 to 80 kyr), is not strongly affected by that factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common task in astronomical research is to estimate the physical parameters (temperature, mass, density etc.) of a gas by using observed line emission. This often requires a calculation of how the radiation propagates via emission and absorption (so-called radiative transfer). In radio and infrared astronomy, the Fortran code RADEX (van der Tak et al., 2007) is a popular tool to solve the non-LTE radiative transfer of a uniform medium in a simplified geometry. I present pythonradex, a Python re-implementation of RADEX. Written in Python, it provides an easy and intuitive user interface, improved performance as well as additional functionality not included in RADEX, such as continuum effects and overlapping lines. In addition, pythonradex provides a self-consistent computation of the total flux for all geometries, including spherical geometries.</description>

      <title>A deep HST view of the open cluster NGC2158: binaries, mass functions, and M-dwarf discontinuity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant fraction of stars in both the Galactic field and stellar clusters are members of binary systems. Understanding their properties is therefore essential for a comprehensive view of stellar structure, evolution, and cluster dynamics. Despite extensive studies of cluster binaries, key issues remain unresolved, particularly for photometric binaries among low-mass stars. While the binary fraction in the field strongly depends on stellar mass, cluster studies have generally suggested an approximately constant fraction over the limited mass ranges explored. In addition, the mass function (MF) of very low-mass stars is still poorly constrained in clusters older than a few hundred Myr. We use deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the intermediate-age open cluster NGC 2158 to investigate its binary population and derive the luminosity and MFs down to ~0.14 solar masses, enabling the first detailed analysis of binaries in this cluster. We measure a global binary fraction of 38%, consistent with other open clusters, and find a clear mass dependence: it decreases from ~52% at 1.0 solar masses to ~11% at 0.2 solar masses. This trend mirrors that of Galactic field stars, suggesting similar binary properties. The MF is characterized by three regimes: high-mass stars (alpha= -2.49 +- 0.19), low-mass stars (alpha= -1.11 +- 0.09), and very low-mass stars (alpha= -0.08 +- 0.07). The slope change near 1.0 solar mass agrees with recent surveys, though we find a deficit below ~0.3 solar masses. We also detect a main-sequence discontinuity around ~0.3 solar masses, possibly linked to the 3He-driven instability predicted by stellar models and analogous to the Jao Gap seen in nearby field stars.</description>

      <title>The impact of cosmic filaments on starburst galaxies across cosmic times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations suggest that various galaxy properties depend on their location within the cosmic web. Yet direct observational evidence of the dependence of star formation activity on distance to filaments remains scarce and is missing at z&gt;1. We investigate how starburst, main-sequence (MS), and quenched galaxies are distributed with respect to cosmic web filaments, and how this distribution evolves with redshift. We first use the SIMBA cosmological simulation to predict the redshift evolution of the mean distance to the closest filament from z=3 to z=0 for different galaxy populations after removing stellar-mass dependencies. We then measure the corresponding signal in the COSMOS field, using COSMOS2020 and COSMOS-Web data, where accurate photometric redshifts enable reconstruction of the projected cosmic web from z=2 to z=0.5, and starbursts are identified through far-infrared spectral energy distribution fitting. In agreement with the results from SIMBA, starburst galaxies are found closer to filaments at z&gt;1 and at larger distances at z&lt;1, MS galaxies occupy intermediate environments with little evolution, and quenched galaxies show progressively shorter distances to filaments toward low redshift, with a crossing between starburst and MS populations around z~1. In COSMOS-Web, the relative evolution in the average distance to filaments between starburst and MS galaxies is detected at a significance level of at least 5{\sigma}. We show that a minimal toy model in which the only environmental ingredient is the sSFR-filament distance modulation measured in simulations is sufficient to reproduce the observed differential evolution of the average filament distance between starburst and MS galaxies. These results show that the imprint of large-scale environmental effects on the star formation activity of galaxies, predicted by simulations, is detectable from z=2 down to z=0.5.</description>

Abstract: We update and expand the MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks (MIST) database to include variations in the alpha-capture elements, specifically [alpha/Fe]=-0.2, 0, +0.2, +0.4, and +0.6 for -3 &lt;= [Fe/H] &lt;= +0.5. Variations in [alpha/Fe] are included in a self-consistent manner from the stellar interior models to the synthetic spectra used to translate these models in the observational plane. We describe a number of updates to the physics utilized in these models as well as new information provided by the models. We validate the models with comparisons to other stellar evolution models including the previous generation of MIST and other models from the literature. MIST data products including stellar evolutiont tracks, isochrones, and bolometric correction tables can be obtained from the MIST project website, https://mist.science. All necessary files to reproduce MIST models are available from Zenodo.</description>

      <title>Dynamical masses of YSOs with the VLBA: DYNAMO VLBA: Trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of YSOs in Orion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results from a multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) survey of compact radio sources in the Orion complex, conducted within both the DYNAMO-VLBA and the GOBELINS projects. Our observations detected 216 compact radio sources, of which 58 yielded reliable multi-epoch astrometric solutions. For these sources, we derived trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions with typical precisions of about 0.05 mas and 0.10 mas yr$^{-1}$, respectively. The measured parallaxes range between 2.26 and 2.65 mas, corresponding to distances of 380 - 440 pc, and delineate the depth of the Orion star-forming complex. We determine mean distances of $405\pm16$ pc for NGC 2068, $403\pm5$ pc for NGC 2024, $407\pm12$ pc for the $\sigma$ Orionis region, $388.5\pm1.7$ pc for the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), and $438\pm12$ pc for L1641. A comparison with Gaia DR3 astrometry for 28 common sources reveals negligible mean parallax offsets ($\Delta\varpi=-0.02\pm0.01$ mas) and small systematic differences in proper motions ($\sim$0.07 mas yr$^{-1}$), likely due to residual rotation of the Gaia reference frame. Our results demonstrate the capability of high-precision radio astrometry to map embedded stellar populations and to provide an independent calibration of the Gaia reference system in obscured regions.</description>

      <title>Whistler-Alfv\'en turbulence in a non-neutral ultrarelativistic pair plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large-scale dynamics of most conventional space and astrophysical plasmas are predominantly governed by Alfv\'en modes, which are low-frequency magnetohydrodynamic modes existing in magnetized media. At scales smaller than the ion gyroscale or frequencies exceeding the ion cyclotron frequency, the Alfv\'en modes transform into kinetic-Alfv\'en or whistler modes that significantly contribute to plasma dynamics. However, this scenario reverses in non-neutral pair plasmas, such as those found in the magnetospheres of pulsars and magnetars, around rotating black holes and in their relativistic jets, as well as in certain laboratory plasmas. In these systems, the large-scale dynamics is governed by hybrid whistler-Alfv\'en modes, which transform into pure Alfv\'en modes at smaller scales. We derive the nonlinear equations that describe the dynamics of whistler-Alfv\'en modes in ultrarelativistic non-neutral magnetically dominated pair plasma and discuss the spectrum of turbulence governed by these equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assuming that dark matter is an ultralight pseudoscalar particle which couples to electromagnetism like an axion (an ALP), we demonstrate that the coupling of the cosmological magnetic field produced by the ALP field oscillations to the primordial dark matter fluctuations yields a spectrum of gauge field fluctuations which can produce a sufficient flux of Lyman-Werner photons to enable the Direct Collapse Black Hole formation scenario. The induced flux is consistent with the bounds on the excess flux of radio photons from ARCADE2 and EDGES measurements.</description>

      <title>The Rise of Ionized Gas Filaments in Early-Type Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiphase filamentary nebulae are ubiquitous in the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) of cool-core clusters, providing insight into baryon cycling and the feeding and feedback of supermassive black holes. However, BCGs account for less than 1% of all early-type galaxies (ETGs). To broaden our understanding of how multiphase filamentary nebulae form in ETGs and connect to the greater picture of galaxy evolution, it is crucial to explore ETGs that are outside of the dense centers of galaxy clusters or groups. We present VLT-MUSE IFU observations of 126 nearby non-central ETGs, detecting warm ionized gas in 62 of them. 35/62 host rotating gas disks with the majority of them morphologically and kinematically aligned with their stellar components, suggesting stellar mass loss may dominate their warm-gas origin. The remaining 27 host filamentary nebulae, often decoupled from the stellar components, resembling those observed in BCGs. These filamentary sources display unique emission line properties that cannot be fully explained by photoionization from post-asymptotic giant branch stars, active galactic nuclei, or fast gas shocks alone. For the twelve filamentary sources that have Chandra data, their soft X-ray emission exceeds or is consistent with (within uncertainties) unresolved low-mass X-ray binary emission, indicating that filamentary systems generally host an appreciable hot gas reservoir. We suggest that cooling-related processes, e.g., self-irradiation associated with the cooling hot gas, may contribute to the powering of warm gas line emission, similar to cool-core clusters, though the detailed mechanisms and physical conditions may differ. As a case study, we investigate NGC 4374, a non-central ETG with extensive Chandra observations, and find that its warm filaments are over-pressured compared to the hot filaments - opposite to what is observed in cool-core clusters.</description>

      <title>COLIBRE: calibrating subgrid feedback in cosmological simulations that include a cold gas phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the calibration of stellar and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in the subgrid model for the new COLIBRE hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. COLIBRE directly simulates the multi-phase interstellar medium and the evolution of dust grains, which is coupled to the chemistry. COLIBRE is calibrated at three resolutions: particle masses of $m_{\rm gas} \approx m_{\rm dm} \sim 10^7$ (m7), $10^6$ (m6), and $10^5~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ (m5). To calibrate the COLIBRE feedback at m7 resolution, we run Latin hypercubes of $\approx 200$ simulations that vary up to four subgrid parameters in cosmological volumes of ($50~\mathrm{cMpc}$)$^{3}$. We train Gaussian process emulators on these simulations to predict the $z=0$ galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) and size - stellar mass relation (SSMR) as functions of the model parameters, which we then fit to observations. The trained emulators not only provide the best-fitting parameter values but also enable us to investigate how different aspects of the prescriptions for supernova and AGN feedback affect the predictions. In particular, we demonstrate that while the observed $z=0$ GSMF and SSMR can be matched individually with a relatively simple supernova feedback model, simultaneously reproducing both necessitates a more sophisticated prescription. We show that the calibrated m7 COLIBRE model not only reproduces the calibration target observables, but also matches various other galaxy properties to which the model was not calibrated. Finally, we apply the calibrated m7 model to the m6 and m5 resolutions and, after slight manual adjustments of the subgrid parameters, achieve a similar level of agreement with the observed $z=0$ GSMF and SSMR.</description>

      <title>The possible accretion discs of GN-z11 at redshift z = 10.6, MoM-z14 at z = 14.44 and other high redshift objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The JWST has enabled the discovery of Active Galactic Nuclei at high redshifts. The intrinsic UV spectrum of GN-z11 at redshift z=10.6 has a spectral slope compatible with a standard accretion disc. By fitting a disc model to its spectrum, we find that the mass of the black hole must be above 1.12 x 10^7 Msun in order that it lies below the Eddington limit. We define this mass as the Eddington mass of the black hole. We note that the spectral shape is consistent with that of accreting stellar mass black holes sources in their soft state, for which no variability is expected. Mom-z14 is a more distant object at $z=14.44$ and has a similar UV slope. Disc model-fitting gives a similar result but lower mass accretion rate. We also examine3 further high redshift objects: GS z14-1, GHZ2 and PAN-z14-1 at z=13.86, 12.34 and 13.53, again obtaining similar results. If sub-Eddington accretion discs are indeed the origin of much of the UV emission from these objects, then the existence of massive black holes less than 304 and 290 Myr after the Big Bang point either to exceptional black hole seeds or to primordial black holes. The observed spread of UV spectral slopes in high redshift objects suggests that our approach may be relevant to about half of that population.</description>

      <title>The HyLight model for hydrogen emission lines in simulated nebulae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen recombination lines provide key diagnostics of ionized gas in galaxies, yet most hydrodynamical simulations estimate hydrogen level populations using interpolated emissivity tables rather than computing them directly from local physical conditions. We present HyLight, a Python-based atomic model that calculates hydrogen level populations and line emissivities from the gas density, temperature, and ionization state, enabling accurate predictions in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium environments. Benchmark comparisons show that HyLight reproduces Cloudy predictions for Balmer, Paschen, and Brackett emissivities to within 1 per cent under typical photoionized nebular conditions, while discrepancies of several tens of per cent arise relative to other published calculations. As an illustrative application, we use HyLight to compute photoionization-to-line intensity ratios in an HII nebula and generate synthetic hydrogen emission maps from a radiation-hydrodynamical simulation that includes non-equilibrium thermochemistry. Combining physical consistency with flexibility, HyLight provides a robust framework for connecting hydrodynamical simulations with observational diagnostics of photoionized regions, and enhances our ability to interpret hydrogen emission in complex, non-equilibrium astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>A Vertically Orientated Dark Matter Halo Marks a Flip of the Galactic Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08684v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unveiling the 3D shape of the Milky Way's dark-matter halo is critical to understanding its formation history. We created an innovative dynamical model with minimal assumptions on the internal dynamical structures and accommodates a highly flexible triaxial DM halo. By applying the method to 6D phase-space data of K-giant stars from LAMOST + Gaia, we robustly determine the 3D dark-matter distribution of the Milky Way out to approximately $50$ kpc. We discover a triaxial, nearly oblate dark-matter halo with $q_{\rm DM} = Z/X= 0.92\pm0.08$, $p_{\rm DM} = Y/X= 0.8\pm0.2$ averagely within 50 kpc, where $Z$ axis is defined perpendicular to the stellar disk. The axes ratio $q_{\rm DM} &gt; p_{\rm DM}$ is strongly preferred; the long-intermediate axis plane of the dark-matter halo is unexpectedly vertical to the Galactic disk, yet aligned with the `plane of satellites'. This striking configuration suggests that the Galactic disk (and the inner halo) has flipped, likely torqued by minor mergers, from an original alignment with the outer dark-matter halo and satellite plane, as supported by Milky Way analogues from Auriga and TNG50. By allowing $q_{\rm DM}(r)$ and $p_{\rm DM}(r)$ vary with radii, we find tentative evidence that the dark-matter halo is twisted, that it agrees alignment with the disk in the inner regions and transitions to a vertical orientation at $r\gtrsim 20$ kpc, supporting the disk flip scenario prediction. Such disk reorientation is non-trivial yet its physical mechanism is straightforward to comprehend and naturally originates a vertical satellite plane. Our findings offer a unified framework that links dark-matter halo orientation, satellite alignment, and disk evolution, reinforcing the internal consistency of the Milky Way in $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>The influence of AGN feedback on star formation in red spiral galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the influence of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback on star formation in red spiral galaxies by analyzing a sample of 324 red and 273 blue face-on spirals selected from 115 low-redshift galaxy clusters. This multi-wavelength dataset combines optical emission line data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with X-ray fluxes from Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray space telescopes. Using diagnostic emission line ratios, we constructed Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagrams, introduced in 1981 to classify galaxies based on nuclear activity. Our analysis reveals that most red spirals exhibit AGN or low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) signatures, based on optical data, as determined by their location in the BPT, Cid Fernandes, and Mazzolari diagrams. These results are consistent with the presence of negative feedback from AGNs quenching star formation. Conversely, X-ray analysis reveals that many blue spirals exhibit high X-ray luminosities and are situated in the AGN region of emission line ratio diagrams, suggesting that AGN-driven positive feedback may be enhancing star formation. Our findings support the hypothesis that AGN feedback plays a key role in the evolution of spiral galaxies, particularly in quenching star formation and driving the transition from blue to red spiral systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new Chandra/ACIS-S imaging spectroscopy of two luminous type 2 quasars, FIRST J120041.4+314745 ($z$=0.116) and 2MASX J13003807+5454367 ($z$=0.088), and compare their X-ray emission with Hubble Space Telescope [O III]$\lambda$5007 morphologies and kinematics. Both systems show kiloparsec-scale soft X-ray emission. In FIRST J120041, the X-ray morphology is clumpy and closely follows the [O III] structures, with surface-brightness peaks co-spatial with the highest [O III] velocities (600-750 km s$^{-1}$) and broadest line widths ($\sim$1700 km s$^{-1}$). In 2MASX J130038, the X-ray emission is centrally concentrated and weakly correlated with rotational [O III] kinematics. Spectral modeling indicates that photoionization dominates the soft X-rays in both quasars. The inferred hot-gas reservoirs are substantial, $M_{\rm x-ray}\sim4.5\times10^{8}M_\odot$ (FIRST J120041) and $M_{\rm x-ray}\sim1.8\times10^{8}M_\odot$ (2MASX J130038), exceeding the outflowing [O III] masses by factors of $\sim$4 and $\sim$16. In 2MASX J130038, we identify a tentative blueshifted Fe XXVI Ly$\alpha$ line at $E_{\rm rest}=7.14\pm0.06$ keV ($v\sim7600$ km s$^{-1}$), consistent with a hot wind confined to the inner few hundred parsecs. Combining these results with a broader sample of twelve type 2 quasars, we argue that luminous quasars evolve along a continuous feedback sequence regulated by progressive clearing of circumnuclear gas. As AGN radiation and winds pierce the surrounding medium, systems transition from heavily enshrouded, compact configurations to phases where the X-ray and [O III] components strongly couple and, eventually, to energetically dominant outflows. FIRST J120041 and 2MASX J130038 represent two points along this sequence, tracing the emergence and growth of hot winds as primary drivers of quasar-scale feedback.</description>

      <title>Probing Heavily Obscured AGN in Major Galaxy Mergers Using the mm-X-ray Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of heavily obscured supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth in late-stage galaxy mergers is challenging: column densities $N_{\mathrm{H}}&gt;10^{24},\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ can block most nuclear emission, leaving significant gaps in the SMBH growth census. Millimeter-wave continuum emission offers a potential window into this obscured phase, as it can trace Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) activity through mechanisms less affected by dust extinction. In this work, we test whether the observed correlation between millimeter ($\sim200,\mathrm{GHz}$) and hard X-ray (14 - 150,keV) luminosities can be used to plausibly identify hidden AGN in local (Ultra)Luminous Infrared Galaxies (U)LIRGs, including systems hosting confirmed dual AGN. We identify three sources -- one confirmed AGN and two strong candidates -- presenting significant evidence of AGN activity. The confirmed dual AGN lie within $\sim3\sigma$ of the mm--X-ray correlation, suggesting this relation can be used to identify hidden pairs. By combining the position of each source relative to this correlation with independent star formation rate constraints, we propose a method to disentangle AGN and star formation contributions for sources with measured column densities. While our analysis is based on a small, heterogeneous local sample and relies on empirical scaling relations, these results indicate that millimeter continuum emission may provide a useful complementary diagnostic for obscured SMBH growth. ALMA observations at high angular resolutions are particularly valuable for this approach, while future facilities such as the ngVLA will be essential to test its robustness in larger and more distant samples.</description>

      <title>The size-velocity dispersion relationship of Galactic HII regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22656</link>

Abstract: The size-velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) relation, while well established for giant HII regions, remains uncertain for their smaller counterparts (physical radii R &lt; 20 pc). Thanks to the LAMOST MRS-N dataset's large sky coverage and high spatial/spectral resolution, we examined this relationship using 10 isolated Galactic HII regions with R &lt; 20 pc. Our results reveal two key findings: (1) these small-size HII regions remarkably follow the same size-$\sigma$ relation as giant HII regions, suggesting this correlation could serve as a novel distance indicator for Galactic HII regions; and (2) we find distinct dynamical behaviors between younger and older HII regions. Specifically, in younger (&lt; 0.5 Myr), ionization-bounded HII regions, the velocity dispersion shows no correlation with expansion velocity, indicating that turbulence is driven primarily by stellar winds and ionization processes. In contrast, in older (&gt; 0.5 Myr), matter-bounded HII regions, a clear correlation emerges, implying that expansion-driven processes begin to play a significant role in generating turbulence. We therefore propose an evolutionary transition in the primary turbulence mechanisms, from being dominated by stellar winds and radiation to being increasingly influenced by expansion-driven dynamics, during the evolution of HII regions. Considering the small sample size used in this work, particularly the inclusion of only two young HII regions, which also have large uncertainties in their expansion velocities, further confirmation of this interpretation will require higher-resolution 2D spectroscopy to resolve blended kinematic components along the line of sight for more accurate estimation of expansion velocities, along with an expanded sample that specifically includes more young HII regions.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dynamically-formed massive black holes in Little Red Dots from X-ray non-detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of massive, compact galaxies (Little Red Dots, LRDs) at $z \sim 2$ challenges early structure formation models, suggesting rapid stellar and black hole (BH) assembly. While LRDs are efficient environments for BH growth, many show no X-ray evidence of strong AGN emission. We utilize a subsample of X-ray non-detected LRDs to test the compatibility of collision-based BH formation scenarios and constrain physical parameters like metallicity and column density. Our results indicate LRDs are ideal birthplaces for massive BHs, particularly given a mass-radius relation $R_{gal} \propto M_{gal}^{0.6}$. Collision-based models suggest seed masses larger than those in the local Universe, consistent with high-redshift BH mass-radius relations. We modeled BH seed formation and X-ray emission (0.3-7 keV) against observed upper limits. We find that mass-radius exponents $&gt; 0.55$ favor the collision-based scenario; however, consistency with stacked X-ray analysis requires specific accretion and obscuration parameters. Constant or increasing SFR scenarios with high Eddington ratios are feasible but necessitate larger column densities or higher metal enrichment. Alternatively, moderate sub-Eddington accretion reconciles massive seeds with observed masses and X-ray weakness. We conclude that even if LRDs began as starbursts, they should eventually evolve into AGNs.</description>

      <title>Improving Precision in Kinematic Weak Lensing with MIRoRS: Model-Independent Restoration of Reflection Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel, model-independent technique for fitting the cross-component of weak lensing shear, $\gamma_\times$, along a line of sight by combining kinematic and photometric measurements of a single lensed galaxy. Rather than relying on parametric models, we fit for the shear parameter that best transforms the velocity field to restore its underlying symmetries, while also incorporating photometric data for the change in position angle due to shear. We first validate our technique with idealized mock data, exploring the method's response to variations in shear, position angle, inclination, and noise. On this idealized mock data, our combined kinematic and photometric model demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional parametric or kinematic-only approaches. We also explore the effects of asymmetric warps and show that rotation direction can impart a small bias on the fit of $\gamma_\times$. Subsequently, we apply our method to a dataset of 358 halos from the Illustris TNG simulations, achieving a notable reduction in the uncertainty of $\gamma_\times$ to 0.039, marking a substantial improvement over previous analysis of the dataset with a parametric model. Finally, we introduce an outlier rejection method based on Moran's $I$ test for spatial autocorrelation. Identifying and filtering out halos with spatially correlated residuals reduces the overall uncertainty to 0.028. Our results underscore the efficacy of combining kinematic and photometric data for weak lensing studies, providing a more precise and targeted measurement of shear along an individual line of sight.</description>

      <title>Bright ring features and polarization structures in Kerr-Sen black hole images illuminated by radiatively inefficient accretion flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03857v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) simulations, we investigate the bright ring features and polarization structures in images of the Kerr-Sen black hole associated with Sgr A*, as illuminated by 230 GHz thermal synchrotron emission from radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAF). Our findings reveal that an increase in the dilaton parameter leads to a shrinking of the bright ring, accompanied by enhancements in both its width and brightness. As the disk thickness grows, the bright ring's diameter and width both decrease. The brightness enhancement induced by the disk thickness is less prominent than that driven by the dilaton parameter. Comparing with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observational data of SgrA*, we present the allowed ranges of black hole parameters, and find that effects of the disk thickness on the allowed parameter space are stronger than those of the observer's inclination. Furthermore, we analyze the coefficient $\beta_2$, associated with the two-fold rotational symmetry of the electric vector position angles (EVPA), to probe the polarization structure of the black hole images, and reveal that effects of the disk thickness on $\beta_2$ are much weaker than those from the dilaton parameter.</description>

      <title>AT 2025abao: the fourth luminous red nova in M 31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of luminous red nova (LRN) AT 2025abao, the fourth discovered in M 31. The LRN, associated to the AGB star WNTR23bzdiq, was discovered during the fast rise following the minimum phase. It reached the peak at $g=15.1$ mag ($M_g=-9.5\pm0.1$ mag), and then it settled onto a long-duration plateau in the red bands, lasting 70 days, while it was slowly linearly declining in the blue bands. The object showed similarities at peak with the canonical LRNe V838 Monocerotis, V1309 Scorpii, and with the faint and fast-evolving AT 2019zhd, the third LRN in M31, though the later evolution is different. Spectroscopically, AT 2025abao evolved as a canonical LRN: the early spectra present a blue continuum with narrow Balmer lines in emission; at peak, the spectral continuum has cooled to a yellow colour, with a photospheric temperature of 6000 K. Balmer lines have weakened while absorption lines from metals (Fe I, Fe II, Sc II, Ba II, Ti II) have developed, and in particular broad (FWHM$\sim$700 km/s) from the UV Ca II H&amp;K lines. Medium- and high-resolution spectra reveal a counter-P Cygni absorption profile in H$\alpha$. Finally, late time spectra show an orange continuum ($T\sim$4000-5000 K), a return in strength of the Balmer lines and the formation of molecular absorption bands. AT 2025abao is the rare case of a LRN with detailed archival information regarding the progenitor system. For the first time, we obtained the spectral energy distribution in the infrared of the precursor of a LRN, which is consistent with that of an M giant/AGB. We propose that the dichotomy of light curve behaviour in LRNe (two peaks vs. plateau) can be explained by the extent and H-richness of the common envelope.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with galaxy clusters using machine learning. Application to eROSITA Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context: We present the first Cosmological Parameter inferences from eROSITA X-ray observations of galaxy clusters using a Machine Learning algorithm. Methods: We train a Random Forest using mock catalogs of clusters from Magneticum multi-cosmology hydrodynamical simulations. We apply the trained ML algorithm to observed X-ray features (gas luminosity, mass, and temperature) at different redshifts from the eROSITA eFEDS and eRASS1 catalogs. Results: We obtain cosmological constraints with precision comparable to those from standard analyses, such as weak lensing and cluster abundances. We infer $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.30^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, $\sigma_8=0.81\pm0.01$, and $h_0=0.710\pm0.004$. The recovered parameters show no tension in the $\Omega_{\rm m}-\sigma_8$ space, but a significant deviation of $h_0$ from the Planck estimates. These inferences remain rather stable against variations of the input observable set and parameter space coverage. These results indicate that correlations among intracluster properties contain cosmological information beyond that encoded in the cluster abundance alone, which can be captured by machine learning trained on multi-cosmology simulations. Conclusions: ML algorithms trained on multi-cosmology hydrodynamical simulations can effectively infer cosmological parameters directly from galaxy cluster data. This is a change of paradigm in the context of cosmological parameter inferences. This approach complements traditional cluster-count analyses and is particularly suited to large upcoming surveys, where systematic uncertainties in mass calibration may otherwise dominate the error budget. It also highlights the potential of large-scale X-ray surveys to deliver independent tests of the standard cosmological model.</description>
