      <title>Random Operator-Valued Kernels and Moment Dilations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies random operator-valued positive definite (p.d.) kernels and their connection to moment dilations. A class of random p.d. kernels is introduced in which the positivity requirement is imposed only in expectation, extending the deterministic case. Basic properties are established, including convexity, sampling stability, and the relationship between mean kernels and deterministic ones. A Gaussian factorization result is proved under a Hilbert-Schmidt/trace condition, clarifying the difference between pathwise and mean-square positive definiteness and linking the construction to radonification in the non-trace-class setting. Moment dilation is then formulated for random operators, extending classical dilation theory to preserve equality of mixed moments in expectation. The resulting dilation triples admit interpretation in terms of unitary dynamics, connecting statistical moment structure with operator-theoretic realization.</description>

      <title>The pure $Y=X^{d}$ truncated moment problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\beta \equiv\beta^{(2n)}$ be a real bivariate sequence of degree $2n$. We study the existence of representing measures for $\beta$ supported in the planar curve $y=x^{d}$ in the case where the associated moment matrix $M_{n}(\beta)$ is $(y-x^{d})$-pure. In Section 2 we provide a general necessary and sufficient condition for representing measures in terms of positive semidefiniteness and recursive generation of the associated core matrix. In particular, if the core matrix is positive definite, then the core variety for $\beta$, i.e., the union of supports of all finitely atomic representing measures, is the whole curve $y = x^d$. In later sections, we provide various other concrete necessary or sufficient conditions for measures. For $d=3$, we provide a core-variety proof of the result of the first-named author characterizing the existence of representing measures. For $d \geq 4$ we develop a sufficient condition for the core variety to be finite or empty. For $d=4$, we adapt the technique of the second-named author, involving positive completions of partially-defined Hankel matrices, to provide necessary and sufficient numerical conditions for representing measures. We conclude with an example showing that in the $d=4$ case, the core variety can be finite, with a unique representing measure, which cannot occur for $d&lt; 4$.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-based inversion and analysis of Flett, Riesz and bi-parametric potentials in $(k,1)$ generalized Fourier framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct and analyze Bessel and Flett potentials associated with the heat and Poisson semigroups in the framework of the $(k,1)$-generalized Fourier transform. We establish fundamental properties of these potentials and derive an explicit inversion formula for the Flett potential using a wavelet-like transform. Furthermore, we introduce a $\beta$-semigroup $\mathcal{B}_k^{(\beta,t)}$, defined via $W_k^{(\beta, t)}$, which enables the formulation of an inversion formula for the Riesz potential. As a unifying extension, we define and investigate bi-parametric potentials $\mathfrak{J}_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}$, which generalize both the Bessel potential and the Flett potential. In addition, we define the associated function spaces.</description>

      <title>New Lower Bounds for the Minimum Singular Value in Matrix Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of the matrix selection problem is to select a submatrix $A_{S}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times k}$ from $A\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times m}$ such that its minimum singular value is maximized. In this paper, we employ the interlacing polynomial method to investigate this problem. This approach allows us to identify a submatrix $A_{S_0}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times k}$ and establish a lower bound for its minimum singular value. Specifically, unlike common interlacing polynomial approaches that estimate the smallest root of the expected characteristic polynomial via barrier functions, we leverage the direct relationship between roots and coefficients. This leads to a tighter lower bound when $k$ is close to $n$. For the case where $AA^{\top}=\mathbb{I}_n$ and $k=n$, our result improves the well-known result by Hong-Pan, which involves extracting a basis from a tight frame and establishing a lower bound for the minimum singular value of the basis matrix.</description>

      <title>The phi-Process: Operator-Algebraic Embeddings of Possibilities, Transfinite Stabilization, and a Quantitative Application to Sensory Depletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formalize a transfinite Phi process that treats all possibility embeddings as operators on structured state spaces including complete lattices, Banach and Hilbert spaces, and orthomodular lattices. We prove a determinization lemma showing that lifting to sets or distributions yields a deterministic global dynamic, an ordinal stabilization theorem sending operator transforms to the fixed subspace by stage omega under normal spectral contraction, and a product of Riesz projections theorem for commuting layers. We establish a compositionality law for lifted maps, show closure of Phi packings, and present a quantitative application to sensory depletion that models tissue removal as a projection and derives strict decreases in the attainable fixed point under minimal monotonicity and positivity assumptions. We also state measurable conditions for probabilistic lifts, give explicit non normal and non commuting counterexamples, and provide finite dimensional and stochastic witnesses together with per theorem scope tables and a small reproducible code appendix.</description>

      <title>The Multivariate Taylor Measure Function Space and a Generalization of Taylor's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the recently defined concept of Taylor measures, we propose a generalization of Taylor's theorem to measurable, non-analytic functions, that do not require differentiation. We study consequences of the generalization, including the definition and properties of a new space of functions, which will be called multivariate Taylor measure function space. The proposed generalization emerges as a unifying framework that includes many concepts from mathematics as special cases.</description>

      <title>Frechet and Mordukhovich Derivative (Coderivative) and Covering Constant for Single-Valued Mapping in Euclidean Space with Applications (I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Frechet derivatives and Mordukhovich derivatives (or coderivatives) of single-valued mappings in Euclidean spaces. At first, we prove the guideline for calculating the Frechet derivatives of single-valued mappings by their partial derivatives. Then, by using the connections between Frechet derivatives and Mordukhovich derivatives (or coderivatives) of single-valued mappings in Banach spaces, we derive the useful rules for calculating the Mordukhovich derivatives of single-valued mappings in Euclidean spaces. For practicing these rules, we find the precise solutions of the Frechet derivatives and Mordukhovich derivatives for some single-valued mappings in Euclidean spaces (in R^2, it can be extended to R^n). By using these solutions, we will find the covering constants for the considered mappings. As applications of the results about the covering constants and by applying the Arutyunov Mordukhovich and Zhukovskiy Parameterized Coincidence Point Theorem, we solve some parameterized equations.</description>

      <title>Sampling theorems for inverse problems on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider inverse problems consisting of the reconstruction of an unknown signal $f$ from noisy measurements $y=Ff+\text{noise}$, where $Ff$ is a function on a Riemannian manifold without boundary $\mathcal M$. We consider the case when only pointwise samples are available, namely $y_j = (Ff)(x_j)+\eta_j$, where $\{x_j\}_{j=1}^n\subseteq\mathcal M$ is a Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund family. We derive sampling theorems providing explicit bounds on the reconstruction error depending on $n$, the smoothness of $f$ and the properties of $F$. We study in detail the case when $F$ is a convolution on a compact two-point homogeneous space. As a corollary, we state a sampling theorem for convolutions on the two-dimensional sphere, and discuss four relevant examples related to terrestrial and celestial measurements.</description>

      <title>Two improvements upon the paper "Wiener--Luxemburg amalgam spaces"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short note seeks to present two new results that essentially improve the corresponding statements from the author's paper ``Wiener--Luxemburg amalgam spaces''. Specifically, in our first result, we show that when both the local and the global components of a pair of r.i. quasi-Banach function spaces are appropriately ordered, then both their sum and intersection can be characterised as the appropriate amalgam of said spaces, up to equivalence of quasinorms. Then, in our second result, we provide a sufficient condition for the validity of the Hardy--Littlewood--P\'{o}lya principle that is weaker than the one obtained originally. We also discuss some consequences of those results and provide further context.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Max-Min Exponential Neural Network Operators in Orlicz Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this current work, we propose a Max Min approach for approximating functions using exponential neural network operators. We extend this framework to develop the Max Min Kantorovich-type exponential neural network operators and investigate their approximation properties. We study both pointwise and uniform convergence for univariate functions. To analyze the order of convergence, we use the logarithmic modulus of continuity and estimate the corresponding rate of convergence. Furthermore, we examine the convergence behavior of the Max Min Kantorovich type exponential neural network operators within the Orlicz space setting. We provide some graphical representations to illustrate the approximation error of the function through suitable kernel and sigmoidal activation functions.</description>

      <title>An interpolation approach to Schoenberg type inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Schoenberg inequality relates the squared moduli of the critical points of a polynomial to those of its zeros, under the condition that the centroid of the zeros lies at the origin. Its generalizations to other orders are referred to as Schoenberg type inequalities. While higher-order analogues have been established for certain even exponents, the general case remains poorly understood. In this paper, we substantially extend the known results by introducing an interpolation-based framework that unifies the treatment of Schoenberg type inequalities across a continuum of exponents. Our approach employs complex interpolation between $\ell^p$ spaces and Schatten $p$-classes $S_p$, yielding sharp Schoenberg type inequalities of order $p$ for all $p \ge 1$, including previously inaccessible intermediate exponents. This completely resolves an open problem posed by Kushel and Tyaglov. In the process, we also provide a new proof of the Schoenberg type inequality of order $1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $f \in \mathscr{S}^2(\mathcal S)_{o}$, the collection of radial $L^2$-Schwartz class functions on Damek--Ricci spaces $\mathcal S$, we consider the Schr\"odinger maximal function, \begin{equation*} S^* f(x):= \displaystyle\sup_{0&lt;t&lt;4/Q^2} \left|S_tf(x)\right|\:,\:\:\:\:\:\:x\in\mathcal S\:, \end{equation*} corresponding to the Laplace--Beltrami operator $\Delta$ with initial data $f$. We first obtain the complete description of the pairs $(q, \alpha) \in [1, \infty] \times [0,\infty)$ for which the estimate \begin{equation*} {\|S^*f\|}_{L^q\left(B_R\right)} \le C_R\: {\|f\|}_{H^{\alpha}(\mathcal S)}\:, \end{equation*} holds on geodesic balls $B_R$, for all $f \in \mathscr{S}^2(\mathcal S)_{o}$. Our results are sharp and agree with the Euclidean case. We also prove that for all $f \in \mathscr{S}^2(\mathcal S)_{o}$, the following global estimate \begin{equation*} {\|S^*f\|}_{L^{2,\infty}(\mathcal S)} \le C\: {\|f\|}_{H^{\alpha}(\mathcal S)},\:\:\:\:\alpha&gt;1/2, \end{equation*} holds true.</description>

Abstract: In graphs and Riemannian manifolds where the kernel of the diffusion semigroup satisfies pointwise sub-Gaussian estimates, we study the range of parameters \( p \in (1, \infty) \) and \( \gamma \in [0, 1] \) for which the quantities \( \|\Delta^\gamma f\|_p \) and \( \|\nabla f\|_p \) can be compared. In particular, we prove that in such metric spaces, the Riesz transform \( \nabla \Delta^{-1/2} \) is unbounded on \( L^p \) for all \( p \in (2, \infty) \), thereby demonstrating a clear departure from the behavior observed in the Euclidean setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the construction of holomorphic functions on a simply connected domain satisfying that all its derivatives and antiderivatives under a composition operator have a dense orbit. Such functions will be called Luh hypercyclic vectors for the respective composition operator. We show that there is a dense linear manifold of Luh hypercyclic vectors. Moreover, we study the dynamics of cosine operator function generated by weighted composition operators on solid Banach function spaces, in particular on Orlicz and Morrey spaces, and we give sufficient conditions for supercyclicity of such cosine operator functions in terms of the corresponding weight function. Also, we give concrete examples of weighted translations satisfying these sufficient conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To generalise evolution families we consider systems of contractions $\{\varphi(u, v)\}_{(u, v) \in E}$ defined on the edges of a graph $\mathcal{G} = (\Omega, E)$. In this setup the Markov property, or \emph{divisibility}, can be modelled via $\varphi(u, v)\varphi(v, w) = \varphi(u, w)$ for edges $(u, v), (v, w), (u, w) \in E$. We obtain results in three settings: 1) contractive Banach space operators; 2) positive unital maps on $C^{\ast}$-algebras; and 3) CPTP-maps on trace class operators on a Hilbert space. In the discrete setting we are able to dilate possibly indivisible families of contractions to divisible families of operators with 'nice' properties (viz. surjective isometries resp. $C^{\ast}$-algebraic automorphisms resp. unitary representations). In the special case of linearly ordered graphs equipped with the order topology, we establish sufficient conditions for strongly continuous dilations of possibly indivisible families in the Banach space and $C^{\ast}$-algebra contexts. To achieve these results we work with string-rewriting systems, and make use of and extend dilation theorems of Stroescu [43], Kraus [23, 24], and vom Ende--Dirr [49].</description>

      <title>Isometric rigidity of the Wasserstein space $\mathcal{W}_1(\mathbf{G})$ over Carnot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to study isometries of the $1$-Wasserstein space $\mathcal{W}_1(\mathbf{G})$ over Carnot groups endowed with horizontally strictly convex norms. Well-known examples of horizontally strictly convex norms on Carnot groups are the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n$ endowed with the Heisenberg-Kor\'anyi norm, or with the Naor-Lee norm; and $H$-type Iwasawa groups endowed with a Kor\'anyi-type norm. We prove that on a general Carnot group there always exists a horizontally strictly convex norm. The main result of the paper says that if $(\mathbf{G},N_{\mathbf{G}})$ is a Carnot group where $N_{\mathbf{G}}$ is a horizontally strictly convex norm on $\mathbf{G}$, then the Wasserstein space $\mathcal{W}_1(\mathbf{G})$ is isometrically rigid. That is, for every isometry $\Phi:\mathcal{W}_1(\mathbf{G})\to\mathcal{W}_1(\mathbf{G})$ there exists an isometry $\psi:\mathbf{G}\to \mathbf{G}$ such that $\Phi=\psi_{\#}$.</description>

      <title>Hypothesis Spaces for Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a hypothesis space for deep learning based on deep neural networks (DNNs). By treating a DNN as a function of two variables - the input variable and the parameter variable - we consider the set of DNNs where the parameter variable belongs to a space of weight matrices and biases determined by a prescribed depth and layer widths. To construct a Banach space of functions of the input variable, we take the weak* closure of the linear span of this DNN set. We prove that the resulting Banach space is a reproducing kernel Banach space (RKBS) and explicitly construct its reproducing kernel. Furthermore, we investigate two learning models - regularized learning and the minimum norm interpolation (MNI) problem - within the RKBS framework by establishing representer theorems. These theorems reveal that the solutions to these learning problems can be expressed as a finite sum of kernel expansions based on training data.</description>

      <title>Measures and Trajectory Properties in Oscillator Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18093v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of trajectories in harmonic oscillator systems equipped with a point, absolutely continuous, or singular measure. As demonstrated in [30], infinite-dimensional linear flows of countable oscillator systems exhibit a new class of trajectory behavior. Specifically, these trajectories are non-periodic, and their projections onto any four-dimensional symplectic subspace fail to be dense in the corresponding projection of the invariant torus. Such trajectories do not arise in finite-dimensional systems, are non-generic for countable oscillator systems, but become generic in the continual case. We prove that for a countable harmonic oscillator system, every point on a non-degenerate invariant torus is a non-wandering point of the flow. In contrast, for a continual system with an absolutely continuous measure, all points on such a torus are wandering. Furthermore, for continual systems with a singular measure, we establish sufficient conditions on the measure and torus that rule out the existence of both transitive trajectories and non-wandering points. As an application, we exhibit a class of singular Bernoulli measures satisfying these conditions.</description>
