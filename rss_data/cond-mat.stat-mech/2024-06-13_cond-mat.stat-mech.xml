      <title>Conformable Derivative Approach to Granular Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proper modeling of complex systems requires innovative mathematical tools. In this sense, we sought to use deformed or fractal derivatives for studying the dynamics of systems, particularly those, such as granular gases, in which the description of the dynamics can be done by using the stretched exponential probability densities. In this contribution we draw up three results of this application of mathematical tools. The first result shows that when we use constraints with finite momentum and the principle of maximum entropy, the Kohlrausch--Williams--Watts function, known as stretched exponential, emerges naturally and in a simpler way, when compared to results in the literature. Next, we obtain generalized expressions for the Langevin equation, as well as its solutions for three different deformed derivatives, including those connected with nonaddictive statistical mechanics. The Haff's-like law for granular gases are obtained. Next, we calculate the partition function $Z$ for a granular gas system by building up the probability density in terms of the stretched exponential function. From this partition function, we determine the internal energy of the system as well as the specific heat, both dependent on temperature. The consistency with classical approach of kinetic theory for ideal gases was verified.</description>

      <title>Scaling properties of (2+1) directed polymers in the low temperature limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In terms of the replica method we consider the low temperature limit of (2+1) directed polymers in a random potential. The proposed approach allows to compute the scaling exponent $\theta$ of the free energy fluctuations as well as the left tail of its probability distribution function. It is argued that $\theta = 1/4$ which is slightly different from the zero-temperature numerical value which is close to $0.241$.</description>

      <title>Dissipation bounds precision of current response to kinetic perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precision of currents in Markov networks is bounded by dissipation via the so-called thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR). In our work, we demonstrate a similar inequality that bounds the precision of the static current response to perturbations of kinetic barriers. Perturbations of such type, which affect only the system kinetics but not the thermodynamic forces, are highly important in biochemistry and nanoelectronics. We prove that our inequality cannot be derived from the standard TUR. Instead, it implies the standard TUR and provides an even tighter bound for dissipation. We also provide a procedure for obtaining the optimal response precision for a given model.</description>

      <title>Resetting by rescaling: exact results for a diffusing particle in one-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a simple model of a diffusive particle on a line, undergoing a stochastic resetting with rate $r$, via rescaling its current position by a factor $a$, which can be either positive or negative. For $|a|&lt;1$, the position distribution becomes stationary at long times and we compute this limiting distribution exactly for all $|a|&lt;1$. This symmetric distribution has a Gaussian shape near its peak at $x=0$, but decays exponentially for large $|x|$. We also studied the mean first-passage time (MFPT) $T(0)$ to a target located at a distance $L$ from the initial position (the origin) of the particle. As a function of the initial position $x$, the MFPT $T(x)$ satisfies a nonlocal second order differential equation and we have solved it explicitly for $0 \leq a &lt; 1$. For $-1&lt;a\leq 0$, we also solved it analytically but up to a constant factor $\kappa$ whose value can be determined independently from numerical simulations. Our results show that, for all $-1&lt;a&lt;1$, the MFPT $T(0)$ (starting from the origin) shows a minimum at $r=r^*(a)$. However, the optimised MFPT $T_{\rm opt}(a)$ turns out to be a monotonically increasing function of $a$ for $-1&lt;a&lt;1$. This demonstrates that, compared to the standard resetting to the origin ($a=0$), while the positive rescaling is not beneficial for the search of a target, the negative rescaling is. Thus resetting via rescaling followed by a reflection around the origin expedites the search of a target in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the quantum distinction of regular and chaotic classical dynamics in dissipative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Grobe-Haake-Sommers (GHS) conjecture generalizes the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture to dissipative systems, connecting classically chaotic systems with quantum spectra that exhibit level repulsion as predicted by Ginibre ensembles. Here, we show that the GHS conjecture does not hold for the open Dicke model, which is a spin-boson model of experimental interest. Surprisingly, where the open quantum model shows Ginibre level statistics, we do not always find evidence of chaotic structures in the classical limit. This result challenges the universality of the GHS conjecture and raises the question of what is the source of spectral correlations in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Exact lattice bosonization of finite N matrix quantum mechanics and c = 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a new exact lattice bosonization of matrix quantum mechanics (equivalently of non-relativistic fermions) that is valid for arbitrary rank N of the matrix, based on an exact operator bosonization introduced earlier in [1]. The trace identities are automatically incorporated in this formalism. The finite number N of fermions is reflected in the finite number N of bosonic oscillators, or equivalently to the finite number N of lattice points. The fermion Hamiltonian is exactly mappable to a bosonic Hamiltonian. At large N, the latter becomes local and corresponds to the lattice version of a relativistic boson Hamiltonian, with a lattice spacing of order 1/N. The finite lattice spacing leads to a finite entanglement entropy (EE) of the bosonic theory, which reproduces the finite EE of the fermionic theory. Such a description is not available in the standard bosonization in terms of fermion density fluctuations on the Fermi surface, which does not have a built-in short distance cut-off (see, however, [2]). The bosonic lattice is equipped with a geometry determined by the matrix potential or equivalently by the shape of the Fermi surface. Our bosonization also works in the double scaled c=1 model, where the bosonic EE again turns out to be finite, with the short distance cut-off turning as g_s l_s, and reproduces the matrix result. Once again, such a short distance cut-off cannot appear in the conventional dual of c=1 in terms of the 2D string ``tachyon'', where the expected short distance scale is l_s. This indicates our bosonization as a possibly different dual description to the c=1 matrix model appropriate for ``local physics'' like quantum entanglement, by contrast with the conventional duality to the eigenvalue density which works well for asymptotic observables like S-matrices. We briefly discuss possible relation of our bosonization to D0 branes.</description>

      <title>Generalized Zeno effect and entanglement dynamics induced by fermion counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional lattice system of free fermions subjected to a generalized measurement process: the system exchanges particles with its environment, but each fermion leaving or entering the system is counted. In contrast to the freezing of dynamics due to frequent measurements of lattice-site occupation numbers, a high rate of fermion counts induces fast fluctuations in the state of the system. Still, through numerical simulations of quantum trajectories and an analytical approach based on replica Keldysh field theory, we find that instantaneous correlations and entanglement properties of free fermions subjected to fermion counting and local occupation measurements are strikingly similar. We explain this similarity through a generalized Zeno effect induced by fermion counting and a universal long-wavelength description in terms of an $\mathrm{SU}(R)$ nonlinear sigma model. Further, for both types of measurement processes, we present strong evidence against the existence of a critical phase with logarithmic entanglement and conformal invariance at finite measurement rates. Instead, we identify a well-defined and finite critical range of length scales on which signatures of conformal invariance are observable. While area-law entanglement is established beyond a scale that is exponentially large in the measurement rate, the upper boundary of the critical range is only algebraically large and thus numerically accessible.</description>

      <title>Many-body thermal states on a quantum computer: a variational approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: {Many-body quantum states at thermal equilibrium are ubiquitous in nature. Investigating their dynamical properties is a formidable task due to the complexity of the Hilbert space they live in. Quantum computers may have the potential to effectively simulate quantum systems, provided that the many-body state under scrutiny can be faithfully prepared via an efficient algorithm. With this aim, we present a hybrid quantum--classical variational quantum algorithm for the preparation of the Gibbs state of the quantum $XY$ model. Our algorithm is based on the Grover and Rudolph parametrized quantum circuit for the preparation of the Boltzmann weights of the Gibbs state, and on a parity-preserving ansatz for the allocation of the eigenenergy basis to their respective Boltzmann weight. We explicitly show, with a paradigmatic few-body case instance, how the symmetries of a many-body system can be exploited to significantly reduce the exponentially increasing number of variational parameters needed in the Grover and Rudolph algorithm. Finally, we show that the density matrix, of the Gibbs state of the $XY$ model, obtained by statevector simulations for different parameters, exhibits a fidelity close to unity with the exact Gibbs state; this highlights the potential use of our protocol on current quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on the highest phonon frequency and superconducting temperature from fundamental physical constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fundamental physical constants govern key effects in high-energy particle physics and astrophysics, including the stability of particles, nuclear reactions, formation and evolution of stars, synthesis of heavy nuclei and emergence of stable molecular structures. Here, we show that fundamental constants also set an upper bound for the frequency of phonons in condensed matter phases, or how rapidly an atom can vibrate. This bound is in agreement with \textit{ab initio} simulations of atomic hydrogen and high-temperature hydride superconductors, and implies an upper limit to the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in condensed matter. Fundamental constants set this limit to the order of 10$^2-10^3$ K. This range is consistent with our calculations of $T_c$ from optimal Eliashberg functions. As a corollary, we observe that the very existence of high-temperature superconductivity research is due to the observed values of fundamental constants. We finally discuss how fundamental constants affect the observability of other condensed matter phenomena including phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Linear stability theory and molecular simulations of nanofilm dewetting with disjoining pressure, strong liquid-solid slip, and thermal fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dewetting of thin nanofilms is significantly impacted by thermal fluctuations, liquid-solid slip, and disjoining pressure, which can be described by lubrication equations augmented by appropriately scaled noise terms, known as stochastic lubrication equations. Here molecular dynamics simulations along with a newly proposed slip-generating method are adopted to study the instability of nanofilms with arbitrary slip. These simulations show that strong-slip dewetting is distinct from weak-slip dewetting by faster growth of perturbations and fewer droplets after dewetting, which can not be predicted by the existing stochastic lubrication equation. A new stochastic lubrication equation considering the strong slip boundary condition is thus derived using a long-wave approximation to the equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics. The linear stability analysis of this equation, i.e., surface spectrum, agrees well with molecular simulations. Interestingly, strong slip can break down the usual Stokes limits adopted in weak-slip dewetting and bring the inertia into effect. The evolution of the standard deviation of the film height $W^2(t)={\overline{h^2}-{\overline{h}}^2}$ at the initial stage of the strong-slip dewetting is found to be $W\sim t^{1/4}$ in contrast to $W\sim t^{1/8}$ for the weak-slip dewetting.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, the moderately long-time behaviours of the correlation functions for two charged coupled harmonic oscillators connected to a common heat bath are analyzed in the presence of a magnetic field via the Quantum Langevin dynamics. Interestingly it is seen that at long times the correlation functions at $T \rightarrow 0$ exhibit a power law decay with the coefficients of the power laws being completely different for the two masses, affecting the overall dynamics of the coupled system. The effect of the bath-induced force on mass m1 mediated by the interaction of m2 with the common heat bath is studied and the results are highlighted in the presence of an external magnetic field. It is shown that the effect of cyclotron frequency increases the correlation functions at an instant of time, lowering the rate of temporal decay of the correlation functions. The results in the absence of a magnetic field are also presented, which are extremely important for investigating the movements of the atoms in protein molecules at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Neural Thermodynamic Integration: Free Energies from Energy-based Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermodynamic integration (TI) offers a rigorous method for estimating free-energy differences by integrating over a sequence of interpolating conformational ensembles. However, TI calculations are computationally expensive and typically limited to coupling a small number of degrees of freedom due to the need to sample numerous intermediate ensembles with sufficient conformational-space overlap. In this work, we propose to perform TI along an alchemical pathway represented by a trainable neural network, which we term Neural TI. Critically, we parametrize a time-dependent Hamiltonian interpolating between the interacting and non-interacting systems, and optimize its gradient using a denoising-diffusion objective. The ability of the resulting energy-based diffusion model to sample all intermediate ensembles allows us to perform TI from a single reference calculation. We apply our method to Lennard-Jones fluids, where we report accurate calculations of the excess chemical potential, demonstrating that Neural TI is capable of coupling hundreds of degrees of freedom at once.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium stationary state of a one-dimensional inertial run-and-tumble particle (IRTP) trapped in a harmonic potential. We find that the presence of inertia leads to two distinct dynamical scenarios, namely, overdamped and underdamped, characterized by the relative strength of the viscous and the trap time-scales. We also find that inertial nature of the active dynamics leads to the particle being confined in specific regions of the phase plane in the overdamped and underdamped cases, which we compute analytically. Moreover, the interplay of the inertial and active time-scales gives rise to several sub-regimes, which are characterized by very different behaviour of position and velocity fluctuations of the IRTP. In particular, in the underdamped regime, both the position and velocity undergoes transitions from a novel multi-peaked structure in the strongly active limit to a single peaked Gaussian-like distribution in the passive limit. On the other hand, in the overdamped scenario, the position distribution shows a transition from a U-shape to a dome-shape, as activity is decreased. Interestingly, the velocity distribution in the overdamped scenario shows two transitions -- from a single-peaked shape with an algebraic divergence at the origin in the strongly active regime to a double peaked one in the moderately active regime to a dome-shaped one in the passive regime.</description>

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids subject to a periodic drive can display fascinating non-equilibrium heating behavior because of their emergent fractionalized quasi-particles. Here, we investigate a driven Kitaev honeycomb model and examine the dynamics of emergent Majorana matter and $Z_2$ flux excitations. We uncover a distinct two-step heating profile $\textrm{--}$ dubbed fractionalized prethermalization $\textrm{--}$ and a quasi-stationary state with vastly different temperatures for the matter and the flux sectors. We argue that this peculiar prethermalization behavior is a consequence of fractionalization. Furthermore, we discuss an experimentally feasible protocol for preparing a zero-flux initial state of the Kiteav honeycomb model with a low energy density, which can be used to observe fractionalized prethermalization in quantum information processing platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomly moving active particles can be herded into directed motion by asymmetric geometric structures. Although such a rectification process has been extensively studied due to its fundamental and technological relevance, a comprehensive understanding of active matter rectification based on single particle dynamics remains elusive. Here, by combining experiments, simulations, and theory, we study the directed transport and energetics of swimming bacteria navigating through funnel-shaped obstacles -- a paradigmatic model of rectification of living active matter. We develop a microscopic parameter-free model for bacterial rectification, which quantitatively explains experimental and numerical observations and predicts the optimal geometry for the maximum rectification efficiency. Furthermore, we quantify the degree of time irreversibility and measure the extractable work associated with bacterial rectification. Our study provides quantitative solutions to long-standing questions on bacterial rectification and establishes a generic relationship between time irreversibility, particle fluxes, and extractable work, shedding light on the energetics of non-equilibrium rectification processes in living systems.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of fitting a centered ellipsoid to $n$ standard Gaussian random vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$, as $n, d \to \infty$ with $n/d^2 \to \alpha &gt; 0$. It has been conjectured that this problem is, with high probability, satisfiable (SAT; that is, there exists an ellipsoid passing through all $n$ points) for $\alpha &lt; 1/4$, and unsatisfiable (UNSAT) for $\alpha &gt; 1/4$. In this work we give a precise analytical argument, based on the non-rigorous replica method of statistical physics, that indeed predicts a SAT/UNSAT transition at $\alpha = 1/4$, as well as the shape of a typical fitting ellipsoid in the SAT phase (i.e., the lengths of its principal axes). Besides the replica method, our main tool is the dilute limit of extensive-rank "HCIZ integrals" of random matrix theory. We further study different explicit algorithmic constructions of the matrix characterizing the ellipsoid. In particular, we show that a procedure based on minimizing its nuclear norm yields a solution in the whole SAT phase. Finally, we characterize the SAT/UNSAT transition for ellipsoid fitting of a large class of rotationally-invariant random vectors. Our work suggests mathematically rigorous ways to analyze fitting ellipsoids to random vectors, which is the topic of a companion work.</description>

      <title>Ergodic and mixing quantum channels: From two-qubit to many-body quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of classical ergodic theory has had a significant impact in the areas of mathematics, physics, and, in general, applied sciences. The quantum ergodic theory of Hamiltonian dynamics has its motivations to understand thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Quantum channel, a completely positive trace-preserving map, represents a most general representation of quantum dynamics and is an essential aspect of quantum information theory and quantum computation. In this work, we study the ergodic theory of quantum channels by characterizing different levels of ergodic hierarchy from integrable to mixing. The quantum channels on single systems are constructed from the unitary operators acting on bipartite states and tracing out the environment. The interaction strength of these unitary operators measured in terms of operator entanglement provides sufficient conditions for the channel to be mixing. By using block diagonal unitary operators, we construct a set of non-ergodic channels. By using canonical form of two-qubit unitary operator, we analytically construct the channels on single qubit ranging from integrable to mixing. Moreover, we also study interacting many-body quantum systems that include the famous Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and show that they display mixing within the framework of the quantum channel.</description>

      <title>A local-global principle for nonequilibrium steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global steady state of a system in thermal equilibrium exponentially favors configurations with lesser energy. This principle is a powerful explanation of self-organization because energy is a local property of a configuration. For nonequilibrium systems, there is no such property for which an analogous principle holds, hence no common explanation of the diverse forms of self-organization they exhibit. However, a flurry of recent work demonstrates that a local property of configurations called "rattling" predicts the global steady states of a broad class of nonequilibrium systems. We interpret this emerging physical theory in terms of Markov processes to generalize and prove its main claims. Surprisingly, we find that the idea at the core of rattling theory is so general as to apply to equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems alike. Its predictions hold to an extent determined by the relative variance of, and correlation between, the local and global "parts" of an arbitrary steady state. We show how these key quantities characterize the local-global relationships of random walks on random graphs, various spin-glass dynamics, and models of animal collective behavior.</description>

      <title>Complex Quantum Networks: a Topical Review</title>

Abstract: These are exciting times for quantum physics as new quantum technologies are expected to soon transform computing at an unprecedented level. Simultaneously network science is flourishing proving an ideal mathematical and computational framework to capture the complexity of large interacting systems. Here we provide a comprehensive and timely review of the rising field of complex quantum networks. On one side, this subject is key to harness the potential of complex networks in order to provide design principles to boost and enhance quantum algorithms and quantum technologies. On the other side this subject can provide a new generation of quantum algorithms to infer significant complex network properties. The field features fundamental research questions as diverse as designing networks to shape Hamiltonians and their corresponding phase diagram, taming the complexity of many-body quantum systems with network theory, revealing how quantum physics and quantum algorithms can predict novel network properties and phase transitions, and studying the interplay between architecture, topology and performance in quantum communication networks. Our review covers all of these multifaceted aspects in a self-contained presentation aimed both at network-curious quantum physicists and at quantum-curious network theorists. We provide a framework that unifies the field of quantum complex networks along four main research lines: network-generalized, quantum-applied, quantum-generalized and quantum-enhanced. Finally we draw attention to the connections between these research lines, which can lead to new opportunities and new discoveries at the interface between quantum physics and network science.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum phase transition via quantum speed limit</title>

Abstract: Quantum speed limit (QSL) is the lower bound on the time required for a state to evolve to a desired final state under a given Hamiltonian evolution. Three well-known QSLs exist Mandelstam-Tamm (MT), Margolus-Levitin (ML), and dual ML (ML$^*$) bounds. We consider one-dimensional systems that undergoes delocalization-localization transition in the presence of quasiperiodic and linear potential. By performing sudden quenches across the phase boundary, we find that the exact dynamics get captured very well by QSLs. We show that the MT bound is always tighter in the short time limit for any arbitrary state, while the optimal bound for the time of orthogonalization (time required to reach the orthogonal state) depends on the choice of the initial state. Further, for extreme quenches, we prove that the MT bound remains tighter for the time of orthogonalization, and it can qualitatively describe the non-analyticity in free energy for dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT). Finally, we also demonstrate that the localization-delocalization transition point can be exactly identified from QSLs, whose computation cost is much less compared to many other diagnostic tools.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of free-fermion systems, signal processing and algebraic combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper offers a review of recent studies on the entanglement of free-fermion systems on graphs that take advantage of methods pertaining to signal processing and algebraic combinatorics. On the one hand, a parallel with time and band limiting problems is used to obtain a tridiagonal matrix commuting with the chopped correlation matrix in bispectral situations and on the other, the irreducible decomposition of the Terwilliger algebra arising in the context of $P$-polynomial association schemes is seen to yield a simplifying framework.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal growth of quantum conditional mutual information under decoherence</title>

Abstract: Local measurements cannot create entanglement, but they can convert short-range entanglement to long-range entanglement, as in quantum teleportation. This phenomenon of measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) has been widely discussed in recent work on measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions and related phenomena. Here, we situate MIE in a broader context of the growth of long-range conditional mutual information (CMI) under decoherence. We upper-bound the rate at which decoherence can generate long-range CMI, and derive a characterization of states that saturate this bound. We point out that the structure of states saturating the CMI upper bound can be very different under different decoherent dynamics and provide explicit examples. We additionally explore the dynamics of CMI in random quantum circuits subject to random local decoherence, as a function of circuit depth. We argue that the universality class of the finite-depth teleportation transition, as well as its lower critical dimension, are different for erasures than for measurements.</description>

      <title>EXCOGITO, an extensible coarse-graining toolbox for the investigation of biomolecules by means of low-resolution representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bottom-up coarse-grained (CG) models proved to be essential to complement and sometimes even replace all-atom representations of soft matter systems and biological macromolecules. The development of low-resolution models takes the moves from the reduction of the degrees of freedom employed, that is, the definition of a mapping between a system's high-resolution description and its simplified counterpart. Even in the absence of an explicit parametrisation and simulation of a CG model, the observation of the atomistic system in simpler terms can be informative: this idea is leveraged by the mapping entropy, a measure of the information loss inherent to the process of coarsening. Mapping entropy lies at the heart of the extensible coarse-graining toolbox, or EXCOGITO, developed to perform a number of operations and analyses on molecular systems pivoting around the properties of mappings. EXCOGITO can process an all-atom trajectory to compute the mapping entropy, identify the mapping that minimizes it, and establish quantitative relations between a low-resolution representation and the geometrical, structural, and energetic features of the system. Here, the software, which is available free of charge under an open-source licence, is presented and showcased to introduce potential users to its capabilities and usage.
