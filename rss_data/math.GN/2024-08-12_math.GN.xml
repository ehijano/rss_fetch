      <title>Discrete Laplacians -- spherical and hyperbolic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrete Laplacian on Euclidean triangulated surfaces is a well-established notion. We introduce discrete Laplacians on spherical and hyperbolic triangulated surfaces. On the one hand, our definitions are close to the Euclidean one in that the edge weights contain the cotangents of certain combinations of angles and are non-negative if and only if the triangulation is Delaunay. On the other hand, these discretizations are structure-preserving in several respects. We prove that the area of a convex polyhedron can be written in terms of the discrete spherical Laplacian of the support function, whose expression is the same as the area of a smooth convex body in terms of the usual spherical Laplacian. We show that the conformal factors of discrete conformal vector fields on a triangulated surface of curvature $k \in \{-1,1\}$ are $-2k$-eigenfunctions of our discrete Laplacians, exactly as in the smooth setting. The discrete conformality can be understood here both in the sense of the vertex scaling and in the sense of circle patterns. Finally, we connect the $-2k$-eigenfunctions to infinitesimal isometric deformations of a polyhedron inscribed into corresponding quadrics.</description>

      <title>On Ramsey-type properties of the distance in nonseparable spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an uncountable subset $\mathcal Y$ of a nonseparable Banach space, is there an uncountable $\mathcal Z\subseteq \mathcal Y$ such that the distances between any two distinct points of $\mathcal Z$ are more or less the same? If an uncountable subset $\mathcal Y$ of a nonseparable Banach space does not admit an uncountable $\mathcal Z\subseteq \mathcal Y$, where any two points are distant by more than $r&gt;0$, is it because $\mathcal Y$ is the countable union of sets of diameters not bigger than $r$?
  We investigate connections between the set-theoretic phenomena involved and the geometric properties of uncountable subsets of nonseparable Banach spaces of densities up to $2^\omega$ related to uncountable $(1+)$-separated sets, equilateral sets or Auerbach systems.
  The results include geometric dichotomies for a wide range of classes of Banach spaces, some in ZFC, some under the assumption of OCA+MA and some under a hypothesis on the descriptive complexity of the space as well as constructions (in ZFC or under CH) of Banach spaces where the geometry of the unit sphere displays anti-Ramsey properties. This complements classical theorems for separable spheres and the recent results of H\'ajek, Kania, Russo for densities above $2^\omega$ as well as offers a synthesis of possible phenomena and categorization of examples for uncountable densities up to $2^\omega$ obtained previously by the author and Guzm\'an, Hru\v{s}\'ak, Ryduchowski and Wark.
  It remains open if the dichotomies may consistently hold for all Banach spaces of the first uncountable density or if the strong anti-Ramsey properties of the distance on the unit sphere of a Banach space can be obtained in ZFC.</description>
