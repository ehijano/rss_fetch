      <title>Surrogate-based multilevel Monte Carlo methods for uncertainty quantification in the Grad-Shafranov free boundary problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a hybrid technique to quantify the variability in the numerical solutions to a free boundary problem associated with magnetic equilibrium in axisymmetric fusion reactors amidst parameter uncertainties. The method aims at reducing computational costs by integrating a surrogate model into a multilevel Monte Carlo method. The resulting surrogate-enhanced multilevel Monte Carlo methods reduce the cost of simulation by factors as large as $10^4$ compared to standard Monte Carlo simulations involving direct numerical solutions of the associated Grad-Shafranov partial differential equation. Accuracy assessments also show that surrogate-based sampling closely aligns with the results of direct computation, confirming its effectiveness in capturing the behavior of plasma boundary and geometric descriptors.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning-based adaptive time-integration for nonsmooth dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical time integration is fundamental to the simulation of initial and boundary value problems. Traditionally, time integration schemes require adaptive time-stepping to ensure computational speed and sufficient accuracy. Although these methods are based on mathematical derivations related to the order of accuracy for the chosen integrator, they also rely on heuristic development to determine optimal time steps. In this work, we use an alternative approach based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) to select the optimal time step for any time integrator method, balancing computational speed and accuracy. To explore the potential of our RL-based adaptive time-stepping approach, we choose a challenging model problem involving set-valued frictional instabilities at various spatiotemporal scales. This problem demonstrates the robustness of our strategy in handling nonsmooth problems, which present a demanding scenario for numerical integration. Specifically, we apply RL to the simulation of a seismic fault with Coulomb friction. Our findings indicate that RL can learn an optimal strategy for time integration, achieving up to a fourfold speed-up. Our RL-based adaptive integrator offers a new approach for time integration in various other problems in mechanics.</description>

      <title>Dissecting a Small Artificial Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the loss landscape and backpropagation dynamics of convergence for the simplest possible artificial neural network representing the logical exclusive-OR (XOR) gate. Cross-sections of the loss landscape in the nine-dimensional parameter space are found to exhibit distinct features, which help understand why backpropagation efficiently achieves convergence toward zero loss, whereas values of weights and biases keep drifting. Differences in shapes of cross-sections obtained by nonrandomized and randomized batches are discussed. In reference to statistical physics we introduce the microcanonical entropy as a unique quantity that allows to characterize the phase behavior of the network. Learning in neural networks can thus be thought of as an annealing process that experiences the analogue of phase transitions known from thermodynamic systems. It also reveals how the loss landscape simplifies as more hidden neurons are added to the network, eliminating entropic barriers caused by finite-size effects.</description>

      <title>Heat semigroup representation of Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces novel numerical algorithms for computational quantum mechanics, grounded in a representation of the Laplace operator -- frequently used to model kinetic energy in quantum systems -- via the heat semigroup. The key advantage of this approach lies in its computational efficiency, particularly within the framework of multiresolution analysis, where the heat equation can be solved rapidly. This results in an effective and scalable method for evaluating kinetic energy in quantum systems. The proposed multiwavelet-based Laplacian approximation is tested through two fundamental quantum chemistry applications: self-consistent field calculations and the time evolution of Schr\"odinger-type equations.</description>

      <title>Riemannian quantum circuit optimization based on matrix product operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We significantly enhance the simulation accuracy of initial Trotter circuits for Hamiltonian simulation of quantum systems by integrating first-order Riemannian optimization with tensor network methods. Unlike previous approaches, our method imposes no symmetry assumptions, such as translational invariance, on the quantum systems. This technique is scalable to large systems through the use of a matrix product operator representation of the reference time evolution propagator. Our optimization routine is applied to various spin chains and fermionic systems, with a particular focus on one-dimensional systems described by the transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian, the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and the spinful Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian. In these cases, our approach achieves a relative error improvement of up to four orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of our method by applying it to molecular systems, specifically lithium hydride, achieving an error improvement of up to eight orders of magnitude. This proof of concept highlights the potential of our approach for broader applications in quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Revealing Local Structures through Machine-Learning- Fused Multimodal Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomistic structures of materials offer valuable insights into their functionality. Determining these structures remains a fundamental challenge in materials science, especially for systems with defects. While both experimental and computational methods exist, each has limitations in resolving nanoscale structures. Core-level spectroscopies, such as x-ray absorption (XAS) or electron energy-loss spectroscopies (EELS), have been used to determine the local bonding environment and structure of materials. Recently, machine learning (ML) methods have been applied to extract structural and bonding information from XAS/EELS, but most of these frameworks rely on a single data stream, which is often insufficient. In this work, we address this challenge by integrating multimodal ab initio simulations, experimental data acquisition, and ML techniques for structure characterization. Our goal is to determine local structures and properties using EELS and XAS data from multiple elements and edges. To showcase our approach, we use various lithium nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) oxide compounds which are used for lithium ion batteries, including those with oxygen vacancies and antisite defects, as the sample material system. We successfully inferred local element content, ranging from lithium to transition metals, with quantitative agreement with experimental data. Beyond improving prediction accuracy, we find that ML model based on multimodal spectroscopic data is able to determine whether local defects such as oxygen vacancy and antisites are present, a task which is impossible for single mode spectra or other experimental techniques. Furthermore, our framework is able to provide physical interpretability, bridging spectroscopy with the local atomic and electronic structures.</description>

      <title>WeTICA: A directed search weighted ensemble based enhanced sampling method to estimate rare event kinetics in a reduced dimensional space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating rare event kinetics from molecular dynamics simulations is a non-trivial task despite the great advances in enhanced sampling methods. Weighted Ensemble (WE) simulation, a special class of enhanced sampling techniques, offers a way to directly calculate kinetic rate constants from biased trajectories without the need to modify the underlying energy landscape using bias potentials. Conventional WE algorithms use different binning schemes to partition the collective variable (CV) space separating the two metastable states of interest. In this work, we have developed a new "binless" WE simulation algorithm to bypass the hurdles of optimizing binning procedures. Our proposed protocol (WeTICA) uses a low-dimensional CV space to drive the WE simulation toward the specified target state. We have applied this new algorithm to recover the unfolding kinetics of three proteins: (A) TC5b Trp-cage mutant, (B) TC10b Trp-cage mutant, and (C) Protein G, with unfolding times spanning the range between 3 and 40 {\mu}s using projections along predefined fixed Time-lagged Independent Component Analysis (TICA) eigenvectors as CVs. Calculated unfolding times converge to the reported values with good accuracy with more than one order of magnitude less cumulative WE simulation time than the unfolding time scales with or without a priori knowledge of the CVs that can capture unfolding. Our algorithm can be used with other linear CVs, not limited to TICA. Moreover, the new walker selection criteria for resampling employed in this algorithm can be used on more sophisticated nonlinear CV space for further improvements of binless WE methods.</description>

      <title>CrystalGRW: Generative Modeling of Crystal Structures with Targeted Properties via Geodesic Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining whether a candidate crystalline material is thermodynamically stable depends on identifying its true ground-state structure, a central challenge in computational materials science. We introduce CrystalGRW, a diffusion-based generative model on Riemannian manifolds that proposes novel crystal configurations and can predict stable phases validated by density functional theory. The crystal properties, such as fractional coordinates, atomic types, and lattice matrices, are represented on suitable Riemannian manifolds, ensuring that new predictions generated through the diffusion process preserve the periodicity of crystal structures. We incorporate an equivariant graph neural network to also account for rotational and translational symmetries during the generation process. CrystalGRW demonstrates the ability to generate realistic crystal structures that are close to their ground states with accuracy comparable to existing models, while also enabling conditional control, such as specifying a desired crystallographic point group. These features help accelerate materials discovery and inverse design by offering stable, symmetry-consistent crystal candidates for experimental validation.</description>

Abstract: In current electronic structure research endeavors such as warm dense matter or machine learning applications, efficient development necessitates non-monolithic software, providing an extendable and flexible interface. The open-source idea offers the advantage of having a source code base that can be reviewed and modified by the community. However, practical implementations can often diverge significantly from their theoretical counterpart. Leveraging the efforts of recent theoretical formulations and the features of Python, we try to mitigate these problems. We present eminus, an education- and development-friendly electronic structure package designed for convenient and customizable workflows, yet built with intelligible and modular implementations.</description>

      <title>Escape-from-a-layer approach for simulating the boundary local time in Euclidean domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an efficient numerical approach to simulate the boundary local time of reflected Brownian motion, as well as the time and position of the associated reaction event on a smooth boundary of a Euclidean domain. This approach combines the standard walk-on-spheres algorithm in the bulk with the approximate solution of the escape problem in a boundary layer. In this way, the most time-consuming simulation of multiple reflections on the boundary is replaced by an equivalent escape event. We validate the proposed escape-from-a-layer approach by comparing simulated statistics of the boundary local time with exact results known for simple domains (a disk, a circular annulus, a sphere, a spherical shell) and with the numerical results obtained by a finite-element method in more sophisticated domains. This approach offers a powerful tool for simulating reflected Brownian motion in multi-scale confinements such as porous media or biological environments, and for solving the related partial differential equations. Its applications in the context of diffusion-controlled reactions in chemical physics are discussed.</description>

      <title>Cluster Sliding Ferroelectricity in Trilayer Quasi-Hexagonal C$_{60}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electric polarization typically originates from non-centrosymmetric charge distributions in compounds. In elemental crystalline materials, chemical bonds between atoms of the same element favor symmetrically distributed electron charges and centrosymmetric structures, making elemental ferroelectrics rare. Compared to atoms, elemental clusters are intrinsically less symmetric and can have various preferred orientations when they are assembled to form crystals. Consequently, the assembly of clusters with different orientations tends to break the inversion symmetry. By exploiting this concept, we show that sliding ferroelectricity naturally emerges in trilayer quasi-hexagonal phase (qHP) C$_{60}$, a cluster-assembled carbon allotrope recently synthesized. Compared to many metallic or semi-metallic elemental ferroelectrics, trilayer qHP C$_{60}$'s have sizable band gaps and several ferroelectric structures, which are distinguishable by measuring their second-harmonic generation (SHG) responses. Some of these phases show both switchable out-of-plane and in-plane polarizations on the order of 0.2 pC/m. The out-of-plane and in-plane polarizations can be switched independently and enable an easy-to-implement construction of Van der Waals homostructures with ferroelectrically switchable chirality.</description>

      <title>All-Electron Molecular Tunnel Ionization Based on the Weak-Field Asymptotic Theory in the Integral Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tunnel ionization (TI) underlies many important ultrafast processes, such as high-harmonic generation and strong-field ionization. Among the existing theories for TI, many-electron weak-field asymptotic theory (ME-WFAT) is by design capable of accurately treating many-electron effects in TI. An earlier version of ME-WFAT relied on an accurate representation of the asymptotic tail of the orbitals, which hindered its implementation in Gaussian-basis-set-based quantum chemistry programs. In this work, we reformulate ME-WFAT in the integral representation, which makes the quality of the asymptotic tail much less critical, hence greatly facilitating its implementation in standard quantum chemistry packages. The integral reformulation introduced here is therefore much more robust when applied to molecules with arbitrary geometry. We present several case studies, among which is the CO molecule where some earlier theories disagree with experiments. Here, we find that ME-WFAT produces the largest ionization probability when the field points from C to O, as experiments suggest. An attractive feature of ME-WFAT is that it can be used with various types of multielectron methods whether of density functional [Phys. Rev. A 106, 052211 (2022)] or multiconfiguration types, this in turn facilitates tunnel ionization calculation in systems exhibiting a strong multireference character.</description>

      <title>CHIPS-FF: Evaluating Universal Machine Learning Force Fields for Material Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce CHIPS-FF (Computational High-Performance Infrastructure for Predictive Simulation-based Force Fields), a universal, open-source benchmarking platform for machine learning force fields (MLFFs). This platform provides robust evaluation beyond conventional metrics such as energy, focusing on complex properties including elastic constants, phonon spectra, defect formation energies, surface energies, and interfacial and amorphous phase properties. Utilizing 16 graph-based MLFF models including ALIGNN-FF, CHGNet, MatGL, MACE, SevenNet, ORB, MatterSim and OMat24, the CHIPS-FF workflow integrates the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) with JARVIS-Tools to facilitate automated high-throughput simulations. Our framework is tested on a set of 104 materials, including metals, semiconductors and insulators representative of those used in semiconductor components, with each MLFF evaluated for convergence, accuracy, and computational cost. Additionally, we evaluate the force-prediction accuracy of these models for close to 2 million atomic structures. By offering a streamlined, flexible benchmarking infrastructure, CHIPS-FF aims to guide the development and deployment of MLFFs for real-world semiconductor applications, bridging the gap between quantum mechanical simulations and large-scale device modeling.</description>
