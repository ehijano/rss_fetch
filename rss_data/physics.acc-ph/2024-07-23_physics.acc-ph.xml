      <title>Application of a plasma-based energy booster in operational free-electron lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma-based accelerators are a promising approach for reducing the size and cost of future particle accelerators, making them a viable technology for constructing and upgrading X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs). Adding an energy booster stage to the linear accelerator of an operational X-ray FEL is recognised as a realistic near-term application of plasma accelerators, with a significant impact on the scientific reach of these facilities. Here, we discuss potential use cases of such a plasma-based energy booster and apply particle-in-cell simulations to estimate its ability to enhance the performance of existing X-ray FEL facilities.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the treatment effect of FLASH radiotherapy with Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC) synchrotron radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC) can also work as a powerful and excellent synchrotron light source, which can generate high-quality synchrotron radiation. This synchrotron radiation has potential advantages in the medical field, with a broad spectrum, with energies ranging from visible light to x-rays used in conventional radiotherapy, up to several MeV. FLASH radiotherapy is one of the most advanced radiotherapy modalities. It is a radiotherapy method that uses ultra-high dose rate irradiation to achieve the treatment dose in an instant; the ultra-high dose rate used is generally greater than 40 Gy/s, and this type of radiotherapy can protect normal tissues well. In this paper, the treatment effect of CEPC synchrotron radiation for FLASH radiotherapy was evaluated by simulation. First, Geant4 simulation was used to build a synchrotron radiation radiotherapy beamline station, and then the dose rate that CEPC can produce was calculated. Then, a physicochemical model of radiotherapy response kinetics was established, and a large number of radiotherapy experimental data were comprehensively used to fit and determine the functional relationship between the treatment effect, dose rate and dose. Finally, the macroscopic treatment effect of FLASH radiotherapy was predicted using CEPC synchrotron radiation light through the dose rate and the above-mentioned functional relationship. The results show that CEPC synchrotron radiation beam is one of the best beams for FLASH radiotherapy.</description>
