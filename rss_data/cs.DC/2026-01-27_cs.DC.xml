      <title>Communication-Avoiding Linear Algebraic Kernel K-Means on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering is an important tool in data analysis, with K-means being popular for its simplicity and versatility. However, it cannot handle non-linearly separable clusters. Kernel K-means addresses this limitation but requires a large kernel matrix, making it computationally and memory intensive. Prior work has accelerated Kernel K-means by formulating it using sparse linear algebra primitives and implementing it on a single GPU. However, that approach cannot run on datasets with more than approximately 80,000 samples due to limited GPU memory.
  In this work, we address this issue by presenting a suite of distributed-memory parallel algorithms for large-scale Kernel K-means clustering on multi-GPU systems. Our approach maps the most computationally expensive components of Kernel K-means onto communication-efficient distributed linear algebra primitives uniquely tailored for Kernel K-means, enabling highly scalable implementations that efficiently cluster million-scale datasets. Central to our work is the design of partitioning schemes that enable communication-efficient composition of the linear algebra primitives that appear in Kernel K-means.
  Our 1.5D algorithm consistently achieves the highest performance, enabling Kernel K-means to scale to data one to two orders of magnitude larger than previously practical. On 256 GPUs, it achieves a geometric mean weak scaling efficiency of $79.7\%$ and a geometric mean strong scaling speedup of $4.2\times$. Compared to our 1D algorithm, the 1.5D approach achieves up to a $3.6\times$ speedup on 256 GPUs and reduces clustering time from over an hour to under two seconds relative to a single-GPU sliding window implementation. Our results show that distributed algorithms designed with application-specific linear algebraic formulations can achieve substantial performance improvement.</description>

      <title>Push Down Optimization for Distributed Multi Cloud Data Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enterprises increasingly adopt multi cloud architectures to take advantage of diverse database engines, regional availability, and cost models. In these environments, ETL pipelines must process large, distributed datasets while minimizing latency and transfer cost. Push down optimization, which executes transformation logic within database engines rather than within the ETL tool, has proven highly effective in single cloud systems. However, when applied across multiple clouds, it faces challenges related to data movement, heterogeneous SQL engines, orchestration complexity, and fragmented security controls. This paper examines the feasibility of push down optimization in multi cloud ETL pipelines and analyzes its benefits and limitations. It evaluates localized push down, hybrid models, and data federation techniques that reduce cross cloud traffic while improving performance. A case study across Redshift and BigQuery demonstrates measurable gains, including lower end to end runtime, reduced transfer volume, and improved cost efficiency. The study highlights practical strategies that organizations can adopt to improve ETL scalability and reliability in distributed cloud environments.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach to Concurrent, Parallel Map-Reduce in R using Futures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The R ecosystem offers a rich variety of map-reduce application programming interfaces (APIs) for iterative computations, yet parallelizing code across these diverse frameworks requires learning multiple, often incompatible, parallel APIs. The futurize package addresses this challenge by providing a single function, futurize(), which transpiles sequential map-reduce expressions into their parallel equivalents in the future ecosystem, which performs all the heavy lifting. By leveraging R's native pipe operator, users can parallelize existing code with minimal refactoring -- often by simply appending `|&gt; futurize()' to an expression. The package supports classical map-reduce functions from base R, purrr, crossmap, foreach, plyr, BiocParallel, e.g., lapply(xs, fcn) |&gt; futurize() and map(xs, fcn) |&gt; futurize(), as well as a growing set of domain-specific packages, e.g., boot, caret, glmnet, lme4, mgcv, and tm. By abstracting away the underlying parallel machinery, and unifying handling of future options, the package enables developers to declare what to parallelize via futurize(), and end-users to choose how via plan(). This article describes the philosophy, design, and implementation of futurize, demonstrates its usage across various map-reduce paradigms, and discusses its role in simplifying parallel computing in R.</description>

      <title>Lightspeed Data Compute for the Space Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While thousands of satellites photograph Earth every day, most of that data never makes it to the ground because downlink bandwidth simply cannot keep up. Processing data in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) zone offers promising capabilities to overcome this limitation. We propose SpaceCoMP, a MapReduce-inspired processing model for LEO satellite mesh networks. Ground stations submit queries over an area of interest; satellites collect sensor data, process it cooperatively at light-speed using inter-satellite laser links, and return only the results. Our compute model leverages space physics to accelerate computations on LEO megaconstellations. Our distance-aware routing protocol exploits orbital geometry. In addition, our bipartite match scheduling strategy places map and reduce tasks within orbital regions while minimizing aggregation costs. We have simulated constellations of 1,000-10,000 satellites showcasing 61-79% improvement in map placement efficiency over baselines, 18-28% over greedy allocation, and 67-72% reduction in aggregation cost. SpaceCoMP demonstrates that the orbital mesh is not merely useful as a communication relay, as seen today, but can provide the foundations for faster data processing above the skies.</description>

      <title>Scaling All-to-all Operations Across Emerging Many-Core Supercomputers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performant all-to-all collective operations in MPI are critical to fast Fourier transforms, transposition, and machine learning applications. There are many existing implementations for all-to-all exchanges on emerging systems, with the achieved performance dependent on many factors, including message size, process count, architecture, and parallel system partition. This paper presents novel all-to-all algorithms for emerging many-core systems. Further, the paper presents a performance analysis against existing algorithms and system MPI, with novel algorithms achieving up to 3x speedup over system MPI at 32 nodes of state-of-the-art Sapphire Rapids systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-core &amp; GPU-based Balanced Butterfly Counting in Signed Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Balanced butterfly counting, corresponding to counting balanced (2, 2)-bicliques, is a fundamental primitive in the analysis of signed bipartite graphs and provides a basis for studying higher-order structural properties such as clustering coefficients and community structure. Although prior work has proposed an efficient CPU-based serial method for counting balanced (2, k)-bicliques. The computational cost of balanced butterfly counting remains a major bottleneck on large-scale graphs. In this work, we present the highly parallel implementations for balanced butterfly counting for both multicore CPUs and GPUs. The proposed multi-core algorithm (M-BBC) employs fine-grained vertex-level parallelism to accelerate wedge-based counting while eliminating the generation of unbalanced substructures. To improve scalability, we develop a GPU-based method (G-BBC) that uses a tile-based parallel approach to effectively leverage shared memory while handling large vertex sets. We then present an improved variation, G-BBC++, which integrates dynamic scheduling to mitigate workload imbalance and maximize throughput. We conduct an experimental assessment of the proposed methods across 15 real-world datasets. Experimental results exhibit that M-BBC achieves speedups of up to 71.13x (average 38.13x) over the sequential baseline BB2K. The GPU-based algorithms deliver even greater improvements, achieving up to 13,320x speedup (average 2,600x) over BB2K and outperforming M-BBC by up to 186x (average 50x). These results indicate the substantial scalability and efficiency of our parallel algorithms and establish a robust foundation for high-performance signed motif analysis on massive bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>An MLIR Lowering Pipeline for Stencils at Wafer-Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE) delivers performance at an unprecedented scale of over 900,000 compute units, all connected via a single-wafer on-chip interconnect. Initially designed for AI, the WSE architecture is also well-suited for High Performance Computing (HPC). However, its distributed asynchronous programming model diverges significantly from the simple sequential or bulk-synchronous programs that one would typically derive for a given mathematical program description. Targeting the WSE requires a bespoke re-implementation when porting existing code. The absence of WSE support in compilers such as MLIR, meant that there was little hope for automating this process.
  Stencils are ubiquitous in HPC, and in this paper we explore the hypothesis that domain specific information about stencils can be leveraged by the compiler to automatically target the WSE without requiring application-level code changes. We present a compiler pipeline that transforms stencil-based kernels into highly optimized CSL code for the WSE, bridging the semantic gap between the mathematical representation of the problem and the WSE's asynchronous execution model. Based upon five benchmarks across three HPC programming technologies, running on both the Cerebras WSE2 and WSE3, our approach delivers comparable, if not slightly better, performance than manually optimized code. Furthermore, without requiring any application level code changes, performance on the WSE3 is around 14 times faster than 128 Nvidia A100 GPUs and 20 times faster than 128 nodes of a CPU-based Cray-EX supercomputer when using our approach.</description>

      <title>CondenseGraph: Communication-Efficient Distributed GNN Training via On-the-Fly Graph Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed Graph Neural Network (GNN) training suffers from substantial communication overhead due to the inherent neighborhood dependency in graph-structured data. This neighbor explosion problem requires workers to frequently exchange boundary node features across partitions, creating a communication bottleneck that severely limits training scalability. Existing approaches rely on static graph partitioning strategies that cannot adapt to dynamic network conditions. In this paper, we propose CondenseGraph, a novel communication-efficient framework for distributed GNN training. Our key innovation is an on-the-fly graph condensation mechanism that dynamically compresses boundary node features into compact super nodes before transmission. To compensate for the information loss introduced by compression, we develop a gradient-based error feedback mechanism that maintains convergence guarantees while reducing communication volume by 40-60%. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that CondenseGraph achieves comparable accuracy to full-precision baselines while significantly reducing communication costs and training time.</description>

      <title>A Universal Load Balancing Principle and Its Application to Large Language Model Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Load balancing-the allocation of work across parallel resources to reduce delay, energy and cost-is a pervasive challenge in science and engineering, from large-scale simulation and data processing to cloud and manufacturing operations. Motivated by the emerging bottleneck in large language model (LLM) serving, we study a particularly stringent regime of load balancing that arises in barrier-synchronized, stateful systems: work cannot be freely migrated and progress is gated by the slowest participant at each step, so heterogeneity and temporal drift in workloads create persistent stragglers and substantial idle time. LLM serving under data-parallel decoding provides a prominent modern instance: in production traces, barrier-induced idle can exceed 40% of compute time per decode step. Here we develop a universal load-balancing principle, which admits a step-wise finite-horizon integer-optimization formulation and yields worst-case guarantees: across LLM decode models and a broader class of non-decreasing workload drift processes, it reduces long-run imbalance by a factor that grows with batch size and system scale. Extensive experiments corroborate the theory, showing substantial improvements in throughput and latency together with reductions in energy consumption. These results provide a general, theoretically grounded framework for load balancing, with immediate implications for sustainable LLM serving and broad relevance to other synchronization-gated resource-allocation problems.</description>

      <title>An Initial Evaluation of Distributed Graph Algorithms using NWGraph and HPX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs are central to modeling relationships in scientific computing, data analysis, and AI/ML, but their growing scale can exceed the memory and compute capacity of single nodes, requiring distributed solutions. Existing distributed graph framework, however, face fundamental challenges: graph algorithms are latency-bound, suffer from irregular memory access, and often impose synchronization costs that limit scalability and efficiency. In this work, we present a distributed implementation of the NWGraph library integrated with the HPX runtime system. By leveraging HPX's asynchronous many-task model, our approach aims to reduce synchronization overhead, improve load balance, and provide a foundation for distributed graph analytics. We evaluate this approach using two representative algorithms: Breadth-First-Search (BFS) and (PageRank). Our initial results show that BFS achieves better performance than the distributed Boost Graph Library (BGL), while PageRank remains more challenging, with current implementation not yet outperforming BGL. These findings highlight both the promise and the open challenges of applying asynchronous task-based runtimes to graph processing, and point to opportunities for future optimizations and extensions.</description>

      <title>On the Bandwidth Consumption of Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of blockchain technology, the number of proposals has boomed. The network traffic imposed by these blockchain proposals increases the cost of hosting nodes. Unfortunately, as of today, we are not aware of any comparative study of the bandwidth consumption of blockchains.
  In this paper, we propose the first empirical comparison of blockchain bandwidth consumption. To this end, we measure the network traffic of blockchain network nodes of five blockchain protocols: Algorand, Aptos, Avalanche, Redbelly and Solana. We study the variation over time, differentiate the receiving and sending traffic and analyze how this traffic varies with the number of nodes and validators.
  We conclude that the transport protocol is the main factor impacting the network traffic, segregating node roles helps reduce traffic and different blockchains are differently impacted by the network size.</description>

      <title>Context Lake: A System Class Defined by Decision Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI agents are increasingly the primary consumers of data, operating continuously to make concurrent, irreversible decisions. Traditional data systems designed for human analysis cycles become correctness bottlenecks under this operating regime. When multiple agents operate over shared resources, their actions interact before reconciliation is possible. Correctness guarantees that apply after the decision window therefore fail to prevent conflicts. We introduce the Decision Coherence Law: for agents that take irreversible actions whose effects interact, correctness requires that interacting decisions be evaluated against a coherent representation of reality at the moment they are made. We show that no existing system class satisfies this requirement and prove through the Composition Impossibility Theorem that independently advancing systems cannot be composed to provide Decision Coherence while preserving their native system classes. From this impossibility result, we derive Context Lake as a necessary system class with three requirements: (1) semantic operations as native capabilities, (2) transactional consistency over all decision-relevant state, and (3) operational envelopes bounding staleness and degradation under load. We formalize the architectural invariants, enforcement boundaries, and admissibility conditions required for correctness in collective agent systems. This position paper establishes the theoretical foundation for Context Lakes, identifies why existing architectures fail, and specifies what systems must guarantee for AI agents to operate constructively at scale.</description>

      <title>Learning to Collaborate: An Orchestrated-Decentralized Framework for Peer-to-Peer LLM Federation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for specialized domains is constrained by a fundamental challenge: the need for diverse, cross-organizational data conflicts with the principles of data privacy and sovereignty. While Federated Learning (FL) provides a framework for collaboration without raw data exchange, its classic centralized form introduces a single point of failure and remains vulnerable to model inversion attacks. Decentralized FL (DFL) mitigates this risk by removing the central aggregator but typically relies on inefficient, random peer-to-peer (P2P) pairings, forming a collaboration graph that is blind to agent heterogeneity and risks negative transfer. This paper introduces KNEXA-FL, a novel framework for orchestrated decentralization that resolves this trade-off. KNEXA-FL employs a non-aggregating Central Profiler/Matchmaker (CPM) that formulates P2P collaboration as a contextual bandit problem, using a LinUCB algorithm on abstract agent profiles to learn an optimal matchmaking policy. It orchestrates direct knowledge exchange between heterogeneous, PEFT-based LLM agents via secure distillation, without ever accessing the models themselves. Our comprehensive experiments on a challenging code generation task show that KNEXA-FL yields substantial gains, improving Pass@1 by approx. 50% relative to random P2P collaboration. Critically, our orchestrated approach demonstrates stable convergence, in stark contrast to a powerful centralized distillation baseline which suffers from catastrophic performance collapse. Our work establishes adaptive, learning-based orchestration as a foundational principle for building robust and effective decentralized AI ecosystems.</description>

Abstract: As Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments expand to include tens of thousands of connected devices. The centralization of security monitoring architectures creates serious latency issues that savvy attackers can exploit to compromise an entire manufacturing ecosystem. This paper outlines a new, decentralized multi-agent swarm (DMAS) architecture that includes autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents at each edge gateway, functioning as a distributed digital "immune system" for IIoT networks. Instead of using a traditional static firewall approach, the DMAS agents communicate via a lightweight peer-to-peer protocol to cooperatively detect anomalous behavior across the IIoT network without sending data to a cloud infrastructure. The authors also outline a consensus-based threat validation (CVT) process in which agents vote on the threat level of an identified threat, enabling instant quarantine of a compromised node or nodes. The authors conducted experiments on a testbed that simulated an innovative factory environment with 2000 IIoT devices and found that the DMAS demonstrated sub-millisecond response times (average of 0.85ms), 97.3% accuracy in detecting malicious activity under high load, and 87% accuracy in detecting zero-day attacks. All significantly higher than baseline values for both centralized and edge computing. Additionally, the proposed architecture can prevent real-time cascading failures in industrial control systems and reduce network bandwidth use by 89% compared to cloud-based solutions.</description>

      <title>Athena: Synergizing Data Prefetching and Off-Chip Prediction via Online Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prefetching and off-chip prediction are two techniques proposed to hide long memory access latencies in high-performance processors. In this work, we demonstrate that: (1) prefetching and off-chip prediction often provide complementary performance benefits, yet (2) naively combining them often fails to realize their full performance potential, and (3) existing prefetcher control policies leave significant room for performance improvement behind.
  Our goal is to design a holistic framework that can autonomously learn to coordinate an off-chip predictor with multiple prefetchers employed at various cache levels. To this end, we propose a new technique called Athena, which models the coordination between prefetchers and off-chip predictor (OCP) as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem. Athena acts as the RL agent that observes multiple system-level features (e.g., prefetcher/OCP accuracy, bandwidth usage) over an epoch of program execution, and uses them as state information to select a coordination action (i.e., enabling the prefetcher and/or OCP, and adjusting prefetcher aggressiveness). At the end of every epoch, Athena receives a numerical reward that measures the change in multiple system-level metrics (e.g., number of cycles taken to execute an epoch). Athena uses this reward to autonomously and continuously learn a policy to coordinate prefetchers with OCP.
  Our extensive evaluation using a diverse set of memory-intensive workloads shows that Athena consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art coordination policies across a wide range of system configurations with various combinations of underlying prefetchers, OCPs, and main memory bandwidths, while incurring only modest storage overhead.

      <title>Conduit: Programmer-Transparent Near-Data Processing Using Multiple Compute-Capable Resources in Solid State Drives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state drives (SSDs) are well suited for near-data processing (NDP) because they: (1) store large application datasets, and (2) support three NDP paradigms: in-storage processing (ISP), processing using DRAM in the SSD (PuD-SSD), and in-flash processing (IFP). A large body of prior SSD-based NDP techniques operate in isolation, mapping computations to only one or two NDP paradigms (i.e., ISP, PuD-SSD, or IFP) within the SSD. These techniques (1) are tailored to specific workloads or kernels, (2) do not exploit the full computational potential of an SSD, and (3) lack programmer-transparency. While several prior works propose techniques to partition computation between the host and near-memory accelerators, adapting these techniques to SSDs has limited benefits because they (1) ignore the heterogeneity of the SSD resources, and (2) make offloading decisions based on limited factors such as bandwidth utilization, or data movement cost. We propose Conduit, a general-purpose, programmer-transparent NDP framework for SSDs that leverages multiple SSD computation resources. At compile time, Conduit executes a custom compiler (e.g., LLVM) pass that (i) vectorizes suitable application code segments into SIMD operations that align with the SSD's page layout, and (ii) embeds metadata (e.g., operation type, operand sizes) into the vectorized instructions to guide runtime offloading decisions. At runtime, within the SSD, Conduit performs instruction-granularity offloading by evaluating six key features, and uses a cost function to select the most suitable SSD resource. We evaluate Conduit and two prior NDP offloading techniques using an in-house event-driven SSD simulator on six data-intensive workloads. Conduit outperforms the best-performing prior offloading policy by 1.8x and reduces energy consumption by 46%.</description>

      <title>Kareus: Joint Reduction of Dynamic and Static Energy in Large Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computing demand of AI is growing at an unprecedented rate, but energy supply is not keeping pace. As a result, energy has become an expensive, contended resource that requires explicit management and optimization. Although recent works have made significant progress in large model training optimization, they focus only on a single aspect of energy consumption: dynamic or static energy.
  We find that fine-grained kernel scheduling and frequency scaling jointly and interdependently impact both dynamic and static energy consumption. Based on this finding, we design Kareus, a training system that pushes the time--energy tradeoff frontier by optimizing both aspects. Kareus decomposes the intractable joint optimization problem into local, partition-based subproblems. It then uses a multi-pass multi-objective optimization algorithm to find execution schedules that push the time--energy tradeoff frontier. Compared to the state of the art, Kareus reduces training energy by up to 28.3% at the same training time, or reduces training time by up to 27.5% at the same energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Faramesh: A Protocol-Agnostic Execution Control Plane for Autonomous Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous agent systems increasingly trigger real-world side effects: deploying infrastructure, modifying databases, moving money, and executing workflows. Yet most agent stacks provide no mandatory execution checkpoint where organizations can deterministically permit, deny, or defer an action before it changes reality. This paper introduces Faramesh, a protocol-agnostic execution control plane that enforces execution-time authorization for agent-driven actions via a non-bypassable Action Authorization Boundary (AAB). Faramesh canonicalizes agent intent into a Canonical Action Representation (CAR), evaluates actions deterministically against policy and state, and issues a decision artifact (PERMIT/DEFER/DENY) that executors must validate prior to execution. The system is designed to be framework- and model-agnostic, supports multi-agent and multi-tenant deployments, and remains independent of transport protocols (e.g., MCP). Faramesh further provides decision-centric, append-only provenance logging keyed by canonical action hashes, enabling auditability, verification, and deterministic replay without re-running agent reasoning. We show how these primitives yield enforceable, predictable governance for autonomous execution while avoiding hidden coupling to orchestration layers or observability-only approaches.</description>

      <title>LLM-42: Enabling Determinism in LLM Inference with Verified Speculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In LLM inference, the same prompt may yield different outputs across different runs. At the system level, this non-determinism arises from floating-point non-associativity combined with dynamic batching and GPU kernels whose reduction orders vary with batch size. A straightforward way to eliminate non-determinism is to disable dynamic batching during inference, but doing so severely degrades throughput. Another approach is to make kernels batch-invariant; however, this tightly couples determinism to kernel design, requiring new implementations. This coupling also imposes fixed runtime overheads, regardless of how much of the workload actually requires determinism.
  Inspired by ideas from speculative decoding, we present LLM-42, a scheduling-based approach to enable determinism in LLM inference. Our key observation is that if a sequence is in a consistent state, the next emitted token is likely to be consistent even with dynamic batching. Moreover, most GPU kernels use shape-consistent reductions. Leveraging these insights, LLM-42 decodes tokens using a non-deterministic fast path and enforces determinism via a lightweight verify-rollback loop. The verifier replays candidate tokens under a fixed-shape reduction schedule, commits those that are guaranteed to be consistent across runs, and rolls back those violating determinism. LLM-42 mostly re-uses existing kernels unchanged and incurs overhead only in proportion to the traffic that requires determinism.</description>

      <title>On the Extension of Private Distributed Matrix Multiplication Schemes to the Grid Partition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider polynomial codes for private distributed matrix multiplication (PDMM/SDMM). Existing codes for PDMM are either specialized for the outer product partitioning (OPP), or inner product partitioning (IPP), or are valid for the more general grid partitioning (GP). We design extension operations that can be applied to a large class of OPP code designs to extend them to the GP case. Applying them to existing codes improves upon the state-of-the-art for certain parameters. Additionally, we show that the GP schemes resulting from extension fulfill additional combinatorial constraints, potentially limiting their performance. We illustrate this point by presenting a new GP scheme that does not adhere to these constraints and outperforms the state-of-the-art for a range of parameters.</description>

      <title>Types for Grassroots Logic Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grassroots Logic Programs (GLP) is a concurrent logic programming language in which logic variables are partitioned into paired readers and writers. An assignment is produced at most once via a writer and consumed at most once via its paired reader, and may contain additional readers and/or writers. This enables the concise expression of rich multidirectional communication modalities.
  ``Logic Programs as Types for Logic Programs'' (LICS'91) defined types as regular sets of paths over derivable ground atoms. Here, we define types to be regular sets of moded paths, where a mode captures directionality of communication -- whether a subterm is consumed from or produced to the environment -- enabling the typing of interactive partial computations including those that eventually deadlock or fail, or never terminate. We provide a syntactic definition of well-typing and prove that a program is well-typed iff the path abstraction of its moded-atom semantics satisfies covariance and contravariance conditions with respect to its type.
  The GLP type system was implemented in Dart by AI, starting from a mathematical specification of Typed GLP (this paper), deriving from it an English spec (written by AI), and from the spec deriving Dart code (by AI). While GLP is naturally untyped, the motivation for Typed GLP comes from programming with AI: Asking AI to program complex communication modalities in GLP (and in general) and hoping for the best is a tenuous strategy. The emerging discipline we advocate and employ is for the human designer and AI to jointly develop and agree upon (1)~GLP types; (2)~GLP procedure type declarations; (3)~informal (English) descriptions of the procedures; and only then let AI attempt to write (4)~GLP code based on those.</description>

      <title>MultiChain Blockchain Data Provenance for Deterministic Stream Processing with Kafka Streams: A Weather Data Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auditability and reproducibility still are critical challenges for real-time data streams pipelines. Streaming engines are highly dependent on runtime scheduling, window triggers, arrival orders, and uncertainties such as network jitters. These all derive the streaming pipeline platforms to throw non-determinist outputs. In this work, we introduce a blockchain-backed provenance architecture for streaming platform (e.g Kafka Streams) the publishes cryptographic data of a windowed data stream without publishing window payloads on-chain. We used real-time weather data from weather stations in Berlin. Weather records are canonicalized, deduplicated, and aggregated per window, then serialised deterministically. Furthermore, the Merkle root of the records within the window is computed and stored alongside with Kafka offsets boundaries to MultiChain blockchain streams as checkpoints. Our design can enable an independent auditor to verify: (1) the completeness of window payloads, (2) canonical serialization, and (3) correctness of derived analytics such as minimum/maximum/average temperatures. We evaluated our system using real data stream from two weather stations (Berlin-Brandenburg and Berlin-Tempelhof) and showed linear verification cost, deterministic reproducibility, and with a scalable off-chain storage with on-chain cryptographic anchoring. We also demonstrated that the blockchain can afford to be integrated with streaming platforms particularly with our system, and we get satisfactory transactions per second values.</description>

      <title>Rhea: Detecting Privilege-Escalated Evasive Ransomware Attacks Using Format-Aware Validation in the Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ransomware variants increasingly combine privilege escalation with sophisticated evasion strategies such as intermittent encryption, low-entropy encryption, and imitation attacks. Such powerful ransomware variants, privilege-escalated evasive ransomware (PEER), can defeat existing solutions relying on I/O-pattern analysis by tampering with or obfuscating I/O traces. Meanwhile, conventional statistical content-based detection becomes unreliable as the encryption size decreases due to sampling noises. We present Rhea, a cloud-offloaded ransomware defense system that analyzes replicated data snapshots, so-called mutation snapshots. Rhea introduces Format-Aware Validation that validates the syntactic and semantic correctness of file formats, instead of relying on statistical or entropy-based indicators. By leveraging file-format specifications as detection invariants, Rhea can reliably identify fine-grained and evasive encryption even under elevated attacker privileges. Our evaluation demonstrates that Rhea significantly outperforms existing approaches, establishing its practical effectiveness against modern ransomware threats.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Purification Controller for Quantum Networks: Dynamic Protocol Selection and Multipartite Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18351v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient entanglement distribution is the cornerstone of the Quantum Internet. However, physical link parameters such as photon loss, memory coherence time, and gate error rates fluctuate dynamically, rendering static purification strategies suboptimal. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Purification Controller (APC) that autonomously optimizes the entanglement distillation sequence to maximize the "goodput," the rate of delivered pairs meeting a strict fidelity threshold. By treating protocol selection as a resource allocation problem, the APC dynamically switches between purification depths and protocol families (e.g., BBPSSW vs. DEJMPS) to navigate the trade-off between generation rate and state quality. Using a dynamic programming planner with Pareto pruning, simulation results demonstrate that our approach eliminates the "fidelity cliffs" inherent in static protocols and prevents resource wastage in high-noise regimes. Furthermore, we extend the controller to heterogeneous scenarios, demonstrating robustness for both multipartite GHZ state generation and continuous variable systems using effective noiseless linear amplification models. We benchmark its computational overhead, confirming real-time feasibility with decision latencies in the millisecond range per link.</description>

      <title>A Programming Model for Disaggregated Memory over CXL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CXL (Compute Express Link) is an emerging open industry-standard interconnect between processing and memory devices that is expected to revolutionize the way systems are designed.
  It enables cache-coherent, shared memory pools in a disaggregated fashion at unprecedented scales, allowing algorithms to interact with various storage devices using simple loads and stores.
  While CXL unleashes unique opportunities, it also introduces challenges of data management and crash consistency.
  For example, CXL currently lacks an adequate programming model, making it impossible to reason about the correctness and behavior of systems on top.
  In this work, we present CXL0, the first programming model for concurrent programs over CXL.
  We propose a high-level abstraction for memory accesses and formally define operational semantics.
  We demonstrate that CXL0 captures a wide range of current and future CXL setups and perform initial measurements on real hardware.
  To illustrate the usefulness of CXL0, we present a general transformation that enhances any linearizable concurrent algorithm with durability in a distributed partial-crash setting.
  We believe that this work will serve as a stepping stone for systems design and programming on top of CXL.</description>

      <title>Joint Resource Optimization, Computation Offloading and Resource Slicing for Multi-Edge Traffic-Cognitive Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolving landscape of edge computing envisions platforms operating as dynamic intermediaries between application providers and edge servers (ESs), where task offloading is coupled with payments for computational services. Ensuring efficient resource utilization and meeting stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements necessitates incentivizing ESs while optimizing the platforms operational objectives. This paper investigates a multi-agent system where both the platform and ESs are self-interested entities, addressing the joint optimization of revenue maximization, resource allocation, and task offloading. We propose a novel Stackelberg game-based framework to model interactions between stakeholders and solve the optimization problem using a Bayesian Optimization-based centralized algorithm. Recognizing practical challenges in information collection due to privacy concerns, we further design a decentralized solution leveraging neural network optimization and a privacy-preserving information exchange protocol. Extensive numerical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms in achieving superior performance compared to existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Task Scheduling in Fog Computing with Deadline Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to the development of numerous time-sensitive applications that require quick responses and low latency. Fog computing has emerged as a solution for processing these IoT applications, but it faces challenges such as resource allocation and job scheduling. Therefore, it is crucial to determine how to assign and schedule tasks on Fog nodes. This work aims to schedule tasks in IoT while minimizing the total energy consumption of nodes and enhancing the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of IoT tasks, taking into account task deadlines. This paper classifies Fog nodes into two categories based on their traffic level: low and high. It schedules short-deadline tasks on low-traffic nodes using an Improved Golden Eagle Optimization (IGEO) algorithm, an enhancement that utilizes genetic operators for discretization. Long-deadline tasks are processed on high-traffic nodes using reinforcement learning (RL). This combined approach is called the Reinforcement Improved Golden Eagle Optimization (RIGEO) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that RIGEO achieves up to a 29% reduction in energy consumption, up to an 86% improvement in response time, and up to a 19% reduction in deadline violations compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Shift Parallelism: Low-Latency, High-Throughput LLM Inference for Dynamic Workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient parallelism is necessary for achieving low-latency, high-throughput inference with large language models (LLMs). Tensor parallelism (TP) is the state-of-the-art method for reducing LLM response latency, however GPU communications reduces combined token throughput. On the other hand, data parallelism (DP) obtains a higher throughput yet is slow in response latency. Best of both worlds does not exist, and it is not possible to combine TP and DP because of the KV cache variance across the parallelisms.
  We notice Sequence Parallelism (SP - Ulysses in training) has similar properties as DP but with KV cache invariance. We adapt SP to inference, and combine it with TP to get the best of both worlds. Our solution: Shift Parallelism.
  Shift Parallelism dynamically switches across TP and SP, and minimizes latency in low traffic without losing throughput in high traffic. The efficient GPU communications of Shift Parallelism yields up to i) 1.51x faster response in interactive workloads and ii) 50% higher throughput in batch workloads, compared to a TP-only solution.
  We evaluate Shift Parallelism with real-world production traces with dynamic traffic patterns as well as synthetic benchmarking patterns across models, context sizes, and arrival rates. All results affirm the same: Shift Parallelism has a better the latency vs. throughput tradeoff than TP or DP, and hence obtains low latency without degrading throughput in dynamic workloads.</description>

      <title>GRACE-MoE: Grouping and Replication with Locality-Aware Routing for Efficient Distributed MoE Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) performs conditional computation by selectively activating a subset of experts, thereby enabling scalable parameter growth in large language models (LLMs). However, the expanded parameter scale exceeds the memory capacity of a single device, necessitating distributed deployment for inference. This setup introduces two critical challenges: (1) Communication Issue: Transferring features to devices with activated experts leads to significant communication overhead. (2) Computational Load Issue: Skewed expert activation overloads certain GPUs, resulting in load imbalance across devices. Among these, communication overhead is identified as the main bottleneck in SMoE inference. Nevertheless, reducing communication between devices may exacerbate computational load imbalance, leading to device idleness and resource waste. Therefore, we present GRACE-MoE, short for Grouping and Replication with Locality-Aware Routing for SMoE inference. GRACE-MoE is a co-optimization framework that jointly reduces communication overhead and alleviates computational load imbalance. Specifically, the framework comprises two key phases: (1) Grouping &amp; Replication: This phase groups experts based on their affinity to reduce cross-device communication. Additionally, dynamic replication is applied to address load skew, improving computational load balance across GPUs. (2) Routing: This phase employs a locality-aware routing strategy with load prediction. It prioritizes local replicas to minimize communication overhead and balances requests across remote replicas when necessary. Experiments on diverse models and multi-node, multi-GPU environments demonstrate that GRACE-MoE efficiently reduces end-to-end inference latency, achieving up to 3.79x speedup over state-of-the-art systems. Code for GRACE-MoE will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>HYDRA: Breaking the Global Ordering Barrier in Multi-BFT Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-Byzantine Fault Tolerant (Multi-BFT) consensus, which runs multiple BFT instances in parallel, has recently emerged as a promising approach to overcome the leader bottleneck in classical BFT protocols. However, existing designs rely on a global ordering layer to serialize blocks across instances, an intuitive yet costly mechanism that constrains scalability, amplifies failure propagation, and complicates deployment. In this paper, we challenge this conventional wisdom. We present HYDRA, the first Multi-BFT consensus framework that eliminates global ordering altogether. HYDRA introduces an object-centric execution model that partitions transactions by their accessed objects, enabling concurrent yet deterministic execution across instances. To ensure consistency, HYDRA combines lightweight lock-based coordination with a deadlock resolution mechanism, achieving both scalability and correctness. We implement HYDRA and evaluate it on up to 128 replicas in both LAN and WAN environments. Experimental results show HYDRA outperforms several state-of-the-art Multi-BFT protocols in the presence of a straggler. These results demonstrate strong consistency and high performance by removing global ordering, opening a new direction toward scalable Multi-BFT consensus design.</description>

      <title>Reexamining Paradigms of End-to-End Data Movement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pursuit of high-performance data transfer often focuses on raw network bandwidth, where international links of 100 Gbps or higher are frequently considered the primary enabler. While necessary, this network-centric view is incomplete. It equates provisioned link speeds with practical, sustainable data movement capabilities. It is a common observation that lower-than-desired data rates manifest even on 10 Gbps links and commodity hardware, with higher-speed networks only amplifying their visibility. We investigate six paradigms -- from network latency and TCP congestion control to host-side factors such as CPU performance and virtualization -- that critically impact data movement workflows. These paradigms represent widely \enquote{accepted} engineering assumptions that inform system design, procurement decisions, and operational practices in production data movement environments. We introduce the \enquote{Drainage Basin Pattern} conceptual model for reasoning about end-to-end data flow constraints across heterogeneous hardware and software components at varying desired data rates to address the fidelity gap between raw bandwidth and application-level throughput. Our findings are validated through rigorous production-scale deployments, from 10 Gbps links to U.S. DOE ESnet technical evaluations and transcontinental production trials over 100 Gbps operational links. The results demonstrate that principal bottlenecks often reside outside the network core, and that a holistic hardware-software co-design enables consistent, predictable performance for moving data at scale and speed.</description>

      <title>Inference Offloading for Cost-Sensitive Binary Classification at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We focus on a binary classification problem in an edge intelligence system where false negatives are more costly than false positives. The system has a compact, locally deployed model, which is supplemented by a larger, remote model, which is accessible via the network by incurring an offloading cost. For each sample, our system first uses the locally deployed model for inference. Based on the output of the local model, the sample may be offloaded to the remote model. This work aims to understand the fundamental trade-off between classification accuracy and the offloading costs within such a hierarchical inference (HI) system. To optimise this system, we propose an online learning framework that continuously adapts a pair of thresholds on the local model's confidence scores. These thresholds determine the prediction of the local model and whether a sample is classified locally or offloaded to the remote model. We present a closed-form solution for the setting where the local model is calibrated. For the more general case of uncalibrated models, we introduce H2T2, an online two-threshold hierarchical inference policy, and prove it achieves sublinear regret. H2T2 is model-agnostic, requires no training, and learns during the inference phase using limited feedback. Simulations on real-world datasets show that H2T2 consistently outperforms naive and single-threshold HI policies, sometimes even surpassing offline optima. The policy also demonstrates robustness to distribution shifts and adapts effectively to mismatched classifiers.</description>

      <title>On the Fundamental Limits of LLMs at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have benefited enormously from scaling, yet these gains are bounded by five fundamental limitations: (1) hallucination, (2) context compression, (3) reasoning degradation, (4) retrieval fragility, and (5) multimodal misalignment. While existing surveys describe these phenomena empirically, they lack a rigorous theoretical synthesis connecting them to the foundational limits of computation, information, and learning. This work closes that gap by presenting a unified, proof-informed framework that formalizes the innate theoretical ceilings of LLM scaling. First, computability and uncomputability imply an irreducible residue of error: for any computably enumerable model family, diagonalization guarantees inputs on which some model must fail, and undecidable queries (e.g., halting-style tasks) induce infinite failure sets for all computable predictors. Second, information-theoretic and statistical constraints bound attainable accuracy even on decidable tasks, finite description length enforces compression error, and long-tail factual knowledge requires prohibitive sample complexity. Third, geometric and computational effects compress long contexts far below their nominal size due to positional under-training, encoding attenuation, and softmax crowding. We further show how likelihood-based training favors pattern completion over inference, how retrieval under token limits suffers from semantic drift and coupling noise, and how multimodal scaling inherits shallow cross-modal alignment. Across sections, we pair theorems and empirical evidence to outline where scaling helps, where it saturates, and where it cannot progress, providing both theoretical foundations and practical mitigation paths like bounded-oracle retrieval, positional curricula, and sparse or hierarchical attention.</description>

      <title>SecureSplit: Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Split Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Split Learning (SL) offers a framework for collaborative model training that respects data privacy by allowing participants to share the same dataset while maintaining distinct feature sets. However, SL is susceptible to backdoor attacks, in which malicious clients subtly alter their embeddings to insert hidden triggers that compromise the final trained model. To address this vulnerability, we introduce SecureSplit, a defense mechanism tailored to SL. SecureSplit applies a dimensionality transformation strategy to accentuate subtle differences between benign and poisoned embeddings, facilitating their separation. With this enhanced distinction, we develop an adaptive filtering approach that uses a majority-based voting scheme to remove contaminated embeddings while preserving clean ones. Rigorous experiments across four datasets (CIFAR-10, MNIST, CINIC-10, and ImageNette), five backdoor attack scenarios, and seven alternative defenses confirm the effectiveness of SecureSplit under various challenging conditions.</description>
