      <title>An RKHS approach to the indefinite Schwarz-Pick inequality on the bidisk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we will give a generalization of the indefinite Schwarz-Pick inequality due to Seto [8]. Our approach is based on a connection between complex geometry and the geometry of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, which was crucially used in our previous work [6].</description>

      <title>More on the optimal arrangement of $2d$ lines in $\mathbb{C}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new infinite family of $d\times 2d$ equiangular tight frames. Many matrices in this family consist of two $d\times d$ circulant blocks. We conjecture that such equiangular tight frames exist for every $d$. We show that our conjecture holds for $d\leq 165$ by a computer-assisted application of a Newton-Kantorovich theorem. In addition, we supply numerical constructions that corroborate our conjecture for $d\leq 1500$.</description>

      <title>Comparing the ill-posedness for linear operators in Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The difficulty for solving ill-posed linear operator equations in Hilbert space is reflected by the strength of ill-posedness of the governing operator, and the inherent solution smoothness. In this study we focus on the ill-posedness of the operator, and we propose a partial ordering for the class of all bounded linear operators which lead to ill-posed operator equations. For compact linear operators, there is a simple characterization in terms of the decay rates of the singular values. In the context of the validity of the spectral theorem the partial ordering can also be understood. We highlight that range inclusions yield partial ordering, and we discuss cases when compositions of compact and non-compact operators occur. Several examples complement the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Geometric scattering for nonlinear wave equations on the Schwarzschild metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we establish a conformal scattering theory for the defocusing semilinear wave equations on the Schwarzschild spacetime. We combine the energy and pointwise decay results of solutions obtained in \cite{Yang} and a Sobolev embedding on spacelike hypersurfaces to establish the energy estimates in two sides between the energy flux of solution through the Cauchy initial hypersurface $\Sigma_0=\left\{ t=0 \right\}$ and the one through the null conformal boundaries $\mathfrak{H}^+\cup \scri^+$ (resp. $\mathfrak{H}^-\cup \scri^-$). Combining these estimates and the well-posedness of Cauchy and Goursat problems for nonlinear wave equations we provide a bounded linear and locally Lipschitz scattering operator which maps the past scattering data to the future scattering data. Our results extend also the previous works \cite{BaSeZho1990,Jo2012,Jo2019} to an asymptotically flat spacetime such as Schwarzschild spacetime which is static and spherically symmetric.</description>

      <title>Key subgroups in the Polish group of all automorphisms of the rational circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending some results of a joint work with E. Glasner (2021) we continue to study the Polish group $G:=\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{Q}_0)$ of all circular order preserving permutations of $\mathbb{Q}_0$ with the pointwise topology, where $\mathbb{Q}_0$ is the rational discrete circle. We show, among others, that certain extremely amenable subgroups $H$ of $G:=\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{Q}_0)$ are inj-key but not co-minimal in $G$. This counterexample answers a question from a joint work with M. Shlossberg (2024) and inspired by a question proposed by V. Pestov about Polish groups $G$ with metrizable universal minimal $G$-flow $M(G)$. It is an open problem to study Pestov's question in its full generality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.15683v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a wide class of domains $G\subset\mathbb C^d$ including balls and polydisks we prove the density of their canonical image in the spectrum of $H^\infty(G)$. This Corona Theorem is proved first in its abstract version for certain uniform algebras. We use properties of bands of measures and idempotents corresponding to Gleason parts.
  The essential tools are properties of hyper-Stonean spaces, normal and Henkin measures and some ideas based on Hoffman - Rossi theorem. We also use our previous results on weak-star closures of reducing bands of measures. Uniform bounds for operators used to solve the Gleason problem concerning ideals of analytic functions vanishing at given points are applied for bidual algebras.</description>

      <title>Multi-window STFT phase retrieval: lattice uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.10620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) phase retrieval refers to the reconstruction of a function $f$ from its spectrogram, i.e., the magnitudes of its short-time Fourier transform $V_gf$ with window function $g$. While it is known that for appropriate windows, any function $f \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$ can be reconstructed from the full spectrogram $|V_g f(\mathbb{R}^2)|$, in practical scenarios, the reconstruction must be achieved from discrete samples, typically taken on a lattice. It turns out that the sampled problem becomes much more subtle: recent results have demonstrated that uniqueness via lattice-sampling is unachievable, irrespective of the choice of the window function or the lattice density. In the present paper, we initiate the study of multi-window STFT phase retrieval as a way to effectively bypass the discretization barriers encountered in the single-window case. By establishing a link between multi-window Gabor systems, sampling in Fock space, and phase retrieval for finite frames, we derive conditions under which square-integrable functions can be uniquely recovered from spectrogram samples on a lattice. Specifically, we provide conditions on window functions $g_1, \dots, g_4 \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$, such that every $f \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$ is determined up to a global phase from $$\left(|V_{g_1}f(A\mathbb{Z}^2)|, \, \dots, \, |V_{g_4}f(A\mathbb{Z}^2)| \right)$$ whenever $A \in \mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ satisfies the density condition $|\det A|^{-1} \geq 4$. For real-valued functions, a density of $|\det A|^{-1} \geq 2$ is sufficient. Corresponding results for irregular sampling are also shown.</description>

      <title>Phase retrieval in Fock space and perturbation of Liouville sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the determination of functions in Fock space from samples of their absolute value, known as the phase retrieval problem in Fock space. An important finding in this research field asserts that phaseless sampling on lattices of arbitrary density renders the problem unsolvable. The present study establishes solvability when using irregular sampling sets of the form $A \cup B \cup C$, where $A, B,$ and $C$ constitute perturbations of a Liouville set, i.e., a set with the property that all functions in Fock space bounded on the set are constant. The sets $A, B,$ and $C$ adhere to specific geometrical conditions of closeness and noncollinearity. We show that these conditions are sufficiently generic so as to allow the perturbations to be chosen also at random. By proving that Liouville sets occupy an intermediate position between sets of stable sampling and sets of uniqueness, we obtain the first construction of uniqueness sets for the phase retrieval problem in Fock space having a finite density. The established results apply to the Gabor phase retrieval problem in subspaces of $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, where we derive additional reductions of the size of uniqueness sets: for the class of real-valued functions, uniqueness is achieved from two perturbed lattices; for the class of even real-valued functions, a single perturbation suffices, resulting in a separated set.</description>

      <title>A convenient setting for infinite-dimensional analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09950v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a convenient framework for infinite-dimensional analysis (including both real and complex analysis in infinite dimensions), in which differentiation (in some weak sense) and integration operations can be easily performed, integration by parts can be conveniently established under rather weak conditions, and especially some nice properties and consequences obtained by convolution in Euclidean spaces can be extended to infinite-dimensional spaces in some sense by taking the limit. Compared to the existing tools in infinite-dimensional analysis, our setting enjoys more convenient and clearer links with that of finite dimensions, and hence it is more suitable for computation and studying some analysis problems in infinite-dimensional spaces.</description>

      <title>Restriction of Fractional Derivatives of the Fourier Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we showed that for suitable $(\beta,p, s,\ell)$ the $\beta$-order fractional derivative with respect to the last coordinate of the Fourier transform of an $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ function is in $H^{-s}$ after restricting to a graph of a function with non-vanishing Gaussian curvature provided that the restriction of the Fourier transform of such function to the surface is in $H^{\ell}$. This is a generalization of the result in \cite{GoldStol}*{Theorem 1.12}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tomita-Takesaki theory associates a positive operator called the "modular operator" with a von Neumann algebra and a cyclic-separating vector. Tomita's theorem says that the unitary flow generated by the modular operator leaves the algebra invariant. I give a new, short proof of this theorem which only uses the analytic structure of unitary flows, and which avoids operator-valued Fourier transforms (as in van Daele's proof) and operator-valued Mellin transforms (as in Zsid\'{o}'s and Woronowicz's proofs). The proof is similar to one given by Bratteli and Robinson in the special case that the modular operator is bounded.</description>

Abstract: We study positive properties of the quasilinear elliptic equation
  $$-\mathrm{div}\mathcal{A}(x,\nabla u)+V|u|^{p-2}u=0\quad (1&lt;p&lt;\infty)\qquad \mbox{ in } \Omega,$$ where the function $\mathcal{A}(x,\xi)$ is induced by a family of norms on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ ($n\geq 2$) parameterized by points in the domain $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and $V$ belongs to a certain local Morrey space. We first establish two-sided estimates for Bregman distances of $|\xi|^{p}_{s,a}$ ($1&lt;s&lt;\infty$), where $a=(a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n})$ and $a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n}$ are certain functions with positive local lower and upper bounds in $\Omega$. These estimates lead to a Maz'ya-type characterization for Hardy-weights of the corresponding functionals. Then we prove three types of sufficient conditions for the attainment of the Hardy constant in a certain space $\widetilde{W}^{1,p}_{0}(\Omega)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for exploring generalization errors of transfer learning through the lens of differential calculus on the space of probability measures. In particular, we consider two main transfer learning scenarios, $\alpha$-ERM and fine-tuning with the KL-regularized empirical risk minimization and establish generic conditions under which the generalization error and the population risk convergence rates for these scenarios are studied. Based on our theoretical results, we show the benefits of transfer learning with a one-hidden-layer neural network in the mean-field regime under some suitable integrability and regularity assumptions on the loss and activation functions.</description>
