      <title>Realizing Transfer Systems as Suboperads of Coinduced Operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an explicit method to identify equivariant suboperads of coinduced operads that contain only fixed points associated to any desired transfer system. Our method works for a class of operads that we call intersection operads, which includes many familiar operads of interest, including the little $k$-cube operads, the Steiner operad, and the linear isometries operad. As an application, we also construct an intersection $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-operad that, when applying our construction, will produce a $\mathbb{N}_\infty$-operad realizing an arbitrary transfer system.</description>

      <title>Identifying Anyonic Topological Order in Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently observed fractional quantum anomalous Hall materials (FQAH) are candidates for topological quantum hardware, but their required anyon states are elusive. We point out dependence on monodromy in the fragile band topology in 2-cohomotopy. An algebro-topological theorem of Larmore &amp; Thomas (1980) then identifies FQAH anyons over momentum space. Admissible braiding phases are 2C-th roots of unity, for C the Chern number. This lays the foundation for understanding symmetry-protected topological order in FQAH systems, reducing the problem to computations in equivariant cohomotopy.</description>

      <title>Semi-strictification of $(\infty, n)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the first equivalence between a weak non-algebraic model and a semi-strict algebraic model of $(\infty, n)$-categories. This takes the form of a natural semi-strictification, whereby a weak $(\infty, n)$-category is embedded into a semi-strict one through an acyclic cofibration, in such a way that weak functors lift to semi-strict functors; this constitutes the derived unit of a Quillen equivalence between weak model categories whose fibrant objects are, respectively, the weak $(\infty, n)$-categories and (up to an acyclic fibration) the semi-strict ones. The semi-strict model has algebraic units and composition of round pasting diagrams, satisfying a strict form of associativity and interchange as in Henry's regular version of Simpson's weak units conjecture; semi-strict functors strictly preserve round composition, but only weakly preserve units. Globular composition operations are obtained from a combination of units and round composition. Since the models satisfy the homotopy hypothesis in the case $n = 0$, this result also exhibits the first semi-strict model of the classical homotopy types that has algebraic units and composition. The constructions are based on the combinatorics of regular directed complexes and are entirely explicit and combinatorial, in the spirit of Mac Lane's strictification of bicategories.</description>

      <title>Modeling Group Actions on Stacks (Especially the Lubin-Tate Action)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose we are given a profinite group $G$ acting on a formal moduli stack $\mathcal{M}$, and we want to understand the group action, and compute cohomology related to this group action. How can we do it? This prolegomenon surveys two methods of pinning down such an action: geometric modeling and the two tower method. We highlight their use on a specific action - the automorphisms of a formal group acting on its deformation space, called the Lubin-Tate action.</description>

      <title>$THH$ of the Morava $E$-theory Spectrum $E_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Morava $E$-theories, $E_{n}$, are complex-oriented $2$-periodic ring spectra, with homotopy groups $\mathbb{W}_{\mathbb{F}_{p^{n}}}[[u_{1}, u_{2}, ... , u_{n-1}]][u,u^{-1}]$. Here $\mathbb{W}$ denotes the Witt vector ring. $E_{n}$ is a Landweber exact spectrum and hence uniquely determined by this ring as $BP_{\ast}$-algebra. Algebraic $K$-theory of $E_{n}$ is a key ingredient towards analyzing the layers in the $p$-complete Waldhausen $K$-theory chromatic tower. One hopes to use the machinery of trace methods to get results towards $K$-theory once the computation for $THH(E_{n})$ is known.
  In this paper we describe $THH(E_{2})$ as part of consecutive chain of cofiber sequences where each cofiber sits in the next cofiber sequence and the first term of each cofiber sequence is describable completely in terms of suspensions and localizations of $E_{2}$. For these results, we first calculate $K(i)$-homology of $THH(E_{2})$ using a B\"okstedt spectral sequence and then lift the generating classes of $K(1)$-homology to fundamental classes in homotopy group of $THH(E_{2})$. These lifts allow us to construct terms of the cofiber sequence and explicitly understand how they map to $THH(E_{2})$.</description>

      <title>Pathological Computations of Mackey Functor-valued Tor over Cyclic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute Mackey functor-valued Tor over certain free incomplete Tambara functors, generalizing the computation of Tor over a polynomial ring on one generator. In contrast with the classical situation where the resulting Tor groups vanish above degree one, we present examples where Tor is nonvanishing in almost every degree. We also discuss a 2-primary analogue of the odd-primary Koszul complexes defined in our other work \cite{MQS24a}.</description>

      <title>Cellular Sheaves on Higher-Dimensional Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23993v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Defining cellular sheaves beyond graph structures, such as on simplicial complexes containing higher-dimensional simplices, is an essential and intriguing topic in topological data analysis (TDA) and the development of sheaf neural networks. In this paper, we explore methods for constructing non-trivial cellular sheaves on spaces that include structures of dimension greater than one. This extends the focus from 0- or 1-dimensional components, such as vertices and edges, to elements like triangles, tetrahedra, and other higher-dimensional simplices within a simplicial complex. We develop a unified framework that incorporates both geometric and algebraic approaches to modeling such complex systems using cellular sheaf theory. Motivated by the geometric and physical insights from anisotropic network models (ANM), we first introduce constructions that define sheaf structures whose 0-th sheaf Laplacians recover classical ANM Hessian matrices. The higher-dimensional sheaf Laplacians in this setting encode additional patterns of multi-way interactions. In parallel, we propose an algebraic framework based on commutative algebra and ringed spaces, where sheaves of ideals and modules are used to define sheaf structures in a combinatorial and algebraically grounded manner. These two perspectives -- the geometric-physical and the algebraic -- offer complementary strengths and together provide a versatile framework for encoding structural relationships and analyzing multi-scale data over simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>Compact aspherical solenoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:1009.5716v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider compact, aspherical solenoids obtained as the inverse limit of a system of CW~complexes and covering maps. This includes $P$-adic solenoids, as well as the universal hyperbolic solenoid of Teichm\"{u}ller theory. Using ideas from shape theory, we classify maps between such solenoids up to homotopy, and we prove a Dehn-Nielsen-type theorem for self-homotopy equivalences of such a solenoid. This generalizes a result of Odden regarding the universal hyperbolic solenoid.</description>

      <title>Topological data analysis of the deconfinement transition in SU(3) lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the confining and deconfining phases of pure $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory with topological data analysis. This provides unique insights into long range correlations of field configurations across the confinement-deconfinement transition. Specifically, we analyze non-trivial structures in electric and magnetic field energy densities as well as Polyakov loop traces and a Polyakov loop-based variant of the topological density. The Betti curves for filtrations based on the electric and magnetic field energy densities reveal signals of electromagnetic dualities. These dualities can be associated with an interchange in the roles of local lumps of electric and magnetic energy densities around the phase transition. Moreover, we show that plaquette susceptibilities can manifest in the geometric features captured by the Betti curves. We also compare these findings against earlier results for $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and elaborate on the significant differences. Our results demonstrate that topological data analysis can identify clear differences between phase transitions of first and second order for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories and provides unprecedented insights into the relevant structures in their vicinity.</description>

      <title>Gradings on nilpotent Lie algebras associated with the nilpotent fundamental groups of smooth complex algebraic varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08571v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a lattice in a simply-connected nilpotent Lie group $N$ whose Lie algebra $\mathfrak{n}$ is
  $p$-filiform. We show that $\Gamma$ is either abelian or 2-step nilpotent if $\Gamma$ is isomorphic to the fundamental
  group of a smooth complex algebraic variety. Moreover as an application of our result, we give a
  required condition of a lattice in a simply-connected nilpotent Lie group of dimension less than or
  equal to six to be isomorphic to the fundamental group of a smooth complex algebraic variety.</description>
