      <title>Hierarchical Self-Attention: Generalizing Neural Attention Mechanics to Multi-Scale Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers and their attention mechanism have been revolutionary in the field of Machine Learning. While originally proposed for the language data, they quickly found their way to the image, video, graph, etc. data modalities with various signal geometries. Despite this versatility, generalizing the attention mechanism to scenarios where data is presented at different scales from potentially different modalities is not straightforward. The attempts to incorporate hierarchy and multi-modality within transformers are largely based on ad hoc heuristics, which are not seamlessly generalizable to similar problems with potentially different structures. To address this problem, in this paper, we take a fundamentally different approach: we first propose a mathematical construct to represent multi-modal, multi-scale data. We then mathematically derive the neural attention mechanics for the proposed construct from the first principle of entropy minimization. We show that the derived formulation is optimal in the sense of being the closest to the standard Softmax attention while incorporating the inductive biases originating from the hierarchical/geometric information of the problem. We further propose an efficient algorithm based on dynamic programming to compute our derived attention mechanism. By incorporating it within transformers, we show that the proposed hierarchical attention mechanism not only can be employed to train transformer models in hierarchical/multi-modal settings from scratch, but it can also be used to inject hierarchical information into classical, pre-trained transformer models post training, resulting in more efficient models in zero-shot manner.</description>

      <title>Instance Generation for Meta-Black-Box Optimization through Latent Space Reverse Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To relieve intensive human-expertise required to design optimization algorithms, recent Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) researches leverage generalization strength of meta-learning to train neural network-based algorithm design policies over a predefined training problem set, which automates the adaptability of the low-level optimizers on unseen problem instances. Currently, a common training problem set choice in existing MetaBBOs is well-known benchmark suites CoCo-BBOB. Although such choice facilitates the MetaBBO's development, problem instances in CoCo-BBOB are more or less limited in diversity, raising the risk of overfitting of MetaBBOs, which might further results in poor generalization. In this paper, we propose an instance generation approach, termed as \textbf{LSRE}, which could generate diverse training problem instances for MetaBBOs to learn more generalizable policies. LSRE first trains an autoencoder which maps high-dimensional problem features into a 2-dimensional latent space. Uniform-grid sampling in this latent space leads to hidden representations of problem instances with sufficient diversity. By leveraging a genetic-programming approach to search function formulas with minimal L2-distance to these hidden representations, LSRE reverse engineers a diversified problem set, termed as \textbf{Diverse-BBO}. We validate the effectiveness of LSRE by training various MetaBBOs on Diverse-BBO and observe their generalization performances on either synthetic or realistic scenarios. Extensive experimental results underscore the superiority of Diverse-BBO to existing training set choices in MetaBBOs. Further ablation studies not only demonstrate the effectiveness of design choices in LSRE, but also reveal interesting insights on instance diversity and MetaBBO's generalization.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Human Visual System: Comparative Insights from Response-Optimized and Task-Optimized Vision Models, Language Models, and different Readout Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14031v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decade, predictive modeling of neural responses in the primate visual system has advanced significantly, largely driven by various DNN approaches. These include models optimized directly for visual recognition, cross-modal alignment through contrastive objectives, neural response prediction from scratch, and large language model embeddings.Likewise, different readout mechanisms, ranging from fully linear to spatial-feature factorized methods have been explored for mapping network activations to neural responses. Despite the diversity of these approaches, it remains unclear which method performs best across different visual regions. In this study, we systematically compare these approaches for modeling the human visual system and investigate alternative strategies to improve response predictions. Our findings reveal that for early to mid-level visual areas, response-optimized models with visual inputs offer superior prediction accuracy, while for higher visual regions, embeddings from LLMs based on detailed contextual descriptions of images and task-optimized models pretrained on large vision datasets provide the best fit. Through comparative analysis of these modeling approaches, we identified three distinct regions in the visual cortex: one sensitive primarily to perceptual features of the input that are not captured by linguistic descriptions, another attuned to fine-grained visual details representing semantic information, and a third responsive to abstract, global meanings aligned with linguistic content. We also highlight the critical role of readout mechanisms, proposing a novel scheme that modulates receptive fields and feature maps based on semantic content, resulting in an accuracy boost of 3-23% over existing SOTAs for all models and brain regions. Together, these findings offer key insights into building more precise models of the visual system.</description>

      <title>A Universal Framework for Large-Scale Multi-Objective Optimization Based on Particle Drift and Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale multi-objective optimization poses challenges to existing evolutionary algorithms in maintaining the performances of convergence and diversity because of high dimensional decision variables. Inspired by the motion of particles in physics, we propose a universal framework for large-scale multi-objective optimization based on particle drift and diffusion to solve these challenges in this paper. This framework innovatively divides the optimization process into three sub-stages: two coarse-tuning sub-stages and one fine-tuning sub-stage. Different strategies of drift-diffusion operations are performed on the guiding solutions according to the current sub-stage, ingeniously simulating the movement of particles under diverse environmental conditions. Finally, representative evolutionary algorithms are embedded into the proposed framework, and their effectiveness are evaluated through comparative experiments on various large-scale multi-objective problems with 1000 to 5000 decision variables. Moreover, comparative algorithms are conducted on neural network training problems to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in the practical problems. The experimental results demonstrate that the framework proposed in this paper significantly enhances the performance of convergence and diversity of MOEAs, and improves the computational efficiency of algorithms in solving large-scale multi-objective optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Assisted Automated Algorithm Generation and Evolution via Meta-black-box optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meta-black-box optimization has been significantly advanced through the use of large language models (LLMs), yet in fancy on constrained evolutionary optimization. In this work, AwesomeDE is proposed that leverages LLMs as the strategy of meta-optimizer to generate update rules for constrained evolutionary algorithm without human intervention. On the meanwhile, $RTO^2H$ framework is introduced for standardize prompt design of LLMs. The meta-optimizer is trained on a diverse set of constrained optimization problems. Key components, including prompt design and iterative refinement, are systematically analyzed to determine their impact on design quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of computational efficiency and solution accuracy. Furthermore, AwesomeDE is shown to generalize well across distinct problem domains, suggesting its potential for broad applicability. This research contributes to the field by providing a scalable and data-driven methodology for automated constrained algorithm design, while also highlighting limitations and directions for future work.</description>

      <title>Personalized Language Models via Privacy-Preserving Evolutionary Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalization in language models aims to tailor model behavior to individual users or user groups. Prompt-based methods incorporate user preferences into queries, while training-based methods encode them into model parameters. Model merging has also been explored for personalization under limited data. However, existing methods often fail to directly optimize task-specific utility and lack explicit mechanisms for privacy preservation. To address the limitations, we propose Privacy-Preserving Model Merging via Evolutionary Algorithms (PriME), a novel personalization approach that employs gradient-free methods to directly optimize utility while reducing privacy risks. By integrating privacy preservation into the optimization objective, PriME creates personalized modules that effectively capture target user preferences while minimizing privacy risks for data-sharing users. Experiments on the LaMP benchmark show that PriME consistently outperforms a range of baselines, achieving up to a 45% improvement in task performance. Further analysis demonstrates that PriME achieves a superior privacy-utility trade-off compared to a prior state-of-the-art, with enhanced robustness to membership inference attacks and greater utility in capturing user preferences.</description>
