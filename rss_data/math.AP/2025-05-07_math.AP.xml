      <title>On the Euler-Poisson equations with variable background states and nonlocal velocity alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the 1D pressureless Euler-Poisson equations with variable background states and nonlocal velocity alignment. Our main focus is the phenomenon of critical thresholds, where subcritical initial data lead to global regularity, while supercritical data result in finite-time singularity formation. The critical threshold behavior of the Euler-Poisson-alignment (EPA) system has previously been investigated under two specific setups: (1) when the background state is constant, phase plane analysis was used in the work of Bhatnagar, Liu and Tan [J. Differ. Equ. 375 (2023) 82-119] to establish critical thresholds; and (2) when the nonlocal alignment is replaced by linear damping, comparison principles based on Lyapunov functions were employed in the work of Choi, Kim, Koo and Tadmor [arXiv:2402.12839].
  In this work, we present a comprehensive critical threshold analysis of the general EPA system, incorporating both nonlocal effects. Our framework unifies the techniques developed in the aforementioned studies and recovers their results under the respective limiting assumptions. A key feature of our approach is the oscillatory nature of the solution, which motivates a decomposition of the phase plane into four distinct regions. In each region, we implement tailored comparison principles to construct the critical thresholds piece by piece.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of a Transmission Problem in Elasticity with kind damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a transmission problem featuring a specific type of damping. Our primary focus is on analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the associated semigroup, $({\mathcal S}_{\mathcal A}(t))_{t\geq 0}$. We demonstrate that this semigroup exhibits a polynomial rate of decay towards zero when the initial data is taken over the domain ${\mathcal D}({\mathcal A})$. Furthermore, we establish that this decay rate is optimal. To support our theoretical findings, we present a comprehensive numerical study that validates and illustrates the sharpness of the obtained decay rates.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the elastic-viscous-plastic sea-ice model with the inviscid Voigt-regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the rigorous mathematical analysis of the elastic-viscous-plastic (EVP) sea-ice model, which was introduced in [E. C. Hunke and J. K. Dukowicz, J. Phys. Oceanogr., 27, 9 (1997), 1849-1867]. The EVP model is one of the standard and most commonly used dynamical sea-ice models. We study a regularized version of this model. In particular, we prove the global well-posedness of the EVP model with the inviscid Voigt-regularisation of the evolution equation for the stress tensor. Due to the elastic relaxation and the Voigt regularisation, we are able to handle the case of viscosity coefficients without cutoff, which has been a major issue and a setback in the computational study and analysis of the related Hibler sea-ice model, which was originally introduced in [W. D. Hibler, J. Phys. Oceanogr., 9, 4 (1979), 815-846]. The EVP model shares some structural characteristics with the Oldroyd-B model and related models for viscoelastic non-Newtonian complex fluids.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis for localized solutions in PDEs and nonlocal equations on $\mathbb{R}^m$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a general methodology for investigating the linear stability of localized solutions in PDEs and nonlocal equations on $\mathbb{R}^m$. More specifically, we control the spectrum of the Jacobian $D\mathbb{F}(\tilde{u})$ at a localized solution $\tilde{u}$, enclosing both the eigenvalues and the essential spectrum. Our approach is computer-assisted and is based on a controlled approximation of $D\mathbb{F}(\tilde{u})$ by its Fourier coefficients counterpart on a bounded domain $\Omega_d = (-d,d)^m$. We first control the spectrum of the Fourier coefficients operator combining a pseudo-diagonalization and a generalized Gershgorin disk theorem. Then, deriving explicit estimates between the problem on $\Omega_d$ and the one on $\mathbb{R}^m$, we construct disks in the complex plane enclosing the eigenvalues of $D\mathbb{F}(\tilde{u})$. Using computer-assisted analysis, the localization of the spectrum is made rigorous and fully explicit. We present applications to the establishment of stability for localized solutions in the planar Swift-Hohenberg PDE, in the planar Gray-Scott model and in the capillary-gravity Whitham equation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Cauchy problem for a quadratic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger system in dimension six. In~\cite{GaoMengXuZheng}, the authors classified the behavior of solutions under the energy constraint $E(u) &lt; E(Q)$, where $Q$ denotes the ground state. In this work, we classify the dynamics of radial solutions at the threshold energy $E(u) = E(Q)$.</description>

      <title>Regular boundary points and the Dirichlet problem for elliptic equations in double divergence form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Dirichlet problem for a second-order elliptic operator $L^*$ in double divergence form, also known as the stationary Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation. Assuming that the leading coefficients have Dini mean oscillation, we establish the equivalence between regular boundary points for the operator $L^*$ and those for the Laplace operator, as characterized by the classical Wiener criterion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the weighted eigenvalue problem for $k$-Hessian equation. To achieve this, we establish the uniform a priori estimates for gradient and second derivatives of solutions to Hessian equation with weight $|x|^{2sk}$ on the right-hand-side. We also prove that the eigenfunction is a minimizer of the corresponding functional among all $k$-admissible functions vanishing on the boundary.</description>

      <title>Traveling waves in periodic metric graphs via spatial dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to introduce a concept of traveling waves in the setting of periodic metric graphs. It is known that the nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger (NLS) equation on periodic metric graphs can be reduced asymptotically on long but finite time intervals to the homogeneous NLS equation, which admits traveling solitary wave solutions. In order to address persistence of such traveling waves beyond finite time intervals, we formulate the existence problem for traveling waves via spatial dynamics. There exist no spatially decaying (solitary) waves because of an infinite-dimensional center manifold in the spatial dynamics formulation. Existence of traveling modulating pulse solutions which are solitary waves with small oscillatory tails at very long distances from the pulse core is proven by using a local center-saddle manifold. We show that the variational formulation fails to capture existence of such modulating pulse solutions even in the singular limit of zero wave speeds where true (standing) solitary waves exist. Propagation of a traveling solitary wave and formation of a small oscillatory tail outside the pulse core is shown in numerical simulations of the NLS equation on the periodic graph.</description>

      <title>Fully discrete backward error analysis for the midpoint rule applied to the nonlinear Schroedinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of symplectic numerical schemes on Hamiltonian systems is widely known to lead to favorable long-time behaviour. While this phenomenon is thoroughly understood in the context of finite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems, much less is known in the context of Hamiltonian PDEs. In this work we provide the first dimension-independent backward error analysis for a Runge-Kutta-type method, the midpoint rule, which shows the existence of a modified energy for this method when applied to nonlinear Schroedinger equations regardless of the level of spatial discretisation. We use this to establish long-time stability of the numerical flow for the midpoint rule.</description>

      <title>Poincar{\'e}-Steklov operator and Calder{\'o}n's problem on extension domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Calder{\'o}n's problem on a class of Sobolev extension domains containing non-Lipschitz and fractal shapes. We generalize the notion of Poincar{\'e}-Steklov (Dirichlet-to-Neumann) operator for the conductivity problem on such domains. From there, we prove the stability of the direct problem for bounded conductivities continuous near the boundary. Then, we turn to the inverse problem and prove its stability at the boundary for Lipschitz conductivities, which we use to identify such conductivities on the domain from the knowledge of the Poincar{\'e}-Steklov operator. Finally, we prove the stability of the inverse problem on the domain for W^{2,$\infty$} conductivities constant near the boundary. The last two results are valid in dimension n $\ge$ 3.</description>

      <title>The Rayleigh-Taylor instability with local energy dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the inhomogeneous incompressible Euler equations including their local energy inequality as a differential inclusion. Providing a corresponding convex integration theorem and constructing subsolutions, we show the existence of locally dissipative Euler flows emanating from the horizontally flat Rayleigh-Taylor configuration and having a mixing zone which grows quadratically in time. For the Rayleigh-Taylor instability these are the first turbulently mixing solutions known to respect local energy dissipation, and outside the range of Atwood numbers considered in arXiv:2002.08843, the first weakly admissible solutions in general. In the coarse grained picture the existence relies on one-dimensional subsolutions described by a family of hyperbolic conservation laws, among which one can find the optimal background profile appearing in the scale invariant bounds from arXiv:2303.01889, and as we show, the optimal conservation law with respect to maximization of the total energy dissipation.</description>

      <title>A piston to counteract diffusion: The influence of an inward-shifting boundary on the heat equation in half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To better understand how populations respond to dynamic external pressure, we propose a new diffusion model in the moving half-line {z $\ge$ b(t)}, where the boundary position b(t) is a given nondecreasing function of time. A Robin boundary condition is imposed at z = b(t) to prevent individuals from leaving the domain, so that the shifting boundary acts as an impermeable wall-a ''piston''-that sweeps the individuals it encounters. Our analysis focuses on the cases where b(t) $\sim$ ct^$\beta$ with $\beta$ $\in$ [0, 1]. We prove quantitative convergence results characterized by attraction toward self-similar profiles, based on entropy techniques and Duhamel's principle. When $\beta$ goes through the critical value 1/2, the shape of the self-similar asymptotic profile switches from Gaussian to exponential. In particular, this profile turns out to be stationary when $\beta$ = 1, reflecting a delicate balance between diffusion and advection induced by the moving boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides the first rigorous construction of the self-similar algebraic spiral vortex sheet solutions to the 2-D incompressible Euler equations. These solutions are believed to represent the typical roll-up pattern of vortex sheets after the formation of curvature singularities. The most challenging part of this paper is to handle the Cauchy integral for the algebraic spiral curve, which falls outside the classical theory of singular integral operators.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the linear and nonlinear ill-posedness of the well-known Kelvin-Helmholtz problem of the incompressible ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations with transverse magnetic field. Our proof rigorously verifies that "the development of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, in the direction of the streaming, is uninfluenced by the presence of the magnetic field in the transverse direction" which was proposed by S.

      <title>H\"ormander oscillatory integral operators: a revisit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present new proofs for both the sharp $L^p$ estimate and the decoupling theorem for the H\"ormander oscillatory integral operator. The sharp $L^p$ estimate was previously obtained by Stein\;\cite{stein1} and Bourgain-Guth \cite{BG} via the $TT^\ast$ and multilinear methods, respectively. We provide a unified proof based on the bilinear method for both odd and even dimensions. The strategy is inspired by Barron's work \cite{Bar} on the restriction problem. The decoupling theorem for the H\"ormander oscillatory integral operator can be obtained by the approach in \cite{BHS}, where the key observation can be roughly formulated as follows: in a physical space of sufficiently small scale, the variable setting can be essentially viewed as translation-invariant. In contrast, we reprove the decoupling theorem for the H\"ormander oscillatory integral operator through the Pramanik-Seeger approximation approach \cite{PS}. Both proofs rely on a scale-dependent induction argument, which can be used to deal with perturbation terms in the phase function.</description>

      <title>Quantitative lower bound for solutions to the Boltzmann equation in non-convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we deal with the continuous mild solutions of the Boltzmann equation in a bounded space domain, either with angular cutoff or non cutoff assumption. Without assuming that the space domain is convex, we construct a Maxwellian lower bound in the cutoff case, and a weaker-than-Maxwellian lower bound in the non-cutoff case, thus extending results of \cite{Bri 1,Bri 2} in which the domain was assumed to be convex.</description>

      <title>On the strong unique continuation property for the Dirac operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [DO99,KY99], the strong unique continuation property from the origin is established for $H_{loc}^1$-solutions to the massless Dirac differential inequality $|{D}_n u | \leq \frac{C}{|x|}|u|$, in dimension $n\geq 2$ and with $C&lt;\frac12$. We show that $\frac12$ is the largest possibile constant in this result, providing an example in $\mathbb{R}^2$ of a (non-trivial) solution of the inequality. Also, we show properties of unique continuation from the origin for solutions to the inequality $|D_n u | \leq \frac{C}{ |x|^{\gamma}}|u|$, for $\gamma&gt;1$, $C&gt;0$. Finally, we establish the strong unique continuation property for the Dirac operator from the point at infinity.</description>

      <title>On quasi-Minnaert resonances in elasticity and their applications to stress concentrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper unveils and investigates a novel quasi-Minnaert resonance for an elastic hard inclusion embedded in a soft homogeneous medium in the sub-wavelength regime. The quasi-Minnaert resonance consists of boundary localization and surface resonance for the generated internal total and external scattered wave fields associated with the hard inclusion. It possesses similar quantitative behaviours as those for the classical Minnaert resonance due to high-contrast material structures, but occurs for a continuous spectrum of frequencies instead of certain discrete Minnaert resonant frequencies. We present a comprehensive analysis to uncover the physical origin and the mechanism of this new physical phenomenon. It is shown that the delicate high-contrast material structures and the properly tailored incident waves which are coupled together in a subtle manner play a crucial role in ensuring such phenomena. The stress concentration phenomena in both the internal total field and the scattered field components are also rigorously established. The analysis in this paper is deeply rooted in layer potential theory and intricate asymptotic analysis. We believe that our findings can have a significant impact on the theory of composite materials and metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness in the critical Besov space of the skew mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{R}^d: d\geq 4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are devoted to studying the global regularity for the skew mean curvature flow with small initial data in $\mathbb{R}^d\, (d\geq 4)$. By using a new div-curl lemma which was first introduced by the third author to establish a bilinear estimate, and also the interaction Morawetz estimate, the global well-posedness for the skew mean curvature flow in the critical Besov space is established, and hence the corresponding result obtained by Huang, Li and Tataru (Int. Math. Res. Not. 2024, no. 5, 3748-3798) is substantially improved.</description>

      <title>The Li-Lin's open problem on $\mathbb{R}^N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2012, Y.Y. Li and C.-S. Lin (Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 203(3): 943-968) posed an open problem concerning the existence of positive solutions to the elliptic equation $$
  \begin{cases}
  -\Delta u = -\lambda |x|^{-s_1}|u|^{p-2}u + |x|^{-s_2}|u|^{q-2}u &amp; \text{in } \Omega,
  u = 0 &amp; \text{on } \partial \Omega,
  \end{cases} $$ for $\lambda &gt; 0$, $p &gt; q = 2^*(s_2)$, $0 \leq s_1 &lt; s_2 &lt; 2$, and $2^*(s) = \frac{2(N-s)}{N-2}$ denotes the Hardy-Sobolev critical exponent, initially studied in bounded domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$, $N \geq 3$. Currently, research on this open problem remains limited, and a complete resolution is still far from being achieved.
  Motivated by the need to address this open problem in more general settings, we extend our investigation to the entire space $\mathbb{R}^N$, focusing on the equation $$ -\Delta u + u = -\lambda |x|^{-s_1}|u|^{p-2}u + |x|^{-s_2}|u|^{q-2}u \quad \text{in } \mathbb{R}^N. $$
  Our analysis reveals stark contrasts between bounded and unbounded domains: in $\mathbb{R}^N$, the equation admits no solution when $q = 2^*(s_2)$ for any $\lambda &gt; 0$, whereas a positive solution exists when $q &lt; 2^*(s_2)$.
  To establish these results, we employ the Nehari manifold method; however, the functional's unboundedness from below on the manifold causes standard global minimization techniques to be inapplicable. Instead, we characterize a local minimizer of the energy functional on the Nehari manifold, overcoming the challenge posed by the lack of a global minimizer.</description>

      <title>Fujita exponent for the fractional sub-Laplace semilinear heat equation with forcing term on the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the semilinear heat equation with a forcing term, driven by the fractional sub-Laplacian (-\Delta_{\mathbbm{H}^N})^s of order $s\in (0,1),$ on the Heisenberg group $\mathbbm{H}^N$. We establish that the Fujita exponent, a critical threshold that delimits different dynamical regimes of this equation, is $$p_F\coloneqq\frac{Q}{Q-2s},$$ where $Q\coloneqq 2N+2$ is the homogeneous dimension of $\mathbbm{H}^N$. We prove the existence of global-in-time solutions for the supercritical case $(p&gt;p_F),$ and the non-existence of global-in-time solutions for the subcritical case $(1&lt;p&lt;p_F).$ For the critical case $p=p_F,$ we provide a class of functions for which the solution blows up in finite time. These results extend the classical Fujita phenomenon to a sub-Riemannian setting with the nonlocal effects of the fractional sub-Laplacian. Our proof methods intertwine analytic techniques with the geometric structure of the Heisenberg group.</description>

      <title>m-accretive extensions of Friedrichs operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of abstract Friedrichs operators in 2007-an operator-theoretic framework for studying classical Friedrichs operators has led to significant developments in the field, including results on well-posedness, multiplicity, and classification. More recently, the von Neumann extension theory has been explored in this context, along with connections between abstract Friedrichs operators and skew-symmetric operators.
  In this work, we show that all m-accretive extensions of abstract Friedrichs operators correspond precisely to those satisfying (V)-boundary conditions. We also establish a connection between the m-accretive extensions of abstract Friedrichs operators and their skew-symmetric components. Additionally, the three equivalent formulations of boundary conditions are unified within a single interpretive framework. To conclude, we discuss a constructive relation between (V)- and (M)-boundary conditions and examine the multiplicity of the associated M-operators. We demonstrate our results on two examples, namely, the first order ordinary differential equation on an interval, with various boundary conditions, and the second-order elliptic partial differential equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Vector valued optimal transport: from dynamic to static formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in classification of vector valued measures and multispecies PDE, we develop a theory that unifies existing notions of vector valued optimal transport, from dynamic formulations (\`a la Benamou-Brenier) to static formulations (\`a la Kantorovich). In our framework, vector valued measures are modeled as probability measures on a product space $\mathbb{R}^d \times G$, where $G$ is a weighted graph over a finite set of nodes and the graph geometry strongly influences the associated dynamic and static distances. We obtain sharp inequalities relating four notions of vector valued optimal transport and prove that the distances are mutually bi-H\"older equivalent. We discuss the theoretical and practical advantages of each metric and indicate potential applications in multispecies PDE and data analysis. In particular, one of the static formulations discussed in the paper is amenable to linearization, a technique that has been explored in recent years to accelerate the computation of pairwise optimal transport distances.</description>

      <title>The Magnetic Laplacian with a Higher-order Vanishing Magnetic Field in a Bounded Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with spectrum properties of the magnetic Laplacian with a higher-order vanishing magnetic field in a bounded domain. We study the asymptotic behaviors of ground state energies for the Dirichlet Laplacian, the Neumann Laplacian, and the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, as the field strength parameter $\beta$ goes to infinite. Assume that the magnetic field does not vanish to infinite order, we establish the leading orders of $\beta$. We also obtain the first terms in the asymptotic expansions with remainder estimates under additional assumptions on an invariant subspace for a Taylor polynomial of the magnetic field. Our aim is to provide a unified approach to all three cases.</description>

      <title>$Q$-functions, synchronization, and Arnold tongues for coupled stochastic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase reduction is an effective theoretical and numerical tool for studying synchronization of coupled deterministic oscillators. Stochastic oscillators require new definitions of asymptotic phase. The $Q$-function, i.e. the slowest decaying complex mode of the stochastic Koopman operator (SKO), was proposed as a means of phase reduction for stochastic oscillators. In this paper, we show that the $Q$-function approach also leads to a novel definition of ``synchronization" for coupled stochastic oscillators. A system of coupled oscillators in the synchronous regime may be viewed as a single (higher-dimensional) oscillator. Therefore, we investigate the relation between the $Q$-functions of the uncoupled oscillators and the higher-dimensional $Q$-function for the coupled system. We propose a definition of synchronization between coupled stochastic oscillators in terms of the eigenvalue spectrum of Kolmogorov's backward operator (the generator of the Markov process, or the SKO) of the higher dimensional coupled system. We observe a novel type of bifurcation reflecting (i) the relationship between the leading eigenvalues of the SKO for the coupled system and (ii) qualitative changes in the cross-spectral density of the coupled oscillators. Using our proposed definition, we observe synchronization domains for symmetrically-coupled stochastic oscillators that are analogous to Arnold tongues for coupled deterministic oscillators.</description>

      <title>Hidden symmetries, hidden conservation laws and exact solutions of dispersionless Nizhnik equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among Lie submodels of the (real symmetric potential) dispersionless Nizhnik equation, we single out a remarkable submodel as such that, despite being the only one, is associated with a family of in general inequivalent one-dimensional subalgebras of the maximal Lie invariance algebra of this equation, which are parameterized by an arbitrary function of the time variable. The wide family of invariant solutions of the dispersionless Nizhnik equation that are related to the above submodel is expressed in terms of an arbitrary function of the time variable and the double quadrature of the well-known (implicit) general solution of the inviscid Burgers equation with respect to a space-like submodel invariant variable. The singled out submodel possesses many other interesting properties. In particular, we show that it is Lie-remarkable, and its maximal Lie invariance algebra completely defines its point symmetry pseudogroup, which provides the second but simpler example of the latter phenomenon in literature. Moreover, only hidden Lie symmetries of the dispersionless Nizhnik equation that are associated with this submodel are essential for finding its exact solutions. Using Lie reductions, we construct new families of exact solutions of the inviscid Burgers equation and the dispersionless Nizhnik equation in closed or parametric form. We also exhaustively described generalized symmetries, cosymmetries and conservation laws of the submodel, which gives the corresponding nonlocal and hidden structures for the inviscid Burgers equation and the dispersionless Nizhnik equation, respectively.</description>

      <title>Layer Potential Methods for Doubly-Periodic Harmonic Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop and analyze layer potential methods to represent harmonic functions on finitely-connected tori (i.e., doubly-periodic harmonic functions). The layer potentials are expressed in terms of a doubly-periodic and non-harmonic Green's function that can be explicitly written in terms of the Jacobi theta function or a modified Weierstrass sigma function. Extending results for finitely-connected Euclidean domains, we prove that the single- and double-layer potential operators are compact linear operators and derive relevant limiting properties at the boundary. We show that when the boundary has more than one connected component, the Fredholm operator of the second kind associated with the double-layer potential operator has a non-trivial null space, which can be explicitly constructed. Finally, we apply our developed theory to obtain solutions to the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems, as well as the Steklov eigenvalue problem. We implement the developed methods using Nystr\"om discretization and find approximate solutions for these problems in several numerical examples. Our method avoids a lattice sum of the free space Green's function, is shown to be spectrally convergent, and has a faster convergence rate than the method of particular solutions for problems on tori with irregularly shaped holes.</description>

Abstract: We consider the linear field-road system, a model for fast diffusion channels in population dynamics and ecology. This system takes the form of a system of PDEs set on domains of different dimensions, with exchange boundary conditions. Despite the intricate geometry of the problem, we provide an explicit expression for its fundamental solution and for the solution to the associated Cauchy problem. The main tool is a Fourier (on the road variable)/Laplace (on time) transform. In addition, we derive estimates for the decay rate of the $L^{\infty}$ norm of these solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes the construction of a coercive ISS-Lyapunov functional for linear regular infinite-dimensional system. Indeed, as already known, Lyapunov functionals for infinite-dimensional systems might be not coercive. Under the assumption that there exists an exactly observable output, we are able to make coercive a Lyapunov functional which is not coercive under additional regularity assumption. We discuss also about the potential applications of such a Lyapunov functional in singular perturbation theory and output regulation. The results are illustrated on a non-trivial equation, namely, the Korteweg-de Vries equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12336v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the global dynamics of the collision of two solitons having the same mass for one-dimensional Nonlinear Schr\"odinger models with multi-power nonlinearity. For any natural number k, it is verified that if the incoming speed v between the two solitary waves is small enough, then, after the collision, the two solitons will move away with an outcoming speed v_{f}=v+O(v^{k}) and the remainder of the solution will also have energy and weighted norms of order O(v^{k}). This is applied to the one-dimensional models with polynomial odd nonlinearity having a stable soliton such as the cubic NLS and the cubic-quintic NLS.</description>

      <title>Strategic geometric graphs through mean field games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exploit the structure of geometric graphs on Riemannian manifolds to analyze strategic dynamic graphs at the limit, when the number of nodes tends to infinity. This framework allows to preserve intrinsic geometrical information about the limiting graph structure, such as the Ollivier curvature. After introducing the setting, we derive a mean field game system, which models a strategic equilibrium between the nodes. It has the usual structure with the distinction of being set on a manifold. Finally, we establish existence and uniqueness of solutions to the system when the Hamiltonian is quadratic for a class of non-necessarily compact Riemannian manifolds, referred to as manifolds of bounded geometry.</description>

      <title>Almost conservation of the harmonic actions for fully discretized nonlinear Klein--Gordon equations at low regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Close to the origin, the nonlinear Klein--Gordon equations on the circle are nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems which have infinitely many almost conserved quantities called harmonic actions or super-actions. We prove that, at low regularity and with a CFL number of size 1, this property is preserved if we discretize the nonlinear Klein--Gordon equations with the symplectic mollified impulse methods. This extends previous results of D. Cohen, E. Hairer and C. Lubich to non-smooth solutions.</description>

      <title>A Non-Conservative, Non-Local Approximation of the Burgers Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of non-local regularisations of scalar conservation laws is an active research program. Applications of such equations are found in the modelling of physical phenomena such as traffic flow. In this paper, we propose a novel inviscid, non-local regularisation in non-divergence form. The salient feature of our approach is that we can obtain sharp a priori estimates on the total variation and supremum norm, and justify the singular limit for Lipschitz initial data up to the time of catastrophe. For generic conservation laws, this result is sharp, since we can demonstrate non-convergence when the initial data features simple discontinuities. Conservation laws with linear flux derivative, such as the Burgers equation, behave better in the presence of discontinuities. Hence, we devote special attention to the limiting behaviour of non-local solutions with respect to the Burgers equation for a simple class of discontinuous initial data.</description>

      <title>Parabolic-scalings on large-time behavior of the incompressible Navier--Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through asymptotic expansion, the large-time behavior of incompressible Navier--Stokes flow in $n$-dimensional whole space is depicted. Especially, from their parabolic scalings, large-time behaviors of any terms on the expansion are clarified. The parabolic scalings also guarantee the uniqueness of the expansion. In the preceding work, the expansion with the $n$th order has already been derived. They also predicted that the flow has some logarithmic evolutions in higher-order decay. In this paper, an asymptotic expansion with $2n$th order is presented. Furthermore, logarithmic evolutions are discovered.</description>

      <title>On a 1d nonlocal transport of the incompressible porous media equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Kiselev and Sarsam proposed the following nonlocal transport equation as a one-dimensional analogue of the 2D incompressible porous media (IPM) equation \begin{eqnarray*} \partial_t\rho+u\partial_x\rho= 0,~u=gH_a\rho, \end{eqnarray*} where the transform $H_a$ is defined by \begin{eqnarray*} H_af(x)=\frac{1}{\pi}P.V.\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}}\frac{a^2f(y)}{(x-y)((x-y)^2+a^2)}dy. \end{eqnarray*} In the preprint [Kiselev-Sarsam, arXiv:2412.16376], the authors proved the local well-posedness for this 1D periodic IPM model as well as finite time blow-up for a class of smooth initial data. In this paper, we present several new weighted inequalities for the transform $H_a$ in the setting of the real line. Based on these integral inequalities, we also prove the finite time blow-up for this 1D IPM model on the real line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09872v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a conformal metric with finite total Q-curvature, we show that the assumptions on scalar curvature sensitively govern the Q-curvature integral. Additionally, we introduce a conformal mass for such manifolds. Using such mass, we provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the metric to be normal without assuming metric completeness. As applications, we derive volume comparison theorems and prove a positive mass type theorem related to Q-curvature.</description>

      <title>On turbulence for spacetimes with stable trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by understanding the nonlinear gravitational dynamics of spacetimes admitting stably trapped null geodesics, such as ultracompact objects and black string solutions to general relativity, we explore the dynamics of nonlinear scalar waves on a simple (fixed) model geometry with stable trapping. More specifically, we consider the time evolution of solutions to the cubic (defocusing) wave equation on a four-dimensional static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically flat (horizonless) spacetime admitting a stable photon sphere.
  Our study shows fundamental differences between linear and nonlinear scalar dynamics. The local energy, as well as all local higher-order energies, of solutions to the linear wave equation on our model spacetime can be rigorously proven to remain uniformly bounded and to decay uniformly in time. However, due to the presence of stable trapping, the uniform decay rate is slow. To help elucidate how the slow linear decay affects solutions to the nonlinear wave equation considered, we examine numerical solutions of the latter, restricting to axisymmetric initial data in this work. In contrast to the linear dynamics, we exhibit a family of nonlinear solutions with turbulent behaviour: Within the region of stable trapping, the slow linear decay allows local higher-order energies of the nonlinear solution to grow over the time interval that we numerically evolve, with the growth being induced by a direct energy cascade.
  As a complement to the numerical analysis, we provide a heuristic argument suggesting that, if a similar behaviour occurs for gravitational wave perturbations of the motivating spacetimes in general relativity, it would likely not generically lead to black hole or singularity formation.</description>
