      <title>Similarity Learning with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a neural network algorithm designed to automatically identify similarity relations from data. By uncovering these similarity relations, our network approximates the underlying physical laws that relate dimensionless quantities to their dimensionless variables and coefficients. Additionally, we develop a linear algebra framework, accompanied by code, to derive the symmetry groups associated with these similarity relations. While our approach is general, we illustrate its application through examples in fluid mechanics, including laminar Newtonian and non-Newtonian flows in smooth pipes, as well as turbulent flows in both smooth and rough pipes. Such examples are chosen to highlight the framework's capability to handle both simple and intricate cases, and further validates its effectiveness in discovering underlying physical laws from data.</description>

      <title>Efficient representation learning of scintillation signal characteristics with spectrum-inspired temporal neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear radiation detectors based on scintillators are widely used in particle and high energy physics experiments, nuclear medicine imaging, industrial and environmental detection, etc. Precisely extracting scintillation signal characteristics at the event level is important for these applications, not only in respect of understanding the scintillator itself, but also kinds and physical property of incident particles. Recent researches demonstrate data-driven neural networks are superior to traditional statistical methods, especially when the analytical form of signals is hard to obtain, or noise is significant. However, most densely connected or convolution-based networks fail to fully exploit the spectral and temporal structure of scintillation signals, leaving large space for performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a network architecture specially tailored for scintillation signal characterization based on previous works on time series analysis. By directly applying Fast Fourier Transform on original signals without data embedding, including the zero-frequency component, adjusting convolution scheme for low-frequency components, and unbiasedly re-weighting features from different frequencies, the proposed network architecture can serve as a lightweight and enhanced representation learning backbone. We prove our idea on simulation data generated with the setting of the LUX dark matter detector, and on experimental electrical signals with fast electronics to emulate scintillation variations. The proposed model achieves significantly better results than the reference model in literature and densely connected models without representation learning.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Summary Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a way to capture high-information posteriors from training sets that are sparsely sampled over the parameter space for robust simulation-based inference. In physical inference problems, we can often apply domain knowledge to define traditional summary statistics to capture some of the information in a dataset. We show that augmenting these statistics with neural network outputs to maximise the mutual information improves information extraction compared to neural summaries alone or their concatenation to existing summaries and makes inference robust in settings with low training data. We introduce 1) two loss formalisms to achieve this and 2) apply the technique to two different cosmological datasets to extract non-Gaussian parameter information.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of network dynamics from partial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the reconstruction of time series from dynamical networks that are partially observed. In particular, we address the extent to which the time series at a node of the network can be successfully reconstructed when measuring from another node, or subset of nodes, corrupted by observational noise. We will assume the dynamical equations of the network are known, and that the dynamics are not necessarily low-dimensional. The case of linear dynamics is treated first, and leads to a definition of observation error magnification factor (OEMF) that measures the magnification of noise in the reconstruction process. Subsequently, the definition is applied to nonlinear and chaotic dynamics. Comparison of OEMF for different target/observer combinations can lead to better understanding of how to optimally observe a network. As part of the study, a computational method for reconstructing time series from partial observations is presented and analyzed.</description>
