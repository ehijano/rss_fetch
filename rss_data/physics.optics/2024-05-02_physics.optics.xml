      <title>Laser Pulse Induced Second- and Third-Harmonic Generation of Gold Nanorods with Real-Time Time-Dependent Density Functional Tight Binding (RT-TDDFTB) Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate second- and third-harmonic generation processes in Au nanorod systems using the real-time time-dependent density functional tight binding (RT-TDDFTB) method. Our study focuses on computation of nonlinear signals based on the time dependent dipole response induced by linearly polarized laser pulses interacting with nanoparticles. We systematically explore the influence of various laser parameters, including pump intensity, duration, frequency, and polarization directions, on the harmonic generation. We demonstrate all the results using Au nanorod dimer systems arranged in end-to-end configurations, and disrupting the spatial symmetry of regular single nanorod systems crucial for second harmonic generation processes. Furthermore, we study the impact of nanorod lengths, which lead to variable plasmon energies, on the harmonic generation, and estimates of polarizabilities and hyper-polarizabilities are provided.</description>

      <title>Excitation-Dependent Features and Artifacts in 2-D Terahertz Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, two-dimensional terahertz spectroscopy (2DTS) has attracted increasing attention for studying complex solids. A number of recent studies have applied 2DTS either with long pulses or away from any material resonances, situations that yield unconventional 2DTS spectra that are often difficult to interpret. Here, we clarify the generic origins of observed spectral features by examining 2DTS spectra of ZnTe, a model system with a featureless optical susceptibility at low terahertz frequencies. These results also reveal possible artifacts that may arise from electro-optic sampling in collinear 2DTS experiments, including the observation of spurious rectified or second harmonic signals.</description>

      <title>Synchronization Dynamics in the Spatial Evolution of Optical Power in Optical Oligomer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigated the spatial evolution of optical power in a closed-form optical waveguide configuration consisting of six passive waveguides and each of the waveguides exhibits equal strength of Kerr nonlinearity. We considered only nearest neighbor interaction between the waveguides. We found that in the case of low Kerr nonlinearity, evolution of optical power shows synchronization behavior. But when we increased the strength of Kerr nonlinearity, we discovered that spatial evolution of optical power in all waveguides shows independent characteristics. On the other hand, we have studied the impact of the coupling constant on the synchronization dynamics of our system. Our findings showed us that strong coupling can strengthen the collective dynamics in the presence of strong Kerr nonlinearity. From our results, we can conclude that Kerr nonlinearity in our system plays the role of disorder parameter that destroys as well as alters the synchronization behavior of evolution of optical power in the waveguides and coupling constant plays the role of an antagonist and restores synchronization in the model.</description>

      <title>Collective nature of high-Q resonances in finite-size photonic metastructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study high quality-factor (high Q) resonances supported by periodic arrays of Mie resonators from the perspectives of both Bloch wave theory and multiple scattering theory. We reveal that, unlike a common belief, the bound states in the continuum (BICs) derived by the Bloch-wave theory do not directly determine the resonance with the highest Q value in large but finite arrays. Higher Q factors appear to be associated with collective resonances formed by nominally guided modes below the light line associated with strong effect of both electric and magnetic multipoles. Our findings offer valuable insights into accessing the modes with higher Q resonances via bonding modes within finite metastructures. Our results underpin the pivotal significance of magnetic and electric multipoles in the design of resonant metadevices and nonlocal flat-band optics. Moreover, our demonstrations reveal that coupled arrays of high-Q microcavities do not inherently result in a stronger light-matter interaction when compared to coupled low-Q nanoresonators. This result emphasizes the critical importance of the study of multiple light-scattering effects in cavity-based systems.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Noise Quenching of An Integrated Frequency Comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated frequency combs promise transformation of lab-based metrology into disruptive real-world applications. These microcombs are, however, sensitive to stochastic thermal fluctuations of the integrated cavity refractive index, with its impact becoming more significant as the cavity size becomes smaller. This tradeoff between microcomb noise performance and footprint stands as a prominent obstacle to realizing applications beyond a controlled lab environment. Here, we demonstrate that small footprint and low noise become compatible through the all-optical Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) method. Our study unveils that the phase-locking nature of the synchronization between the cavity soliton and the injected reference pump laser enables the microcomb to no longer be limited by internal noise sources. Instead, the microcomb noise is mostly limited by external sources, namely, the frequency noise of the two pumps that doubly pin the microcomb. First, we theoretically and experimentally show that the individual comb tooth linewidths of an octave-spanning microcomb remain within the same order-of-magnitude as the pump lasers, contrary to the single-pumped case that exhibits a more than two order-of-magnitude increase from the pump to the comb edge. Second, we theoretically show that intrinsic noise sources such as thermorefractive noise in KIS are quenched at the cavity decay rate, greatly decreasing its impact. Experimentally, we show that even with free-running lasers, the KIS microcomb can exhibit better repetition rate noise performance than the predicted thermorefractive noise limitation in absence of KIS.</description>

      <title>High-gain far-detuned nonlinear frequency conversion in optical fibers: intramodal vs. intermodal processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present theoretical and experimental evidence of high-gain far-detuned nonlinear frequency conversion, extending towards both the visible and the mid-infrared, in a few-mode graded-index silica fiber pumped at 1.064 $\mu$m, and more specifically achieving gains of hundreds of dB per meter below 0.65 $\mu$m and beyond 3.5 $\mu$m. Our findings highlight the potential of graded-index fibers in terms of strong modal confinement over an ultrabroad spectral range for enabling high-gain wavelength conversion. Such advancements require an accurate interpretation of intramodal and intermodal four-wave mixing processes.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of frequency downconverted arm length stabilization for a future upgraded gravitational wave detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors consist of complex multiple optical cavity systems. An arm-length stabilization (ALS) system has played an important role in bringing such complex detector into operational state and enhance the duty cycle. The sensitivity of these detectors can be improved if the thermal noise of their test mass mirror coatings is reduced. Crystalline AlGaAs coatings are a promising candidate for this. However, traditional ALS system with frequency-doubled 532 nm light is no longer an option with AlGaAs coatings due to the narrow bandgap of GaAs, thus alternative locking schemes must be developed. In this letter, we describe an experimental demonstration of a novel ALS scheme which is compatible with AlGaAs coatings. This ALS scheme will enable the use of AlGaAs coatings and contribute to improved sensitivity of future detectors.</description>

      <title>Topological Corner Modes by Composite Wannier States in Glide-Symmetric Photonic Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Second-order topological insulators can be characterized by their bulk polarization, which is believed to be intrinsically connected to the center of the Wannier function. In this study, we demonstrate the existence of second-order topological insulators that feature a pair of partially degenerate photonic bands. These arise from the nonsymmorphic glide symmetry in an all-dielectric photonic crystal. The center of the maximally localized Wannier function (MLWF) is consistently located at the origin but is not equivalent with respect to the sum of constituent polarizations. As a result, topological corner modes can be identified by the distinctly hybridized MLWFs that truncate at the sample boundary. Through full-wave numerical simulations paired with microwave experiments, the second-order topology is clearly confirmed and characterized. These topological corner states exhibit notably unique modal symmetries, which are made possible by the inversion of the Wannier bands. Our results provide an alternative approach to explore higher-order topological physics with significant potential for applications in integrated and quantum photonics.</description>

      <title>Evidence of 1+1D photorefractive stripe solitons deep in the Kerr limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kerr nonlinearity allows for exact analytic soliton solutions in 1+1D. While nothing excludes that these solitons form in naturally-occurring real-world 3D settings as solitary walls or stripes, their observation has previously been considered unfeasible because of the strong transverse instability intrinsic to the extended nonlinear perturbation. We report the observation of solitons that are fully compatible with the 1+1D Kerr paradigm limit hosted in a 2+1D system. The waves are stripe spatial solitons in bulk copper doped potassium-lithium-tantalate-niobate (KLTN) supported by the unsaturated photorefractive screening nonlinearity. The parameters of the stripe solitons fit well, in the whole existence domain, with the 1+1D existence curve that we derive for the first time in closed form starting from the saturable model of propagation. Transverse instability, that accompanies the solitons embedded in the 3D system, is found to have a gain length much longer than the crystal. Findings establish our system as a versatile platform for investigating exact soliton solutions in bulk settings and in exploring the role of dimensionality at the transition from integrable to non-integrable regimes of propagation.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum gain by electrons under action of intense structured light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of light waves interaction with charged particles becomes more and more complex starting with the case of plane waves, where the analytical solution is well known, to more natural, though more complicated situations which include focused or structured laser beams. Internal structure may introduce a new degree of freedom and qualitatively change the dynamics of interacting particles. For certain conditions, namely for the dilute plasma, description of single-particle dynamics in the focused structured laser beams is the first step and may serve as a good approximation on the way of understanding the global plasma response. Moreover, the general problem of integrability in complex systems starts from consideration of the integrals of motion for a single particle. The primary goal of this work is an understanding of the physics of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) absorption by a single particle in a focused structured light. A theoretical model of the process, including solutions of Maxwell equations with the required accuracy and a high-order perturbative approach to electron motion in external electromagnetic fields, is developed and its predictions are examined with numerical simulations for several exemplary electromagnetic field configurations. In particular, it was found that for the particles distributed initially with the azimuthal symmetry around the beam propagation direction, the transferred OAM has a smallness of the fourth order of the applied field amplitude, and requires an accurate consideration of the temporal laser pulse envelope.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the classical dynamics of a system of a pair of Kerr-Duffing nonlinear oscillators coupled by a nonlinear interaction and subject to a parametric drive. Within a rotating wave approximation (RWA), we analyze the steady-state solutions for the oscillation amplitude of the two oscillators. In the most relevant case of identical oscillators, we separately investigate configurations in which only one oscillator is parametrically driven, or both of them are simultaneously driven. In the latter regime, special attention is paid to the symmetric case where the parametric drives acting on the two oscillators are equal: for an increasing value of the detuning of the parametric drive, a transition to a multi-stable, symmetry-breaking regime is found, where the two oscillators display different oscillation amplitudes and phases.</description>

Abstract: We observe strongly anisotropic third-harmonic generation mediated by resonant sum-frequency driving of Raman phonons with THz light, extending light-induced dual control of structural and optical properties in solids. Either strong enhancement or strong suppression of the third harmonic covering six orders of magnitude can be achieved, a result of interference between purely electronic and phonon-mediated contributions to the polarization field. These findings enrich capabilities for tailoring nonlinear optics via phononics and for the spectroscopy of crystalline structural dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving area of integrated photonics, there is a growing need for materials that satisfy the particular requirements of increasingly complex and specialized devices and applications. Present photonic material platforms have made significant progress over the past years; however, each platform still faces specific material and performance challenges. We introduce a novel material for integrated photonics: Aluminum Gallium Nitride (AlGaN) on Aluminum Nitride (AlN) as a platform for developing reconfigurable and nonlinear on-chip optical systems. AlGaN combines compatibility with standard semiconductor fabrication technologies, high electro-optic modulation capabilities, and large nonlinear coefficients while providing a broad and low-loss spectral transmission range, making it a viable material for advanced photonic applications. In this work, we design and grow AlGaN/AlN heterostructures and integrate fundamental photonic building blocks into these chips. In particular, we fabricate edge couplers, low-loss waveguides, directional couplers, and tunable high-quality factor ring resonators to enable nonlinear light-matter interaction and quantum functionality. The comprehensive platform we present in this work paves the way for nonlinear photon-pair generation applications, on-chip nonlinear quantum frequency conversion, and fast electro-optic modulation for switching and routing classical and quantum light fields.</description>

      <title>Near-field Spin Chern Number Quantized by Real-space Topology of Optical Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Chern number has been widely used to describe the topological properties of periodic structures in the momentum space. Here, we introduce a real-space spin Chern number for the optical near fields of finite-sized structures. This new spin Chern number is intrinsically quantized and equal to the structure's Euler characteristic. The relationship is robust against continuous deformation of the structure's geometry and is irrelevant to the specific material constituents or external excitation. Our work enriches topological physics by extending the concept of Chern number to the real space, opening exciting possibilities for exploring the real-space topological properties of light.</description>

      <title>Coordinate-based neural representations for computational adaptive optics in widefield microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Widefield microscopy is widely used for non-invasive imaging of biological structures at subcellular resolution. When applied to complex specimen, its image quality is degraded by sample-induced optical aberration. Adaptive optics can correct wavefront distortion and restore diffraction-limited resolution but require wavefront sensing and corrective devices, increasing system complexity and cost. Here, we describe a self-supervised machine learning algorithm, CoCoA, that performs joint wavefront estimation and three-dimensional structural information extraction from a single input 3D image stack without the need for external training dataset. We implemented CoCoA for widefield imaging of mouse brain tissues and validated its performance with direct-wavefront-sensing-based adaptive optics. Importantly, we systematically explored and quantitatively characterized the limiting factors of CoCoA's performance. Using CoCoA, we demonstrated the first in vivo widefield mouse brain imaging using machine-learning-based adaptive optics. Incorporating coordinate-based neural representations and a forward physics model, the self-supervised scheme of CoCoA should be applicable to microscopy modalities in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emitters in high refractive index materials like 4H-SiC suffer from reduced detection of photons because of losses caused by total internal reflection. Thus, integration into efficient nanophotonic structures which couple the emission of photons to a well defined waveguide mode can significantly enhance the photon detection efficiency. In addition, interfacing this waveguide to a classical fiber network is of similar importance to detect the photons and perform experiments. Here, we show a waveguide fiber interface in SiC. By careful measurements we determine efficiencies exceeding 93 % for the transfer of photons from SiC nanobeams to fibers. We use this interface to create a bright single photon source based on waveguide integrated V2 defects in 4H-SiC and achieve an overall photon count rate of 181 kilo-counts per second. We observe and quantify the strain induced shift of the ground state spin states and demonstrate coherent control of the electron spin with a coherence time of T2=42.5 $\rm\mu$s.</description>

Abstract: Nonlinear quantum photonics serves as a cornerstone in photonic quantum technologies, such as universal quantum computing and quantum communications. The emergence of integrated photonics platform not only offers the advantage of large-scale manufacturing but also provides a variety of engineering methods. Given the complexity of integrated photonics engineering, a comprehensive simulation framework is essential to fully harness the potential of the platform. In this context, we introduce a nonlinear quantum photonics simulation framework which can accurately model a variety of features such as adiabatic waveguide, material anisotropy, linear optics components, photon losses, and detectors. Furthermore, utilizing the framework, we have developed a device scheme, chip-scale temporal walk-off compensation, that is useful for various quantum information processing tasks. Applying the simulation framework, we show that the proposed device scheme can enhance the squeezing parameter of photon-pair sources and the conversion efficiency of quantum frequency converters without relying on higher pump power.</description>

      <title>Topological photon pumping in quantum optical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05570</link>

Abstract: We establish the concept of topological pumping in one-dimensional systems with long-range interactions and apply it to the transport of a photon in quantum optical systems. In our theoretical investigation, we introduce an extended version of the Rice-Mele model with all-to-all exchange interactions. By analyzing its properties, we identify the general conditions for topological pumping and demonstrate the topologically protected and dispersionless transport of a photon on a one-dimensional emitter chain. As concrete examples, we investigate three different popular quantum optics platforms, namely Rydberg atom lattices, dense lattices of atoms excited to low-lying electronic states, and atoms coupled to waveguides, using experimentally relevant parameters. We observe that despite the long-ranged character of the dipole-dipole interactions, topological pumping facilitates the transport of a photon with a fidelity per cycle which can reach 99.9%. Moreover, we find that the photon pumping process remains topologically protected against local disorder in the coupling rates.</description>
