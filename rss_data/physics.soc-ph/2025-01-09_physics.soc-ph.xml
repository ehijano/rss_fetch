      <title>Fluctuation induced intermittent transitions between distinct rhythms in balanced excitatory-inhibitory spiking networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermittent transitions, associated with critical dynamics and characterized by power-law distributions, are commonly observed during sleep. These critical behaviors are evident at the microscopic level through neuronal avalanches and at the macroscopic level through transitions between sleep stages. To clarify these empirical observations, models grounded in statistical physics have been proposed. At the mesoscopic level of cortical activity, critical behavior is indicated by the intermittent transitions between various cortical rhythms. For instance, empirical investigations utilizing EEG data from rats have identified intermittent transitions between $\delta$ and $\theta$ rhythms, with the duration of $\theta$ rhythm exhibiting a power-law distribution. However, a dynamic model to account for this phenomenon is currently absent. In this study, we introduce a network of sparsely coupled excitatory and inhibitory populations of quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons to demonstrate that intermittent transitions can emerge from the intrinsic fluctuations of a finite-sized system, particularly when the system is positioned near a Hopf bifurcation point, which is a critical point. The resulting power-law distributions and exponents are consistent with empirical observations. Additionally, we illustrate how modifications in network connectivity can affect the power-law exponent by influencing the attractivity and oscillation frequency of the stable limit cycle. Our findings, interpreted through the fundamental dynamics of neuronal networks, provide a plausible mechanism for the generation of intermittent transitions between cortical rhythms, in alignment with the power-law distributions documented in empirical researches.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations in the email size modeled by a log-normal-like distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A previously established frequency distribution model combining a log-normal distribution with a logarithmic equation describes fluctuations in the email size during send requests. Although the frequency distribution fit was considered satisfactory, the underlying mechanism driving this distribution remains inadequately explained. To address this gap, this study introduced a novel email-send model that characterizes the sending process as an exponential function modulated by noise from a normal distribution. This model is consistent with both the observed frequency distribution and the previously proposed frequency distribution model.</description>

      <title>Traits of a Leader: User Influence Level Prediction through Sociolinguistic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognition of a user's influence level has attracted much attention as human interactions move online. Influential users have the ability to sway others' opinions to achieve some goals. As a result, predicting users' level of influence can help to understand social networks, forecast trends, prevent misinformation, etc. However, predicting user influence is a challenging problem because the concept of influence is specific to a situation or a domain, and user communications are limited to text. In this work, we define user influence level as a function of community endorsement and develop a model that significantly outperforms the baseline by leveraging demographic and personality data. This approach consistently improves RankDCG scores across eight different domains.</description>

      <title>Postsingular Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04111v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents, for the first time, a conceptual and formal model of postsingular science (PSS), which analyses and interprets changes in scientific knowledge driven by accelerating technological progress, singularity, and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into scientific processes. The PSS model is based on the interplay of six key components: cumulative knowledge, intelligence, technological synergy, quantum information, social dynamics, and environmental sustainability. The interaction of these variables is described through a system of nonlinear differential equations, reflecting the complex feedback loops and synergetic effects characteristic of the postsingular world. A differentiation table contrasting postsingular and classical science is also presented, highlighting the most fundamental differences between contemporary classical science and future postsingular science. The model emphasizes the synergy between humans and artificial intelligence, the role of quantum technologies in accelerating scientific discovery, and the impact of social and ecological factors that either constrain or stimulate scientific progress. It is anticipated that new forms of scientific information dissemination will replace traditional academic publications and that scientific processing will reach an entirely new level of development following the singularity-driven acceleration of technological progress and the integration of AI into R&amp;D. This will herald an era of nonstop, ultrarapid science operating 24/7. The synergy of humans and artificial intelligence will create a scientific union on the basis of fundamentally new principles and methods. This research provides an initial theoretical foundation for further interdisciplinary studies aimed at developing sustainable strategies and effectively managing scientific progress in the postsingular era.</description>

      <title>Inferring resource competition in microbial communities from time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The competition for resources is a defining feature of microbial communities. In many contexts, from soils to host-associated communities, highly diverse microbes are organized into metabolic groups or guilds with similar resource preferences. The resource preferences of individual taxa that give rise to these guilds are critical for understanding fluxes of resources through the community and the structure of diversity in the system. However, inferring the metabolic capabilities of individual taxa, and their competition with other taxa, within a community is challenging and unresolved. Here we address this gap in knowledge by leveraging dynamic measurements of abundances in communities. We show that simple correlations are often misleading in predicting resource competition. We show that spectral methods such as the cross-power spectral density (CPSD) and coherence that account for time-delayed effects are superior metrics for inferring the structure of resource competition in communities. We first demonstrate this fact on synthetic data generated from consumer-resource models with time-dependent resource availability, where taxa are organized into groups or guilds with similar resource preferences. By applying spectral methods to oceanic plankton time-series data, we demonstrate that these methods detect interaction structures among species with similar genomic sequences. Our results indicate that analyzing temporal data across multiple timescales can reveal the underlying structure of resource competition within communities.</description>

      <title>Cluster &amp; Disperse: a general air conflict resolution heuristic using unsupervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a general and malleable heuristic for the air conflict resolution problem. This heuristic is based on a new neighborhood structure for searching the solution space of trajectories and flight-levels. Using unsupervised learning, the core idea of our heuristic is to cluster the conflict points and disperse them in various flight levels. Our first algorithm is called Cluster &amp; Disperse and in each iteration it assigns the most problematic flights in each cluster to another flight-level. In effect, we shuffle them between the flight-levels until we achieve a well-balanced configuration. The Cluster &amp; Disperse algorithm then uses any horizontal plane conflict resolution algorithm as a subroutine to solve these well-balanced instances. Nevertheless, we develop a novel algorithm for the horizontal plane based on a similar idea. That is we cluster and disperse the conflict points spatially in the same flight level using the gradient descent and a social force. We use a novel maneuver making flights travel on an arc instead of a straight path which is based on the aviation routine of the Radius to Fix legs. Our algorithms can handle a high density of flights within a reasonable computation time. We put their performance in context with some notable algorithms from the literature. Being a general framework, a particular strength of the Cluster &amp; Disperse is its malleability in allowing various constraints regarding the aircraft or the environment to be integrated with ease. This is in contrast to the models for instance based on mixed integer programming.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear $q$-voter model involving nonconformity on networks</title>

Abstract: The order-disorder phase transition is a fascinating phenomenon in opinion dynamics models within sociophysics. This transition emerges due to noise parameters, interpreted as social behaviors such as anticonformity and independence (nonconformity) in a social context. In this study, we examine the impact of nonconformist behaviors on the macroscopic states of the system. Both anticonformity and independence are parameterized by a probability \( p \), with the model implemented on a complete graph and a scale-free network. Furthermore, we introduce a skepticism parameter \( s \), which quantifies a voter's propensity for nonconformity. Our analytical and simulation results reveal that the model exhibits continuous and discontinuous phase transitions for nonzero values of \( s \) at specific values of \( q \). We estimate the critical exponents using finite-size scaling analysis to classify the model's universality. The findings suggest that the model on the complete graph and the scale-free network share the same universality class as the mean-field Ising model. Additionally, we explore the scaling behavior associated with variations in \( s \) and assess the influence of \( p \) and \( s \) on the system's opinion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Kaleidoscopic reorganization of network communities across different scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of structural heterogeneity is pervasive in real networks, and their community organization is no exception. Still, a vast majority of community detection methods assume neatly hierarchically organized communities of a characteristic scale for a given hierarchical level. In this work, we demonstrate that the reality of scale-dependent community reorganization is convoluted with simultaneous processes of community splitting and merging, challenging the conventional understanding of community-scale adjustment. We provide a mathematical argument concerning the modularity function, the results from real-network analysis, and a simple network model for a comprehensive understanding of the nontrivial community reorganization process. The reorganization is characterized by a local drop in the number of communities as the resolution parameter varies. This study suggests a need for a paradigm shift in the study of network communities, which emphasizes the importance of considering scale-dependent reorganization to better understand the genuine structural organization of networks.</description>

      <title>Parrondo's effects with aperiodic protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the effectiveness of employing archetypal aperiodic sequencing -- namely Fibonacci, Thue-Morse, and Rudin-Shapiro -- on the Parrondian effect. From a capital gain perspective, our results show that these series do yield a Parrondo's Paradox with the Thue-Morse based strategy outperforming not only the other two aperiodic strategies but benchmark Parrondian games with random and periodical ($AABBAABB\ldots$) switching as well. The least performing of the three aperiodic strategies is the Rudin-Shapiro. To elucidate the underlying causes of these results, we analyze the cross-correlation between the capital generated by the switching protocols and that of the isolated losing games. This analysis reveals that a strong anticorrelation with both isolated games is typically required to achieve a robust manifestation of Parrondo's effect. We also study the influence of the sequencing on the capital using the lacunarity and persistence measures. In general, we observe that the switching protocols tend to become less performing in terms of the capital as one increases the persistence and thus approaches the features of an isolated losing game. For the (log-)lacunarity, a property related to heterogeneity, we notice that for small persistence (less than 0.5) the performance increases with the lacunarity with a maximum around 0.4. In respect of this, our work shows that the optimization of a switching protocol is strongly dependent on a fine-tuning between persistence and heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Evidence of equilibrium dynamics in human social networks evolving in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How do networks of relationships evolve over time? We analyse a dataset tracking the social interactions of 900 individuals over four years. Despite continuous shifts in individual relationships, the macroscopic structural properties of the network remain stable, fluctuating within predictable bounds. We connect this stability to the concept of equilibrium in statistical physics. Specifically, we demonstrate that the probabilities governing network dynamics are stationary over time, and key features like degree, edge, and triangle abundances align with theoretical predictions from equilibrium dynamics. Moreover, the dynamics satisfies the detailed balance condition. Remarkably, equilibrium persists despite constant turnover as people join, leave, and change connections. This suggests that equilibrium arises not from specific individuals but from the balancing act of human needs, cognitive limits, and social pressures. Practically, this equilibrium simplifies data collection, supports methods relying on single network snapshots (like Exponential Random Graph Models), and aids in designing interventions for social challenges. Theoretically, it offers new insights into collective human behaviour, revealing how emergent properties of complex social systems can be captured by simple mathematical models.</description>

      <title>Garbage in Garbage out: Impacts of data quality on criminal network intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Criminal networks such as human trafficking rings are threats to the rule of law, democracy and public safety in our global society. Network science provides invaluable tools to identify key players and design interventions for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), e.g., to dismantle their organisation. However, poor data quality and the adaptiveness of criminal networks through self-organization make effective disruption extremely challenging. Although there exists a large body of work building and applying network scientific tools to attack criminal networks, these work often implicitly assume that the network measurements are accurate and complete. Moreover, there is thus far no comprehensive understanding of the impacts of data quality on the downstream effectiveness of interventions. This work investigates the relationship between data quality and intervention effectiveness based on classical graph theoretic and machine learning-based approaches. Decentralization emerges as a major factor in network robustness, particularly under conditions of incomplete data, which renders attack strategies largely ineffective. Moreover, the robustness of centralized networks can be boosted using simple heuristics, making targeted attack more infeasible. Consequently, we advocate for a more cautious application of network science in disrupting criminal networks, the continuous development of an interoperable intelligence ecosystem, and the creation of novel network inference techniques to address data quality challenges.</description>

      <title>Refreshing idea on Fourier analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The "theoretical limit of time-frequency resolution in Fourier analysis" is thought to originate in certain mathematical and/or physical limitations. This, however, is not true. The actual origin arises from the numerical (technical) method deployed to reduce computation time. In addition, there is a gap between the theoretical equation for Fourier analysis and its numerical implementation. Knowing the facts brings us practical benefits. In this case, these related to boundary conditions, and complex integrals. For example, replacing a Fourier integral with a complex integral brings a hybrid method for the Laplace and Fourier transforms, and reveals another perspective on time-frequency analysis. We present such a perspective here with a simple demonstrative analysis.</description>
