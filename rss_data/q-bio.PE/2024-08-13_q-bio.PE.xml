      <title>Within-host infection dynamics with master equations and the method of moments: A case study of human papillomavirus in the epithelium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Master equations provide researchers with the ability to track the distribution over possible states of a system. From these equations, we can summarize the temporal dynamics through a method of moments. These distributions and their moments capture the stochastic nature of a system, which is essential to study infectious diseases. In this paper, we define the states of the system to be the number of infected cells of a given type in the epithelium, the hollow organ tissue in the human body. Epithelium found in the cervix provides a location for viral infections to live and persist, such as human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is a highly transmissible disease which most commonly affects biological females and has the potential to progress into cervical cancer. By defining a master equation model which tracks the infected cell layer dynamics, information on disease extinction, progression, and viral output can be derived from the method of moments. From this methodology and the outcomes we glean from it, we aim to inform differing states of HPV infected cells, and assess the effects of structural information for each outcome.</description>

      <title>TGL-Lambda: An implementation of TrapGrid to estimate trap attractiveness from heterogeneous field data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes a recently developed software called ``TGL-Lambda'' enables quantifying lure attractiveness under a variety of field capture scenarios including mixed lure/trap combinations. TGL-Lambda delivers a flexible approach to simultaneously estimating the {\lambda} value for multiple trap types, accommodating a common situation in ``Mark-release-recapture'' (MRR) experiments in the field. Specifically, where researchers release a known number of marked insects in a field and count how many are recaptured in two to five trap and lure types, and the trap and release locations are known, TGL-Lambda can be used to estimate the attractiveness ({\lambda}) of each of the trap types.</description>

      <title>Influence of bovines and rodents in the spread of schistosomiasis across the ricefield-lakescape of Lake Mainit, Philippines: An Optimal Control Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schistosomiasis remains a persistent challenge in tropical freshwater ecosystems, necessitating the development of refined control strategies. Bovines, especially water buffaloes, are commonly used in traditional farming practices across rural areas of the Philippines. Bovines, however, are the biggest reservoir hosts for schistosome eggs, which contribute to the active transmission cycle of schistosomiasis in rice fields. We propose a mathematical model to analyze schistosomiasis dynamics in rice fields near the Lake Mainit in the Philippines, an area known for endemic transmission of schistosomiasis, focusing on human, bovine, and snail populations. Rodents, although considered, were not directly included in the control strategies. Grounded in field data, the model, built on a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, enabled us to derive the basic reproduction number and assess various intervention strategies. The simulation of optimal control scenarios, incorporating chemotherapy, mollusciciding, and mechanical methods, provides a comparative analysis of their efficacies. The results indicated that the integrated control strategies markedly reduced the prevalence of schistosomiasis. This study provides insights into optimal control strategies that are vital for policymakers to design effective, sustainable schistosomiasis control programs, underscored by the necessity to include bovine populations in treatment regimens.</description>

      <title>Computation of random time-shift distributions for stochastic population models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Even in large systems, the effect of noise arising from when populations are initially small can persist to be measurable on the macroscale. A deterministic approximation to a stochastic model will fail to capture this effect, but it can be accurately approximated by including an additional random time-shift to the initial conditions. We present a efficient numerical method to compute this time-shift distribution for a large class of stochastic models. The method relies on differentiation of certain functional equations, which we show can be effectively automated by deriving rules for different types of model rates that arise commonly when mass-action mixing is assumed. Explicit computation of the time-shift distribution can be used to build a practical tool for the efficient generation of macroscopic trajectories of stochastic population models, without the need for costly stochastic simulations. Full code is provided to implement this and we demonstrate our method on an epidemic model and a model of within-host viral dynamics.</description>

      <title>Effects of phylogeny on coexistence in model communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14392v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Species' interactions are shaped by their traits. Thus, we expect traits -- in particular, trait (dis)similarity -- to play a central role in determining whether a particular set of species coexists. Traits are, in turn, the outcome of an eco-evolutionary process summarized by a phylogenetic tree. Therefore, the phylogenetic tree associated with a set of species should carry information about the dynamics and assembly properties of the community. Many studies have highlighted the potentially complex ways in which this phylogenetic information is translated into species' ecological properties. However, much less emphasis has been placed on developing clear, quantitative expectations for community properties under a particular hypothesis. To address this gap, we couple a simple model of trait evolution on a phylogenetic tree with Lotka-Volterra community dynamics. This allows us to derive properties of a community of coexisting species as a function of the number of traits, tree topology and the size of the species pool. Our analysis highlights how phylogenies, through traits, affect the coexistence of a set of species. Together, these results provide much-needed baseline expectations for the ways in which evolutionary history, summarized by phylogeny, is reflected in the size and structure of ecological communities.</description>

      <title>Exact and efficient phylodynamic simulation from arbitrarily large populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many biological studies involve inferring the evolutionary history of a sample of individuals from a large population and interpreting the reconstructed tree. Such an ascertained tree typically represents only a small part of a comprehensive population tree and is distorted by survivorship and sampling biases. Inferring evolutionary parameters from ascertained trees requires modeling both the underlying population dynamics and the ascertainment process. A crucial component of this phylodynamic modeling involves tree simulation, which is used to benchmark probabilistic inference methods. To simulate an ascertained tree, one must first simulate the full population tree and then prune unobserved lineages. Consequently, the computational cost is determined not by the size of the final simulated tree, but by the size of the population tree in which it is embedded. In most biological scenarios, simulations of the entire population are prohibitively expensive due to computational demands placed on lineages without sampled descendants. Here, we address this challenge by proving that, for any partially ascertained process from a general multi-type birth-death-mutation-sampling model, there exists an equivalent process with complete sampling and no death, a property which we leverage to develop a highly efficient algorithm for simulating trees. Our algorithm scales linearly with the size of the final simulated tree and is independent of the population size, enabling simulations from extremely large populations beyond the reach of current methods but essential for various biological applications. We anticipate that this unprecedented speedup will significantly advance the development of novel inference methods that require extensive training data.</description>
