      <title>Learning finite symmetry groups of dynamical systems via equivariance detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Equivariance Seeker Model (ESM), a data-driven method for discovering the underlying finite equivariant symmetry group of an arbitrary function. ESM achieves this by optimizing a loss function that balances equivariance preservation with the penalization of redundant solutions, ensuring the complete and accurate identification of all symmetry transformations. We apply this framework specifically to dynamical systems, identifying their symmetry groups directly from observed trajectory data. To demonstrate its versatility, we test ESM on multiple systems in two distinct scenarios: (i) when the governing equations are known theoretically and (ii) when they are unknown, and the equivariance finding relies solely on observed data. The latter case highlights ESM's fully data-driven capability, as it requires no prior knowledge of the system's equations to operate.</description>

      <title>A parallel-in-time method based on the Parareal algorithm and High-Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition with applications to fluid simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high cost of sequential time integration is one major constraint that limits the speedup of a time-parallel algorithm like the Parareal algorithm due to the difficulty of coarsening time steps in a stiff numerical problem. To address this challenge, we develop a parallel-in-time approach based on the Parareal algorithm, in which we construct a novel coarse solver using a data-driven method based on Dynamic Mode Decomposition in place of a classic time marching scheme. The proposed solver computes an approximation of the solution using two numerical schemes of different accuracies in parallel, and apply High-Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD) to reduce the cost of sequential computations. Compared to the original Parareal algorithm, the proposed approach allows for the construction of low-cost coarse solvers for many complicated stiff problems. We demonstrate through several numerical examples in fluid dynamics that the proposed method can effectively reduce the serial computation cost and improve the parallel speedup of long-time simulations which are hard to accelerate using the original Parareal algorithm.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Mechanisms and Design Principles for Photodesorption from TiO${}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photocatalytic reactions often exhibit fast kinetics and high product selectivity, qualities which are desirable but difficult to achieve simultaneously in thermally driven processes. However, photo-driven mechanisms are poorly understood owing to the difficulty in realistically modeling catalysts in optically excited states. Here we apply many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) calculations to gain insight into these mechanisms by studying a prototypical photocatalytic reaction, proton desorption from a rutile TiO${}_2$ (110) surface. Our calculations reveal a qualitatively different desorption process upon photoexcitation, with an over 50% reduction in the desorption energy and the emergence of an energy barrier. We rationalize these findings with a generalizable model based on Fano theory and explain the surprising increase of excitonic effects as the proton detaches from the surface. Our model also yields a connection between how the alignment of relevant ionization potentials affects the shape of the excited-state potential energy surface. These results cannot be qualitatively captured by typical constrained density-functional theory and highlight how contemporary first-principles MBPT calculations can be applied to design photocatalytic reactions.</description>

      <title>Weighted balanced truncation method for approximating kernel functions by exponentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel approximation with exponentials is useful in many problems with convolution quadrature and particle interactions such as integral-differential equations, molecular dynamics and machine learning. This paper proposes a weighted balanced truncation to construct an optimal model reduction method for compressing the number of exponentials in the sum-of-exponentials approximation of kernel functions. This method shows great promise in approximating long-range kernels, achieving over 4 digits of accuracy improvement for the Ewald-splitting and inverse power kernels in comparison with the classical balanced truncation. Numerical results demonstrate its excellent performance and attractive features for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Learning at Heisenberg Limit for Hybrid Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20373v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems with different particle species are fundamental in quantum materials and quantum information science. In this work, we demonstrate that Hamiltonian learning in hybrid spin-boson systems can achieve the Heisenberg limit. Specifically, we establish a rigorous theoretical framework proving that, given access to an unknown hybrid Hamiltonian system, our algorithm can estimate the Hamiltonian coupling parameters up to root mean square error (RMSE) $\epsilon$ with a total evolution time scaling as $T \sim \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ using only $\mathcal{O}({\rm polylog}(\epsilon^{-1}))$ measurements. Furthermore, it remains robust against small state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. In addition, we also provide an alternative algorithm based on distributed quantum sensing, which significantly reduces the maximum evolution time per measurement. To validate our method, we apply it to the generalized Dicke model for Hamiltonian learning and the spin-boson model for spectrum learning, demonstrating its efficiency in practical quantum systems. These results provide a scalable and robust framework for precision quantum sensing and Hamiltonian characterization in hybrid quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Tradeoffs in Biconic Intake Aerodynamic Design Optimization with Sub-optimal Oswatitsch Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of sub-optimal Oswatitsch solutions is introduced in order to systematically conduct a tradeoff between total pressure recovery (TPR) and intake drag coefficient (CDi) for supersonic intakes. It is shown that the Oswatitsch-optimal TPR for a biconic intake may be enhanced by adding a conical flare which modifies the terminal normal shock into a novel Lambda shock structure. The optimization problem is formulated along the lines of Axiomatic Design Theory with the conical angle pair and the cowl fineness ratio as the two design parameters. Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations are performed to iteratively arrive at the optimal solutions, with and without an intake length constraint, for a fixed value of the intake mass flow rate. The results are used to generate the Pareto front in the space of the objective functions, which yields the set of solutions between which TPR and Cdi may be traded off for one another. Additionally, an off-Oswatitsch solution, where only the second cone angle is altered from its optimal Oswatitsch value, is obtained and is compared with the sub-optimal Oswatitsch solutions that form the Pareto front.</description>

      <title>Unexpected Density Functional Dependence of the Antipolar $Pbcn$ Phase in HfO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The antipolar $Pbcn$ phase of HfO$_2$ has been suggested to play an important role in the phase transition and polarization switching mechanisms in ferroelectric hafnia. In this study, we perform a comprehensive benchmark of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulations to investigate the thermodynamic stability and phase transition behavior of hafnia, with a particular focus on the relationship between the $Pbcn$ and ferroelectric $Pca2_1$ phases. Our results reveal significant discrepancies in the predicted stability of the $Pbcn$ phase relative to the $Pca2_1$ phase across different exchange-correlation functionals. Notably, the PBE and hybrid HSE06 functionals exhibit consistent trends, which diverge from the predictions of the PBEsol and SCAN functionals. For a given density functional, temperature-driven phase transitions predicted by DFT-based quasi-harmonic free energy calculations aligns with finite-temperature MD simulations using a deep potential trained on the same density functional. Specifically, the PBE functional predicts a transition from $Pca2_1$ to $Pbcn$ with increasing temperature, while PBEsol predicts a transition from $Pca2_1$ to $P4_2/nmc$. A particularly striking and reassuring finding is that under fixed mechanical boundary conditions defined by the ground-state structure of $Pca2_1$, all functionals predict consistent relative phase stabilities and comparable switching barriers as well as domain wall energies. These findings underscore the unique characteristics of the $Pbcn$ phase in influencing phase transitions and switching mechanisms in ferroelectric hafnia.</description>

      <title>Steady undisturbed velocity correction scheme for Euler-Lagrange simulations near planar walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Euler-Lagrange (EL) point-particle simulations rely on hydrodynamic force closure models to accurately predict particle dynamics in flows. The closure models currently employed for dilute particle-laden flows require the undisturbed fluid velocity estimated at the particle center. Recovering this undisturbed velocity necessitates modeling the particle-induced disturbance on the flow. In this work, we present a new framework for velocity disturbance modeling near no-slip walls, suited for dilute gas-solid flows characterized by large Stokes numbers. For small disturbance Reynolds numbers, the velocity disturbance governing equations reduce to the steady Stokes equations. To exactly satisfy the no-slip and no-penetration boundary conditions for the velocity disturbance at the location of the planar wall, we employ the method of images to derive the Green's functions of the Stokes equations for Wendland and Gaussian force regularization kernels. An additional convolution product with a mesh-spacing dependent Gaussian kernel is performed to match the solution produced by a discrete flow solver. We verify the proposed analytical model by comparing the velocity disturbance generated on a computational mesh with the model predictions. An extension of the model for finite particle Reynolds numbers is proposed by multiplying an Oseen correction factor in an unbounded domain. The correction scheme is validated using canonical test cases involving the motion of a single particle parallel and perpendicular to a wall at various Stokes numbers, particle Reynolds numbers, and particle diameter to mesh-spacing ratios. Owing to the polynomial representation of the velocity disturbance for a Wendland force regularization, the current model is computationally efficient and well-suited for large-scale, two-way coupled EL simulations.</description>

      <title>Classifying acoustic cavitation with machine learning trained on multiple physical models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16142v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acoustic cavitation threshold charts are used to map between acoustic parameters (mainly intensity and frequency) and different regimes of acoustic cavitation. The two main regimes are transient cavitation, where a bubble collapses, and stable cavitation, where a bubble undergoes periodic oscillations without collapse. The cavitation charts strongly depend on the physical model used to compute the bubble dynamics and the algorithm for classifying the cavitation threshold. The differences between modeling approaches become especially noticeable for resonant bubbles and when sonication parameters result in large-amplitude oscillations. This paper proposes a machine learning approach that integrates three physical models, i.e., the Rayleigh-Plesset, Keller-Miksis and Gilmore equations, and multiple cavitation classification techniques. Specifically, we classify the cavitation regimes based on the maximum radius, the acoustic Mach number, the kurtosis factor of acoustic emissions, and the Flynn criterion on the inertial and pressure functions. Four machine learning strategies were developed to predict the likelihood of the transient and stable cavitation, using equally weighted contributions from classification techniques. By solving the differential equations for bubble dynamics across a range of sonication and material parameters and applying cross-validation on held-out test data, our framework demonstrates high predictive accuracy for cavitation regimes. This physics-informed machine learning approach offers probabilistic insights into cavitation likelihood, combining diverse physical models and classification strategies, each contributing different levels of physical rigor and interpretability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the possibility of improving multireference-driven coupled cluster (CC) approaches with an algorithm that iteratively combines complete active space (CAS) calculations with tailored CC and externally corrected CC. This is accomplished by establishing a feedback loop between the CC and CAS parts of a calculation through similarity transformation of the Hamiltonian with those CC amplitudes that are not encompassed by the active space. We denote this approach the complete active space iterative coupled cluster (CASiCC) ansatz. We investigate its efficiency and accuracy in the singles and doubles approximation by studying the prototypical molecules H4, H8, H2O, and N2. Our results demonstrate that CASiCC systematically improves on the single-reference CCSD and the ecCCSD methods across entire potential energy curves, while retaining modest computational costs. However, the tailored coupled cluster method shows superior performance in the strong correlation regime suggesting that its accuracy is based on error compensation. We find that the iterative version of externally corrected and tailored coupled cluster methods converge to the same results.</description>

      <title>SPRING: an effective and reliable framework for image reconstruction in single-particle Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07413v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) is an experimental technique to gain images of isolated structures by recording the light scattered off the sample. In principle, the sample density can be recovered from the scattered light field through a straightforward Fourier Transform operation. However, only the amplitude of the field is recorded, while the phase is lost during the measurement process and has to be retrieved by means of suitable, well-established phase retrieval algorithms. In this work, we present SPRING, an analysis framework tailored to X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) single-shot single-particle diffraction data that implements the Memetic Phase Retrieval method to mitigate the shortcomings of conventional algorithms. We benchmark the approach on experimental data acquired in two experimental campaigns at SwissFEL and European XFEL. Imaging results on isolated nanostructures reveal unprecedented stability and resilience of the algorithm's behavior on the input parameters, as well as the capability of identifying the solution in conditions hardly treatable so far with conventional methods. A user-friendly implementation of SPRING is released as open-source software, aiming at being a reference tool for the coherent diffraction imaging community at XFEL and synchrotron facilities.</description>

Abstract: The multisilce method is an important algorithm for electron diffraction and image simulations in transmission electron microscopy. We have proposed a quantum algorithm of the multislice method based on quantum circuit model previously. In this work we have developed an improved quantum algorithm. We reconstruct the phase-shifting quantum circuit without using the multi-controlled quantum gates, thereby significantly improve the computation efficiency. The new quantum circuit also allows further gate count reduction at the cost of a controllable error. We have simulated the quantum circuit on a classical supercomputer and analyzed the result to prove the feasibility and correctness of the improved quantum algorithm. We also provide proper parameter settings through testing, allowing the minimization of the necessary number of quantum gates while limiting the relative error within 1%. This work demonstrates the potential of applying quantum computing to electron diffraction simulations and achieving quantum advantages.</description>
