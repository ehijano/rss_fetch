      <title>A New Thermodynamics Featuring the Arrow in Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a truth universally acknowledged that all isolated macroscopic systems must be in want of ever greater disorder, with due apologies to Jane Austen for plagiarizing the opening line in her novel {\it Pride and Prejudice}. This common, everyday process, often referred to as the Arrow of Time, has not been able to find a comfortable home in the body of modern statistical physics. There is a hint of such a disordering arrow in the second law of traditional thermostatics but, properly stated, that law relates only to the static equilibrium state of confined, isolated macroscopic matter. We will attempt to enhance today's thermo{\it statics} with a true thermo{\it dynamics} in which the disordering arrow in time is shown to be responsible for all the order -- creation we find in the universe -- including the existential order needed to sustain life.</description>

      <title>Structural Properties of the Asymmetric Barab\'asi-Albert Model in the Lattice Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Asymmetric BA model extends the Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free network model by introducing a parameter $\omega$. As $\omega$ varies, the model transitions through different network structures: an extended lattice at $\omega = -1$, a random graph at $\omega = 0$, and the original scale-free network at $\omega = 1$. We derive the exact degree distribution for $\omega = -r/(r+k)$, where $k \in \{0,1,\cdots\}$, and develop a perturbative expansion around these values of $\omega$. Additionally, we show that for $\omega = -1 + \varepsilon$, the clustering coefficient scales as $\ln t / \sqrt{\varepsilon} t$ and approaches zero as $t \to \infty$, confirming the absence of small-world properties.</description>

      <title>Interacting systems with zero thermodynamic curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review a conjecture by Ruppeiner that relates the nature of interparticle interactions to the sign of the thermodynamic curvature scalar $R$, paying special attention to the case of zero curvature. We highlight the underappreciated fact that there are two Ruppeiner metrics that are equally viable in principle, which are obtained by restricting to systems of constant volume and constant particle number, respectively. We then demonstrate the existence of thermodynamic systems with vanishing curvature scalar but nontrivial interactions. Information about interactions in these systems is obtained by carrying out an inversion procedure on the virial coefficients. Finally, we show using the virial expansion that the ideal gas is the unique physical system for which both curvature scalars vanish. This leads us to propose an extension to Ruppeiner's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Single-molecule Automata: Harnessing Kinetic-Thermodynamic Discrepancy for Temporal Pattern Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular-scale computation is crucial for smart materials and nanoscale devices, yet creating single-molecule systems capable of complex computations remains challenging. We present a theoretical framework for a single-molecule computer that performs temporal pattern recognition and complex information processing. Our approach introduces the concept of an energy seascape, extending traditional energy landscapes by incorporating control parameter degrees of freedom. By engineering a kinetic-thermodynamic discrepancy in folding dynamics, we demonstrate that a linear polymer with $N$ binary-state foldable units can function as a deterministic finite automaton, processing $2^N$ configurations. The molecule's dominant configuration evolves deterministically in response to mechanical signals, enabling recognition of complex temporal patterns. This design allows complete state controllability through non-equilibrium driving protocols. Our model opens avenues for molecular-scale computation with applications in biosensing, smart drug delivery, and adaptive materials. We discuss potential experimental realizations using DNA nanotechnology. This work bridges the gap between information processing devices and stochastic molecular systems, paving the way for sophisticated molecular computers rivaling biological systems in complexity and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Potts Partition Function Zeros and Ground State Entropy on Hanoi Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study properties of the Potts model partition function $Z(H_m,q,v)$ on $m$'th iterates of Hanoi graphs, $H_m$, and use the results to draw inferences about the $m \to \infty$ limit that yields a self-similar Hanoi fractal, $H_\infty$. We also calculate the chromatic polynomials $P(H_m,q)=Z(H_m,q,-1)$. From calculations of the configurational degeneracy, per vertex, of the zero-temperature Potts antiferromagnet on $H_m$, denoted $W(H_m,q)$, estimates of $W(H_\infty,q)$, are given for $q=3$ and $q=4$ and compared with known values on other lattices. We compute the zeros of $Z(H_m,q,v)$ in the complex $q$ plane for various values of the temperature-dependent variable $v=y-1$ and in the complex $y$ plane for various values of $q$. These are consistent with accumulating to form loci denoted ${\cal B}_q(v)$ and ${\cal B}_v(q)$, or equivalently, ${\cal B}_y(q)$, in the $m \to \infty$ limit. Our results motivate the inference that the maximal point at which ${\cal B}_q(-1)$ crosses the real $q$ axis, denoted $q_c$, has the value $q_c=(1/2)(3+\sqrt{5} \, )$ and correspondingly, if $q=q_c$, then ${\cal B}_y(q_c)$ crosses the real $y$ axis at $y=0$, i.e., the Potts antiferromagnet on $H_\infty$ with $q=(1/2)(3+\sqrt{5} \, )$ has a $T=0$ critical point. Finally, we analyze the partition function zeros in the $y$ plane for $q \gg 1$ and show that these accumulate approximately along parts of the sides of an equilateral triangular with apex points that scale like $y \sim q^{2/3}$ and $y \sim q^{2/3} e^{\pm 2\pi i/3}$. Some comparisons are presented of these findings for Hanoi graphs with corresponding results on $m$'th iterates of Sierpinski gasket graphs and the $m \to \infty$ limit yielding the Sierpinski gasket fractal.</description>

      <title>Statistics of a Large Number of Renewals in Equilibrium and Non-Equilibrium Renewal Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19966v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The renewal process is a key statistical model for describing a wide range of stochastic systems in Physics. This work investigates the behavior of the probability distribution of the number of renewals in renewal processes in the short-time limit, with a focus on cases where the number of renewals is large. We find that the specific details of the sojourn time distribution $\phi(\tau)$ in this limit can significantly modify the behavior in the large-number-of-renewals regime. We explore both non-equilibrium and equilibrium renewal processes, deriving results for various forms of $\phi(\tau)$. Using saddle point approximations, we analyze cases where $\phi(\tau)$ follows a power-series expansion, includes a cutoff, or exhibits non-analytic behavior near $\tau = 0$. Additionally, we show how the short-time properties of $\phi(\tau)$ shape the decay of the number of renewals in equilibrium compared to non-equilibrium renewal processes. The probability of the number of renewals plays a crucial role in determining rare event behaviors, such as Laplace tails. The results obtained here are expected to help advance the development of a theoretical framework for rare events in transport processes in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Explicit dynamical properties of the Pelikan random map in the chaotic region and at the intermittent critical point towards the non-chaotic region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pelikan random trajectories $x_t \in [0,1[$ are generated by choosing the chaotic doubling map $x_{t+1}=2 x_t [mod 1]$ with probability $p$ and the non-chaotic half-contracting map $x_{t+1}=\frac{x_t}{2}$ with probability $(1-p)$. We compute various dynamical observables as a function of the parameter $p$ via two perspectives. In the first perspective, we focus on the closed dynamics within the subspace of probability densities that remain constant on the binary-intervals $x \in [ 2^{-n-1}, 2^{-n}[$ partitioning the interval $x \in [0,1[$ : the dynamics for the weights $\pi_t(n)$ of these intervals corresponds to a biased random walk on the half-infinite lattice $n \in \{0,1,2,..+\infty\}$ with resetting occurring with probability $p$ from the origin $n=0$ towards any site $n$ drawn with the distribution $2^{-n-1}$. In the second perspective, we study the Pelikan dynamics for any initial condition $x_0$ via the binary decomposition $x_t = \sum_{l=1}^{+\infty} \frac{\sigma_l (t)}{2^l} $, where the dynamics for the half-infinite lattice $l=1,2,..$ of the binary variables $\sigma_l(t) \in \{0,1\}$ can be reformulated in terms of two global variables : $z_t$ corresponds to a biased random walk on the half-infinite lattice $z \in \{0,1,2,..+\infty\}$ that may remain at the origin $z=0$ with probability $p$, while $F_t \in \{0,1,2,..t\}$ counts the number of time-steps $\tau \in [0,t-1]$ where $z_{\tau+1}=0=z_{\tau}$ and represents the number of the binary coefficients of the initial condition that have been erased. We discuss typical and large deviations properties in the chaotic region $\frac{1}{2}&lt;p&lt;1 $ as well as at the intermittent critical point $p_c=\frac{1}{2}$ towards the non-chaotic region $0&lt;p&lt;\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for extracting entanglement entropy in interacting fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy probing novel phases and phase transitions numerically via quantum Monte Carlo has made great achievements in large-scale interacting spin/boson systems. In contrast, the numerical exploration in interacting fermion systems is rare, even though fermion systems attract more attentions in condensed matter. The fundamental restrictions is that the computational cost of fermion quantum Monte Carlo ($\sim \beta N^3$) is much higher than that of spin/boson ($\sim \beta N$). To tackle the problem cumbersome existent methods of eantanglement entropy calculation, we propose a fermionic quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on the incremental technique along physical parameters, which greatly improves the efficiency of extracting entanglement entropy. Taking a two-dimensional square lattice Hubbard model as an example, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and show the high computation precision. In this simulation, the calculated scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy elucidates the different phases of the Fermi surface and Goldstone modes.</description>

      <title>Efficient Optimization of Variational Autoregressive Networks with Natural Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating free energy is a fundamental problem in statistical mechanics. Recently, machine-learning-based methods, particularly the variational autoregressive networks (VANs), have been proposed to minimize variational free energy and to approximate the Boltzmann distribution. VAN enjoys notable advantages, including exact computation of the normalized joint distribution and fast unbiased sampling, which are critical features often missing in Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. However, VAN also faces significant computational challenges. These include difficulties in the optimization of variational free energy in a complicated parameter space and slow convergence of learning. In this work, we introduce an optimization technique based on natural gradients to the VAN framework, namely ng-VAN, to enhance the learning efficiency and accuracy of the conventional VAN. The method has computational complexity cubic in the batch size rather than in the number of model parameters, hence it can be efficiently implemented for a large VAN model. We carried out extensive numerical experiments on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model and spin glasses on random graphs and illustrated that compared with the conventional VAN, ng-VAN significantly improves the accuracy in estimating free energy and converges much faster with shorter learning time. This allows extending the VAN framework's applicability to challenging statistical mechanics problems that were previously not accessible.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo study of the two-dimensional kinetic Ising model under a non-antisymmetric magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive numerical study of dynamic phase transitions in the two-dimensional kinetic Ising model under a non-antisymmetric time-dependent magnetic field including a sinusoidal term and a second harmonic component. We demonstrate that the expected antisymmetric property and the scaling behavior of the order parameter are maintained using the recently proposed generalized conjugate field approach. Via a detailed finite-size scaling analysis we compute, for zero-bias field, the set of critical exponents suggesting that the Ising universality class is conserved, even in the absence of half-wave antisymmetry in the time-dependent magnetic field. Our results verify up-to-date experimental observations and provide a deeper understanding of non-equilibrium phase transitions, establishing a broader framework for exploring symmetry-breaking phenomena in driven magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Coastlines violate the Schramm-Loewner Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mandelbrot's empirical observation that the coast of Britain is fractal has been confirmed by many authors, but it can be described by the Schramm--Loewner Evolution? Since the self-affine surface of our planet has a positive Hurst exponent, one would not expect a priori any critical behavior. Here, we investigate numerically the roughness and fractal dimension of the isoheight lines of real and artificial landscapes. Using a novel algorithm to take into account overhangs, we find that the roughness exponent of isoheight lines is consistent with unity regardless of the Hurst exponent of the rough surface. Moreover, the effective fractal dimension of the iso-height lines decays linearly with the Hurst exponent of the surface. We perform several tests to verify if the complete and accessible perimeters would follow the Schramm--Loewner Evolution and find that the left passage probability test is clearly violated, implying that coastlines violate SLE.</description>

      <title>Learning thermodynamics and topological order of the 2D XY model with generative real-valued restricted Boltzmann machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting the topological Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition in the prototypical 2D XY model using unsupervised machine learning methods has long been a challenging problem due to the lack of suitable order parameters. To address this issue, we begin with a conventional real-valued RBM (RBM-xy), which uses exponential conditional probabilities to generate visible units. We then develop a novel real-valued RBM (RBM-CosSin) featuring nonlinear cos/sin activation, whose visible units follow the von Mises distribution. Our findings reveal that RBM-CosSin effectively learns the underlying Boltzmann distribution of 2D XY systems and generate authentic XY configurations that accurately capture both thermodynamics and topological order (vortex). Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is possible to extract phase transition information, including the KT transition, from the weight matrices without relying on prior physics knowledge.</description>

      <title>On the Uniform Sampling of the Configuration Model with Centrality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Onion Decomposition has recently been shown to provide principled models of complex graphs that better reproduce the sparse networks found in nature, but at the cost of complicated connection rules. We propose a k-edge swapping MCMC algorithm to efficiently obtain a uniform sample from the ensemble of simple graphs with a fixed Onion Decomposition and degree sequence. We prove the non-connectivity of the 2-edge swap algorithm for some small graphs, but then provide numerical experiments to show that this non-connectivity is not a problem for 2-edge swap in many practical cases, and likely irrelevant when using k-edge swaps with k&gt;2. We finish by comparing our null model to other well-known models in the literature, and show that keeping constraints on the meso-scale structures of the Onion Decomposition greatly increases both the structural and functional realism of random graph null model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18985v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the collective motion of self-propelled agents through the lens of quantum-like entanglement in visual perception. This approach makes the non-linear dynamics in ordinary space a derivative of dynamics in the Hilbert space of perception. By appropriate choice of operators in this quantum-inspired model, we show how the familiar Vicsek model, a well-known paradigm for flocking behaviour, naturally emerges. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to explore how different types of entangled quantum states-such as GHZ states, W states, and cluster states-affect collective motion. Each type of entanglement introduces unique coordination patterns, interaction strength, and information sharing among agents, leading to different collective behaviours.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using quantum equations of motion for interacting bosons, stochastic molecular dynamics simulations with quantized momenta are performed for Lennard-Jones helium-4. The viscosity of the quantum liquid is significantly less than that of the classical liquid, being almost 5 times smaller at the lowest temperature studied. The classical and quantum liquids are identical except for Bose-Einstein condensation, which pinpoints the molecular mechanism for superfluidity. The results rely on the existence of stochastic but real particle trajectories, which has implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Universality in diffusion-controlled nucleation and growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nucleation and growth is studied in a system undergoing diffusion-controlled condensation under gradual changes in parameters, such as cooling. It is demonstrated that when Gibbs-Thompson effect becomes negligible, the system falls into a universal regime. i.e. the final droplet size distribution remains invariant under certain rescaling of system parameters. An approximate yet very accurate analytic form is obtained for the size distribution function in this regime.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamic length increases monotonically in pinned and unpinned glass forming systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Random First Order Transition Theory (RFOT) predicts that transport proceeds by cooperative movement of particles in domains whose sizes increase as a liquid is compressed above a characteristic volume fraction, $\phi_d$. The rounded dynamical transition around $\phi_d$, which signals a crossover to activated transport, is accompanied by a growing correlation length that is predicted to diverge at the thermodynamic glass transition density ($&gt; \phi_d$). Simulations and imaging experiments probed the single particle dynamics of mobile particles in response to pinning all the particles in a semi-infinite space or randomly pinning (RP) a fraction of particles in a liquid at equilibrium. The extracted dynamic length increases non-monotonically with a peak around $\phi_d$. This finding is at variance with the results obtained using the small wave length limit of a four-point structure factor for unpinned systems. To obtain a consistent picture of the growth of the dynamic length, one that is impervious to the use of RP, we introduce a multi particle structure factor, $S^c_{mp}(q,t)$, that probes collective dynamics. The collective dynamic length, calculated from the small wave vector limit of $S^c_{mp}(q,t)$, increases monotonically as a function of the volume fraction in glass forming binary mixture of charged colloidal particles in both unpinned and pinned systems. This prediction, which also holds in the presence of added monovalent salt, may be validated using imaging experiments.</description>

      <title>Stochastic quasi-cycles as a simple explanation for the time evolution of the Cape Rodney-Okakari Point Marine ecological reserve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dataset collected at the Cape Rodney-Okakari Point Marine (CR-OPM) reserve on the North Island of New Zealand is rather unique. It describes the cyclic time evolution of a rocky intertidal community, with the relative abundances of the various coastal species that have been meticulously monitored for more than 20 years. Past theoretical studies, anchored on a deterministic description, required invoking ad hoc mechanisms to reproduce the observed dynamical paths. Following a maximum likelihood approach to interpolate individual stochastic trajectories, we here propose quasi-cycles as an alternative and simpler mechanism to explain the oscillations observed in the population numbers of the ecosystem. From a general standpoint, we also show that it is possible to return conclusive evidence on the existence of stochastic quasi-cycles, without resorting to global fitting strategies which necessitate handling a large collection of independent replicas of the dynamics, a possibility that is often precluded in real life applications.</description>

      <title>Conformality loss and short-range crossover in long-range conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the conformality loss of theories with long-range interactions. We consider the $O(2)\times O(N)$ multiscalar model with coupling $r^{-d-\delta}$ in $d=4-\epsilon$ dimension. We compute the critical exponents of the long-range fixed points (LRFPs) to three loops. The phase diagram of the model is dominated by two processes: the short-range crossover and merger-annihilation of LRFPs. The two processes intersect at the lower edge of the conformal window, below which the LRFPs disappear into the complex plane. We propose a novel scenario for the short-range crossover of complex LRFPs, in which the short-range crossover occurs on a vertical line in the complex plane of $\delta$. The complex marginal operator generates renormalization group flow on the transition line and significantly enriches the short-range crossover of complex LRFPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial stock return correlations have been analyzed through the lens of random matrix theory to differentiate the underlying signal from spurious correlations. The continuous spectrum of the eigenvalue distribution derived from the stock return correlation matrix typically aligns with a rescaled Marchenko-Pastur distribution, indicating no detectable signal. In this study, we introduce a stochastic field theory model to establish a detection threshold for signals present in the limit where the eigenvalues are within the continuous spectrum, which itself closely resembles that of a random matrix where standard methods such as principal component analysis fail to infer a signal. We then apply our method to Standard &amp; Poor's 500 financial stocks' return correlations, detecting the presence of a signal in the largest eigenvalues within the continuous spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study theoretically the dynamics of frustrated spin Peierls systems after a quench from the paramagnetic state to the magnetically ordered state. By constructing and numerical simulating a minimal model, we show that it can exhibit a transient non-collinear magnetic order before settling in the equilibrium collinear magnetic order. The transient magnetic order is selected by the phonon fluctuations originated from the initial state. Our results reveal a mechanism for controlling the phases of matter by exploiting incoherent, nonequilibrium fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Mode-Dependent Phonon Relaxation in fcc Ni: Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Frozen-Trajectory Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a computational study of phonon relaxation in face-centered cubic (fcc) nickel (Ni), focusing on ultra-fast magnetization dynamics. The phonons are excited beyond their thermal equilibrium population, and the relaxation behavior is analyzed as a function of both wave vector ($\vec{q}$) and phonon frequency ($\omega$). To efficiently investigate these excitations, we introduce a trajectory post-processing technique, the frozen-trajectory excitation, which facilitates the $(\vec{q},\omega)$-resolved analysis. Molecular dynamics simulations combined with the frozen-phonon multislice method predict relaxation signatures observable with time-resolved transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at 10 -- 20 fs resolution. Our findings indicate mode dependence in the relaxation processes, highlighting the importance of phonon-specific behavior consideration in ultrafast dynamics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of in-plane magnetic fields on the superconducting state in layered Ising superconductors, resulting in the emergence of the orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state coupled with Josephson vortices. Recent experiments have revealed an unexpected first-order phase transition in these superconductors under strong in-plane magnetic fields. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that this phase transition is primarily driven by the formation and subsequent melting of a Josephson vortex lattice within the superconducting layers. As the magnetic field increases, the vortex lattice undergoes a transition from a solid to a liquid state, triggering the observed first-order phase transition. We calculate both the melting line and the in-plane critical field in the phase diagram, showing strong agreement with experimental results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theory and experiment have long discussed negative thermodynamic pressure states, but their microscopic origins are unclear. I address this problem within the framework of quantum thermodynamics. I show that the pressure exerted on the boundary is positive when there is no interaction with the boundary. This is formalized via a no-go theorem that holds for any quantum state. It is believed that stable negative pressure states cannot exist in gases. I provide solvable examples of quantum and classical gases, where negative pressure is achieved due to a suitable coupling with the boundary walls.</description>

      <title>Single-atom dissipation and dephasing in Dicke and Tavis-Cummings quantum batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of single-atom dissipation and dephasing noise on the performance of Dicke and Tavis-Cummings quantum batteries, where the electromagnetic field of the cavity hosting the system acts as a charger. For these models a genuine charging process can only occur in the transient regime. Indeed, unless the interaction with the environment is cut off, the asymptotic energy of the battery is solely determined by the environment and does not depend on the initial energy of the electromagnetic field. We numerically estimate the fundamental figures of merit for the model, including the time at which the battery reaches its maximum ergotropy, the average energy, and the energy that needs to be used to switch the battery-charger interaction on and off. Depending on the scaling of the coupling between the battery and the charger, we show that the model can still exhibit a subextensive charging time. However, for the Dicke battery, this effect comes with a higher cost when switching the battery-charger interaction on and off. We also show that as the number of battery constituents increases, both the Dicke and Tavis-Cummings models become asymptotically free, meaning the amount of energy that is not unitarily extractable becomes negligible. We obtain this result numerically and demonstrate analytically that it is a consequence of the symmetry under permutation of the model. Finally, we perform simulations for different values of the detuning, showing that the optimal regime for the Dicke battery is off-resonance, in contrast to what is observed in the Tavis-Cummings case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and theoretically investigate a minimal particle-based model for a new class of active matter where particles exhibit directional, volume-conserving division in confinement while interacting sterically, mimicking cells in early embryogenesis. We find that complex motion, synchronized within division cycles, displays strong collective effects and becomes self-similar in the long-time limit. Introducing the method of normalized retraced trajectories, we show that the transgenerational motion caused by cell division can be mapped to a time-inhomogenous random walk with an exponentially decreasing length scale. Analytical predictions for this stochastic process allow us to extract effective parameters, indicating unusual effects of crowding and absence of jamming. Robustness of our findings against desynchronized divisions, cell size dispersity, and variations in confinement hints at universal behavior. Our results establish an understanding of complex dynamics exhibited by isovolumentric division over long timescales, paving the way for new bioengineering strategies and perspectives on living matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1907.09055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of a crystalline solid by applying intermediate statistics obtained by deforming known solid state models using the mathematics of $q$-analogs. We apply the resulting $q$-deformation to both the Einstein and Debye models and study the deformed thermal and electrical conductivities and the deformed Debye specific heat. We find that the $q$-deformation acts in two different ways -- but not necessarily as independent mechanisms. First, it acts as an effective factor of disorder or impurity, modifying the characteristics of a crystalline structure, which are phenomena described by q-bosons. Second, it also manifests intermediate statistics, namely, the B-anyons (or B-type systems). For the latter case, we have identified the Schottky effect, normally associated with high-$T_c$ superconductors in the presence of rare-earth-ion impurities. We also find that it increases the specific heat of the solids beyond the Dulong-Petit limit at high temperature. Such an effect is usually related to anharmonicity of interatomic interactions. Alternatively, since in the $q$-bosons case the statistics are in principle maintained, the effect of the deformation acts more slowly due to a small change in the crystal lattice. On the other hand, B-anyons that belong to modified statistics are more sensitive to the deformation. The results reported here may be verified experimentally, for instance, in experimental samples by inserting impurities, or changes in pressure or temperature if one assumes these tuning quantities are related with the q-deformation parameter.</description>

      <title>Universal Aspects of Barrier Crossing Under Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.16277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermal activation process by which a system passes from one local energy minimum to another is a recurring motif in physics, chemistry, and biology. For instance, biopolymer chains are typically modeled in terms of energy landscapes, with folded and unfolded conformations represented by two distinct wells separated by a barrier. The rate of transfer between wells depends primarily on the height of the barrier, but it also depends on the details of the shape of the landscape along the trajectory. We consider the case of bias due to an external force, analogous to the pulling force applied in optical tweezer experiments on biopolymers. Away from the Arrhenius-law limit and well out of equilibrium, somewhat idiosyncratic behavior might be expected. Instead, we identify universal behavior of the biased activated-barrier-crossing process and demonstrate that data collapse onto a universal curve can be achieved for simulated data over a wide variety of energy landscapes having barriers of different height and shape and for loading rates spanning many orders of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: Recent experiments have implemented resetting by means of an external trap, whereby a system relaxes to the minimum of the trap and is reset in a finite time. In this work, we set up and analyse the thermodynamics of such a protocol. We present a general framework, even valid for non-Poissonian resetting, that captures the thermodynamic work required to maintain a resetting process up to a given observation time, and exactly calculate the moment generating function of this work. Our framework is valid for a wide range of systems, the only assumption being relaxation to equilibrium in the resetting trap. Examples and extensions are considered. In the case of Brownian motion, we investigate optimal resetting schemes that minimise work and its fluctuations, the mean work for arbitrary switching protocols and comparisons to previously studied resetting schemes. Numerical simulations are performed to validate our findings.</description>

      <title>Promoting Fluctuation Theorems into Covariant Forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The principle of covariance, a cornerstone of modern physics, asserts the equivalence of all inertial frames of reference. Fluctuation theorems, as extensions of the second law of thermodynamics, establish universal connections between irreversibility and fluctuation in terms of stochastic thermodynamic quantities. However, these relations typically assume that both the thermodynamic system and the heat bath are at rest with respect to the observer, thereby failing to satisfy the principle of covariance. In this study, by introducing covariant work and heat that incorporate both energy-related and momentum-related components, we promote fluctuation theorems into covariant forms applicable to moving thermodynamic systems and moving heat baths. We illustrate this framework with two examples: the work statistics of a relativistic stochastic field and the heat statistics of a relativistic Brownian motion. Although our study is carried out in the context of special relativity, the results can be extended to the nonrelativistic limit. Our work combines the principle of covariance and fluctuation theorems into a coherent framework and may have applications in the study of thermodynamics relevant to cosmic microwave background as well as the radiative heat transfer and noncontact friction between relatively moving bodies.</description>

      <title>Restarts delay escape over a potential barrier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the barrier escape problem, a random searcher starting at the energy minima tries to escape the barrier under the effect of thermal fluctuations. If the random searcher is subject to successive restarts at the bottom of the well, then its escape over the barrier top is delayed compared to the time it would take in absence of restarts. When restarting at an intermediate location, the time required by the random searcher to go from the bottom of the well to the restart location should be considered. Taking into account this time overhead, we find that restarts delay escape, independent of the specific nature of the distribution of restart times, or the location of restart, or the specific details of the random searcher. For the special case of Poisson restarts, we study the escape problem for a Brownian particle with a position-dependent restart rate $r(x)\theta(x^p_0-x)$, with $x^p_0$ being the location of restart. We find that position-dependent restarts delay the escape as compared to Kramers escape time. We also study ways of modifying time overheads which help expedite escape under restarts.</description>

      <title>SmoQyDEAC.jl: A differential evolution package for the analytic continuation of imaginary time correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the SmoQyDEAC.jl package, a Julia implementation of the Differential Evolution Analytic Continuation (DEAC) algorithm [N. S. Nichols et al., Phys. Rev. E 106, 025312 (2022)] for analytically continuing noisy imaginary time correlation functions to the real frequency axis. Our implementation supports fermionic and bosonic correlation functions on either the imaginary time or Matsubara frequency axes, and treatment of the covariance error in the input data. This paper presents an overview of the DEAC algorithm and the features implemented in the SmoQyDEAC.jl. It also provides detailed benchmarks of the package's output against the popular maximum entropy and stochastic analytic continuation methods. The code for this package can be downloaded from our GitHub repository at https://github.com/SmoQySuite/SmoQyDEAC.jl or installed using the Julia package manager. The online documentation, including examples, can be accessed at https://smoqysuite.github.io/SmoQyDEAC.jl/stable/.</description>

      <title>Dissipation at limited resolutions: Power law and detection of hidden dissipative scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium systems, in particular living organisms, are maintained by irreversible transformations of energy that drive diverse functions. Quantifying their irreversibility, as measured by energy dissipation, is essential for understanding the underlying mechanisms. However, existing techniques usually overlook experimental limitations, either by assuming full information or by employing a coarse-graining method that requires knowledge of the structure behind hidden degrees of freedom. Here, we study the inference of dissipation from finite-resolution measurements by employing a recently developed model-free estimator that considers both the sequence of coarse-grained transitions and the waiting time distributions: $\sigma_2=\sigma_2^\ell + \sigma_2^t$. The dominant term $\sigma_2^\ell$ originates from the sequence of observed transitions; we find that it scales with resolution following a power law. Comparing the scaling exponent with a previous estimator highlights the importance of accounting for flux correlations at lower resolutions. $\sigma_2^t$ comes from asymmetries in waiting time distributions. It is non-monotonic in resolution, with its peak position revealing characteristic scales of the underlying dissipative process, consistent with observations in the actomyosin cortex of starfish oocytes. Alternatively, the characteristic scale can be detected in a crossover of the scaling of $\sigma_2^\ell$. This provides a novel perspective for extracting otherwise hidden characteristic dissipative scales directly from dissipation measurements. We illustrate these results in biochemical models as well as complex networks. Overall, this study highlights the significance of resolution considerations in nonequilibrium systems, providing insights into the interplay between experimental resolution, entropy production, and underlying complexity.</description>

      <title>Divergence asymmetry and connected components in a general duplication-divergence graph model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This Letter introduces a generalization of known duplication-divergence models for growing random graphs. This general duplication-divergence model includes a new coupled divergence asymmetry rate, which allows to obtain the structure of random growing networks by duplication-divergence in a continuous range of configurations between two known limit cases (1) complete asymmetric divergence, i.e., divergence rates affect only edges of either the original or the copy vertex, and (2) symmetric divergence, i.e., divergence rates affect equiprobably both the original and the copy vertex. Multiple connected sub-graphs (of order greater than one) (of order greater than one) emerge as the divergence asymmetry rate slightly moves from the complete asymmetric divergence case. Mean-field results of priorly published models are nicely reproduced by this generalization. In special cases, the connected components size distribution $C_s$ suggests a power-law scaling of the form $C_s \sim s^{-\lambda}$ for $s&gt;1$, e.g., with $\lambda \approx 5/3$ for divergence rate $\delta \approx 0.7$.</description>

      <title>Emergent generalized symmetry and maximal symmetry-topological-order</title>

Abstract: A characteristic property of a gapless liquid state is its emergent symmetry and dual symmetry, associated with the conservation laws of symmetry charges and symmetry defects respectively. These conservation laws, considered on an equal footing, can't be described simply by the representation theory of a group (or a higher group). They are best described in terms of a topological order (TO) with gappable boundary in one higher dimension; we call this the symTO of the gapless state. The symTO can thus be considered a fingerprint of the gapless state. We propose that a largely complete characterization of a gapless state, up to local-low-energy equivalence, can be obtained in terms of its maximal emergent symTO. In this paper, we review the symmetry/topological-order (Symm/TO) correspondence and propose a precise definition of maximal symTO. We discuss various examples to illustrate these ideas. We find that the 1+1D Ising critical point has a maximal symTO described by the 2+1D double-Ising topological order. We provide a derivation of this result using symmetry twists in an exactly solvable model of the Ising critical point. The critical point in the 3-state Potts model has a maximal symTO of double (6,5)-minimal-model topological order. As an example of a noninvertible symmetry in 1+1D, we study the possible gapless states of a Fibonacci anyon chain with emergent double-Fibonacci symTO. We find the Fibonacci-anyon chain without translation symmetry has a critical point with unbroken double-Fibonacci symTO. In fact, such a critical theory has a maximal symTO of double (5,4)-minimal-model topological order. We argue that, in the presence of translation symmetry, the above critical point becomes a stable gapless phase with no symmetric relevant operator.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian transport distinguishes three usually equivalent notions of entropy production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend entropy production to a deeply quantum regime involving noncommuting conserved quantities. Consider a unitary transporting conserved quantities ("charges") between two systems initialized in thermal states. Three common formulae model the entropy produced. They respectively cast entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable, as an information-theoretic uncertainty measure, and as a quantifier of irreversibility. Often, the charges are assumed to commute with each other (e.g., energy and particle number). Yet quantum charges can fail to commute. Noncommutation invites generalizations, which we posit and justify, of the three formulae. Charges' noncommutation, we find, breaks the formulae's equivalence. Furthermore, different formulae quantify different physical effects of charges' noncommutation on entropy production. For instance, entropy production can signal contextuality - true nonclassicality - by becoming nonreal. This work opens up stochastic thermodynamics to noncommuting - and so particularly quantum - charges.</description>

      <title>Nambu-Goldstone modes in a lattice Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with multi flavor symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15922v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a lattice Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with SU(2) and SU(3) flavor symmetries of staggered fermions in the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian formalism. This type of four-fermion interactions has been widely used for describing low-energy behaviors of strongly interacting quarks as an effective model. In particular, we focus on the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the flavor symmetries. In the strong coupling regime for the interactions, we prove the following: (i) For the spatial dimension $\nu \ge 5$, the SU(3) model shows a long-range order at sufficiently low temperatures. (ii) In the case of the SU(2) symmetry, there appears a long-range order in the spatial dimension $\nu \ge 3$ at sufficiently low temperatures. (iii) These results hold in the ground states as well. (iv) In general, if a long-range order emerges in this type of models, then there appear gapless excitations above the sector of the infinite-volume ground states. These are nothing but the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the global rotational symmetry of flavors. (v) In particular, we establish that the number of the lineraly independent Nambu-Goldstone modes is equal to the number of the broken symmetry generators on the Hilbert space constructed from a certain symmetry-breaking infinite-volume ground state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the dependence of the critical properties of the Anderson model on the dimension $d$ in the language of $\beta$-function and renormalization group recently introduced in Ref.[arXiv:2306.14965] in the context of Anderson transition on random regular graphs. We show how in the delocalized region, including the transition point, the one-parameter scaling part of the $\beta$-function for the fractal dimension $D_{1}$ evolves smoothly from its $d=2$ form, in which $\beta_2\leq 0$, to its $\beta_\infty\geq 0$ form, which is represented by the regular random graph (RRG) result. We show how the $\epsilon=d-2$ expansion and the $1/d$ expansion around the RRG result can be reconciled and how the initial part of a renormalization group trajectory governed by the irrelevant exponent $y$ depends on dimensionality. We also show how the irrelevant exponent emerges out of the high-gradient terms of expansion in the nonlinear sigma-model and put forward a conjecture about a lower bound for the fractal dimension. The framework introduced here may serve as a basis for investigations of disordered many-body systems and of more general non-equilibrium quantum systems.</description>

      <title>General criterion for non-Hermitian skin effects and Application: Fock space skin effects in many body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity enables macroscopic accumulation of bulk states, named non-Hermitian skin effects. The non-Hermitian skin effects are well-established for single-particle systems, but their proper characterization for general systems is elusive. Here, we propose a general criterion of non-Hermitian skin effects, which works for any finite-dimensional system evolved by a linear operator. The applicable systems include many-body systems and network systems. A system meeting the criterion exhibits enhanced non-normality of the evolution operator, accompanied by exceptional characteristics intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems. Applying the criterion, we discover a new type of non-Hermitian skin effect in many-body systems, which we dub the Fock space skin effect. We also discuss the Fock space skin effect-induced slow dynamics, which gives an experimental signal for the Fock space skin effect.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Freezing in Exactly Solvable Models of Driven Chaotic Quantum Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The late-time equilibrium behavior of generic interacting models is determined by the coupled hydrodynamic equations associated with the globally conserved quantities. In the presence of an external time-dependent drive, non-integrable systems typically thermalize to an effectively infinite-temperature state, losing all memory of their initial states. However, in the presence of a large time-periodic Floquet drive, there exist special points in phase-space where the strongly interacting system develops approximate {\it emergent} conservation laws. Here we present results for an exactly solvable model of two coupled chaotic quantum dots with multiple orbitals interacting via random two and four-fermion interactions in the presence of a Floquet drive. We analyze the phenomenology of dynamically generated freezing using a combination of exact diagonalization, and field-theoretic analysis in the limit of a large number of electronic orbitals. The model displays universal freezing behavior irrespective of whether the theory is averaged over the disorder configurations or not. We present explicit computations for the growth of many-body chaos and entanglement entropy, which demonstrates the long-lived coherence associated with the interacting degrees of freedom even at late-times at the dynamically frozen points. We also compute the slow timescale that controls relaxation away from exact freezing in a high-frequency expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a two-phase field model and a hybrid particle-phase field model to simulate dilute colloidal sedimentation and flotation near a liquid-gas interface (or fluid-fluid interface in general). Both models are coupled to the incompressible Stokes equation, which is solved numerically using a combination of sine and regular Fourier transforms to account for the no-slip boundary conditions at the boundaries. The continuum two-phase field model allows us to analytically solve the equilibrium interfacial profile using a perturbative approach, demonstrating excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Notably, we show that strong coupling to particle dynamics can significantly alter the liquid-gas interface, thereby modifying the liquid-gas interfacial tension. In particular, we show that the renormalized surface tension is monotonically decreasing with increasing colloidal particle concentration and decreasing buoyant mass.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient path-integral molecular dynamics simulations with GPUMD using neuroevolution potentials: Case studies on thermal properties of materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations are crucial for accurately capturing nuclear quantum effects in materials. However, their computational intensity and reliance on multiple software packages often limit their applicability at large scales. Here, we present an integration of PIMD methods, including thermostatted ring-polymer molecular dynamics (TRPMD), into the open-source GPUMD package, combined with highly accurate and efficient machine-learned neuroevolution potential (NEP) models. This approach achieves almost the accuracy of first-principles calculations with the computational efficiency of empirical potentials, enabling large-scale atomistic simulations that incorporate nuclear quantum effects. We demonstrate the efficacy of the combined NEP-PIMD approach by examining various thermal properties of diverse materials, including lithium hydride (LiH), three porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), liquid water, and elemental aluminum. For LiH, our NEP-PIMD simulations successfully capture the isotope effect, reproducing the experimentally observed dependence of the lattice parameter on the reduced mass. For MOFs, our results reveal that achieving good agreement with experimental data requires consideration of both nuclear quantum effects and dispersive interactions. For water, our PIMD simulations capture the significant impact of nuclear quantum effects on its microscopic structure. For aluminum, the TRPMD method effectively captures thermal expansion and phonon properties, aligning well with quantum mechanical predictions. This efficient NEP-PIMD approach opens new avenues for exploring complex material properties influenced by nuclear quantum effects, with potential applications across a broad range of materials.</description>
