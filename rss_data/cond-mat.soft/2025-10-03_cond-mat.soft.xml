      <title>Robustness of classical nucleation theory to chemical heterogeneity of crystal nucleating substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous nucleation is a process wherein extrinsic impurities facilitate freezing by lowering nucleation barriers and constitutes the dominant mechanism for crystallization in most systems. Classical nucleation theory (\textsc{Cnt}) has been remarkably successful in predicting the kinetics of heterogeneous nucleation, even on chemically and topographically non-uniform surfaces, despite its reliance on several restrictive assumptions, such as the idealized spherical-cap geometry of the crystalline nuclei. Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations and jumpy forward flux sampling to investigate the kinetics and mechanism of heterogeneous crystal nucleation in a model atomic liquid. We examine both a chemically uniform, weakly attractive liquiphilic surface and a checkerboard surface comprised of alternating liquiphilic and liquiphobic patches. We find the nucleation rate to retain its canonical temperature dependence predicted by \textsc{Cnt} in both systems. Moreover, the contact angles of crystalline nuclei exhibit negligible dependence on nucleus size and temperature. On the checkerboard surface, nuclei maintain a fixed contact angle through pinning at patch boundaries and vertical growth into the bulk. These findings offer insights into the robustness of \textsc{Cnt} in experimental scenarios, where nucleating surfaces often feature active hotspots surrounded by inert or liquiphobic domains.</description>

      <title>Creases as elastocapillary gates for autonomous droplet control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplets are the core functional units in microfluidic technologies that aim to integrate computation and reaction on a single platform. Achieving directed transport and control of these droplets typically demands elaborate substrate patterning, modulation of external fields, and real-time feedback. Here we reveal that an engineered pattern of creases on a soft interface autonomously gate and steer droplets through a long-range elastocapillary repulsion, allowing programmable flow of information. Acting as an energy barrier, the crease bars incoming droplets below a critical size, without making contact. We uncover the multi-scale, repulsive force-distance law describing interactions between a drop and a singular crease. Leveraging this mechanism, we demonstrate passive and active filtration based on droplet size and surface tension, and implement functionalities such as path guidance, tunable hysterons, pulse modulators, and elementary logic operations like adders. This crease-based gating approach thus demonstrates complex in-unit processing capabilities - typically accessible only through sophisticated surface and fluidic modifications - offering a multimodal, potentially rewritable strategy for droplet control in interfacial assembly and biochemical assays.</description>

      <title>Boundaries Program Deformation in Isolated Active Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular structures must organize themselves within strict physical constraints, operating with finite resources and well-defined boundaries. Classical systems demonstrate only passive responses to boundaries, from surface energy minimization in soap films to strain distributions in elastic networks. Active matter fundamentally alters this paradigm - internally generated stresses create a bidirectional coupling between boundary geometry and mass conservation that enables dynamic control over network organization. Here we demonstrate boundary geometry actively directs network deformation in reconstituted microtubule-kinesin systems, revealing a programmable regime of shape transformation through controlled boundary manipulation. A coarse-grained theoretical framework reveals how boundary geometry couples to internal stress fields via mass conservation, producing distinct dynamical modes that enable engineered deformations. The emergence of shape-preserving and shape-changing regimes, predicted by theory and confirmed through experiments, establishes boundary geometry as a fundamental control parameter for active materials. The control principle based on boundaries advances both the understanding of biological organization and enables design of synthetic active matter devices with programmable deformation.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian Rotational Diffusion and Swing Motion of Dumbbell Probes in Two Dimensional Colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two dimensional (2D) colloids exhibit intriguing phase behaviors distinct from those in three dimensions, as well as dynamic heterogeneity reminiscent of glass-forming liquids. Here, using discontinuous molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the reporting dynamics of dicolloidal dumbbell probes in 2D colloids across the liquid-hexatic phase transition, where hexagonal bond-orientational order (HBOO) extends to quasi-long-ranged one. The rotational dynamics of dumbbell probes faithfully capture the structural and dynamical features of the host: Brownian in the isotropic liquid, and non-Gaussian in the hexatic and solid phases, reflecting both HBOO and dynamic heterogeneity of the medium. In the 2D hexatic and solid phases, probe rotation reflects heterogeneity as the dumbbells sample multiple dynamical domains of the host system: in mobile domains, they undergo rotational jumps of $\pi/3$ in accordance with HBOO, whereas in immobile domains they librate within cages formed by surrounding discs. Such non-Gaussianity disappears upon reentrant melting of the host medium driven by size polydispersity, highlighting a close connection between HBOO and probe dynamics. Furthermore, probe dynamics reveal both coupling (at a single particle level) and decoupling (at an ensemble-averaged level) between translation and rotation: swing motion emerges as their primary diffusion mode, while the Debye-Stokes-Einstein relation breaks down regardless of how the rotational diffusion coefficient is defined.</description>

      <title>libMobility: A Python library for hydrodynamics at the Smoluchowski level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective hydrodynamic modeling is crucial for accurately predicting fluid-particle interactions in diverse fields such as biophysics and materials science. Developing and implementing hydrodynamic algorithms is challenging due to the complexity of fluid dynamics, necessitating efficient management of large-scale computations and sophisticated boundary conditions. Furthermore, adapting these algorithms for use on massively parallel architectures like GPUs adds an additional layer of complexity. This paper presents the libMobility software library, which offers a suite of CUDA-enabled solvers for simulating hydrodynamic interactions in particulate systems at the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) level. The library facilitates precise simulations of particle displacements influenced by external forces and torques, including both the deterministic and stochastic components. Notable features of libMobility include its ability to handle linear and angular displacements, thermal fluctuations, and various domain geometries effectively. With an interface in Python, libMobility provides comprehensive tools for researchers in computational fluid dynamics and related fields to simulate particle mobility efficiently. This article details the technical architecture, functionality, and wide-ranging applications of libMobility. libMobility is available at https://github.com/stochasticHydroTools/libMobility.</description>

      <title>A spectrum of p-atic symmetries and defects in confluent epithelia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological defects provide a unifying language to describe how orientational order breaks down in active and living matter. Considering cells as elongated particles confluent, epithelial tissues can be interpreted as nematic fields and its defects have been linked to extrusion, migration, and morphogenetic transformations. Yet, epithelial cells are not restricted to nematic order: their irregular shapes can express higher rotational symmetries, giving rise to p-atic order. Here we introduce a framework to extract p-atic fields and their defects directly from experimental images. Applying this method to MDCK cells, we find that all symmetries generate defects.No strong positional or orientational correlations are found between nematic and hexatic defects, suggesting that different symmetries coexist largely independently. These results demonstrate that epithelial tissues should not be described by nematic order alone, but instead host a spectrum of p-atic symmetries. Our work provides the first direct experimental evidence for this multivalency of order and offers a route to test and refine emerging p-atic liquid crystal theories of living matter.</description>

      <title>Coupling free-surface geometry and localized ion dose for continuum models of radiation-induced nanopatterning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A first-principles understanding of the self-organization of highly regular, nanometer-scale structures atop irradiated semiconductor surfaces has been sought for decades. While numerous models exist which explain certain aspects of this phenomenon, a unified, physical model capable of explaining all details of pattern formation has remained elusive. However, it is increasingly apparent that such a model will require understanding the dual influence of the collision cascade initiated by ion implantation: first, as a source of material transport by sputtering and atomic displacements occurring over short time scales, and, second, as a source of defects permitting viscous flow within the thin, amorphous layer that results from sustained irradiation over longer time scales. To better understand the latter, we develop several asymptotic approximations for coupling the localized ion dose with an evolving free interface. We then show how theoretical predictions of quantities commonly used for comparison with experimental observations -- such as ripple wavelengths, critical irradiation angle for patterning onset, and surface roughening -- exhibit surprising sensitivity to the details of this coupling.</description>

      <title>In Situ Observation of Proton-Induced DNA Fragmentation in the Bragg Peak: Evidence for a Protective Role of Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report in situ single-molecule measurements of proton-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA immersed in water, using real-time fluorescence tracking along the entire proton path, including the Bragg peak region. By chemically suppressing radical-mediated processes, we isolate direct DNA damage mechanisms and determine DSB cross sections as a function of depth. Near the Bragg peak, we observe a tenfold reduction in DSB cross sections in aqueous DNA compared to dry DNA, providing quantitative evidence for the protective role of water. These findings highlight the importance of intermolecular energy dissipation in mitigating radiation-induced damage in condensed biological matter, with implications for radiobiology and proton therapy modeling.</description>

      <title>Folding lattice proteins confined on minimal grids using a quantum-inspired encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Steric clashes pose a challenge when exploring dense protein systems using conventional explicit-chain methods. A minimal example is a single lattice protein confined on a minimal grid, with no free sites. Finding its minimum energy is a hard optimization problem, withsimilarities to scheduling problems. It can be recast as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem amenable to classical and quantum approaches. We show that this problem in its QUBO form can be swiftly and consistently solved for chain length 48, using either classical simulated annealing or hybrid quantum-classical annealing on a D-Wave system. In fact, the latter computations required about 10 seconds. We also test linear and quadratic programming methods, which work well for a lattice gas but struggle with chain constraints. All methods are benchmarked against exact results obtained from exhaustive structure enumeration, at a high computational cost.</description>

      <title>Effective-medium theory for elastic systems with correlated disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlated structures are intimately connected to intriguing phenomena exhibited by a variety of disordered systems such as soft colloidal gels, bio-polymer networks and colloidal suspensions near a shear jamming transition. The universal critical behavior of these systems near the onset of rigidity is often described by traditional approaches as the coherent potential approximation - a versatile version of effective-medium theory that nevertheless have hitherto lacked key ingredients to describe disorder spatial correlations. Here we propose a multi-purpose generalization of the coherent potential approximation to describe the mechanical behavior of elastic networks with spatially-correlated disorder. We apply our theory to a simple rigidity-percolation model for colloidal gels and study the effects of correlations in both the critical point and the overall scaling behavior. We find that although the presence of spatial correlations (mimicking attractive interactions of gels) shifts the critical packing fraction to lower values, suggesting sub-isostatic behavior, the critical coordination number of the associated network remains isostatic. More importantly, we discuss how our theory can be employed to describe a large variety of systems with spatially-correlated disorder.</description>

      <title>Early-stage impact dynamics in dense suspensions of millimeter-sized particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19202v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the phenomenon of the early-stage dynamics of impact-induced hardening in dense suspensions, where materials undergo solidification upon impact. While Stokes flow theory traditionally applies to suspensions with micrometer-sized particles due to their low Reynolds numbers, suspensions containing larger particles defy such idealizations. Our work focuses on the early-stage impact-induced hardening of suspensions containing millimeter-sized particles through dynamic impact experiments. We are particularly interested in the maximum drag force $F_\mathrm{max}$ acting on the projectile as a function of the impact speed $u_0$. We successfully conducted experiments using these suspensions and confirmed the relation $F_\mathrm{max}\sim u_0^{3/2}$ for relatively large $u_0$ as observed in the previous studies suspensions of micrometer-sized particles. Our findings reveal that the early-stage behaviors of millimeter-sized particle suspensions align well with predictions from the floating model, typically applicable under Stokes flow conditions. This research sheds light on the complex dynamics of impact-induced hardening in dense suspensions, particularly with larger particles, advancing our understanding beyond conventional micrometer-sized systems.</description>

      <title>The emergent dynamics of double-folded randomly branching ring polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The statistics of randomly branching double-folded ring polymers are relevant to the secondary structure of RNA, the large-scale branching of plectonemic DNA (and thus bacterial chromosomes), the conformations of single-ring polymers migrating through an array of obstacles, as well as to the conformational statistics of eukaryotic chromosomes and melts of crumpled, non-concatenated ring polymers. Double-folded rings fall into different dynamical universality classes depending on whether the random tree-like graphs underlying the double-folding are quenched or annealed, and whether the trees can undergo unhindered Brownian motion in their spatial embedding. Locally, one can distinguish (i) repton-like mass transport around a fixed tree, (ii) the spontaneous creation and deletion of side branches, and (iii) displacements of tree node, where complementary ring segments diffuse together in space. Here we employ dynamic Monte Carlo simulations of a suitable elastic lattice polymer model of double-folded, randomly branching ring polymers to explore the mesoscopic dynamics that emerge from different combinations of the above local modes in three different systems: ideal non-interacting rings, self-avoiding rings, and rings in the melt state. We observe the expected scaling regimes for ring reptation, the dynamics of double-folded rings in an array of obstacles, and Rouse-like tree dynamics as limiting cases. Of particular interest, the monomer mean-square displacements of $g_1\sim t^{0.4}$ observed for crumpled rings with $\nu=1/3$ are similar to the subdiffusive regime observed in bacterial chromosomes. In our analysis, we focus on the question to which extent contributions of different local dynamical modes to the emergent dynamics are simply additive. Notably, we reveal a non-trivial acceleration of the dynamics of interacting rings, when all three types of local motion are present.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24120v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncovering the rules governing the nonequilibrium dynamics of the membranes that define biological cells is of central importance to understanding the physics of living systems. We theoretically and computationally investigate the behavior of flexible quasispherical vesicles that exchange membrane constituents, internal volume, and heat with an external reservoir. The excess chemical potential and osmotic pressure difference imposed by the reservoir act as generalized thermodynamic driving forces that modulate vesicle morphology. We show that the renormalization of membrane mechanical properties by nonequilibrium driving gives rise to a morphological transition between a weakly driven regime, in which growing vesicles remain quasispherical, and a strongly driven regime, in which vesicles accommodate rapid membrane uptake by developing surface wrinkles. Additionally, we propose a minimal vesicle growth-shape law, derived using insights from stochastic thermodynamics, that robustly describes vesicle growth dynamics even in strongly driven, far-from-equilibrium regimes.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal anti-aligning active mixtures: deriving the exact Boltzmann collision operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the effect of non-reciprocity in a binary mixture of self-propelled particles with anti-aligning interactions, where a particle of type A reacts differently to a particle of type B than vice versa. Starting from a well-known microscopic Langevin-model for the particles, setting up the corresponding exact N-particle Fokker-Planck equation and making Boltzmann's assumptions of low density and one-sided molecular chaos, the non-linear active Boltzmann equation with the exact collision operator is derived. In this derivation, the effect of phase-space compression and the build-up of pair-correlations during binary interactions is explicitly taken into account, leading to a theoretical description beyond mean-field. This extends previous results for reciprocal interactions, where it was found that orientational order can emerge in a system with purely anti-aligning interactions. Although the equations of motion are more complex than in the reciprocal system, the theory still leads to analytical expressions and predictions. Comparisons with agent-based simulations show excellent quantitative agreement of the dynamic and static behavior in the low density and/or small coupling limit.</description>

Abstract: We present a topology grounded, multiscale simulation platform for morphogenesis and biological active matter. Morphogenesis and biological active matter represent keystone problems in biology with additional, far-reaching implications across the biomedical sciences. Addressing these problems will require flexible, cross-scale models of tissue shape, development, and dysfunction that can be tuned to understand, model, and predict relevant individual cases. Current approaches to simulating anatomical or cellular subsystems tend to rely on static, assumed shapes. Meanwhile, the potential for topology to provide natural dimensionality reduction and organization of shape and dynamical outcomes is not fully exploited. TopoSPAM combines ease of use with powerful simulation algorithms and methodological advances, including active nematic gels, topological-defect-driven shape dynamics, and an active 3D vertex model of tissues. It is capable of determining emergent flows and shapes across scales.</description>
