      <title>Effect of seaweed, moringa leaf extract and biofertilizer on growth, yield and fruit quality of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) under greenhouse condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17984</link>

Abstract: This factorial experiment was conducted in a greenhouse during the period of May 3, 2021 to August 5, 2021 at the research farm belongs to the Horticulture Department, College of Agricultural Engineering Sciences, University of Sulaimani, Sulaimani, Iraq. The experiment was designed to study the effect of some biostimulants, individually and their combinations, on cucumber plants performance under greenhouse conditions; in addition to compare the results with of chemical fertilizers application. The treatments consisted of control (without adding any kinds of biostimulants) recommended dose of 100% chemical fertilizers (RDCF), seaweed extracts (SE), moringa leaf extract (MLE), bacterial-based biostimulant of Fulzym-plus (FP), that contains Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas putida, (SE+MLE), (SE+FP), (MLE+FP), and (SE+MLE+FP). The experiment was laid out in simple RCBD with 3 replications. The results showed that the application of different biostimulants, individually and their combinations, significantly improved the root growth characteristics. However, the highest values of lateral roots number per plant, lateral root length, lateral root diameter and root system dry weight were recorded by the application of recommended dose of chemical fertilizer (RDCF). While, this treatment was not different substantially with the triple combination of the tested biostimulants (SE+FP+MLE) in all studied root characteristics. In addition, untreated plants registered the minimum value of all the mentioned characters.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Image Transformers for Prostate Cancer Detection from Ultrasound Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PURPOSE: Deep learning methods for classifying prostate cancer (PCa) in ultrasound images typically employ convolutional networks (CNNs) to detect cancer in small regions of interest (ROI) along a needle trace region. However, this approach suffers from weak labelling, since the ground-truth histopathology labels do not describe the properties of individual ROIs. Recently, multi-scale approaches have sought to mitigate this issue by combining the context awareness of transformers with a CNN feature extractor to detect cancer from multiple ROIs using multiple-instance learning (MIL). In this work, we present a detailed study of several image transformer architectures for both ROI-scale and multi-scale classification, and a comparison of the performance of CNNs and transformers for ultrasound-based prostate cancer classification. We also design a novel multi-objective learning strategy that combines both ROI and core predictions to further mitigate label noise. METHODS: We evaluate 3 image transformers on ROI-scale cancer classification, then use the strongest model to tune a multi-scale classifier with MIL. We train our MIL models using our novel multi-objective learning strategy and compare our results to existing baselines. RESULTS: We find that for both ROI-scale and multi-scale PCa detection, image transformer backbones lag behind their CNN counterparts. This deficit in performance is even more noticeable for larger models. When using multi-objective learning, we can improve performance of MIL, with a 77.9% AUROC, a sensitivity of 75.9%, and a specificity of 66.3%. CONCLUSION: Convolutional networks are better suited for modelling sparse datasets of prostate ultrasounds, producing more robust features than transformers in PCa detection. Multi-scale methods remain the best architecture for this task, with multi-objective learning presenting an effective way to improve performance.</description>
