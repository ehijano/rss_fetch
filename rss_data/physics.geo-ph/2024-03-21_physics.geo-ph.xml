      <title>Earthquakes Three-Stage Early Warning and Short-Term Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article discusses the possibilities of three-step early warning and short-term prediction of earthquakes based on the classical geological model of fault formation and a model of the generation of electromagnetic emissions detected before earthquakes. These possibilities are revealed by the analysis of frequency data of VLF/LF electromagnetic radiation, existing before the earthquake preparation period.</description>

      <title>Modelling Evolutionary Power Spectral Density Functions of Strong Earthquakes Via Copulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach for analyzing seismic accelerograms using the evolutionary Power Spectral Density function (ePSDF). The accelerogram of an earthquake can be accurately modeled and simulated from its spectrogram, based on the oscillatory stochastic processes theory. To adequately characterize a spectrogram that is consistent with the response spectra, a parametric model with 16 parameters is proposed. This model describes the square of the amplitude spectrum, an envelope of the square of the accelerogram, and a copula that constructs a time-frequency model from the time and frequency marginals. The use of copulas to model a bivariate probability distribution is a common practice in statistics, particularly when the marginal distributions are known. The periodogram can be viewed as an unnormalized probability density function, where the total energy serves as the normalization constant, since the total energy of a seismic motion is always finite. Additionally, a reduced model consisting of only 10 parameters is presented, which may be especially valuable when only shear wave effects are relevant.</description>

      <title>Physics mechanisms of fines detachment and migration during CO2-water corefloods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key risks for a Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) is injectivity decline. Evaporation of the connate brine in near-wellbore region during CO2 injection may result in drying-up the rock yielding the mobilisation and migration of clay particles leading to decline rock permeability and consequent loss of well injectivity. Influx of the reservoir brine into the dried-up zone yields accumulation of precipitated salt and injectivity decline. This paper presents the results of eight coreflooding experiments aiming investigation of the effect of rock dry-out, fines migration, and salt precipitation during CO2 injection. Pressure drops across the cores, brine saturation and produced clay fines concentration versus Pore Volume Injected (PVI) have been measured. All lab tests exhibit the following features: intensive fines production at the very beginning of gas-water production period following reduced-rate fines production during overall evaporation period and continuous fines disappearance at the late stage; abrupt increase in gas permeability in the middle of evaporation, and non-monotonic evaporation rate and pressure drop. To explain these phenomena, we distinguished three sequential regimes of fines detachment during two-phase displacement: (i) moving gas-water menisci; (ii) pendular rings of residual water; (iii) dry flux, and found that for the conditions of our corefloods, detachment is possible in regime (i) only. Fines production during overall evaporation period is explained by simultaneous occurrence of three regimes during unstable displacement of water by gas in micro-heterogeneous rock.</description>

      <title>Design, implementation and application of the Marchenko Plane-wave algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Marchenko algorithm can suppress the disturbing effects of internal multiples that are present in seismic reflection data. To achieve this, a set of coupled equations with four unknowns is solved. These coupled equations are separated into a set of two equations with two unknowns using a time window. The two unknown focusing functions can be resolved by an iterative or direct method. These focusing functions, when applied to reflection data, create virtual point-sources inside the medium. Combining individual virtual point-sources into a plane-wave leads to an efficient computation of images without internal multiples. In this study the internal multiples are eliminated in a redatuming step which is part of the imaging algorithm. To use the Marchenko algorithm with plane-wave focusing functions, the time window that separates the unknowns must be adapted. The design of the plane-wave Marchenko algorithm is explained and illustrated with numerically modeled and measured reflection data.</description>

      <title>Note on Using Singular Value Decomposition to Solve Diluted Pore Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diluted pore networks or networks that are obtained directly from image analysis (e.g., CT scans of rock samples) are commonly used to evaluate flow through multiphase and complex porous media. These networks are often subjected to singular points and regions, that is, isolated sub-networks that are not connecting the inlet and outlet. These regions impair the invertibility of the Laplacian matrix and affect the accuracy and robustness of the pore network models. Searching and eliminating these singularities is commonly done by preconditioning or searching algorithms like breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS), which are time-consuming and computationally expensive. Here, we suggest using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to simultaneously locate and eliminate isolated regions and solve the flow equation. In this technical note, we briefly describe the SVD method and demonstrate its utility in solving the flow equation of different networks and dilution degrees. We show that the SVD is extremely robust, allowing exact solutions up to the percolation threshold. Moreover, we compare pore network solutions of images with and without singular regions to demonstrate how effective SVD is in locating and eliminating the singular regions while keeping the same solution in the relevant domain.</description>

      <title>Pore network models to determine flow statistics and structural controls in variably saturated porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conceptualizing a porous media as a network of conductors sets a compromise between the oversimplifying conceptualization of the media as a bundle of capillary tubes and the computationally expensive and unobtainable detailed description of the media's geometry needed for direct numerical simulations. These models are abundantly being used to evaluate single and multiphase flow characteristics. The different flow characteristics are valuable in evaluating phenomena that may or may not be relevant for different applications. Here, we evaluate how different information about the pore space affects the ability of the network model to evaluate different flow characteristics.</description>
