      <title>The Luminosity Function and Clustering of H$\alpha$ Emitting Galaxies at $z\approx4-6$ from a Complete NIRCam Grism Redshift Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the luminosity function (LF) and clustering properties of 888 H$\alpha$ emitters (HAEs) at $3.75 &lt; z &lt; 6$ in the GOODS-N field. The sample, built from JWST CONGRESS and FRESCO NIRCam grism surveys using a novel redshift assignment algorithm, spans $\sim$62 arcmin$^2$ and reaches $L_{\rm H\alpha} \sim 10^{41.2} {\rm erg s^{-1}}$. We identify two prominent filamentary protoclusters at $z \approx 4.41$ and $z \approx 5.19$, hosting 98 and 144 HAEs, respectively. The observed H$\alpha$ LFs show similar shallow faint-end slopes for both protocluster and field galaxies at $z=3.75-5$, and for the protocluster at $z=5-6$ ($\alpha\approx 1.2$ to $-1.3$). In contrast, the field LF at $z=5-6$ is much steeper ($\alpha=-1.87_{-0.23}^{+0.30}$), suggesting that protocluster galaxies at $z &gt; 5$ are more evolved, resembling those at $z=3.75-5$. The observed star formation rate density from H$\alpha$, integrated down to 0.45 ${\rm M_\odot yr^{-1}}$, is $0.050^{+0.002}_{-0.003}$ and $0.046^{+0.006}_{-0.004} M_\odot {\rm yr}^{-1} {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ at $z=3.75-5$ and $z=5-6$, with protoclusters contributing $\sim$25% and 55%, respectively. This implies that a large fraction of star formation at $z &gt; 4$ occurs in protoclusters. We conduct the first star-formation-rate-limited 3D clustering analysis at $z &gt; 4$. We find the filamentary protocluster geometry flattens the power-law shape of the HAE auto-correlation functions, with slopes much shallower than typically assumed. The auto-correlation function of field HAEs have correlation lengths of $r_0 = 4.61^{+1.00}_{-0.68} h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ at $z \approx 4-5$ and $r_0 = 6.23^{+1.68}_{-1.13} h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ at $z=5-6$. Comparing the observed correlation functions with the UniverseMachine simulation, we infer the dark matter (sub-)halo masses of HAEs to be $\log (M_h/M_\odot)=11.0-11.2$ at $z\approx 4-6$, with a scatter of 0.4 dex.</description>

      <title>ELVES-Dwarf I: Satellites Systems of Eight Isolated Dwarf Galaxies in the Local Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The satellite populations of Milky Way--mass systems have been extensively studied, significantly advancing our understanding of galaxy formation and dark matter physics. In contrast, the satellites of lower-mass dwarf galaxies remain largely unexplored, despite hierarchical structure formation predicting that dwarf galaxies should host their own satellites. We present the first results of the ELVES-Dwarf survey, which aims to statistically characterize the satellite populations of isolated dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume ($4&lt;D&lt;10$~Mpc). We identify satellite candidates in integrated light using the Legacy Surveys data and are complete down to $M_g\approx -9$ mag. We then confirm the association of satellite candidates with host galaxies using surface brightness fluctuation distances measured from the Hyper Suprime-Cam data. We surveyed 8 isolated dwarf galaxies with stellar masses ranging from sub-Small Magellanic Cloud to Large Magellanic Cloud scales ($10^{7.8} &lt; M_\star^{\rm host}&lt;10^{9.5}\, M_\odot$) and confirmed 6 satellites with stellar masses between $10^{5.6}$ and $10^{8} \, M_\odot$. Most confirmed satellites are star-forming, contrasting with the primarily quiescent satellites observed around Milky Way--mass hosts. By comparing observed satellite abundances and stellar mass functions with theoretical predictions, we find no evidence of a "missing satellite problem" in the dwarf galaxy regime.</description>

      <title>Counting Little Red Dots at $z&lt;4$ with Ground-based Surveys and Spectroscopic Follow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Little red dots (LRDs) are a population of red, compact objects discovered by JWST at $z&gt;4$. At $4&lt;z&lt;8$, they are roughly 100 times more abundant than UV-selected quasars. However, their number density is uncertain at $z&lt;4$ due to the small sky coverage and limited blue wavelength coverage of JWST. We present our ground-based search for LRDs at $2\lesssim z\lesssim4$, combining ultra-deep Hyper Suprime-Cam photometry and various (near-)infrared surveys within a total area of $\sim3.1\,\mathrm{deg^{2}}$. We find that for LRDs with $M_{5500}&lt;-22.5$, their number density declines from $\sim10^{-4.5}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ at $z&gt;4$ to $\sim10^{-5.3}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ at $2.7&lt;z&lt;3.7$ and $\sim10^{-5.7}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ at $1.7&lt;z&lt;2.7$. We also present the Magellan/FIRE spectrum of our first followed-up candidate, DEEP23-z2LRD1 at $z_\mathrm{spec}=2.26$, as a proof of concept for our sample selection. Similar to high-redshift LRDs, the spectrum of DEEP23-z2LRD1 exhibits broad H$\alpha$ emission with $\mathrm{FWHM}\approx2400\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and with nearly symmetric narrow H$\alpha$ absorption. Additionally, DEEP23-z2LRD1 has extremely narrow [OIII] lines with $\mathrm{FWHM}\approx140\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, suggesting the presence of an accreting black hole in a low-mass host galaxy. Limited by the angular resolution of ground-based surveys, we emphasize that spectroscopic follow-ups are required to characterize the contamination fraction of this sample and pin down LRD number density at $z&lt;4$.</description>

      <title>In the grip of the disk: dragging the companion through an AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been proposed as environments that can facilitate the capture of extreme-mass-ratio binaries and accelerate their inspiral beyond the rate expected from gravitational wave emission alone. In this work, we explore binaries shortly after capture, focusing on the evolution of the binary parameters when the system is still far from merger. We find that repeated interactions with the AGN disk typically reduce both the inclination and semi-major axis of the orbit. The evolution of the eccentricity is more intricate, exhibiting phases of growth and decay. Nevertheless, as the binary gradually aligns with the disk plane, the system tends to circularize. Interestingly, we also identify scenarios where initially highly eccentric, nearly counter-rotating orbits can undergo a rapid transition to co-rotation while maintaining a constant eccentricity. These dynamical effects could have significant implications for the modeling and interpretation of LISA sources.</description>

      <title>X-ray Constraints on Wandering Black Holes in Stripped Galaxy Nuclei in the Halo of NGC 5128</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset of galaxies have dense nuclei, and when these galaxies are accreted and tidally stripped, the nuclei can masquerade as globular clusters in the halos of large galaxies. If these nuclei contain massive central black holes, some may accrete gas and become observable as active galactic nuclei. Previous studies have found that candidate stripped nuclei rarely host luminous X-ray sources, but these studies were typically restricted to both the most massive candidate nuclei and the most luminous X-ray sources. Here we use new and archival Chandra and XMM-Newton data to search for X-ray emission in a near-complete sample of massive globular clusters and candidate stripped nuclei in the nearest accessible elliptical galaxy, NGC 5128. This sample has the unique advantage that the candidate stripped nuclei are identified dynamically via elevated mass-to-light ratios. Our central result is that 5/22 ($23^{+11}_{-6}$%) of the candidate stripped nuclei have X-ray sources down to a typical limit of $L_X \sim 5 \times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$, a fraction lower than or comparable to that among massive clusters with normal mass-to-light ratios (16/41; $39^{+8}_{-7}$%). Hence we confirm and extend the result that nearly all X-ray sources in stripped nuclei are likely to be X-ray binaries rather than active galactic nuclei. If the candidate stripped nuclei have black holes of typical masses $\sim 2 \times 10^{5} M_{\odot}$ needed to explain their elevated mass-to-light ratios, then they have typical Eddington ratios of $\lesssim 2 \times 10^{-6}$. This suggests that it will be challenging to conduct an accretion census of wandering black holes around even nearby galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Noctua Suite of Simulations -- The Difficulty of Growing Massive Black Holes in Low-Mass Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We study the individual and cumulative impact of stellar feedback processes on massive black hole (MBH) growth in a simulated low-mass dwarf galaxy. Methods. A suite of high-resolution radiation-hydrodynamic simulations called Noctua is performed, using the ArepoNoctua numerical framework for BHs in galaxy simulations. The chemical evolution of the gas is explicitly modelled in a time-dependent non-equilibrium way. Two types of stellar feedback are considered: individually-traced type II supernova (SNII) explosions, and radiatively transferred (on-the-fly) ionising stellar radiation (ISR) from OB stars. As part of the numerical framework, we develop and apply a novel physically-motivated model for MBH gas accretion, taking into account the angular momentum of the gas in the radiatively efficient regime, to estimate the gas accretion rate from the sub-grid accretion disc. Results. Without any stellar feedback, an initial $10^4~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ MBH is able to steadily grow over time, roughly doubling its mass after 800 Myr. Surprisingly, the growth of the MBH is more than doubled when only ISR feedback is considered, compared to the no stellar feedback run. This is due to the star formation rate (SFR) being highly suppressed (to a similar level or slightly above that when SNII feedback is considered), enabling a higher cumulative net gas inflow onto the MBH from not only the cold neutral- and molecular medium phases, but also the unstable- and warm neutral medium phases. With SNII feedback included, the gas accretion onto the MBH is episodic over time, and is suppressed by more than an order of magnitude already during the first 150 Myr. When combining SNII with ISR feedback, the growth of the MBH remains suppressed due to SNII feedback, but to a lesser extent compared to the SNII-only feedback run, due to a slightly lower SFR, and hence a reduced number of SNII events.</description>

      <title>Bridging Quasars and Little Red Dots: Insights into Broad-Line AGNs at $z=5-8$ from the First JWST COSMOS-3D Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of 13 broad-line AGNs at $z = 5 - 8$ from the first 10% data of the JWST Cycle 3 Treasury Program COSMOS-3D. These AGNs are identified by their broad H$\alpha$ or H$\beta$ emission lines through the NIRCam grism wide-field slitless spectroscopy. One object at $z = 7.646$ with broad H$\beta$ emission has an F444W magnitude of 23.6 mag, making it one of the brightest $z &gt; 7.5$ broad-line AGNs yet known. Among the 13 AGNs, 10 objects have reddened optical continua with slopes $\beta_{\rm opt}&gt;0$. The remaining three objects have their overall SEDs that resemble those of UV-luminous quasars at similar redshifts, but their $\beta_{\rm opt}$, though negative, are not as blue as those of unobscured quasars. We also obtain MIRI photometry at 7.7-18 $\mu$m for two AGNs and place strong constraints on their rest-frame near-IR SED. We find no significant variability in the rest-frame UV by comparing the COSMOS-3D and COSMOS-Web F115W images taken apart by 60 days in the rest-frame. We compute the H$\alpha$ luminosity functions (LFs) for the broad H$\alpha$ emitters at $z \approx 5-6$ and find a potential redshift evolution when compared with that of the $z \approx 4-5$ sample. We also derive the H$\beta$ LF at $z\sim8$ for AGNs and galaxies by combining our sample with those from the literature. The broad H$\beta$ emitters in this work suggest a number density two orders of magnitude higher than that predicted by the quasar LF based on rest-frame UV-selected samples. As a preview, our work showcases the ability of the COSMOS-3D grism survey to provide a complete view of the properties, growth, and evolution of bright broad-line AGNs at $z&gt;5$.</description>

      <title>MISTRAL: a model for radiatively efficient AGN winds in cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is crucial for regulating galaxy evolution. Motivated by observations of broad absorption line winds from rapidly accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), we introduce the Mistral AGN feedback model, implemented in the Arepo code. Mistral comes in two versions: continuous radial (Mistral-continuous) and stochastic bipolar momentum deposition (Mistral-stochastic). Using the framework of the IllustrisTNG simulations, we explore the effect of Mistral on BH and galaxy properties, through an idealized Milky Way-mass galaxy and cosmological zoom simulations run down to $z=2$. Unlike standard thermal AGN feedback prescriptions, Mistral generates galaxy-scale winds that mimic outflows driven by BH accretion. Mistral-continuous produces short-lived galactic fountains, and is inefficient at regulating the growth of massive galaxies at $z=2$. In contrast, Mistral-stochastic efficiently suppresses star formation in massive galaxies, and reproduces the empirical stellar-to-halo mass and ($z=0$) BH-stellar mass relations. By supporting large-scale ($&gt;50\,\rm kpc$) outflows while simultaneously preventing gas inflows, Mistral-stochastic additionally regulates the cold and hot gas fractions at both galaxy and halo scales. Mistral-stochastic therefore works self-consistently across the halo mass range explored $\left(10^{12}-3\times10^{13}\,\rm M_\odot\right)$, without adopting a SMBH-mass dependent AGN feedback scheme such as the one used in IllustrisTNG. Our model is a promising tool for predicting the impact of radiatively efficient AGN winds on galaxy evolution, and interpreting the growing population of high-redshift galaxies and quasars observed by JWST. This work is part of the "Learning the Universe" collaboration, which aims to infer the physical processes governing the evolution of the Universe.</description>

      <title>ZTF IC 10 variable catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08045v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study how massive variable stars effect their environment, we search for variability among Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) sources located within the optical extent of a nearby starburst galaxy IC 10. We present the ZTF IC 10 catalog, which classifies 1516 $r$ band sources and 864 $g$ band sources within a $225''$ radius around IC 10 into three categories: 1388 (767) $r$ ($g$) band non-variables, 150 (85) $r$ ($g$) band non-periodic variables, and 37 (12) $r$ ($g$) band periodic variables. Among them 101 (48) $r$ ($g$) band non-periodic variables, and 22 (4) $r$ ($g$) band periodic variables are inside IC 10. We verify our classification by cross-matching with previous variability catalogs and machine learning powered classifications. Various analysis including population demographics, color-magnitude diagrams, and cross matching with a set of different surveys and database such as Gaia, XMM-Newton, Chandra, and SIMBAD are also presented. Based on source density and parallax, we distinguish sources within IC 10 from non-IC 10 sources. For IC 10 sources, we highlight flaring super giants, a source with long secondary period, periodic super giants including possible S Doradus luminous blue variable and candidate Miras. For non-IC 10 sources, we present super red sources and compact objects such as a possible long period subdwarf and a periodic X-ray source. The catalog can serve as a useful database to study the connection between various type of massive stars and their host galaxies.</description>

      <title>Andromeda's asymmetric satellite system as a challenge to cold dark matter cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Andromeda galaxy is surrounded by a strikingly asymmetrical distribution of satellite dwarf galaxies aligned towards the Milky Way. The standard model of cosmology predicts that most satellite galaxy systems are near-isotropic, and dwarf associations observed in the local Universe are only weakly asymmetric. Here, we characterise the Andromeda system's asymmetry, and test its agreement with expectations from concordance cosmology. All but one of Andromeda's 37 satellite galaxies are contained within 107 degrees of our Galaxy. In standard cosmological simulations, less than 0.3% (0.5% when accounting for possible observational incompleteness) of Andromeda-like systems demonstrate a comparably significant asymmetry. None are as collectively lopsided as the observed satellite configuration. In conjunction with its satellite plane, our results paint the Andromeda system as an extreme outlier in the prevailing cosmological paradigm, further challenging our understanding of structure formation at small scales.</description>

      <title>Relationships between PAHs, Small Dust Grains, H$_2$, and HI in Local Group Dwarf Galaxies NGC 6822 and WLM Using JWST, ALMA, and the VLA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 0.7-3.3 pc resolution mid-infrared (MIR) JWST images at 7.7 $\mu$m (F770W) and 21 $\mu$m (F2100W) covering the main star-forming regions of two of the closest star-forming low-metallicity dwarf galaxies, NGC6822 and Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM). The images of NGC6822 reveal filaments, edge-brightened bubbles, diffuse emission, and a plethora of point sources. By contrast, most of the MIR emission in WLM is point-like, with a small amount of extended emission. Compared to solar metallicity galaxies, the ratio of 7.7 $\mu$m intensity ($I_\nu^{F770W}$), tracing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), to 21 $\mu$m intensity ($I_\nu^{F2100W}$), tracing small, warm dust grain emission, is suppressed in these low-metallicity dwarfs. Using ALMA CO(2-1) observations, we find that detected CO intensity versus $I_\nu^{F770W}$ at ~2 pc resolution in dwarfs follows a similar relationship to that at solar metallicity and lower resolution, while the CO versus $I_\nu^{F2100W}$ relationship in dwarfs lies significantly below that derived from solar metallicity galaxies at lower resolution, suggesting more pronounced destruction of CO molecules at low metallicity. Finally, adding in Local Group L-Band Survey VLA 21 cm HI observations, we find that $I_\nu^{F2100W}$ and $I_\nu^{F770W}$ vs. total gas ratios are suppressed in NGC6822 and WLM compared to solar metallicity galaxies. In agreement with dust models, the level of suppression appears to be at least partly accounted for by the reduced galaxy-averaged dust-to-gas and PAH-to-dust mass ratios in the dwarfs. Remaining differences are likely due to spatial variations in dust model parameters, which should be an exciting direction for future work in local dwarf galaxies.</description>

Abstract: In this chapter, we give an overview of the major components of the interstellar medium (ISM) in galaxies at a level appropriate for upper level undergraduates or beginning graduate students. We discuss the major constituents of the the ISM in present-day star forming galaxies and summarize common methods to observe these components. We also review basic aspects of ISM structure accessible to extragalactic observations. Finally, we describe variations in ISM content and star-formation activity among local universe galaxies.</description>

      <title>Comparing Optical Variability of Type 1 and Type 2 AGN from the BAT 9-Month Sample using ASAS-SN and TESS Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an optical variability analysis and comparison of the samples of Seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies, selected from the \textit{Swift} 9-month BAT catalog, using the light curves from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN). We measured the normalized excess variance of TESS and ASAS-SN light curves for each target and performed a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between the two samples, where our results showed significant differences. This is consistent with predictions from the unification model, where Seyfert 2s are obscured by the larger scale dust torus and their variability is suppressed. This variability difference is independent of the luminosity, Eddington ratio, or black hole mass, further supporting geometrical unification models. We searched the dependence of the normalized excess variance of Seyfert 1s on absolute magnitudes, Eddington ratio, and black hole mass, where our results are consistent with relations found in the literature. Finally, a small sub-sample of changing-look AGNs that transitioned during the time frame of the ASAS-SN light curves, with their variability amplitudes changing according to the classification, larger variability as type 1s and smaller as 2s. The change of variability amplitudes can be used to better pinpoint when the type transition occurred. The consistency trend of the variability amplitude differences between Seyfert 1s and 2s and between changing-look AGNs in 1 or 2 stages suggests that variability can be a key factor in shedding light on the changing-look AGN or the dichotomy between Seyfert 1 or 2 populations.</description>

      <title>On the nature of spiral arms in the interacting galaxy M51</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigated the radial variation of the azimuthal propagation of star formation across the spiral arms in the nearby galaxy NGC 5194 (M51a) by analysing the spatial separation between young star clusters and their nearest HII regions. The significant differences in the radial profiles of the mean azimuthal offsets in the M51a arms were found when the southern and northern arms were studied separately. The northern arm analysis showed that its radial profile is consistent with the predictions of stationary density wave theory for trailing spirals, while the explanation of the radial profile for the southern arm required its pattern speed to be higher than the rotation velocity of disc matter within the corotation circle, and lower than that outside of it. At the same time, these different radial profiles of the mean azimuthal offset in the two arms are joined by a common localization of corotation resonances, confirmed by independent studies using different methods.</description>

      <title>Stellar rotation in the intermediate-age massive cluster NGC 1783: clues on the nature of UV-dim stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, stellar rotation has emerged as a key factor in shaping the morphology of color-magnitude diagrams of young and intermediate-age star clusters. In this study, we use MUSE integral-field spectroscopy to investigate the stellar rotation of ~2300 stars in the 1.5 Gyr old cluster NGC 1783 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The effective temperature, surface gravity, radial velocity, and projected rotational velocity ($v\mathrm{sin}i$) of the entire sample were obtained within a Bayesian framework to derive robust estimates of these parameters along with their associated errors. The analysis shows that stars along the extended main sequence turn-off (eMSTO) cover a wide range of rotational velocities, from values consistent with no/slow rotation up to $v\mathrm{sin}i$ ~ 250 km/s. The distribution of stellar rotation velocities appears to play a crucial role in explaining the broadening of the eMSTO in this cluster, and a correlation is observed between $v\mathrm{sin}i$ and the color of the eMSTO stars, with $v\mathrm{sin}i$ increasing as the color becomes redder. Among the eMSTO stars, we investigate the peculiar population of stars strongly dimmed in the UV (so-called UV-dim stars), recently discovered in NGC 1783. UV-dim stars show clear photometric evidence of self-extinction and mild spectroscopic signatures typically observed in shell stars, thus suggesting that they have likely a decretion disc observed nearly equator-on. Interestingly, the study also shows that a significant fraction of UV-dim stars are slow rotators. We discuss potential implications these results may have on our understanding of the formation and evolution of UV-dim stars and we propose that the rotational properties of the UV-dim stars should vary with cluster age.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of actinides and short-lived radionuclides during i-process nucleosynthesis in AGB stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A complex interplay between mixing and nucleosynthesis is at work in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. In addition to the slow neutron capture process (s-process), the intermediate neutron capture process (i-process) can develop during protons ingestion events (PIEs). In this paper, after quickly reviewing the different modes of production of heavy elements in AGB stars that were identified so far, we investigate the synthesis of actinides and other short-lived radioactive nuclei (SLRs, $^{60}$Fe, $^{107}$Pd, $^{126}$Sn, $^{129}$I, $^{135}$Cs and $^{182}$Hf) during i-process nucleosynthesis. AGB stellar models with initial masses $1 \leq M_{\rm ini}/M_{\odot} \leq 3$, metallicities $-3 \leq $ [Fe/H] $ \leq 0$ and different overshoot strengths were computed with the stellar evolution code STAREVOL. During PIEs, a nuclear network of 1160 isotopes is used and coupled to the transport equations. We found that AGB models with [Fe/H] $&lt;-2$ can synthesize actinides with sometimes abundances greater than solar. The $^{60}$Fe yield scales with the initial metallicity while the $^{107}$Pd, $^{126}$Sn, $^{129}$I, $^{135}$Cs and $^{182}$Hf yields follow a similar pattern as a function of metallicity, with a production peak at [Fe/H] $\simeq -1.3$. At [Fe/H] $&lt;-1$, the fraction of odd Ba isotopes $f_{\rm Ba,odd}$ is predicted to vary between 0.6 and 0.8 depending on the initial mass and metallicity. Nuclear uncertainties on our $1 M_{\odot}$, [Fe/H] $=-2.5$ model lead to $f_{\rm Ba,odd}$ ranging between 0.27 and 0.76, which is clearly above the s-process value. AGB stars experiencing PIEs appear to be potential producers of actinides and SLRs, particularly at low metallicity (except for $^{60}$Fe). Galactic chemical evolution modeling are required to assess their possible contribution to the galactic enrichment.</description>

      <title>Disk-jet coupling across the spectral transition in supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion flows in both stellar and supermassive black holes show a distinct spectral transition. This is seen directly in binaries and changing look AGN, and also in a recent sample of eROSITA X-ray selected, unobscured AGN where the stacked spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for a single black hole mass bin (log $M/M_{\odot} =8-8.5$) clearly show the UV bright disk appearing as the luminosity increases. In binaries, this transition is associated with a change in radio jet, from coupling to the X-ray hot flow with $L_R \propto L_X^{0.7}$ (Fundamental Plane relation), to collapsing when the X-ray hot flow collapses into a disc. We explore the radio behaviour across the transition in our AGN sample by stacking VLASS images. We significantly detect weak radio emission even after subtracting the contribution from star formation in the host galaxy. The residual radio emission remains relatively constant across the transition, despite the mean mass accretion rate changing by a factor 6 and UV flux changing by a factor 100. However, the X-rays change by only a factor 2, giving a constant radio to X-ray flux ratio as predicted by the 'fundamental plane'. We show that this is consistent with these AGN having the same compact radio jet coupling to the X-ray hot flow (not the disc) as in the binaries. The most significant difference is the persistence of the coronal X-rays across the spectral transition in AGN, whereas in binaries the coronal X-rays can be very weak in the disc dominated state.</description>

      <title>The Herschel-SPIRE Dark Field -- II. A P(D) fluctuation analysis of the deepest Herschel image of the submillimetre universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Herschel-SPIRE Dark Field is the deepest field produced by the SPIRE instrument pushing down below the galaxy confusion limit in each of the 250, 350, 500 $\mu$m bands. Standard source extraction techniques inevitably fail because of this, and we must turn to statistical methods. Here, we present a P(D) - probability of deflection - analysis of a 12$'$ diameter region of uniform coverage at the centre of the Herschel-SPIRE Dark Field. Comparing the distribution of pixel fluxes from our observations to the distributions predicted by current literature models, we find that none of the most recent models can accurately recreate our observations. Using a P(D) analysis, we produce a fitted differential source count spline with a bump in the source counts at faint flux densities, followed by a turnover at fainter fluxes, required to fit the observations. This indicates a possible missing component from the current literature models that could be interpreted perhaps as a new population of galaxies, or a missing aspect of galaxy evolution. Taking our best-fitting results, we also calculate the contribution to the cosmic infrared background (CIB) in each of the bands, which all agree with the Planck CIB measurements in this field.</description>

      <title>Revisiting open clusters within 200 pc in the solar neighbourhood with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we develop a membership identification method and apply it for 30 open clusters (OCs) within 200 pc of the Sun using astrometric data of Gaia DR3. By accounting for projection effects that distort apparent stellar motions, our approach converts astrometric data into accurate five-dimensional positions and velocities. This approach enables better identification of members in nearby open clusters. We then compare our refined membership lists with previous catalogs, revealing more members in most open clusters, but also the identification of elongated structures in Melotte 25 (Hyades), NGC 2632 (Praesepe), Melotte 111 (Coma Berenices), Platais 3, Melotte 22 (Pleiades), NGC 2451A, Platais 9, IC 2391, Platais 8, UPK 640, HSC 2986, which we studied in detail. An analysis of the ages of their members reveals the members within and outside of the tidal radius are distinctly coeval, further validating our methodology. This study suggests that for OCs in the solar neighborhood, correcting for the projection effect is very important for identification of OC members.</description>

      <title>ExoMolHR: A Relational Database of Empirical High-Resolution Molecular Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ExoMolHR is an empirical, high-resolution molecular spectrum calculator for the high-temperature molecular line lists available from the ExoMol molecular database. Uncertainties, where available, in recommended ExoMol datasets are used to select highly accurate spectral lines. These lines largely rely on empirical energy levels generated through the MARVEL (measured active rotation vibration energy levels) procedure, which is being systematically used to improve the energy and transition data provided by the ExoMol database. The freely accessible ExoMolHR database provides line positions with calculated intensities for a user-specified wavenumber/wavelength range and temperature. Spectra can be plotted on the ExoMolHR website (https://www.exomol.com/exomolhr/) or downloaded as a CSV file. Cross sections can be calculated using the Python program PyExoCross. The ExoMolHR database currently provides 24307135 spectral lines for 33 molecules and 58 isotopologues; these numbers will increase as the ExoMol database is updated.</description>

      <title>PDRs4All XIII. Empirical prescriptions for the interpretation of JWST imaging observations of star-forming regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (Abridged) JWST continues to deliver incredibly detailed infrared (IR) images of star forming regions in the Milky Way and beyond. IR emission from star-forming regions is very spectrally rich due to emission from gas-phase atoms, ions, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Physically interpreting IR images of these regions relies on assumptions about the underlying spectral energy distribution in the imaging bandpasses. We aim to provide empirical prescriptions linking line, PAH, and continuum intensities from JWST images, to facilitate the interpretation of JWST images in a wide variety of contexts. We use JWST PDRs4All Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) imaging and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) integral field unit (IFU) and MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) spectroscopic observations of the Orion Bar photodissociation region (PDR), to directly compare and cross-calibrate imaging and IFU data at ~100 AU resolution over a region where the radiation field and ISM environment evolves from the hot ionized gas to the cold molecular gas. We measure the relative contributions of line, PAH, and continuum emission to the NIRCam and MIRI filters as functions of local physical conditions. We provide empirical prescriptions based on NIRCam and MIRI images to derive intensities of emission lines and PAH features. Within the range of the environments probed in this study, these prescriptions accurately predict Pa-$\alpha$, Br-$\alpha$, PAH 3.3 $\mu$m and 11.2 $\mu$m intensities, while those for FeII 1.644 $\mu$m, H$_2$ 1--0 S(1) 2.12 $\mu$m and 1--0 S(9) 4.96 $\mu$m, and PAH 7.7 $\mu$m show more complicated environmental dependencies. Linear combinations of JWST NIRCam and MIRI images provide effective tracers of ionized gas, H$_2$, and PAH emission in PDRs. We expect these recipes to be useful for both the Galactic and extragalactic communities.</description>

      <title>The Expanding 3 kpc Arms Are Neither Expanding nor Spiral Arms but X1 Orbits Driven by the Galactic Bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near the center of our Milky Way is a bar-like structure and the so-called Expanding 3-kpc arms. We currently have limited knowledge of this important region, since we are about 8.2 kpc from the center and cannot directly observe it at optical wavelengths, owing to strong extinction from interstellar dust. Here we present extremely precise VLBI measurements of water maser sources from the BeSSeL Survey, where extinction is not a problem, which accurately determine the 3-dimensional locations and motions of three massive young stars. Combined with previous measurements, these stars delineate a trail of orbits outlining the Milky Way's Galactic Bar. We present the first measurements capturing the dynamics of quasi-elliptical (X1) orbits around the Galactic Bar. Our findings provide evidence substantiating the existence of such orbits populated by massive young stars. Our measurements of the position and velocity of a number of massive young stars, previously identified with the Expanding 3-kpc arms, show that they are more likely located in the X1 orbits about the Galactic Bar. Also, some stars previously assigned to the Norma spiral arm appear to be in these orbits, which suggests that this spiral arm does not extend past the end of the bar.</description>

      <title>The Pristine survey: XXVIII. The extremely metal-poor stream C-19 stretches over more than 100 degrees</title>

Abstract: The discovery of the most metal-poor stream, C-19, provides us with a fossil record of a stellar structure born very soon after the Big Bang. In this work, we search for new C-19 members over the whole sky by combining two complementary stream-searching algorithms, STREAMFINDER and StarGO,, and utilizing low-metallicity star samples from the Pristine survey as well as Gaia BP/RP spectro-photometric catalogues. We confirm twelve new members, spread over more than 100$^\circ$, using velocity and metallicity information from a set of spectroscopic follow-up programs that targeted a quasi-complete sample of our bright candidates ($G \lesssim 16.0$). From the updated set of stream members, we confirm that the stream is wide, with a stream width of $\sim200$ pc, and dynamically hot, with a derived velocity dispersion of $10.9^{+2.1}_{-1.5}$ km/s. The tension remains between these quantities and a purely baryonic scenario in which the relatively low-mass stream (even updated to a few $10^4M_{\odot}$) stems from a globular cluster progenitor, as suggested by its chemical abundances. Some heating mechanism, such as preheating of the cluster in its own dark matter halo or through interactions with halo sub-structures appears necessary to explain the tension. The impact of binaries on the measured dispersion also remains unknown. Detailed elemental abundances of more stream members as well as multi-epoch radial velocities from spectroscopic observations are therefore crucial to fully understand the nature and past history of the most metal-poor stream of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolved circumnuclear coronal $[{\rm Fe\,VII}]\,\lambda6087$ emission in nearby Seyfert galaxies</title>

Abstract: Coronal lines are forbidden emission lines with a ionisation potential $\chi\gtrsim100\,{\rm eV}$. They are linked to energetic phenomena triggered by AGNs in the circumnuclear medium. We present the first high-angular-resolution integral-field analysis of the $[{\rm Fe\,VII}]\,\lambda6087$ coronal line in a sample of four nearby low-inclination Seyfert galaxies (three of Type 1 and one of Type 2). The data were obtained with the adaptive-optics-assisted mode of MUSE, and have angular resolutions of $0.06-0.18\,{\rm arcsec}$, allowing us to probe regions down to a few tens of parsecs in size. In three of the objects, we find a resolved coronal emission in a relatively compact configuration ($\lesssim200\,{\rm pc}$ in radius). The coronal emission is smooth and symmetric with respect to the centre of the galaxy, except for one object where an off-nucleus clump of emission is detected. Through the use of spectroastrometry we find that the $[{\rm Fe\,VII}]$ outflow of the Type 2 AGN host has a redshifted and a blueshifted component whose centroids are separated by $\sim20\,{\rm pc}$. We interpret this as evidence that some of the coronal emission comes from the inner part of a biconic outflow, also seen in low-ionisation lines. Similar $[{\rm Fe\,VII}]$ properties are found in two of the Type 1 AGN hosts, but with a much smaller separation between the centroids of the lobes of the outflow ($&lt;7\,{\rm pc}$). This could be due to the foreshortening of the axis of the bicone in Type 1 objects. We also studied the spectrum of the unresolved nuclear source and found that in three out of four galaxies a fraction of at least $\sim60\%$ of the $[\textrm{Fe VII}]$ emission has kinematics similar to those of $[{\rm O\,III}]$. We conclude that part of the coronal emission within the inner few tens of parsecs is co-spatial and shares kinematics with the outflows as traced by lower-ionisation lines.</description>

      <title>PECCARY: A novel approach for characterizing orbital complexity, stochasticity, and regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Permutation Entropy and statistiCal Complexity Analysis for astRophYsics (PECCARY) is a computationally inexpensive, statistical method by which any time-series can be characterized as predominantly regular, complex, or stochastic. Elements of the PECCARY method have been used in a variety of physical, biological, economic, and mathematical scenarios, but have not yet gained traction in the astrophysical community. This study introduces the PECCARY technique with the specific aims to motivate its use in and optimize it for the analysis of astrophysical orbital systems. PECCARY works by decomposing a time-dependent measure, such as the x-coordinate or orbital angular momentum time-series, into ordinal patterns. Due to its unique approach and statistical nature, PECCARY is well-suited for detecting preferred and forbidden patterns (a signature of chaos), even when the chaotic behavior is short-lived or when working with a relatively short duration time-series or small sets of time-series data. A variety of examples are used to demonstrate the capabilities of PECCARY. These include mathematical examples (sine waves, varieties of noise, sums of sine waves, well-known chaotic functions), a double pendulum system, and astrophysical tracer particle simulations with potentials of varying intricacies. Since the adopted timescale used to diagnose a given time-series can affect the outcome, a method is presented to identify an ideal sampling scheme, constrained by the overall duration and the natural timescale of the system. The accompanying PECCARY Python package and its usage are discussed.</description>

      <title>First confirmation of anisotropic halo bias from statistically anisotropic matter distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We confirm for the first time the existence of distinctive halo bias associated with the quadrupolar type of statistical anisotropy (SA) of the linear matter density field using cosmological $N$-body simulations. We find that the coefficient of the SA-induced bias for cluster-sized halos takes negative values and exhibits a decreasing trend with increasing halo mass. This results in the quadrupole halo power spectra in a statistically anisotropic universe being less amplified compared to the monopole spectra. The anisotropic feature in halo bias that we found presents a promising new tool for testing the hypothesis of a statistically anisotropic universe, with significant implications for the precise verification of anisotropic inflation scenarios and vector dark matter and dark energy models.</description>

      <title>Optical constraints on the coldest metal-poor population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coldest metal-poor population made of T and Y dwarfs are archaeological tracers of our Galaxy because they are very old and have kept the pristine material. The optical properties of these objects are important to characterise their atmospheric properties. We aim at characterising further the optical properties of ultracool metal-poor population with deep far-red optical images and parallax determinations.
  With a two-year baseline, we solved trigonometric parallaxes of the five metal-poor T dwarf candidates using Calar-Alto 3.5-m telescope. We obtained $z'$-band photometry for the other 12 metal-poor T dwarf candidates using 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias, the 8.2-m European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope, and the Dark Energy Survey, increasing the sample of T subdwarfs with optical photometry from 12 to 24. We report a 3-$\sigma$ limit for the only potential metal-poor Y dwarf, a.k.a., the Accident in five optical bands using the Gran Telescopio Canarias. We compared these objects with a known subdwarf benchmark and solar-metallicity dwarfs in colour-magnitude and colour-colour diagrams, as well as with state-of-the-art theoretical ultracool models. We confirm three more T subdwarfs and show that the Accident is subluminous compared to the current Y dwarf limit. Additionally, we propose two more Y subdwarf candidates.
  We emphasise that the $z_{PS1} - W1$ colour combining with the $W1 - W2$ colour could break the metallicity-temperature degeneracy for T and possibly for Y dwarfs. The $z_{PS1} - W1$ colour shifts redward when metallicity decreases for a certain temperature, which is not predicted by models. The Accident has the reddest $z_{PS1} - W1$ colour among our sample. The $z_{PS1} - W1$ colour will be useful to search for other examples of this cold and old population in upcoming and existing deep optical and infrared large-area surveys.</description>

      <title>Measuring anisotropies in the PTA band with cross-correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The astrophysical gravitational wave background in the nanohertz (nHz) band is expected to be primarily composed of the superposition of signals from binaries of supermassive black holes. The spatial discreteness of these sources introduces shot noise, which, in certain regimes, would overwhelm efforts to measure the anisotropy of the gravitational wave background. Moreover, the fact the time-residual map has a finite angular resolution and the presence of pulsar noise, affects our ability to construct the angular power spectrum of the anisotropy from a time-residual map (finite resolution noise). In this work, we explicitly demonstrate, starting from first principles, that cross-correlating a gravitational wave background map with a sufficiently dense galaxy survey can mitigate this issue. This approach could potentially reveal underlying properties of the gravitational wave background that would otherwise remain obscured. We quantify both the shot noise and the finite resolution noise level and show that cross-correlating the gravitational wave background with a galaxy catalog improves by more than one order of magnitude the prospects for a first detection of the background anisotropy by a gravitational wave observatory operating in the nHz frequency range. In particular, we find that with a futuristic scenario with an effective number of frequencies equal to $N_f=10$, the detection of the spectral amplitude can be achieved combining the first $20$ multipoles, with a threshold to resolve single events SKA-like. Increasing observation time, pulsar number or reducing the pulsar white noise considerably improves the detection significance.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Quasi-periodic Eruptions in the Tidal Disruption Event and Extreme Coronal Line Emitter AT2022upj: implications for the QPE/TDE fraction and a connection to ECLEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are recurring soft X-ray transients emerging from the vicinity of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in nearby, low-mass galaxy nuclei; about ten QPE hosts have been identified thus far. Here we report the \textit{NICER} discovery of QPEs in the optically-selected Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) and Extreme Coronal Line Emitter (ECLE) AT2022upj, exhibiting a large spread in recurrence times from 0.5-3.5 days, durations from 0.3-1 days, peak luminosities from $10^{42.5-43.0}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and erratic flare profiles. A wealth of evidence now links at least some QPEs to the newly-formed accretion flows emerging from TDEs; AT2022upj is the third QPE reported in an optically discovered TDE. Marginalizing over the uncertain distributions of QPE peak luminosity, recurrence time, delay after TDE peak, and lifetime, we use the burgeoning sample to make a Bayesian estimate that the fraction of optical TDEs resulting in QPEs within 5 years post-disruption is $9^{+9}_{-5}$\%. Along with AT2019qiz, AT2022upj also marks the second of the three optical TDE+X-ray QPEs showing coronal line emission, suggesting ECLEs may represent a subset of TDEs particularly efficient at forming QPEs and/or that sustained QPE X-ray emission contributes to coronal line emission in some galaxy nuclei.</description>

      <title>A systematic method to identify runaways from star clusters produced from single-binary interactions: A case study of M67</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One hypothesis for runaway stars (RSs) is that they are ejected from star clusters with high velocities relative to the cluster center-of-mass motion. There are two competing mechanisms for their production: supernova-based ejections in binaries, where one companion explodes, leaves no remnant, and launches the other companion at the instantaneous orbital velocity, and the disintegration of triples (or higher-order multiples), which produces a recoiled runaway binary (RB) and an RS. We search for RS candidates using data from the Gaia DR3 survey with a focus on triple disintegration since in this case the product is always a binary and a single star that should be moving in opposite directions. We created a systematic methodology to look for candidate RS-RB runaway pairs produced from the disintegration of bound three-body systems formed from single-binary interactions based on momentum conservation and causality. The method we use is general and can be applied to any cluster with a 5D kinematic data set. We used our criteria to search for these pairs in a 150 pc circular field of view surrounding the open cluster M67, which we used as a benchmark cluster to test the robustness of our method. Our results reveal only one RS-RB pair that is consistent with all of our selection criteria out of an initial sample of $10^8$ pairs.</description>

      <title>Galaxy and halo properties around cosmic filaments from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 and the ELUCID simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) along with haloes from the dark matter only constrained ELUCID (Exploring the Local Universe with the reConstructed Initial Density field) simulation, we examine the properties of galaxies and haloes with respect to their distance to cosmic filaments, determined by the medial-axis thinning technique of the COsmic Web Skeleton (COWS) method. Our findings suggest that galaxies or subhaloes grow in mass as they approach these filaments. Galaxies exhibit a redder colour and diminished specific star formation rates as they approach these filaments. Additionally, older subhaloes tend to be more common near the central regions of these filaments. Elliptical galaxies are more frequently found than spiral galaxies in the central regions of the filaments. Lower-mass galaxies typically display reduced sizes in proximity to filaments, whereas higher-mass galaxies tend to exhibit increased sizes when close to filaments. Moreover, the concentration and spin of the haloes grow as they approach the filaments. These findings support the notion that the large-scale structure of the universe, characterized by cosmic web structures, plays a vital role in shaping galaxy and halo properties.</description>
