      <title>Twisting of Lie triple systems, $L_\infty$-algebras, and (generalized) matched pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce notions of (proto-, quasi-)twilled Lie triple systems and give their equivalent descriptions using the controlling algebra and bidegree convention. Then we construct an $L_\infty$-algebra via a twilled Lie triple system. Besides, we establish the twisting theory of Lie triple systems and then characterize the twisting as a Maurer-Cartan element in the constructed $L_\infty$-algebra. Finally, we clarify the relationship between twilled Lie triple systems and matched pairs and clarify the relationship between twilled Lie triple systems and relative Rota-Baxter operators respectively so that we obtain the relationship between matched pairs of Lie triple systems and relative Rota-Baxter operators.</description>

      <title>The algebraic and geometric classification of compatible Pre-Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a method to obtain the algebraic classification of compatible pre-Lie algebras from the classification of pre-Lie algebras of the same dimension. We use this method to obtain the algebraic classification of complex $2$-dimensional compatible pre-Lie algebras. As a byproduct, we obtain the classification of complex $2$-dimensional compatible commutative associative, compatible associative, and compatible Novikov algebras. In addition, we consider the geometric classification of varieties of cited algebras, that is the description of its irreducible components.</description>

      <title>Extending Structures for Dendriform Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we devote to extending structures for dendriform algebras. First, we define extending datums and unified products of dendriform algebras, and theoretically solve the extending structure problem. As an application, we consider flag datums as a special case of extending structures, and give an example of the extending structure problem. Second, we introduce matched pairs and bicrossed products of dendriform algebras and theoretically solve the factorization problem for dendriform algebras. Moreover, we also introduce cocycle semidirect products and nonabelian semidirect products as special cases of unified products. Finally, we define the deformation map on a dendriform extending structure (more general case), not necessary a matched pair, which is more practical in the classifying complements problem.</description>

      <title>A parametrization of nonassociative cyclic algebras of prime degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine and explicitly parametrize the isomorphism classes of nonassociative quaternion algebras over a field of characteristic different from two, as well as the isomorphism classes of nonassociative cyclic algebras of odd prime degree when the base field contains a primitive $m$th root of unity. In the course of doing so, we prove that any two such algebras can be isomorphic only if the cyclic field extension and the chosen generator of the Galois group are the same. As an application, we give a parametrization of nonassociative cyclic algebras of prime degree over a local nonarchimedean field $F$, which is entirely explicit under mild hypotheses on the residual characteristic. In particular, this gives a rich understanding of the important class of nonassociative quaternion algebras up to isomorphism over nonarchimedean local fields.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of commutative semisimple finite group algebras using the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, and let $G$ be a finite abelian group with order coprime to $q$. We present a full decomposition of the semisimple group algebra $\mathbb{F}_q[G]$. This was achieved by studying algebraic properties of coordinate rings of the form $\mathbb{F}_q[X_1, \ldots ,X_n] / ( X_1^{m_1} - 1, \ldots, X_n^{m_n} - 1 )$, which omits the use of finding primitive idempotents and character theory. We discuss some properties of this decomposition, like providing a formula for the number of simple components. Moreover, we discuss some applications in cryptography, and the classification of all irreducible representations of $G$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ up to isomorphism.</description>

      <title>The necessity of (co)unit in nearly Frobenius algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we concern the concept of nearly Frobenius algebra, which corresponds to most 2D-TQFT of which each cobordism admits no critical points of index 0 or 2. We prove that any nearly Frobenius algebra over a principal ideal domain with surjective multiplication and injective comultiplication is indeed a Frobenius algebra. The motivation of this study mainly emanates from the investigation of potential constructions of link homology.</description>

      <title>Symmetric monoidal categories of conveniently-constructible Banach bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a continuously-normed Banach bundle $\mathcal{E}$ over a compact Hausdorff space $X$ whose space of sections is algebraically finitely-generated (f.g.) over $C(X)$ is locally trivial (and hence the section space is projective f.g over $C(X)$); this answers a question of I. Gogi{\'c}. As a preliminary we also provide sufficient conditions for a quotient bundle to be continuous phrased in terms of the Vietoris continuity of the unit-ball maps attached to the bundles. Related results include (a) the fact that the category of topologically f.g. continuous Banach bundles over $X$ form a symmetric monoidal category under the (fiber-wise-maximal) tensor product, (b) the full faithfulness of the global-section functor from topologically f.g. continuous bundles to $C(X)$-modules and (c) the consequent identification of the algebraically f.g. bundles as precisely the rigid objects in the aforementioned symmetric monoidal category.</description>

      <title>Virtually regular modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We call a right module $M$ (strongly) virtually regular if every (finitely generated) cyclic submodule is isomorphic to a direct summand. $M$ is said to be completely virtually regular if every submodule is virtually regular. In this paper, characterizations and some closure properties of the aforementioned modules are given. Several structure results are obtained over commutative rings. In particular, the structures of finitely presented (strongly) virtually regular modules and completely virtually regular modules are fully determined over valuation domains. Namely, for a valuation domain $R$ with the unique maximal ideal $P$, we show that finitely presented (strongly) virtually regular modules are free if and only if $P$ is not principal; and that $P=Rp$ is principal if and only if finitely presented virtually regular modules are of the form $$R^n \oplus (\frac{R}{Rp})^{n_1} \oplus (\frac{R}{Rp^2})^{n_2} \oplus \cdots \oplus (\frac{R}{Rp^k})^{n_k}$$ for nonnegative integers $n,\,k,\,n_1,\,n_2,\cdots ,n_k.$ Similarly, we prove that $P=Rp$ is principal if and only if finitely presented strongly virtually regular modules are of the form $ R^n \oplus (\frac{R}{Rp})^{m}$, where $m,n$ are nonnegative integers.
  We also obtain that, $R$ admits a nonzero finitely presented completely virtually regular module $M$ if and only if $P=Rp$ is principal. Moreover, for a finitely presented $R$-module $M$, we prove that: $(i)$ if $R$ is not a DVR, then $M$ is completely virtually regular if and only if $M \cong (\frac{R}{Rp})^{m}$; and $(ii)$ if $R$ is a DVR, then $M$ is completely virtually regular if and only if $M\cong R^n \oplus (\frac{R}{Rp})^{m}.$ Finally, we obtain a characterization of finitely generated virtually regular modules over the ring of integers.</description>

      <title>Canonical Filtrations of Finite-Dimensional Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study canonical filtrations of finite-dimensional associative algebras and Lie algebras. These filtrations are defined via optimal destabilizing one-parameter subgroups in the sense of geometric invariant theory (GIT), and appear to be a new invariant of finite-dimensional algebras. We establish some fundamental properties of these filtrations, and show that an algebra is semisimple if and only if it is GIT semistable. We give a method to compute canonical filtrations of algebras whose automorphism group or module of derivations is sufficiently rich, and use this to compute these filtrations in examples when the automorphism group contains a sufficiently large torus. We also obtain some results on the structure of the associated graded algebra of the canonical filtration of an associative algebra.</description>

      <title>Associativity and Commutativity of Partially Ordered Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03627v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a commutative monoid $(M,+,0)$ and a biadditive binary operation $\mu \colon M \times M \to M$. We will show that under some additional general assumptions, the operation $\mu$ is automatically both associative and commutative. The main additional assumption is localizability of $\mu$, which essentially means that a certain canonical order on $M$ is compatible with adjoining some multiplicative inverses of elements of $M$. As an application we show that a division ring $\mathbb F$ is commutative provided that for all $a \in \mathbb F$ there exists a natural number $k$ such that $a-k$ is not a sum of products of squares. This generalizes the classical theorem that every archimedean ordered division ring is commutative to a more general class of formally real division rings that do not necessarily allow for an archimedean (total) order. Similar results about automatic associativity and commutativity are well-known for special types of partially ordered extended rings (``extended'' in the sense that neither associativity nor commutativity of the multiplication is required by definition), namely in the uniformly bounded and the lattice-ordered cases, i.e.~for (extended) $f$-rings. In these cases the commutative monoid in question is the positive cone of the partially ordered extended ring. We also discuss how these classical results can be obtained from our main theorem.</description>

      <title>When Leibniz algebras are Nijenhuis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leibniz algebras can be seen as a ``non-commutative" analogue of Lie algebras. Nijenhuis operators on Leibniz algebras introduced by Cari\~{n}ena, Grabowski, and Marmo in [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 37(2004)] are (1, 1)-tensors with vanishing Nijenhuis torsion. Recently triangular Leibniz bialgebras were introduced by Tang and Sheng in [J. Noncommut. Geom. 16(2022)] via the twisting theory of twilled Leibniz algebras. In this paper we find that Leibniz algebras are very closely related to Nijenhuis operators, and prove that a triangular symplectic Leibniz bialgebra together with a dual triangular structure must possess Nijenhuis operators, which makes it possible to study the applications of Nijehhuis operators from the perspective of Leibniz algebras. At the same time, we regain the classical Leibniz Yang-Baxter equation by using the tensor form of classical $r$-matrics. At last we give the classification of triangular Leibniz bialgebras of low dimensions.</description>

      <title>Results on left-right approximation for k-Nash morphisms and for k-analytic morphisms of weakly finite singularity type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard Artin approximation (AP) is not readily applicable to the left-right equivalence of morphisms Maps((k^n,o),(k^m,o)). Moreover, the na\"ive extension does not hold in the k-analytic case, because of Osgood-Gabrielov-Shiota examples.
  The left-right version of Artin approximation (LRAP) was established by M. Shiota for morphisms that are either Nash or [real-analytic and of finite singularity type]. We establish LRAP and its stronger version of P{\l}oski (LRAPP) for Maps(X,Y) where X,Y are k-analytic/k-Nash germs of schemes of any characteristic.
  More precisely:
  *(k-algebraic power series, k&lt;x&gt;/J_X and k&lt;y&gt;/J_Y) LRAP, LRAPP, the inverse Artin approximation (and its P{\l}oski's version) hold for any morphism.
  *(k-analytic power series, k{x}/J_X and k{y}/J_Y) LRAP, LRAPP, the inverse Artin approximation (and its P{\l}oski's version) hold for finite morphisms.
  * LRAP holds for analytic morphisms of weakly-finite singularity type.
  This later class of morphisms of ``weakly-finite singularity type" (which we introduce) is of separate importance. It extends naturally the class of morphisms of ``finite singularity type", while preserving their non-pathological behaviour. The definition goes via the higher critical loci of morphisms with singular target. (The critical locus Crit_X f is defined via the Zariski-Lipman sequence.)
  We establish basic properties of these critical loci. In particular: any map is finitely (right) determined by its higher singular loci.</description>

      <title>Interval Replacements of Persistence Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define two notions. The first one is a $compression\ system$ $\xi$ for a finite poset $\mathbf{P}$, which assigns each interval subposet $I$ to a poset morphism $\xi_I \colon Q_I \to \mathbf{P}$ satisfying some conditions, where $Q_I$ is a connected finite poset. An example is given by the $total$ compression system that assigns each $I$ to the inclusion of $I$ into $\mathbf{P}$. The second one is an $I$-$rank$ of a persistence module $M$ under $\xi$, the family of which is called the $interval\ rank\ invariant$ of $M$ under $\xi$. A compression system $\xi$ makes it possible to define the $interval\ replacement$ (also called the interval-decomposable approximation) not only for 2D persistence modules but also for any persistence modules over any finite poset. We will show that the forming of the interval replacement preserves the interval rank invariant, which is a stronger property than the preservation of the usual rank invariant. Moreover, to know what is preserved explicitly, we will give a formula of the $I$-rank of $M$ under $\xi$ in terms of the structure linear maps of $M$ for any compression system $\xi$, and give a sufficient condition for the $I$-rank of $M$ under $\xi$ to coincide with that under the total compression system, the value of which is equal to the generalized rank invariant introduced by Kim--M\'emoli.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that even dimensional Fermat cubic hypersurfaces are rational over any field of characteristic different from three by producing explicit rational parametrizations given by polynomials of low degree. As a byproduct of our rationality constructions we get estimates on the number of their rational points over a number field, and a class of quadro-cubic Cremona correspondences of even dimensional projective spaces.</description>
