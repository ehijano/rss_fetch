      <title>Elliptic and parabolic equations with rough boundary data in Sobolev spaces with degenerate weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the inhomogeneous boundary value problem for elliptic and parabolic equations in divergence form in the half space $\{x_d &gt; 0\}$, where the coefficients are measurable, singular or degenerate, and depend only on $x_d$. The boundary data are considered in Besov spaces of distributions with negative orders of differentiability in the range $(-1,0]$. The solution spaces are weighted Sobolev spaces with power weights that decay rapidly near the boundary, and are outside the Muckenhoupt $A_p$ class. Sobolev spaces with such weights contain functions that are very singular near the boundary and do not possess a trace on the boundary. Consequently, solutions may not exist for arbitrarily prescribed boundary data and right-hand sides of the equations. We establish a natural structural condition on the right-hand sides of the equations under which the boundary value problem is well-posed.</description>

      <title>Fundamental solution to the heat equation with a dynamical boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an explicit representation of the fundamental solution to the heat equation on a half-space of ${\mathbb R}^N$ with the homogeneous dynamical boundary condition, and obtain upper and lower estimates of the fundamental solution. These enable us to obtain sharp decay estimates of solutions to the heat equation with the homogeneous dynamical boundary condition. Furthermore, as an application of our decay estimates, we identify the so-called Fujita exponent for a semilinear heat equation on the half-space of ${\mathbb R}^N$ with the homogeneous dynamical boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Low Mach number limit for the global large solutions to the $2$D Navier--Stokes--Korteweg system in the critical $\widehat{L^p}$ framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we consider the compressible Navier--Stokes--Korteweg system on the $2$D whole plane and show that a unique global solution exists in the scaling critical Fourier--Besov spaces for arbitrary large initial data provided that the Mach number is sufficiently small. Moreover, we also show that the global solution converges to the $2$D incompressible Navier--Stokes flow in the singular limit of zero Mach number. The key ingredient of the proof lies in the nonlinear stability estimates around the large incompressible flow via the Strichartz estimate for the linearized equations in Fourier--Besov spaces.</description>

      <title>Linear and nonlinear stability for the $3$D stratified Boussinesq equations with the horizontal viscosity and diffusivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we consider the $3$D Boussinesq equations for stably stratified fluids with the horizontal viscosity and thermal diffusivity and investigate the large time behavior of the solutions. Making use of the anisotropic Littlewood--Paley theory, we obtain their precise $L^1$-$L^p$ decay estimates, which provide us information on both the anisotropic and dispersive structure of the system. More precisely, we reveal that the dispersion from the skew symmetric terms of stratification makes the decay rates of some portions of the solutions faster and furthermore the third component of the velocity field exhibit the enhanced dissipative effect, which provides the additional fast decay rate.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Steklov problem on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map encodes the voltage-to-current measurements under the influence of a magnetic field. In the case of surfaces, we provide precise spectral asymptotics expansion (up to arbitrary polynomial power) for the eigenvalues of this map. Moreover, we consider the inverse spectral problem and from the expansion we show that the spectrum of the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, in favourable situations, uniquely determines the number and the length of boundary components, the parallel transport and the magnetic flux along boundary components. In general, we show that the situation complicates compared to the case when there is no magnetic field. For instance, there are plenty of examples where the expansion does $\textit{not}$ detect the number of boundary components, and this phenomenon is thoroughly studied in the paper.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the Nonlocal Allen-Cahn Equation to Mean Curvature Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove convergence of the nonlocal Allen-Cahn equation to mean curvature flow in the sharp interface limit, in the situation when the parameter corresponding to the kernel goes to zero fast enough with respect to the diffuse interface thickness. The analysis is done in the case of a $W^{1,1}$-kernel, under periodic boundary conditions and in both two and three space dimensions. We use the approximate solution and spectral estimate from the local case, and combine the latter with an $L^2$-estimate for the difference of the nonlocal operator and the negative Laplacian from Abels, Hurm arXiv:2307.02264. To this end, we prove a nonlocal Ehrling-type inequality to show uniform $H^3$-estimates for the nonlocal solutions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Cauchy problem of the parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel system with the logistic-type term $au-bu^\gamma$ on $\mathbb{R}^N, N\geq2$. We discuss the global boundedness of classical solutions with nonnegative bounded and uniformly continuous initial functions when $\gamma&gt;1$. Moreover, based on the persistence of classical solution we show the large time behavior of the positive constant equilibria with strictly positive initial function in the case of $\gamma\in(1,2)$.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov stability of the equilibrium of the non-local continuity equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with the development of Lyapunov methods for the analysis of equilibrium stability in a dynamical system on the space of probability measures driven by a non-local continuity equation. We derive sufficient conditions of stability of an equilibrium distribution relying on an analysis of a non-smooth Lyapunov function. For the linear dynamics we reduce the stability analysis to a study of a quadratic form on a tangent space to the space of probability measures. These results are illustrated by the studies of the stability of the equilibrium measure for gradient flow in the space of probability measures and Gibbs measure for a system of coupled mathematical pendulums.</description>

      <title>Dissipation estimates of the Fisher information for the Landau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an a priori estimate for the dissipation of the Fisher information for the space-homogeneous Landau equation with very soft potentials. This work is motivated by the recent breakthrough by Guillen and Silvestre, which proves that the Fisher information is monotone decreasing. As a direct consequence, we show that the Fisher information becomes instantaneously bounded, even if it is not initially bounded. This leads to a proof of the global existence of smooth solutions for the space-homogeneous Landau equation with very soft potentials, given initial data $f_0 \in L^1_{2-\gamma} \cap L \log L$. This result includes the case of the Coulomb potential.</description>

      <title>Curve Shortening Flow of Space Curves with Convex Projections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that under Space Curve Shortening flow any closed immersed curve in $\mathbb R^n$ whose projection onto $\mathbb{R}^2\times\{\vec{0}\}$ is convex remains smooth until it shrinks to a point. Throughout its evolution, the projection of the curve onto $\mathbb{R}^2\times\{\vec{0}\}$ remains convex.
  As an application, we show that any closed immersed curve in $\mathbb R^n$ can be perturbed to an immersed curve in $\mathbb R^{n+2}$ whose evolution by Space Curve Shortening shrinks to a point.</description>

      <title>Non-collapsing, non-inflating and convergence results for solutions to Ricci flow with $L^{p}$ bounded scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study $n$-dimensional Ricci flows $(M^n,g(t))_{t\in [0,T)},$ where $T&lt; \infty$ is a potentially singular time, and for which the spatial $L^p$ norm, $p&gt;\frac n 2$, of the scalar curvature is uniformly bounded on $[0,T).$
  In the case that $M$ is closed, we show that non-collapsing and non-inflating estimates hold. If we further assume that $n=4$ or that $M^n$ is K\"ahler, we explain how these non-inflating/non-collapsing estimates can be combined with integral bounds on the Ricci and full curvature tensor of the prequel paper arXiv:2406.02351 to obtain an improved space time integral bound of the Ricci curvature.
  As an application of these estimates, we show that if we further restrict to $n=4$, then the solution convergences to an orbifold as $t \to T$ and that the flow can be extended using the Orbifold Ricci flow to the time interval $ [0,T+\sigma)$ for some $\sigma&gt;0.$
  We also prove local versions of many of the results mentioned above.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove an upper bound on the $\widehat{A}$ genus of a smooth, closed, spin Riemannian manifold using its scalar curvature lower bound, Neumann isoperimetric constant, and volume. The proof of this result relies on spectral analysis of the Dirac operator. We also construct an example to show that the Neumann isoperimetric constant in this bound is necessary. Our result partially answers a question of Gromov on bounding characteristic numbers using scalar curvature lower bound.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present the mathematical analysis of the convergence of the linearized Crank-Nicolson Galerkin method for a nonlinear Schrodinger problem related to a domain with a moving boundary. The convergence analysis of the numerical method is carried out for both semi-discrete and fully discrete problems. An optimal error estimate in the $L^2$-norm with order ${O}(\tau^2+ h^s),~ 2\leq s\leq r$, where $h$ is the finite element mesh size parameter, $\tau$ is the time step, and $r-1$ represents the degree of the finite element polynomial basis. Numerical simulations are provided to confirm the consistency between theoretical and numerical results, validating the method and the order of convergence for different degrees $p\geq 1$ of the Lagrange polynomials and also for Hermite polynomials (degree $p=3$), which form the basis of the approximate solution.</description>

      <title>Unique continuation principles for finite-element discretizations of the Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unique continuation principles are fundamental properties of elliptic partial differential equations, giving conditions that guarantee that the solution to an elliptic equation must be uniformly zero. Since finite-element discretizations are a natural tool to help gain understanding into elliptic equations, it is natural to ask if such principles also hold at the discrete level. In this work, we prove a version of the unique continuation principle for piecewise-linear and -bilinear finite-element discretizations of the Laplacian eigenvalue problem on polygonal domains in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Namely, we show that any solution to the discretized equation $-\Delta u = \lambda u$ with vanishing Dirichlet and Neumann traces must be identically zero under certain geometric and topological assumptions on the resulting triangulation. We also provide a counterexample, showing that a nonzero \emph{inner solution} exists when the topological assumptions are not satisfied. Finally, we give an application to an eigenvalue interlacing problem, where the space of inner solutions makes an explicit appearance.</description>

      <title>Nonsmooth Analysis of Doubly Nonlinear Second-Order Evolution Equations with Non-Convex Energy Functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:1910.10128v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of strong solutions to a general class of doubly multivalued and nonlinear evolution equations of second order. The multivalued operators are generated by the subdifferential of nonsmooth potentials that live in different spaces, $U$ and $V$, where in general $U \nsubseteq V$ and $V \nsubseteq U$. The proof is based on the regularization of the dissipation potential using the generalized Moreau--Yosida regularization and a semi-implicit time-discretization scheme, which demonstrates the existence of strong solutions to the regularized problem. The existence of solutions to the original problem is then shown by letting the regularization parameter converge to zero. Furthermore, we establish an energy-dissipation inequality for the solution. We conclude with applications of this abstract theory.</description>

      <title>The generalized fractional KdV equation in weighted Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work concerns the study of persistence property in polynomial weighted spaces for solutions of the generalized fractional KdV equation in any spatial dimension $d\geq 1$. By establishing well-posedness results in conjunction with some asymptotic at infinity unique continuation principles, it is verified that dispersive effects and dimensionality mainly determine the maximum spatial decay allowed by solutions of this model. In particular, we recover and extend some known results on weighted spaces for different models such as the Benjamin-Ono equation, and the dispersion generalized Benjamin-Ono equation. The estimates obtained for the linear equation seem to be of independent interest, and they are useful to obtain persistence properties in weighted spaces for models with different nonlinearities as the fractional KdV equation with combined nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Bounds on buoyancy driven flows with Navier-slip conditions on rough boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection with Navier-slip and fixed temperature boundary conditions at the two horizontal rough walls described by the height function $h$. We prove rigorous upper bounds on the Nusselt number $\text{Nu}$ which capture the dependence on the curvature of the boundary $\kappa$ and the (non-constant) friction coefficient $\alpha$ explicitly. If $h\in W^{2,\infty}$ and $\kappa$ satisfies a smallness condition with respect to $\alpha$, we find $$ \text{Nu}\lesssim \text{Ra}^{\frac{1}{2}}+\|\kappa\|_{\infty}\,,$$ where $\text{Ra}$ is the Rayleigh number, which agrees with the predicted Spiegel-Kraichnan scaling when $\kappa=0$. This bound is obtained via local regularity estimates in a small strip at the boundary. When $h\in W^{3,\infty}$, the functions $\kappa$ and $\alpha$ are sufficiently small in $L^{\infty}$ and the Prandtl number $\Pr$ is sufficiently large, we prove upper bounds using the background field method, which interpolate between $\text{Ra}^{\frac{1}{2}}$ and $\text{Ra}^{\frac{5}{12}}$ with non-trivial dependence on $\alpha$ and $\kappa$. These bounds agree with the result in Drivas et al (2022 Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 380 20210025) for flat boundaries and constant friction coefficient. Furthermore, in the regime $\Pr\geq \text{Ra}^{\frac 57}$, we improve the $\text{Ra}^{\frac 12}$-upper bound, showing $$\text{Nu}\lesssim_{\alpha,\kappa}\text{Ra}^{\frac{3}{7}}\,,$$ where $\lesssim_{\alpha,\kappa}$ hides an additional dependency of the implicit constant on $\alpha$ and $\kappa$.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of high-contrast media in finite-strain elastoplasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is devoted to the analysis of the interplay between internal variables and high-contrast microstructure in inelastic solids. As a concrete case-study, by means of variational techniques, we derive a macroscopic description for an elastoplastic medium. Specifically, we consider a composite obtained by filling the voids of a periodically perforated stiff matrix by soft inclusions. We study the $\Gamma$-convergence of the related energy functionals as the periodicity tends to zero. The main challenge is posed by the lack of coercivity brought about by the degeneracy of the material properties in the soft part. We prove that the $\Gamma$-limit, which we compute with respect to a suitable notion of convergence, is the sum of the contributions resulting from each of the two components separately. Eventually, convergence of the energy minimizing configurations is obtained.</description>

      <title>Large time behaviour of the 2D thermally non-diffusive Boussinesq equations with Navier-slip boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the large-time behavior of a buoyancy-driven fluid without thermal diffusion under Navier-slip boundary conditions in a bounded domain with Lipschitz-continuous second derivatives. After establishing improved regularity for classical solutions, we analyze their large-time asymptotics. Specifically, we show that the solutions converge to a state where, as $t \rightarrow \infty$, $\|u\|_{W^{1,p}} \rightarrow 0$, and hydrostatic balance is achieved in the weak topology of $L^2$. Additionally, we determine the necessary conditions for the hydrostatic balance to be attained in the strong topology in the large-time limit. We then analyze a particular steady state, the hydrostatic equilibrium, characterized by $ u = 0 $, $ \theta = \beta x_2 + \gamma $, and $ p = \frac{\beta}{2}x_2^2 + \gamma x_2 + \delta $. In a periodic strip, we establish the linear stability of this state for $\beta &gt; 0$, indicating that the temperature is vertically stably stratified. This work builds upon the results in [Doering et al.], which focus on free-slip boundary conditions, as well as recent studies [Ayd{\i}n, Kukavica, Ziane; Ayd{\i}n, Jayanti] that address no-slip boundary conditions. Notably, the novelty of this study lies in the ability to directly bound the pressure term, made possible by the Navier-slip boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Model order reduction and sensitivity analysis for complex heat transfer simulations inside the human eyeball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heat transfer in the human eyeball, a complex organ, is significantly influenced by various pathophysiological and external parameters. Particularly, heat transfer critically affects fluid behavior within the eye and ocular drug delivery processes. Overcoming the challenges of experimental analysis, this study introduces a comprehensive three-dimensional mathematical and computational model to simulate the heat transfer in a realistic geometry. Our work includes an extensive sensitivity analysis to address uncertainties and delineate the impact of different variables on heat distribution in ocular tissues. To manage the model's complexity, we employed a very fast model reduction technique with certified sharp error bounds, ensuring computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. Our results demonstrate remarkable consistency with experimental observations and align closely with existing numerical findings in the literature. Crucially, our findings underscore the significant role of blood flowand environmental conditions, particularly in the eye's internal tissues. Clinically, this model offers a promising tool for examining the temperature-related effects of various therapeutic interventions on the eye. Such insights are invaluable for optimizing treatment strategies in ophthalmology.</description>

      <title>The hot spots conjecture for some non-convex polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an elementary new proof of the hot spots conjecture for L-shaped domains. This result, in addition to a new eigenvalue inequality, allows us to locate the hot spots in Swiss cross translation surfaces. We then prove, in several cases, that first mixed Dirichlet-Neumann eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on L-shaped domains also have no interior critical points. As a combination of these results, we prove the hot spots conjecture for five classes of domains tiled by L-shaped domains, including a class of non-simply connected domains. An interesting feature of the proofs is that we make positive use of the lack of regularity of eigenfunctions on non-convex polygons.</description>

      <title>Measures in the dual of $BV$: perimeter bounds and relations with divergence-measure fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze some properties of the measures in the dual of the space $BV$, by considering (signed) Radon measures satisfying a perimeter bound condition, which means that the absolute value of the measure of a set is controlled by the perimeter of the set itself, and whose total variations also belong to the dual of $BV$. We exploit and refine the results of [25](Phuc, Torres 2017), in particular exploring the relation with divergence-measure fields and proving the stability of the perimeter bound from sets to $BV$ functions under a suitable approximation of the given measure. As an important tool, we obtain a refinement of Anzellotti-Giaquinta approximation for $BV$ functions, which is of separate interest in itself and, in the context of Anzellotti's pairing theory for divergence-measure fields, implies a new way of approximating $\lambda$-pairings, as well as new bounds for their total variation. These results are also relevant due to their application in the study of weak solutions to the non-parametric prescribed mean curvature equation with measure data, which is explored in a subsequent work.</description>

      <title>On the existence of traveling wave solutions for cold plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper is concerned with the existence of traveling wave solutions of the asymptotic model, derived by the authors in a previous work, to approximate the unidirectional evolution of a collision-free plasma in a magnetic field. First, using bifurcation theory, we can rigorously prove the existence of periodic traveling waves of small amplitude. Furthermore, our analysis also evidences the existence of different type of traveling waves. To this end, we present a second approach based on the analysis of the differential system satisfied by the traveling-wave profiles, the existence of equilibria, and the identification of associated homo-clinic and periodic orbits around them. The study makes use of linearization techniques and numerical computations to show the existence of different types of traveling-wave solutions, with monotone and non-monotone behaviour and different regularity, as well as periodic traveling waves.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a FEM-MCM Discretization for the 2D/3D stochastic closed-loop geothermal system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a new 2D/3D stochastic closed-loop geothermal system with a random hydraulic conductivity tensor. We use the finite element method (FEM) and the Monte Carlo method (MCM) to discrete physical and probability spaces, respectively. This FEM-MCM method is effective. The stability for velocity and temperature is rigorously proved. Compared with the deterministic closed-loop geothermal system, a same optimal error estimate for approximate velocity and temperature is obtained. Furthermore, a series of numerical experiments were carried out to show this method has better stability and accuracy results.</description>

      <title>Scaling Limit of Kuramoto Model on Random Geometric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Kuramoto model on a graph with nodes given by $n$ i.i.d. points uniformly distributed on the $d$ dimensional torus. Two nodes are declared neighbors if they are at distance less than $\epsilon$. We prove a scaling limit for this model in compact time intervals as $n\to\infty$ and $\epsilon \to 0$ such that $\epsilon^{d+2}n/\log n \to \infty$. The limiting object is given by the heat equation. On the one hand this shows that the nonlinearity given by the sine function disappears under this scaling and on the other hand, provides evidence that stable equilibria of the Kuramoto model on these graphs are, as $n\to\infty$, in correspondence with those of the heat equation, which are explicit and given by twisted states. In view of this, we conjecture the existence of twisted stable equilibria with high probability as $n\to \infty$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the notion of stochastic kinetic solutions introduced in arXiv:2108.08858 to establish the well-posedness of stochastic kinetic solutions of generalized Dean-Kawasaki equations with correlated noise on bounded, $C^2$-domains with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The results apply to a wide class of non-negative boundary data, which is based on certain a priori estimates for the solutions, that encompasses all non-negative constant functions including zero and all smooth functions bounded away from zero.</description>
