      <title>(S,w)-Gap Shifts and Their Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $S$-gap shifts have a dynamically and combinatorially rich structure. Dynamical properties of the $S$-gap shift can be related to the properties of the set $S$. This interplay is particularly interesting when $S$ is not syndetic such as when $S$ is the set of prime numbers or when $S=\{2^n\}$. It is a well known result that the entropy of the $S$-gap shift is given by $h(X) = \log \lambda$, where $\lambda&gt;0$ is the unique solution to the equation $\sum_{n \in S} \lambda^{-(n+1)}=1$. Fix a point $w$ of the full shift $\{1,2, \dots, k\}^\mathbb{Z}$. We introduce the $(S,w)$-gap shift which is a generalization of the $S$-gap shift consisting of sequences in $\{0,1, \dots, k\}^\mathbb{Z}$ in which any two $0$'s are separated by a word $u$ appearing in $w$ such that $|u|\in S$. We extend the formula for the entropy of the $S$-gap shift to a formula describing the entropy of this new class of shift spaces. Additionally we investigate the dynamical properties including irreducibility and mixing of this generalization of the $S$-gap shift.</description>

      <title>Formulation a new SIR model with non-local mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we develop a mobility-based Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model to elucidate the dynamics of pandemic propagation. While traditional SIR models within the field of epidemiology aptly characterize transitions among susceptible, infected, and recovered states, they typically neglect the inherent spatial mobility of particles. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel dynamical SIR model that incorporates nonlocal spatial motion for three distinct particle types, thereby bridging the gap between epidemiological theory and real-world mobility patterns. This paper primarily focuses on analyzing the long-term behavior of this dynamic system, with specific emphasis on the computation of first and second moments. We propose a new reproduction number $R_0^m$ and compare it with the classical reproduction number $R_0$ in the traditional SIR model. Furthermore, we rigorously examine the phenomenon of intermittency within the context of this enhanced SIR model. The results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of pandemic spread dynamics, considering both the interplay between disease transmission and population mobility and the impact of spatial motion on the system's behavior over time.</description>

      <title>Cellular automata can really solve the parity problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining properties of an arbitrary binary sequence is a challenging task if only local processing is allowed. Among these properties, the determination of the parity of 1s by distributed consensus has been a recurring endeavour in the context of automata networks. In its most standard formulation, a one-dimensional cellular automaton rule should process any odd-sized cyclic configuration and lead the lattice to converge to the homogeneous fixed point of 0s if the parity of 1s is even and to the homogeneous fixed point of 1s, otherwise. The only known solution to this problem with a single rule was given by Betel, de Oliveira and Flocchini (coined BFO rule after the authors' initials). However, three years later the authors of the BFO rule realised that the rule would fail for some specific configuration and proposed a computationally sound fix, but a proof could not be worked out. Here we provide another fix to the BFO rule along with a full proof, therefore reassuring that a single-rule solution to the problem really does exist.</description>

      <title>Efficient Numerical Algorithms for Phase-Amplitude Reduction on the Slow Attracting Manifold of Limit cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase-amplitude framework extends the classical phase reduction method by incorporating amplitude coordinates (or isostables) to describe transient dynamics transverse to the limit cycle in a simplified form. While the full set of amplitude coordinates provides an exact description of oscillatory dynamics, it maintains the system's original dimensionality, limiting the advantages of simplification. A more effective approach reduces the dynamics to the slow attracting invariant submanifold associated with the slowest contracting direction, achieving a balance between simplification and accuracy. In this work, we present an efficient numerical method to compute the parameterization of the attracting slow submanifold of hyperbolic limit cycles and the simplified dynamics in its induced coordinates. Additionally, we compute the infinitesimal Phase and Amplitude Response Functions (iPRF and iARF, respectively) restricted to this manifold, which characterize the effects of perturbations on phase and amplitude. These results are obtained by solving an invariance equation for the slow manifold and adjoint equations for the iPRF and iARF. To solve these functional equations efficiently, we employ the Floquet normal form to solve the invariance equation and propose a novel coordinate transformation to simplify the adjoint equations. The solutions are expressed as Fourier-Taylor expansions with arbitrarily high accuracy. Our method accommodates both real and complex Floquet exponents. Finally, we discuss the numerical implementation of the method and present results from its application to a representative example.</description>

      <title>Local rigidity for symplectic billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show a local rigidity result for the integrability of symplectic billiards. We prove that any domain which is close to an ellipse, and for which the symplectic billiard map is rationally integrable must be an ellipse as well. This is in spirit of the result of Avila, De Simoi, and Kaloshin for Birkhoff billiards.</description>

      <title>Continuation methods as a tool for parameter inference in electrophysiology modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameterizing mathematical models of biological systems often requires fitting to stable periodic data. In cardiac electrophysiology this typically requires converging to a stable action potential through long simulations. We explore this problem through the theory of dynamical systems, bifurcation analysis and continuation methods; under which a converged action potential is a stable limit cycle. Various attempts have been made to improve the efficiency of identifying these limit cycles, with limited success. We demonstrate that continuation methods can more efficiently infer the converged action potential as proposed model parameter sets change during optimization or inference routines. In an example electrophysiology model this reduces parameter inference computation time by 70%. We also discuss theoretical considerations and limitations of continuation method use in place of time-consuming model simulations. The application of continuation methods allows more robust optimization by making extra runs from multiple starting locations computationally tractable, and facilitates the application of inference methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo to gain more information on the plausible parameter space.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov stability and uniqueness problems for Hamilton-Jacobi equations without monotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the evolutionary Hamilton-Jacobi equation
  \begin{align*}
  w_t(x,t)+H(x,Dw(x,t),w(x,t))=0, \quad(x,t)\in M\times [0,+\infty),
  \end{align*}
  where $M$ is a compact manifold, $H:T^*M\times R\to R$, $H=H(x,p,u)$ satisfies Tonelli conditions in $p$ and the Lipschitz condition in $u$.
  This work mainly concerns with the Lyapunov stability (including asymptotic stability, and instability) and uniqueness of stationary viscosity solutions of the equation. A criterion for stability and a criterion for instability are given. We do not utilize auxiliary functions and thus our method is different from the classical Lyapunov's direct method.
  We also prove several uniqueness results for stationary viscosity solutions. The Hamiltonian $H$ has no concrete form and it may be non-monotonic in the argument $u$, where the situation is more complicated than the monotonic case. Several simple but nontrivial examples are provided, including the following equation on the unit circle
  \[
  w_t(x,t)+\frac{1}{2}w^2_x(x,t)-a\cdot w_x(x,t)+(\sin x+b)\cdot w(x,t)=0,\quad x\in \mathbf{S},
  \]
  where $a$, $b\in R$ are parameters. We analyze the stability, and instability of the stationary solution $w=0$ when parameters vary, and show that $w=0$ is the unique stationary solution when $a=0$, $b&gt;1$ and $a\neq0$, $b\geqslant 1$.
  The sign of the integral of $\frac{\partial H}{\partial u}$ with respect to the Mather measure of the contact Hamiltonian system generated by $H$ plays an essential role in the proofs of aforementioned results. For this reason, we first develop the Mather and weak KAM theories for contact Hamiltonian systems in this non-monotonic setting. A decomposition theorem of the Ma\~n\'e set is the main result of this part.</description>

      <title>An Ensemble Information Filter: Retrieving Markov-information from the SPDE discretisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensemble-based Data Assimilation faces significant challenges in high-dimensional systems due to spurious correlations and ensemble collapse. These issues arise from estimating dense dependencies with limited ensemble sizes. This paper introduces the Ensemble Information Filter, which encodes Markov properties directly into the statistical model's precision matrix, leveraging structure from SPDE dynamics to constrain information to propagate locally. EnIF eliminates the need for ad-hoc localisation, improving statistical consistency and scalability. Numerical experiments demonstrate its advantages in filtering, smoothing, and parameter estimation, making EnIF a robust and efficient solution for large-scale data assimilation problems.</description>

Abstract: In two previous papers we showed that any analytically integrable vector field admits a local analytic Poincar\'e-Birkhoff normalization in the neighborhood of a singular point. The aim of this paper is to extend this analytic normalization result to the case of rationally integrable systems, where the first integrals and commuting vector fields are not required to be analytic, but just rational (i.e., quotients of analytic functions or vector fields by analytic functions).</description>

      <title>Smooth Koopman eigenfunctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00532v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any dynamical system, whether it is generated by a differential equation or a transformation map on a manifold, induces a dynamics on functional-spaces. The choice of functional-space may vary, but the induced dynamics is always linear, and codified by the Koopman operator. The eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator are of extreme importance in the study of the dynamics. They provide a clear distinction between the mixing and non-mixing components of the dynamics, and also reveal embedded toral rotations. The usual choice of functional-space is $L^2$, a class of square integrable functions. A fundamental problem with eigenfunctions in $L^2$ is that they are often extremely discontinuous, particularly if the system is chaotic. There are some prototypical systems called skew-product dynamics in which $L^2$ Koopman eigenfunctions are also smooth. The article shows that under general assumptions on an ergodic system, these prototypical examples are the only possibility. Moreover, the smooth eigenfunctions can be used to create a change of variables which explicitly characterizes the weakly mixing component too.</description>

      <title>Unconditional stability of a recurrent neural circuit implementing divisive normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18946v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stability in recurrent neural models poses a significant challenge, particularly in developing biologically plausible neurodynamical models that can be seamlessly trained. Traditional cortical circuit models are notoriously difficult to train due to expansive nonlinearities in the dynamical system, leading to an optimization problem with nonlinear stability constraints that are difficult to impose. Conversely, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) excel in tasks involving sequential data but lack biological plausibility and interpretability. In this work, we address these challenges by linking dynamic divisive normalization (DN) to the stability of ORGaNICs, a biologically plausible recurrent cortical circuit model that dynamically achieves DN and that has been shown to simulate a wide range of neurophysiological phenomena. By using the indirect method of Lyapunov, we prove the remarkable property of unconditional local stability for an arbitrary-dimensional ORGaNICs circuit when the recurrent weight matrix is the identity. We thus connect ORGaNICs to a system of coupled damped harmonic oscillators, which enables us to derive the circuit's energy function, providing a normative principle of what the circuit, and individual neurons, aim to accomplish. Further, for a generic recurrent weight matrix, we prove the stability of the 2D model and demonstrate empirically that stability holds in higher dimensions. Finally, we show that ORGaNICs can be trained by backpropagation through time without gradient clipping/scaling, thanks to its intrinsic stability property and adaptive time constants, which address the problems of exploding, vanishing, and oscillating gradients. By evaluating the model's performance on RNN benchmarks, we find that ORGaNICs outperform alternative neurodynamical models on static image classification tasks and perform comparably to LSTMs on sequential tasks.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the structure of Newton polygons for compositions of polynomials over the rationals. We establish sufficient conditions under which the successive vertices of the Newton polygon of the composition $ g(f^n(x)) $ with respect to a prime $ p $ can be explicitly described in terms of the Newton polygon of the polynomial $ g(x) $. Our results provide deeper insights into how the Newton polygon of a polynomial evolves under iteration and composition, with applications to the study of dynamical irreducibility, eventual stability, non-monogenity of tower of number fields, etc.</description>
