      <title>Generation of structure-guided pMHC-I libraries using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized vaccines and T-cell immunotherapies depend critically on identifying peptide-MHC class I (pMHC-I) interactions capable of eliciting potent immune responses. However, current benchmarks and models inherit biases present in mass-spectrometry and binding-assay datasets, limiting discovery of novel peptide ligands. To address this issue, we introduce a structure-guided benchmark of pMHC-I peptides designed using diffusion models conditioned on crystal structure interaction distances. Spanning twenty high-priority HLA alleles, this benchmark is independent of previously characterized peptides yet reproduces canonical anchor residue preferences, indicating structural generalization without experimental dataset bias. Using this resource, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art sequence-based predictors perform poorly at recognizing the binding potential of these structurally stable designs, indicating allele-specific limitations invisible in conventional evaluations. Our geometry-aware design pipeline yields peptides with high predicted structural integrity and higher residue diversity than existing datasets, representing a key resource for unbiased model training and evaluation. Our code, and data are available at: https://github.com/sermare/struct-mhc-dev.</description>

      <title>From Classical Machine Learning to Emerging Foundation Models: Review on Multimodal Data Integration for Cancer Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancer research is increasingly driven by the integration of diverse data modalities, spanning from genomics and proteomics to imaging and clinical factors. However, extracting actionable insights from these vast and heterogeneous datasets remains a key challenge. The rise of foundation models (FMs) -- large deep-learning models pretrained on extensive amounts of data serving as a backbone for a wide range of downstream tasks -- offers new avenues for discovering biomarkers, improving diagnosis, and personalizing treatment. This paper presents a comprehensive review of widely adopted integration strategies of multimodal data to assist advance the computational approaches for data-driven discoveries in oncology. We examine emerging trends in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), including methodological frameworks, validation protocols, and open-source resources targeting cancer subtype classification, biomarker discovery, treatment guidance, and outcome prediction. This study also comprehensively covers the shift from traditional ML to FMs for multimodal integration. We present a holistic view of recent FMs advancements and challenges faced during the integration of multi-omics with advanced imaging data. We identify the state-of-the-art FMs, publicly available multi-modal repositories, and advanced tools and methods for data integration. We argue that current state-of-the-art integrative methods provide the essential groundwork for developing the next generation of large-scale, pre-trained models poised to further revolutionize oncology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review to systematically map the transition from conventional ML to advanced FM for multimodal data integration in oncology, while also framing these developments as foundational for the forthcoming era of large-scale AI models in cancer research.</description>

      <title>A PBN-RL-XAI Framework for Discovering a "Hit-and-Run" Therapeutic Strategy in Melanoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10136v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Innate resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy remains a major clinical challenge in metastatic melanoma, with the underlying molecular networks being poorly understood. To address this, we constructed a dynamic Probabilistic Boolean Network model using transcriptomic data from patient tumor biopsies to elucidate the regulatory logic governing therapy response. We then employed a reinforcement learning agent to systematically discover optimal, multi-step therapeutic interventions and used explainable artificial intelligence to mechanistically interpret the agent's control policy. The analysis revealed that a precisely timed, 4-step temporary inhibition of the lysyl oxidase like 2 protein (LOXL2) was the most effective strategy. Our explainable analysis showed that this ``hit-and-run" intervention is sufficient to erase the molecular signature driving resistance, allowing the network to self-correct without requiring sustained intervention. This study presents a novel, time-dependent therapeutic hypothesis for overcoming immunotherapy resistance and provides a powerful computational framework for identifying non-obvious intervention protocols in complex biological systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond vividness: Content analysis of induced hallucinations reveals the hidden structure of individual differences in visual imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rapidly alternating red and black display known as Ganzflicker induces visual hallucinations that reflect the generative capacity of the visual system. Recent proposals regarding the imagery spectrum, that is, differences in the visual system of individuals with absent imagery, typical imagery, and vivid imagery, suggest these differences should impact the complexity of other internally generated visual experiences. Here, we used tools from natural language processing to analyze free-text descriptions of hallucinations from over 4,000 participants, asking whether people with different imagery phenotypes see different things in their mind's eye during Ganzflicker-induced hallucinations. Strong imagers described complex, naturalistic content, while weak imagers reported simple geometric patterns. Embeddings from vision language models better captured these differences than text-only language models, and participants with stronger imagery used language with richer sensorimotor associations. These findings may reflect individual variation in coordination between early visual areas and higher-order regions relevant for the imagery spectrum.</description>

      <title>La-Proteina: Atomistic Protein Generation via Partially Latent Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, many generative models for de novo protein structure design have emerged. Yet, only few tackle the difficult task of directly generating fully atomistic structures jointly with the underlying amino acid sequence. This is challenging, for instance, because the model must reason over side chains that change in length during generation. We introduce La-Proteina for atomistic protein design based on a novel partially latent protein representation: coarse backbone structure is modeled explicitly, while sequence and atomistic details are captured via per-residue latent variables of fixed dimensionality, thereby effectively side-stepping challenges of explicit side-chain representations. Flow matching in this partially latent space then models the joint distribution over sequences and full-atom structures. La-Proteina achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple generation benchmarks, including all-atom co-designability, diversity, and structural validity, as confirmed through detailed structural analyses and evaluations. Notably, La-Proteina also surpasses previous models in atomistic motif scaffolding performance, unlocking critical atomistic structure-conditioned protein design tasks. Moreover, La-Proteina is able to generate co-designable proteins of up to 800 residues, a regime where most baselines collapse and fail to produce valid samples, demonstrating La-Proteina's scalability and robustness.</description>

      <title>Bayesian dictionary learning estimation of cell membrane permeability from surface pH data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gas transport across cell membrane is a very important process in biochemistry which is essential for many crucial tasks, including cell respiration pH regulation in the cell. In the late 1990's, the suggestion that gasses are transported via preferred gas channels embedded into the cell membrane challenged the century old Overton's theory that gases pass through the lipid cell membrane by diffusing across the concentration gradient. Since experimental evidence alone does not provide enough evidence to favor one of the proposed mechanisms, mathematical models have been introduced to provide a context for the interpretation of laboratory measurement. Following up on previous work where the membrane permeability was estimated using particle filter, in this article we propose an algorithm based on dictionary learning for estimating cell membrane permeability. Computed examples illustrate that the novel approach, which can be applied when the properties of the membrane do not change in the course of the data collection process, is computationally much more efficient than particle filter.</description>

      <title>Do we need equivariant models for molecule generation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models are increasingly used for molecular discovery, with most recent approaches relying on equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) under the assumption that explicit equivariance is essential for generating high-quality 3D molecules. However, these models are complex, difficult to train, and scale poorly.
  We investigate whether non-equivariant convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with rotation augmentations can learn equivariance and match the performance of equivariant models. We derive a loss decomposition that separates prediction error from equivariance error, and evaluate how model size, dataset size, and training duration affect performance across denoising, molecule generation, and property prediction. To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze learned equivariance in generative tasks.</description>

      <title>Modeling Cholera Dynamics with Vaccination as the Control Strategy and Seasonal-forcing Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a seasonally forced cholera model that incorporates imperfect vaccination as a control strategy. The model captures the temporal dynamics of susceptible, vaccinated, infected, and recovered individuals, as well as the environmental pathogen concentration. A key focus is the instantaneous reproduction number, which serves as a threshold indicator for outbreak persistence or elimination. When reproduction number, the disease-free equilibrium is attainable; otherwise, endemic conditions persist. We conduct a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the influence of two critical parameters: the vaccination rate and the waning rate of immunity. Results show that increasing the vaccination rate and reducing the waning rate significantly decrease reproduction number, reinforcing the importance of sustained vaccine efficacy. Seasonal forcing amplifies the complexity of cholera dynamics, revealing the need for timely public health interventions, especially before high-transmission periods. This model demonstrates practical applicability in informing vaccination strategies, especially in resource-limited settings prone to seasonal outbreaks. It offers a flexible framework for public health planning, adaptable to other waterborne diseases. The findings suggest that integrated approaches combining vaccination, improved sanitation, and targeted education are essential to reducing cholera transmission and achieving long-term control.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Swin Transformer for enhanced diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease using multi-shell diffusion MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: This study aims to support early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and detection of amyloid accumulation by leveraging the microstructural information available in multi-shell diffusion MRI (dMRI) data, using a vision transformer-based deep learning framework.
  Methods: We present a classification pipeline that employs the Swin Transformer, a hierarchical vision transformer model, on multi-shell dMRI data for the classification of Alzheimer's disease and amyloid presence. Key metrics from DTI and NODDI were extracted and projected onto 2D planes to enable transfer learning with ImageNet-pretrained models. To efficiently adapt the transformer to limited labeled neuroimaging data, we integrated Low-Rank Adaptation. We assessed the framework on diagnostic group prediction (cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease dementia) and amyloid status classification.
  Results: The framework achieved competitive classification results within the scope of multi-shell dMRI-based features, with the best balanced accuracy of 95.2% for distinguishing cognitively normal individuals from those with Alzheimer's disease dementia using NODDI metrics. For amyloid detection, it reached 77.2% balanced accuracy in distinguishing amyloid-positive mild cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease dementia subjects from amyloid-negative cognitively normal subjects, and 67.9% for identifying amyloid-positive individuals among cognitively normal subjects. Grad-CAM-based explainability analysis identified clinically relevant brain regions, including the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, as key contributors to model predictions.
  Conclusion: This study demonstrates the promise of diffusion MRI and transformer-based architectures for early detection of Alzheimer's disease and amyloid pathology, supporting biomarker-driven diagnostics in data-limited biomedical settings.</description>

      <title>Anticipating the Selectivity of Cyclization Reaction Pathways with Neural Network Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reaction mechanism search tools have demonstrated the ability to provide insights into likely products and rate-limiting steps of reacting systems. However, reactions involving several concerted bond changes - as can be found in many key steps of natural product synthesis - can complicate the search process. To mitigate these complications, we present a mechanism search strategy particularly suited to help expedite exploration of an exemplary family of such complex reactions, cyclizations. We provide a cost-effective strategy for identifying relevant elementary reaction steps by combining graph-based enumeration schemes and machine learning techniques for intermediate filtering. Key to this approach is our use of a neural network potential (NNP), AIMNet2-rxn, for computational evaluation of each candidate reaction pathway. In this article, we evaluate the NNP's ability to estimate activation energies, demonstrate the correct anticipation of stereoselectivity, and recapitulate complex enabling steps in natural product synthesis.</description>

      <title>Screen Them All: High-Throughput Pan-Cancer Genetic and Phenotypic Biomarker Screening from H&amp;E Whole Slide Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09554v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular assays are standard of care for detecting genomic alterations in cancer prognosis and therapy selection but are costly, tissue-destructive and time-consuming. Artificial intelligence (AI) applied to routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs) offers a fast and economical alternative for screening molecular biomarkers. We introduce OmniScreen, a high-throughput AI-based system leveraging Virchow2 embeddings extracted from 60,529 cancer patients with paired 489-gene MSK-IMPACT targeted biomarker panel and WSIs. Unlike conventional approaches that train separate models for each biomarker, OmniScreen employs a unified model to predict a broad range of clinically relevant biomarkers across cancers, including low-prevalence targets impractical to model individually. OmniScreen reliably identifies therapeutic targets and shared phenotypic features across common and rare tumors. We investigate the biomarker prediction probabilities and accuracies of OmniScreen in relation to tumor area, cohort size, histologic subtype alignment, and pathway-level morphological patterns. These findings underscore the potential of OmniScreen for routine clinical screening.</description>

      <title>The Basic Reproduction Number for Petri Net Models: A Next-Generation Matrix Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The basic reproduction number (R_0) is an epidemiological metric that represents the average number of new infections caused by a single infectious individual in a completely susceptible population. The methodology for calculating this metric is well-defined for numerous model types, including, most prominently, Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The basic reproduction number is used in disease modeling to predict the potential of an outbreak and the transmissibility of a disease, as well as by governments to inform public health interventions and resource allocation for controlling the spread of diseases. A Petri net (PN) is a directed bipartite graph where places, transitions, arcs, and the firing of the arcs determine the dynamic behavior of the system. Petri net models have been an increasingly used tool within the epidemiology community. However, a generalized method for calculating R_0 directly from PN models has not been established. Thus, in this paper, we present a general method for calculating R_0 for Petri nets. Additionally, we show how a computational method implementing the next-generation algorithm in ODE models can also be applied to Petri net models. We also provide multiple examples of how to use this approach to calculate 0 for various SIR-type Petri net models.</description>
