      <title>Group Theory in Physics: An Introduction with Mathematica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group Theory has become an invaluable tool in the physics community. Despite numerous introductory books, the subject remains challenging for beginners. Mathematica has emerged as a popular tool for research and education, offering various packages and built-in tools for Group Theory. However, these resources are often too scattered for effective educational use. This work aims to provide a comprehensive source to help beginning students grasp Group Theory concepts and their applications from a physicist's perspective, while also building familiarity with symbolic language. We present several example notebooks that succinctly cover well-known theories and demonstrate specific concepts, which can be easily adapted for educational purposes. We provide basic examples on finite, compact and non-compact groups, and motivate the use of these concepts in solving physics problems such as addition of angular momenta, modelling a system of qubits and the description of spacetime transformations.</description>

      <title>VirtualRelativity: An Interactive Simulation of the Special Theory of Relativity in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Special Theory of Relativity, introduced by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century, marked a radical shift in our understanding of space and time. Nevertheless, the theory's non-intuitive implications continue to pose conceptual challenges for novice physicists. In this thesis, we propose a virtual reality solution based on the development of a Unity package capable of simulating the effects of relativity in a digital environment. The current implementation includes the representation of space contraction, time dilation and relativistic Doppler effect. The primary focus lies in the accurate representation of relativistic laws, as well as in computational efficiency and in the modeling of a user interface specifically crafted to enhance understanding and interactivity. The package significantly reduces developer workload through a streamlined API, enabling maximum freedom in the development of virtual scenarios. Design goals are validated by a testing phase conducted through dedicated probe scenes. To showcase the potential of this work, we also present the deployment of a VR application built on top of the package, that transports users in experiencing relativistic effects in real-life scenarios. The application is scheduled to be used by Master's students in Physical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. In the meanwhile, other educational areas of expansion are being considered, suggesting a promising future in the direction of this work.</description>

      <title>A low cost technique to find gravitational acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01451v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most common way to find gravitational acceleration, g, in a laboratory is to use a simple pendulum and a clock. Alternately, g can be calculated by measuring time and distance for a free fall. Since the time of free fall in a laboratory is short, there are challenges in measuring the short period. In this article, a low cost technique to measure the time for a free fall using a discharging RC circuit is discussed.</description>

      <title>Using GeoGebra to discover the motion of device in a well-known physical experimental instrument -- Looking into vibration-damping devices in the scanning tunneling microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we take a vibration-damping devices in the well-known physical experimental instrument--scanning tunneling microscope as the study base, and with the help of GeoGebra software, we explain in detail the principle of damping the vibration of the damper in the magnetic field to realize the vibration-damping function of the whole device and establish a clear physical picture and a correct and comprehensive knowledge. This question also shows the process of clarifying the meaning of the problem with the help of software tools.</description>

      <title>Summary Report on the 2024 African School of Physics Program for Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On April 15-19, 2024, as a part of the eighth African School of Physics, ASP2024, we organized a program for learners from selected high schools in the vicinity of Marrakesh, Morocco. In this event, within a week, we reached out to over a thousand high school students, aka learners, from many high schools in the region of Marrakesh. We present a summary report on these outreach activities.</description>

      <title>Teaching Physics to Life Sciences Students in the SCALE-UP Style</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics has a reputation among majority of life sciences students for being very complicated and tough. If we leave students with this impression, it is likely that students see physics class as useless and irrelevant to life sciences. Concepts of physics are vital in oder to understand physics based technological tools and biophysical topics essential and relevant for life sciences. This review summarizes approaches for improving teaching and learning in introductory physics courses to life science students in the SCALE- UP style. We also discuss our experiences in adapting IPLS Courses to better meet the needs of life sciences students. to better meet the needs of life sciences students.</description>

      <title>A Journey in Implementing Computational Physics from the Ground Up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter narrates the journey of developing and integrating computing into the physics curriculum through three consecutive courses, each tailored to the learners' level. It starts with the entry-level "Physics Playground in Python" for high school and freshman students with no programming experience, designed in the spirit of the "Hello World" approach. At the sophomore and junior level, students from all sciences and engineering disciplines learn "Scientific Computing with Python" in an environment based on the "Two Bites at Every Apple" approach. Ultimately, upper undergraduate and entry-level graduate students take "Computational Physics," to develop their skills in solving advanced problems using complex numerical algorithms and computational tools. This journey showcases the increasing complexity and sophistication of computational tools and techniques that can be incorporated into the physical science curriculum, serving as a guide for educators looking to integrate computing into their teaching. It also aims to inspire students by showcasing the impact and potential of computational methods in science education and research.</description>

      <title>Gravitation: from Newton to Einstein</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07287</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.07287v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This document gathers the notes of a 30-hour review course on gravitation, which I delivered in January 2018 and January 2019 at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences of Cameroon (AIMS-Cameroon). Its main goal is to propose a big picture of gravitation, where Einstein's relativity arises as a natural increment to Newton's theory. It is designed for bachelor/master students who do not necessarily have prior knowledge about relativity. The students are nevertheless expected to be familiar with the fundamentals of Newton's mechanics and gravitation, for the first chapter to be a mere reformulation of known concepts. The second chapter then introduces special and general relativity at the same time, while the third chapter explores concrete manifestations of relativistic gravitation, notably gravitational waves and black holes. Each section corresponds, on average, to slightly more than a 2-hour black-board lecture. The numerous exercises must be considered part of the course itself; they are intended to stimulate active reading.</description>
