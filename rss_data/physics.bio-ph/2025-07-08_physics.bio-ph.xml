      <title>Differentiation of Wild-Type and CRISPR-Modified Colon Cancer Cells Using Brillouin Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the mechanical properties of colon cancer cells through Brillouin microscopy, focusing on the differentiation between wild-type (WT) and CRISPR-modified cells. Brillouin microspectroscopy, a non-invasive technique, was employed to measure Brillouin shifts and full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of the cells in vitro. Using a custom-built confocal Brillouin microspectrometer, both WT and CRISPR-modified cells exhibited distinct mechanical responses. Statistical analysis revealed that WT cells had different stiffness and viscosity compared to CRISPR-modified cells, as indicated by their Brillouin shift and FWHM values. The data suggest that Brillouin spectroscopy offers a viable method to differentiate between normal and mutated cells at the subcellular level, providing new insights into cellular mechanical properties relevant to cancer research. These findings hold potential for advancing non-invasive diagnostic techniques and understanding cellular mechanics in oncology.</description>

      <title>How Easy Is It to Learn Motion Models from Widefield Fluorescence Single Particle Tracks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion models are often deduced from fluorescence widefield tracking experiments by analyzing single-particle trajectories post-processed from the data. This analysis immediately raises the following question: To what degree is our ability to learn motion models impacted by analyzing post-processed trajectories versus the raw measurements? To answer this question, we mathematically formulate a data likelihood for diffraction-limited fluorescence widefield tracking experiments. In particular, we explicitly make the likelihood's dependence on the motion model versus the emission model (or measurement model). The emission model describes how photons emitted by fluorescently labeled particles are distributed in space according to the optical point spread function, with intensities subsequently integrated over a pixel, and convoluted with camera noise. Logic dictates that if the data likelihood is primarily informed by the motion model, then it should be straightforward to learn the motion model from the trajectory post-processed from the data. On the other hand, if the majority of the likelihood is numerically dominated by the emission model, then the post-processed trajectory inferred from data is primarily informed by the emission model, and very little information on the motion model permeates into the post-processed trajectories analyzed downstream to learn motion models. We find that for typical diffraction-limited fluorescence experiments, the emission model often robustly contributes approximately 99% to the likelihood, leaving motion models to explain approximately 1% of the data. This result immediately casts doubt on our ability to reliably learn motion models from post-processed data, raising further questions on the significance of motion models learned thus far from post-processed single-particle trajectories from single-molecule widefield fluorescence tracking experiments.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Determination of Local Magnetic Fields and Sensor Orientation with Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Nanodiamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds have emerged as a promising quantum sensing platform for biomedical imaging applications, yet random orientations of individual particles present significant challenges in large-scale sensor calibration. In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach to simultaneously determine each particle's crystallographic axes and the surrounding local vector magnetic field. Specifically, a minimum of four distinct bias fields is required to unambiguously extract both the orientation and the local field. We validate our method experimentally using NV centers in two scenarios: (1) in a bulk diamond with known crystal orientation as a proof of concept, and (2) on various single nanodiamonds to mimic real-world applications. Our work represents a crucial step towards unlocking the full potential of nanodiamonds for advanced applications such as in-situ biomedical imaging and nanoscale sensing in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Design and optimization of in situ self-functionalizing stress sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical forces are crucial regulators of diverse biological processes, yet their in vivo measurement remains challenging due to limitations of current techniques, that can be destructive or require complex dedicated setups. This study introduces a novel class of biocompatible, self-functionalizing stress sensors based on inverted emulsions, that can be used to measure mechanical stresses inside tissues but can also locally perturb the biological environment through specific binder presentation or drug delivery. We engineered an optimal design for these inverted emulsions, focusing on finding the perfect balance between the two contradictory constraints: achieving low surface tension for deformability while maintaining emulsion instability for efficient self-functionalization and drug release. Proof-of-concept experiments in both agarose gels and complex biological systems, including brain organoids and zebrafish embryos, confirm the droplets ability to deform in response to mechanical stress applied on the tissue, to self-functionalize and to release encapsulated molecules locally. These versatile sensors offer a method for non-invasive stress measurements and targeted chemical delivery within living biological tissues, overcoming current technical barriers in biophysical measurements.</description>

      <title>Evaluating non-equilibrium trajectories via mean back relaxation: Dependence on length and time scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mean back relaxation (MBR) relates the value of a stochastic process at three different time points. It has been shown to detect broken detailed balance under certain conditions. For experiments of probe particles in living and passivated cells, MBR was found to be related to the so called effective energy, which quantifies the violation of the fluctuation dissipation theorem. In this manuscript, we discuss the dependence on the length and time parameters that enter MBR, both for cells as well as for a model system, finding qualitative agreement between the two. For the cell data, we extend the phenomenological relation between MBR and effective energy to a larger range of time parameters compared to previous work, allowing to test it in systems with limited resolution. We analyze the variance of back relaxation (VBR) in dependence of the mentioned parameters, relevant for the statistical error in MBR evaluation. For Gaussian systems, the variance is found analytically in terms of the mean squared displacement, and we determine its absolute minimum as a function of the length and time parameters. Comparing VBR from cell data to a Gaussian prediction demonstrates a non-Gaussian process.</description>

      <title>Forces and symmetry breaking of a living meso-swimmer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Swimming is ubiquitous in nature and crucial for the survival of a wide range of organisms. The physics of swimming at the viscosity-dominated microscale and inertia-dominated macroscale is well studied. However, in between lies a complicated mesoscale with swimmers affected by non-linear and time-dependent fluid mechanics. The intricate motility strategies and complex and periodically changing body shapes add extra challenges for accurate meso-swimming modelling. Here, we have further developed the micropipette force sensor to directly probe the swimming forces of the meso-organism Artemia. We present a universal scaling law for a wide range of micro- to meso-organisms with different body shapes, swimming strategies, and level of inertia at the mesoscale. Through deep neural network-based image analysis, we discover that Artemia achieves an increased propulsive force by increasing its level of time-reversal symmetry breaking. These results capture fundamental aspects of biological meso-swimming dynamics and provide guidance for future biomimicking meso-robot designs.</description>

      <title>Frustration, dynamics and catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The controlled dissipation of chemical potentials is the fundamental way cells make a living. Enzyme-mediated catalysis allows the various transformations to proceed at biologically relevant rates with remarkable precision and efficiency. Theory, experiments and computational studies coincide to show that local frustration is a useful concept to relate protein dynamics with catalytic power. Local frustration gives rise to the asperities of the energy landscapes that can harness the thermal fluctuations to guide the functional protein motions. We review here recent advances into these relationships from various fields of protein science. The biologically relevant dynamics is tuned by the evolution of protein sequences that modulate the local frustration patterns to near optimal values.</description>
