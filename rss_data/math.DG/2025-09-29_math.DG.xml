      <title>Almost paracontact metric 3-dimensional Walker manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we construct and study almost paracontact metric structures $(\varphi ,\xi ,\eta ,g)$ on a 3-dimensional Walker manifold $(M,g)$ with respect to a local basis only by the coordinate functions of a unit space-like vector field $\xi $, globally defined on $M$ and a function $f$ on $M$, characterizing the Lorentzian metric $g$. Necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained for $M$, endowed with these structures, to fall in one of the following classes of 3-dimensional almost paracontact metric manifolds according to the classification given by S. Zamkovoy and G. Nakova: paracontact metric, normal, almost $\alpha $-paracosymplectic, almost paracosymplectic, paracosymplectic and $\mathbb{G}_{12}$-manifolds. Also, classes to which the studied manifolds do not belong are found. Special attention is paid to an $\eta $-Einstein manifold among the considered manifolds and its $\xi $-sectional, $\varphi $-sectional and scalar curvature are investigated. Examples of the examined manifolds are given.</description>

      <title>Noncollapsing for Curvature Flows with Inhomogeneous Speeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study closed, embedded hypersurfaces in Euclidean space evolving by fully nonlinear curvature flows, whose speed is given by a symmetric, monotone increasing, $1$-homogeneous, positive underlying speed function $F$ composed with a modulating function $\Psi$. Under the assumption that $F$ is convex or inverse-concave and that $\Psi$ satisfies the corresponding structural conditions, we establish exterior noncollapsing estimates for the flow. The main difficulty stems from the nonlinearity of the evolution equation satisfied in the viscosity sense by the exscribed curvature, whereas in previous works it is a solution to the linearized flow. Moreover, in the case where $F$ is inverse-concave, we refine Andrews and Langford's argument for the interior case.</description>

      <title>On the Ricci flow on Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the evolution of metrics on finite trees under continuous-time Ricci flows based on the Lin-Lu-Yau version of Ollivier Ricci curvature. We analyze long-time dynamics of edge weights and curvatures, providing precise characterizations of their limiting behaviors. We prove that the Ricci flow converges to metric with zero curvature on edges whose normalized weights converge to positive values only if the tree is a caterpillar tree.</description>

      <title>Holomorphicity of parabolic stable minimal surfaces of high codimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical theorem of Micallef says that if $F \colon (\Sigma, g) \to \mathbb{R}^4$ is a stable minimal immersion of an oriented $2$-dimensional complete Riemannian manifold (that is parabolic) into $\mathbb{R}^4$, it is necessarily holomorphic with respect to some parallel orthogonal complex structure on $\mathbb{R}^4$. We generalize this theorem by replacing $\mathbb{R}^4$ with $\mathbb{R}^{2 + 2k}$ for any codimension $2k$, under the additional hypothesis that the normal bundle $N \Sigma$ is equipped with a complex structure that is compatible with the induced metric and parallel with respect to the induced connection. This is a necessary assumption for such a theorem to hold, and it is automatically satisfied in the classical case $k=1$. We also briefly discuss possible further generalizations of such a result to other calibrations and to Smith maps.</description>

      <title>The twistor lifts of surfaces in 4-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a survey of the twistor lifts of surfaces in 4-spaces. In most part of this survey, the space is the Euclidean $4$-space $E^4$. The definitions of the Gauss maps and the twistor lifts of surfaces in $E^4$ are given by complex structures of $E^4$. Based on these definitions, we can understand that the Gauss maps of minimal surfaces are holomorphic and characterize isotropicity of minimal surfaces.</description>

      <title>On a variational problem for curves in Lie sphere geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda$ be the unit tangent bundle of the unit 3-sphere acted on transitively by the contact group of Lie sphere transformations. We study the Lie sphere geometry of generic curves in $\Lambda$ which are everywhere transversal to the contact distribution of $\Lambda$. By the method of moving frames, we prove that such curves can be parametrized by a Lie-invariant parameter, the Lie arclength, and that in this parametrization they are uniquely determined, up to Lie sphere transformation, by four local invariants, the Lie curvatures. We then consider the simplest Lie-invariant functional on generic transversal curves defined by integrating the differential of the Lie arclength. The corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations are computed and the critical curves are characterized in terms of their Lie curvatures. In our discussion, we adopt Griffiths' exterior differential systems approach to the calculus of variations.</description>

      <title>Neural Feature Geometry Evolves as Discrete Ricci Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks learn feature representations via complex geometric transformations of the input data manifold. Despite the models' empirical success across domains, our understanding of neural feature representations is still incomplete. In this work we investigate neural feature geometry through the lens of discrete geometry. Since the input data manifold is typically unobserved, we approximate it using geometric graphs that encode local similarity structure. We provide theoretical results on the evolution of these graphs during training, showing that nonlinear activations play a crucial role in shaping feature geometry in feedforward neural networks. Moreover, we discover that the geometric transformations resemble a discrete Ricci flow on these graphs, suggesting that neural feature geometry evolves analogous to Ricci flow. This connection is supported by experiments on over 20,000 feedforward neural networks trained on binary classification tasks across both synthetic and real-world datasets. We observe that the emergence of class separability corresponds to the emergence of community structure in the associated graph representations, which is known to relate to discrete Ricci flow dynamics. Building on these insights, we introduce a novel framework for locally evaluating geometric transformations through comparison with discrete Ricci flow dynamics. Our results suggest practical design principles, including a geometry-informed early-stopping heuristic and a criterion for selecting network depth.</description>

      <title>Comparison estimates on nonsmooth spaces with integrable Ricci lower bounds via localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study comparison estimates on metric measure spaces admitting a synthetic variable Ricci curvature lower bound. We obtain geometric and functional inequalities assuming that the deficit of the lower bound from a given constant is sufficiently integrable. More precisely, we extend to the nonsmooth setting the Bishop-Gromov comparison, the Myers' diameter estimate and the Cheng's comparison principle for Dirichlet eigenvalues. Our analysis relies on the localization method and on one-dimensional comparison estimates for nonsmooth weighted intervals.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of critical points of hydrophobic capillary functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the rigidity, among sets of finite perimeter, of volume-preserving critical points of the capillary energy in the half space, in the case where the prescribed interior contact angle is between $90^\circ$ and $120^\circ$. No structural or regularity assumption is required on the finite perimeter sets. Assuming that the ``tangential'' part of the capillary boundary is $\mathcal{H}^n$-null, this rigidity theorem extends to the full hydrophobic regime of interior contact angles between $90^\circ$ and $180^\circ$. Furthermore, we establish the anisotropic counterpart of this theorem under the assumption of lower density bounds.</description>

Abstract: Characteristic class relations in Dolbeault cohomology follow from the existence of a holomorphic geometric structure (for example, holomorphic conformal structures, holomorphic Engel distributions, holomorphic projective connections, and holomorphic foliations). These relations can be calculated directly from the representation theory of the structure group, without selecting any metric or connection or having any knowledge of the Dolbeault cohomology groups of the manifold. This paper improves on its predecessor [17] by allowing infinite type geometric structures.</description>

      <title>The space of positive transition measures on a Markov chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information geometry of Markov chains has been studied using the dually flat structure of the space of transition probabilities. Although applications of this structure have been investigated, few attempts have examined its statistical meaning. In this paper, we construct a foundation for investigating the statistical meaning based on Amari's theory of positive measures. For the space of discrete distributions, Amari has introduced the space of positive measures by removing the constraint condition and investigated the extended space by finding the Bregman and $F$-divergence suitably. According to this, we introduce an extension of the space of transition probabilities equipped with suitable $F$-divergence for a given Markov chain. We regard it as the space of positive transition measures on a Markov chain, and study its dually flat structure. This provides new insight into the geometry of Markov chains and may lead to the development of the theory of Markov embeddings.</description>

Abstract: Based on a quantitative version of the classical Hopf-Rinow theorem in terms of the doubling property, we prove new precompactness principles in the (pointed) Gromov-Hausdorff topology for domains in (maybe incomplete) Riemannian manifolds with a lower Ricci curvature bound, which are applicable to those with weak regularities considered in PDE theory, and the covering spaces of balls naturally appear in the study of local geometry and topology of manifolds with lower curvature bounds. All the new principles are more general than those earlier known for manifolds with smooth boundary, and improves those for manifolds with non-smooth boundary.</description>

Abstract: In this note we prove three rigidity results for Einstein manifolds with bounded covering geometry.

(2) A compact Einstein manifolds with a non-vanishing and almost maximal volume entropy is hyperbolic. (3) A compact Einstein manifold admitting a uniform local rewinding almost maximal volume is isometric to a space form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend our investigation of the class of biconservative surfaces with non-constant mean curvature in 4-dimensional space forms $N^4(\epsilon)$. Specifically, we focus on biconservative surfaces with non-parallel normalized mean curvature vector fields (non-PNMC) that have flat normal bundles and are Weingarten. In our initial result we obtain the compatibility conditions for this class of biconservative surfaces in terms of an ODE system. Subsequently, by prescribing the flat connection in the normal bundle, we prove an existence result for the considered class of biconservative surfaces. Furthermore, we determine all non-PNMC biconservative Weingarten surfaces with flat normal bundles that either exhibit a particular form of the shape operator in the direction of the mean curvature vector field or have constant Gaussian curvature $K = \epsilon$. Finally, we prove that such surfaces cannot be biharmonic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate four-dimensional gradient shrinking Ricci solitons with positive modified sectional curvature. Our first main result shows that if the norm of the self-dual Weyl tensor and the scalar curvature satisfy a certain sharp pinching condition (closely related, in a precise sense, to that of K\"ahler metric), then the soliton is necessarily locally K\"ahler. We further obtain a characterization theorem and a weighted integral gap result for compact gradient shrinking Ricci solitons with bounded modified sectional curvature. In addition, we establish a Hitchin-Thorpe type inequality for compact four-dimensional Ricci solitons, providing new topological constraints on such manifolds.</description>

      <title>Microlocal analysis of double fibration transforms with conjugate points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the structure of normal operators of double fibration transforms with conjugate points. Examples of double fibration transforms include Radon transforms, $d$-plane transforms on the Euclidean space, geodesic X-ray transforms, light-ray transforms, and ray transforms defined by null bicharacteristics associated with real principal type operators. We show that, under certain stable conditions on the distribution of conjugate points, the normal operator splits into an elliptic pseudodifferential operator and several Fourier integral operators, depending on the degree of the conjugate points. These problems were first studied for geodesic X-ray transforms by Stefanov and Uhlmann (Analysis \&amp; PDE, {\bf 5} (2012), pp.219--260). After that Holman and Uhlmann (Journal of Differential Geometry, {\bf 108} (2018), pp.459--494) proved refined results according to the degree of regular conjugate points.</description>
