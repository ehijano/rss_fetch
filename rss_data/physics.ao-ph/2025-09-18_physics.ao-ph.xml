      <title>Artificial neural networks ensemble methodology to predict significant wave height</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forecast of wave variables are important for several applications that depend on a better description of the ocean state. Due to the chaotic behaviour of the differential equations which model this problem, a well know strategy to overcome the difficulties is basically to run several simulations, by for instance, varying the initial condition, and averaging the result of each of these, creating an ensemble. Moreover, in the last few years, considering the amount of available data and the computational power increase, machine learning algorithms have been applied as surrogate to traditional numerical models, yielding comparative or better results. In this work, we present a methodology to create an ensemble of different artificial neural networks architectures, namely, MLP, RNN, LSTM, CNN and a hybrid CNN-LSTM, which aims to predict significant wave height on six different locations in the Brazilian coast. The networks are trained using NOAA's numerical reforecast data and target the residual between observational data and the numerical model output. A new strategy to create the training and target datasets is demonstrated. Results show that our framework is capable of producing high efficient forecast, with an average accuracy of $80\%$, that can achieve up to $88\%$ in the best case scenario, which means $5\%$ reduction in error metrics if compared to NOAA's numerical model, and a increasingly reduction of computational cost.</description>

      <title>Radar Maxima: calibrated area-based probabilistic forecasts for heavy precipitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present, motivate, and evaluate Radar Maxima, a calibrated area-based probabilistic forecast product for heavy precipitation. It is designed to overcome inherent limitations of point-based forecasts, which often yield low probabilities for extreme events due to spatial displacement errors. The method aggregates radar-derived precipitation within 40 km neighbourhoods to statistically upscale forecasts from the ensemble system ICON-D2-EPS of DWD. Evaluation considers both objective verification metrics and feedback from operational weather forecasters based on case studies. Verification shows improved predictability, reliability and forecast sharpness. Evaluation of forecasters confirmed operational value in some cases.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Verification of Lumped-Parameter, Multibody Structural Dynamics for Offshore Wind Turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the modeling and verification of multibody structural dynamics for offshore wind turbines. The flexible tower and support structure of a monopile-based offshore wind turbine are modeled using an acausal, lumped-parameter, multibody approach that incorporates structural flexibility, soil-structure interaction, and hydrodynamic models. Simulation results are benchmarked against alternative modeling approaches, demonstrating the model's ability to accurately capture both static and dynamic behaviors under various wind and wave conditions while maintaining computational efficiency. This work provides a valuable tool for analyzing key structural characteristics of wind turbines, including eigenfrequencies, mode shapes, damping, and internal forces.</description>

      <title>An Attention-Based Stochastic Simulator for Multisite Extremes to Evaluate Nonstationary, Cascading Flood Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compound flood risks from spatially and temporally clustered extremes challenge traditional risk models and insurance portfolios that often neglect correlated risks across regions. Spatiotemporally clustered floods exhibit fat-tail behavior, modulated by low-frequency hydroclimatic variability and large-scale moisture transport. Nonstationary stochastic simulators and regional compound event models aim to capture such tail risk, but have not yet unified spatial and temporal extremes under low-frequency hydroclimatic variability. We introduce a novel attention-based framework for multisite flood generation conditional on a multivariate hydroclimatic signal with explainable attribution to global sub-decadal to multi-decadal climate variability. Our simulator combines wavelet signal processing, transformer-based multivariate time series forecasting, and modified Neyman-Scott joint clustering to simulate climate-informed spatially compounding and temporally cascading floods. Applied to a Mississippi River Basin case study, the model generates distributed portfolios of plausibly clustered flood risks across space and time, providing a basis for simulating spatiotemporally correlated losses characteristic of flood-induced damage.</description>
