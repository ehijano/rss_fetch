      <title>Multiplicity-dependent jet modification from di-hadron correlations in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-range correlations between charged particles are studied via two-particle angular correlations in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. The correlation functions are measured as a function of the relative azimuthal angle $\Delta\varphi$ and the pseudorapidity separation $\Delta\eta$ for pairs of primary charged particles within the pseudorapidity interval $|\eta| &lt; 0.9$ and the transverse-momentum range $1 &lt; p_{\rm T} &lt; 8$ GeV/$c$. Near-side ($|\Delta\varphi|&lt;1.3$) peak widths are extracted from a generalised Gaussian fitted over the correlations in full pseudorapidity separation ($|\Delta\eta|&lt;1.8$), while the per-trigger associated near-side yields are extracted for the short-range correlations ($|\Delta\eta|&lt;1.3$). Both are evaluated as a function of charged-particle multiplicity obtained by two different event activity estimators. The width of the near-side peak decreases with increasing multiplicity, and this trend is reproduced qualitatively by the Monte Carlo event generators PYTHIA 8, AMPT, and EPOS. However, the models overestimate the width in the low transverse-momentum region ($p_{\rm T} &lt; 3$ GeV/$c$). The per-trigger associated near-side yield increases with increasing multiplicity. Although this trend is also captured qualitatively by the considered event generators, the yield is mostly overestimated by the models in the considered kinematic range. The measurement of the shape and yield of the short-range correlation peak can help us understand the interplay between jet fragmentation and event activity, quantify the narrowing trend of the near-side peak as a function of transverse momentum and multiplicity selections in pp collisions, and search for final-state jet modification in small collision systems.

      <title>Measurement of the Free Neutron Lifetime in a Magneto-Gravitational Trap with In Situ Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we publish three years of data for the UCNtau experiment performed at the Los Alamos Ultra Cold Neutron Facility at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center. These data are in addition to our previously published data. Our goals in this paper are to better understand and quantify systematic uncertainties and to improve the lifetime statistical precision. We report a measured value for these runs from 2020-2022 for the neutron lifetime of 877.94+/-0.37 s; when all the data from UCNtau are averaged we report an updated value for the lifetime of 877.82+/-0.22 (statistical)+0.20-0.17 (systematic) s. We utilized improved monitor detectors, reduced our correction due to UCN upscattering on ambient gas, and employed four different main UCN detector geometries both to reduce the correction required for rate dependence and explore potential contributions due to phase space evolution.</description>

      <title>Weak decays in superheavy nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superheavy nuclei represent the heaviest atoms and nuclides known at the limit of mass and charge. The observed superheavy nuclei are all proton-rich; they decay primarily by emitting $\alpha$ particles and fission, with a possible small electron capture (EC) branch. Due to the huge atomic numbers and associated relativistic effects, EC-decays of superheavy systems are expected to differ from what is known in lighter nuclei. In this paper, using the quantified relativistic nuclear density functional theory and the quasiparticle random-phase approximation with the interaction optimized to experimental $\beta^-$-decay half-lives and Gamow-Teller resonance energies, we study the EC/$\beta^\pm$-decays in $Z = 101-118$ nuclei. Both allowed ($1^+$) and first-forbidden ($0^-, 1^-$ and $2^-$) transitions are considered. We show that the first-forbidden $1^-$ transitions dominate the decay rates in almost all studied nuclei. For proton-rich nuclei, EC dominates over $\beta^+$ decay. We identify 44 nuclei with EC/$\beta^+$ branching ratio larger than 5\%, indicating a possible competition with $\alpha$-decay and spontaneous fission channels.</description>

      <title>Effect of vector meson spin coherence on the measurements of chiral magnetic effect in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect (CME) in heavy-ion collisions reflects the local violation of ${\cal P}$ and ${\cal CP}$ symmetries in strong interactions and manifests as electric charge separation along the direction of the magnetic field created by the wounded nuclei. The experimental observables for the CME, such as the $\gamma_{112}$ correlator, the $R_{\Psi_2}(\Delta S)$ correlator, and the signed balance functions, however, are also subject to non-CME backgrounds, including those from resonance decays. A previous study showed that the CME observables are affected by the diagonal component of the spin density matrix, the $\rho_{00}$ for vector mesons. In this work, we study the contributions from the other elements of the spin density matrix using a toy model and a multiphase transport model. We find that the real part of the $\rho_{1-1}$ component, $\mathrm{Re}\,\rho_{1-1}$, affects the CME observables in a manner opposite to that of the $\rho_{00}$. All three aforementioned CME observables show a linear dependence on $\mathrm{Re}\,\rho_{1-1}$ in the model calculations, supporting our analytical derivations. The rest elements of the spin density matrix do not contribute to the CME observables. The off-diagonal terms in the spin density matrix indicate spin coherence and may be nonzero in heavy-ion collisions due to local spin polarization or spin-spin correlations. Thus, $\mathrm{Re}\,\rho_{1-1}$, along with $\rho_{00}$, could play a significant role in interpreting measurements in search of the CME.</description>

      <title>Partial-wave analysis to determine the spin of $\Xi(1690)^-$ and $\Xi(1820)^-$ produced in $\overline{p}p$ annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently [arXiv:2201.03852v2] the PANDA collaboration studied the feasibility of determining the spin and parity of the $\Xi(1690)^{-}$and $\Xi(1820)^{-}$ resonances in the $\Lambda K^-$ system produced in $\bar{p}p$ collisions via the reaction channel $\overline{p} p \rightarrow \bar{\Xi}^{+} \Lambda K^{-}$. This contribution aims to study these reactions using a model-independent irreducible tensor formalism developed earlier. This study leads us to identify the partial-wave amplitude, which would be zero if $\Xi(1690)^{-}$ or $\Xi(1820)^{-}$ had spin-1/2, provided these resonances are produced at threshold (s-wave production).</description>

      <title>Strong decays of $a_0$, $f_0$, $f_2$, and $K^*_2$ resonances as dynamically generated states of two vector mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-body strong decays of the $f_0(1500)$, $f_0(1710)$, $a_0(1710)$, $f_2(1270)$, $f_2'(1525)$, and $K_2^*(1430)$ resonances are investigated, assuming them as dynamically generated states of two vector mesons via $s$-wave interactions. The partial decay widths of all the possible two-body pseudoscalar meson-pseudoscalar meson final states are calculated considering the triangular diagrams. It is found that the ratios of branching fractions are similar to the previous results for most channels, which were obtained by using the real-axis method and considering the box diagrams. However, there are also differences. In addition, our focus is on the partial decay widths. More precise experimental measurements are needed to test the model calculations and determine the nature of these scalar and tensor mesons. It is anticipated that the BES\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral3}, Belle\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2} and LHCb collaborations will conduct these measurements in the future.</description>

      <title>Probing strangeness with event topology classifiers in pp collisions at the LHC with rope hadronization mechanism in PYTHIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the formation of a deconfined and thermalized state of partons, known as quark-gluon plasma, leads to enhanced production of strange hadrons in contrast to proton-proton (pp) collisions, which are taken as baseline. This observation is known as strangeness enhancement in heavy-ion collisions and is considered one of the important signatures that can signify the formation of QGP. However, in addition to strangeness enhancement, recent measurements hint at observing several heavy-ion-like features in high-multiplicity pp collisions at the LHC energies. Alternatively, event shape observables, such as charged particle multiplicity, transverse spherocity, transverse sphericity, charged particle flattenicity, and relative transverse activity classifiers, can fundamentally separate hard interaction-dominated jetty events from soft isotropic events. These features of event shape observables can probe the observed heavy-ion-like features in pp collisions with significantly reduced selection bias and can bring all collision systems on equal footing. In this article, we present an extensive summary of the strange particle ratios to pions as a function of different event classifiers using the PYTHIA~8 model with color reconnection and rope hadronization mechanisms to understand the microscopic origin of strangeness enhancement in pp collisions and also prescribe the applicability of these event classifiers in the context of strangeness enhancement. Charged-particle flattenicity is found to be most suited for the study of strangeness enhancement, and it shows a similar quantitative enhancement as seen for the analysis based on the number of multi-parton interactions.</description>

      <title>A simple explanation for the absence of the spherical nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the EMC effect, the Cd puzzle and the SU3-IBM, a hypothesis can be given for a nucleus, that only the nucleus itself is a trivial (0,0) representation of the SU(3) group, which leads to a simple conclusion that spherical nucleus does not exist and the spherical mean field is not allowed. The key conclusion is that the color degree of freedom is required even at the low energy excitation of the nucleus.</description>

      <title>Exclusive vector-quarkonium photoproduction at NLO in alpha_s in collinear factorisation with evolution of the generalised parton distributions and high-energy resummation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the first complete one-loop study of exclusive photoproduction of vector quarkonia off protons in Collinear Factorisation (CF) including the scale evolution of the Generalised Parton Distributions (GPDs). We confirm the perturbative instability of the cross section at high photon-proton-collision energies (W_gamma+p) at Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) in alpha_s and solve this issue by resumming higher-order QCD corrections, which are enhanced by a logarithm of the parton energies, using High-Energy Factorisation (HEF) in the Doubly-Logarithmic Approximation (DLA) matched to CF. Our NLO CF + DLA HEF results are in agreement with the latest HERA data, show a smaller sensitivity to the factorisation and renormalisation scales compared to Born-order results. Quark-induced channels via interference with gluon ones are found to contribute at most 20% of the cross section for W_gamma+p &gt; 100 GeV. Our results also show that such exclusive cross sections cannot be accurately obtained from the square of usual Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) and clearly illustrate the importance of quarkonium exclusive photoproduction to advance our understanding of the 3D content of the nucleon in terms of gluons. Our work provides an important step towards a correct interpretation of present and future experimental data collected at HERA, the EIC, the LHC and future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-particle correlations are presented for K$^0_\mathrm{S}$, $\Lambda$, and $\overline\Lambda$ strange hadrons as a function of relative momentum in lead-lead collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 0.607 nb$^{-1}$ and was collected using the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. These correlations are sensitive to quantum statistics and to final-state interactions between the particles. The source size extracted from the K$^0_\mathrm{S}$K$^0_\mathrm{S}$ correlations is found to decrease from 4.6 to 1.6 fm in going from central to peripheral collisions. Strong interaction scattering parameters (i.e., scattering length and effective range) are determined from the $\Lambda$K$^0_\mathrm{S}$ and $\Lambda\Lambda$ (including their charge conjugates) correlations using the Lednick$\'y$-Lyuboshitz model and are compared to theoretical and other experimental results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonrelativistic effective field theory (NRET) is widely used in dark matter direct detection and charged-lepton flavor violation studies through $\mu \to e$ conversion. However, existing literature has not fully considered tensor couplings. This study fills this gap by utilizing an innovative tensor decomposition method, extending NRET to incorporate previously overlooked tensor interactions. This development is expected to have a significant impact on ongoing experiments seeking physics beyond the Standard Model and on our understanding of the new-physics interactions. Notably, we identify additional operators in $\mu \to e$ conversion that are absent in scalar and vector couplings. To support further research and experimental analyses, comprehensive tables featuring tensor matrix elements and their corresponding operators are provided.</description>

Abstract: We have developed an innovative methodology for obtaining the neutron energy distribution from a time-of-flight (TOF) measurement based on the iterative Bayesian unfolding method and accurate Monte Carlo simulations. This methodology has been validated through the analysis of a realistic virtual $\beta$-decay experiment, including the most relevant systematic effects in a real experiment. The proposed methodology allowed for obtaining accurate results over the energy range above the neutron detection threshold.</description>

      <title>Performance of CMS muon reconstruction from proton-proton to heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of muon tracking, identification, triggering, momentum resolution, and momentum scale has been studied with the CMS detector at the LHC using data collected at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV in proton-proton (pp) and lead-lead (PbPb) collisions in 2017 and 2018, respectively, and at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 8.16 TeV in proton-lead (pPb) collisions in 2016. Muon efficiencies, momentum resolutions, and momentum scales are compared by focusing on how the muon reconstruction performance varies from relatively small occupancy pp collisions to the larger occupancies of pPb collisions and, finally, to the highest track multiplicity PbPb collisions. We find the efficiencies of muon tracking, identification, and triggering to be above 90% throughout most of the track multiplicity range. The momentum resolution and scale are unaffected by the detector occupancy. The excellent muon reconstruction of the CMS detector enables precision studies across all available collision systems.</description>

Abstract: Optical atomic clocks$^{1,2}$ use electronic energy levels to precisely keep track of time. A clock based on nuclear energy levels promises a next-generation platform for precision metrology and fundamental physics studies. Thorium-229 nuclei exhibit a uniquely low energy nuclear transition within reach of state-of-the-art vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser light sources and have therefore been proposed for construction of the first nuclear clock$^{3,4}$. However, quantum state-resolved spectroscopy of the $^{229m}$Th isomer to determine the underlying nuclear structure and establish a direct frequency connection with existing atomic clocks has yet to be performed. Here, we use a VUV frequency comb to directly excite the narrow $^{229}$Th nuclear clock transition in a solid-state CaF$_2$ host material and determine the absolute transition frequency. We stabilize the fundamental frequency comb to the JILA $^{87}$Sr clock$^2$ and coherently upconvert the fundamental to its 7th harmonic in the VUV range using a femtosecond enhancement cavity. This VUV comb establishes a frequency link between nuclear and electronic energy levels and allows us to directly measure the frequency ratio of the $^{229}$Th nuclear clock transition and the $^{87}$Sr atomic clock. We also precisely measure the nuclear quadrupole splittings and extract intrinsic properties of the isomer. These results mark the start of nuclear-based solid-state optical clock and demonstrate the first comparison of nuclear and atomic clocks for fundamental physics studies. This work represents a confluence of precision metrology, ultrafast strong field physics, nuclear physics, and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>A unitary coupled-channel three-body amplitude with pions and kaons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-body dynamics above threshold is required for the reliable extraction of many amplitudes and resonances from experiment and lattice QCD. The S-matrix principle of unitarity can be used to construct dynamical coupled-channel approaches in which three particles scatter off each other, re-arranging two-body subsystems by particle exchange. This paper reports the development of a three-body coupled-channel, amplitude including pions and kaons. The unequal-mass amplitude contains two-body S- and P-wave subsystems ("isobars") of all isospins, $I=0,\,1/2,\,1,\, 3/2, \, 2$, and it also allows for transitions within a given isobar. The $f_0(500)\, ("\sigma"),\,f_0(980),\,\rho(700), K_0^*(700)\,("\kappa")$, and $K^*(892)$ resonances are included, apart from repulsive isobars. Different methods to evaluate the amplitude for physical momenta are discussed. Production amplitudes for $a_1$ quantum numbers are shown as a proof of principle for the numerical implementation.</description>
