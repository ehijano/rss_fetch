      <title>Quantum decoherence of gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum nature of gravity remains an open question in fundamental physics, lacking experimental verification. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a potential avenue for detecting gravitons, the hypothetical quantum carriers of gravity. However, by analogy with quantum optics, distinguishing gravitons from classical GWs requires the preservation of quantum coherence, which may be lost due to interactions with the cosmic environment causing decoherence. We investigate whether GWs retain their quantum state by deriving the reduced density matrix and evaluating decoherence, using an environmental model where a scalar field is conformally coupled to gravity. Our results show that quantum decoherence of GWs is stronger at lower frequencies and higher reheating temperatures. We identify a model-independent amplitude threshold below which decoherence is negligible, providing a fundamental limit for directly probing the quantum nature of gravity. In the standard cosmological scenario, the low energy density of the universe at the end of inflation leads to complete decoherence at the classical amplitude level of inflationary GWs. However, for higher energy densities, decoherence is negligible within a frequency window in the range $100\ {\rm Hz} \text{-} 10^8\ {\rm Hz}$, which depends on the reheating temperature. In a kinetic-dominated scenario, the dependence on reheating temperature weakens, allowing GWs to maintain quantum coherence above $10^7\ {\rm Hz}$.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Consequences of Varying Couplings in Gravity Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Lagrangian formulation for gravity with matter where the gravitational couplings are universally treated as being field-dependent. The solutions for FLRW geometries and the associated time evolution of the Newton and cosmological couplings are found. The distance-redshift relations are shown to prefer a slowly growing Newton's coupling along with a negative equation of state ($w\geq -\frac{1}{3}$) for the matter fluid at the present epoch of accelerated expansion, while ruling out Dirac's large number hypothesis. We obtain an improved bound on $\dot{G}(t)$ as: $1.67\times 10^{-11} yr^{-1}&lt;\frac{\dot{G}}{G}&lt;3.34\times 10^{-11} yr^{-1}$ in the context of supernova cosmology, as well as a new constraint on $\dot{\Lambda}(t)$ as: $-0.67\times 10^{-11} yr^{-1}&lt;\frac{\dot{\Lambda}}{\Lambda}&lt;-1.34\times 10^{-11} yr^{-1}$. Based on this formulation, we also present a dynamical solution to the `cosmic coincidence' problem.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15-year Data Set: Search for Gravitational Wave Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a search for nonlinear gravitational wave memory in the NANOGrav 15-year data set. We find no significant evidence for memory signals in the dataset, with a maximum Bayes factor of 3.1 in favor of a model including memory. We therefore place upper limits on the strain of potential gravitational wave memory events as a function of sky location and observing epoch. We find upper limits that are not always more constraining than previous NANOGrav results. We show that it is likely due to the increase in common red noise between the 12.5-year and 15-year NANOGrav datasets.</description>

      <title>Perturbative and non-linear analyses of gravitational turbulence in spacetimes with stable light rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some black hole mimickers, as well as black strings and other higher-dimensional spacetimes, exhibit stable light rings-regions where light or high-frequency gravitational waves can be trapped. In these regions, linear perturbations decay slowly, raising the possibility of nonlinear instability mechanisms. In this work, we study the cubic nonlinear wave equation as a proxy for Einstein's equations, using a four-dimensional model geometry that allows stable trapping. By employing a perturbative approach, we show that the nonlinear wave equation on the sphere with dissipative terms captures several features of the full nonlinear problem. This framework allows us to confirm a previous conjecture: all higher-order energy norms grow for arbitrarily small initial fluctuation amplitudes. Additionally, we analyze the system's mode spectrum at late times, revealing an inertial range dominated by a direct energy cascade. These findings further support the notion that spacetimes with stable light rings develop weak, high-frequency radiation hair, which will not generically lead to instabilities.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of circular light rays in a plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is the purpose of this paper to give a characterisation of circular light rays in a plasma on an axially symmetric and stationary spacetime. We restrict to the case of an unmagnetised, pressure-free electron-ion plasma and we assume that the plasma shares the symmetry of the spacetime. As a main tool we use two potentials, one for prograde and one for retrograde light rays, whose critical points are exactly the circular light rays in the plasma. In the case that the plasma density vanishes, the corresponding equipotential surfaces reduce to the relativistic Von Zeipel cylinders which have been discussed in many papers since the 1970s. In a plasma, the gradients of the potentials give the centrifugal and the Coriolis forces experienced by a light ray, where the plasma has an influence only on the centrifugal force. The introduction of these potentials allows us to generalise topological methods that have been successfully used for proving the existence or non-existence of circular vacuum light rays to the plasma case. The general results are illustrated with examples on Minkowski, Schwarzschild, Kerr and NUT spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Effect of primary scalar hair on black hole's strong lensing in Beyond Horndeski Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the gravitational lensing effects of a static, asymptotically flat black hole with primary scalar hair in Beyond Horndeski Gravity, focusing on the strong lensing regime. Recently, in Ref. [1], we placed constraints on the scalar hair parameter by analyzing its thermodynamic stability and the black hole shadow. In this work, we further investigate the strong lensing properties of the black hole, which form the basis of shadow formation, and employ observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope to derive more precise constraints on the scalar hair parameter. Additionally, we compute the shape and position of different lensed images of a thin accretion disk and argue that the observed black hole shadow corresponds to the secondary image of the emitting disk. Using this interpretation, we perform a new set of constraints on the scalar hair. Furthermore, we discuss why higher-order images are not suitable for astrophysical constraints, highlighting the limitations posed by their faintness and observational challenges. Finally, we find that models satisfying these constraints exhibit local instabilities.</description>

      <title>Generalized black-bounces solutions in f(R) gravity and their field sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we studied the possibility of generalizing spherically symmetric and static black-bounce solutions, known from General Relativity, to the $f(R)$ theory in metric formalism. For this purpose, we adopted two distinct approaches: the first involved choosing a known model of $f(R)$ theory, such as $f(R)=R+a_R R^2$, while the second focused on selecting models for the derivative of the $f(R)$ function, $f_R(R)$, such that the form of the $f(R)$ function itself depended on the chosen space-time model. All the selected models recover General Relativity for specific parameter choices. As a result, we demonstrated that black-bounce solutions can emerge from this theory when considering the coupling of $f(R)$ gravity with nonlinear electrodynamics and a partially phantom scalar field. We also analyzed the energy conditions of these solutions and found that, unlike in General Relativity, it is possible to satisfy all energy conditions in certain regions of space-time.</description>

      <title>Wormhole geometries in $f\left(R,T^2\right)$ gravity satisfying the energy conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the properties of traversable wormhole spacetimes within the framework of energy-momentum squared gravity, also known as $f(R,T^2)$ gravity, where $R$ represents the Ricci scalar, $T_{ab}$ is the energy-momentum tensor, and $T^2 = T_{ab}T^{ab}$. Adopting a linear functional form $f(R,T^2) = R + \gamma T^2$, we demonstrate the existence of a wide range of wormhole solutions that satisfy all of the energy conditions without requiring fine-tuning of the model parameters. Due to the inherent complexity of the field equations, these solutions are constructed through an analytical recursive method. However, they lack a natural localization, requiring a junction with an external vacuum region. To address this, we derive the corresponding junction conditions and establish that the matching must always be smooth, precluding the formation of thin shells at the interface. Using these conditions, we match the interior wormhole geometry to an exterior Schwarzschild solution, yielding localized, static, and spherically symmetric wormholes that satisfy all the energy conditions throughout the entire spacetime. Finally, we extend our analysis to more intricate dependencies on $T^2$, demonstrating that the methodology remains applicable as long as no mixed terms between $R$ and $T^2$ are introduced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the great interest in studying quantum and gravitational phenomena in a unified way, scalar bosons are considered in a cosmic-string spacetime and in a non-inertial framework, with a generalized gravitational interaction containing both relativistic and quantum corrections. Solutions for the quantum-corrected gravitational interaction for an arbitrary state are reported in a quasi-exact manner and a discussion of the structure of the problem, whose special case appears in double confluent Heun form, is given.</description>

      <title>Particle production induced by a Lorentzian non-commutative spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine particle production, evaporation, and greybody factors for a Lorentzian non-commutative black hole. We begin by analyzing particle creation for bosons, considering scalar perturbations to compute the Bogoliubov coefficients, which enable the determination of the Hawking temperature $T_{\Theta}$. Subsequently, we describe Hawking radiation as a tunneling process using the Painlev\'e-Gullstrand metric representation, allowing the evaluation of divergent integrals via the residue method. This approach yields the particle creation density for bosonic modes. Next, we extend the analysis to fermions, obtaining the corresponding particle creation density. The black hole evaporation is then examined through the Stefan-Boltzmann law, leading to an estimate of the black hole's lifetime. In this context, we identify the presence of a remnant mass when the black hole reaches the final stage of its evaporation. Furthermore, we compute greybody factors for bosons, taking into account scalar, vector, and tensorial perturbations. Finally, we determine the greybody factors for fermions as well. Overall, compared to the Schwarzschild case ($\Theta = 0$), the presence of the non-commutative parameter $\Theta$ lowers the Hawking temperature and reduces the particle creation density for both bosons and fermions, causing the evaporation process to proceed more slowly. Additionally, $\Theta$ decreases the magnitude of the greybody factors for bosons and fermions across all perturbations considered in this analysis.</description>

      <title>Work Statistics via Real-Time Effective Field Theory: Application to Work Extraction from Thermal Bath with Qubit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum thermal states are known to be passive, as required by the second law of thermodynamics. This paper studies the possible work extraction via coupling the thermal bath to a qubit of either spin, fermion, or topological types, which acts as a quantum thermal state at different temperatures. The amount of work extraction is derived from the work statistics under a cyclic nonequilibrium process. Though the work statistics of many-body systems are known to be challenging to calculate explicitly, we propose an effective field theory approach to tackle this problem by assuming the externally driven source to couple to a specific quasiparticle operator of the thermal state. We show that the work statistics can be expressed succinctly in terms of this quasiparticle's thermal spectral function. We obtain the non-perturbative work distribution function (WDF) for the pure thermal bath without the qubit coupling. With qubit coupling, we get the second-order WDF, from which the physical regime of work extraction can be pinned down precisely to help devise quantum engines.</description>

      <title>Implications of {\sigma}-cut potential on Antikaon condensates in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of neutron stars with antikaon condensation in the framework of the Relativistic Mean-Field (RMF) model with a $\sigma$-cut potential. The well-known RMF models, TM1 and TM1e, are used to analyze the structure and composition of neutron stars. The antikaon condensation part of the equation of state (EoS) is constrained from the experimental data of K$^{-}$ atomic and kaon-nucleon scattering. The $\sigma$-cut potential, which is known to make the EoS stiffer at high densities, is modulated by a free parameter $f_{s}$. Our present analysis suggests that one can obtain neutron star configurations heavier than 2$M_{\odot}$ with antikaon condensates in most cases for $f_{s}$ = 0.6. The antikaon phase transition is a second-order for $f_{s}$ = 0.6 for both TM1 and TM1e parameter sets. The calculated global properties of neutron stars with antikaon condensates i.e., mass and radius seem to be in resonable agreement with other theoretical and observational data.</description>

      <title>The Ising model as a window on quantum gravity with matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the Ising model CFT can be used to obtain some clear insights into 3D (quantum) gravity with matter. We review arguments for the existence of its holographic description, and concentrate on the time dependence of perturbations of the theory at high temperature, which would correspond to throwing matter into a black hole in the dual picture. Apart from an expected QNM-like exponential damping, we observe a plateau, a burst and a subsequent re-emergence of the whole signal, the latter being apparently at odds with a black hole interpretation. We provide an explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the properties of bulk matter fields and the fact that the geometry/metric is not fundamental but a derived quantity in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3D gravity. This allows for evading the black hole information paradox in the present context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As is very well-known, linearisation of the instanton equations on a 4-manifold gives rise to an elliptic complex of differential operators, the truncated (twisted) Hodge complex $\Lambda^0(\mathfrak{g}) \to \Lambda^1(\mathfrak{g})\to \Lambda^2_+(\mathfrak{g})$. Moreover, the linearisation of the full YM equations also fits into this framework, as it is given by the second map followed by its adjoint. We define and study properties of what we call the Pleba\'nski complex. This is a differential complex that arises by linearisation of the equations implying that a Riemannian 4-manifold is hyper-K\"ahler. We recall that these are most naturally stated as the condition that there exists a perfect $\Sigma^i\wedge \Sigma^j\sim\delta^{ij}$ triple $\Sigma^i, i=1,2,3$ of 2-forms that are closed $d\Sigma^i=0$. The Riemannian metric is encoded by the 2-forms $\Sigma^i$. We show that what results is an elliptic differential complex $TM \to S\to E\times \Lambda^1 \to E$, where $S$ is the tangent space to the space of perfect triples, and $E=\mathbb{R}^3$. We also show that, as in the case with instanton equations, the full Einstein equations $Ric=0$ also fit into this framework, their linearisation being given by the second map followed by its adjoint. Our second result concerns the elliptic operator that the Pleba\'nski complex defines. In the case of the instanton complex, operators appearing in the complex supplemented with their adjoints assemble to give the Dirac operator. We show how the same holds true for the Pleba\'nski complex. Supplemented by suitable adjoints, operators assemble into an elliptic operator that squares to the Laplacian and is given by the direct sum of two Dirac operators.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry breaking and restoration by helical magnetic fields in AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of helical magnetic fields on chiral symmetry breaking within the AdS/QCD framework using the D3/D7-brane model. By analyzing the brane embeddings, we obtain three types of massless solutions, corresponding to three phases with different behavior in the dual field theory. From the study of quark condensates, free energy, and electric currents, we find that helical magnetic fields can counteract uniform-field-induced symmetry breaking, driving the system towards symmetry restoration. We also find an effect analog to the chiral magnetic effect whereby the current is parallel to the magnetic field. We further study the massive case, and find that the helical configuration is less effective in erasing the first order phase transition that is present in the case of a constant magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Cosmological implications of Tracker scalar fields as dynamical dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The preference for dynamical dark energy over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model has gained attention in recent cosmological studies, particularly with results from the DESI experiment. We investigate this claim by analysing tracker scalar field models, which can alleviate the cosmic coincidence problem and transition to a cosmological constant-like behaviour at late times. Focusing on the inverse axionlike and inverse steep exponential potentials, we study their background evolution and perturbations, finding a mild suppression in the matter power spectrum compared to $\Lambda$CDM but no distinguishing features in the bispectrum. Using a combined dataset of ${\rm CMB}+{\rm BAO}+{\rm Pantheon~Plus}+{\rm Hubble\; parameter}+{\rm RSD}$, we perform a statistical comparison based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Our results indicate that standard $\Lambda$CDM model remains the most favoured model. While the inverse axionlike model is preferred over the inverse steep exponential model in terms of statistical evidence, neither provides compelling support for dynamical dark energy over the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism for the generation of magnetic fields on cosmological scales that is operative after recombination. An essential ingredient is an instability (of parametric resonance type) of the electromagnetic field driven by an oscillating pseudo-scalar dark matter field, $\phi$, that is coupled to the electromagnetic field tensor via a $\phi F \wedge F$ term in the Lagrangian of axion-electrodynamics. We find that magnetic fields larger than the observational lower bounds can be generated soon after recombination on scales of $1 {\rm{Mpc}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the inhomogeneous cosmology in Kaluza-Klein spacetime with a positive cosmological constant in a dust dominated era ($p = 0$). Depending on the integration constant we have derived two types of solutions. The dimensional reduction of extra dimensional scale factor is possible due to inhomogeneity depending on the curvature of the metric for positive cosmological constant for all solutions. The high value of entropy in present observable universe and the possible matter leakage in $4D$ world due to reduction of extra dimension are also discussed. Our solutions show the early deceleration and late accelerating nature of the universe. Findings are verified by the wellknown Raychaudhuri equation.</description>

      <title>Transition from adiabatic inspiral to plunge for eccentric binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09160v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black hole binaries with small mass ratios will be critical targets for the forthcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. They also serve as useful tools for understanding the properties of binaries at general mass ratios. In its early stages, such a binary's gravitational-wave-driven inspiral can be modeled as the smaller body flowing through a sequence of geodesic orbits of the larger black hole's spacetime. Its motion through this sequence is determined by the rate at which backreaction changes an orbit's integrals of motion $E$, $L_z$, and $Q$. Key to the motion being close to a geodesic at any moment is the idea that the effect of backreaction is small compared to a ``restoring force'' arising from the potential which governs geodesic motion. This restoring force holds the small body on a geodesic trajectory as the backreaction causes that geodesic to slowly evolve. As the inspiraling body approaches the last stable orbit (LSO), the restoring force becomes weaker and the backreaction becomes stronger. Once the small body evolves past the LSO, its trajectory converges to a plunging geodesic. This work aims to smoothly connect these two disparate regimes: the slowly evolving adiabatic inspiral and the final plunge. Past work has focused on this transition to plunge for circular systems. Here, we study the transition for binaries with eccentricity. A well-defined eccentric transition will make it possible to develop small-mass-ratio binary waveform models that terminate in a physically reasonable way, rather than abruptly terminating as an inspiral-only model ends. A model that can explore the parameter space of eccentricity may also be useful for understanding the final cycles of eccentric binaries at less extreme mass ratios, such as those likely to be observed by ground-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Einstein static Universe with boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10549v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The de Sitter state and the static Einstein Universe are unique states that have a constant scalar Ricci curvature ${\cal R}$. It was shown earlier that such a unique symmetry of the de Sitter state leads to special thermodynamic properties of this state, which are determined by the local temperature $T=1/(\pi R)$, where $R$ is the radius of the cosmological horizon. Then, what happens in the static Universe? We consider the original Einstein Universe, i.e. the so-called spherical Universe. It is half of the elliptical Universe $R\times S^3$, which was introduced later. Formally, the original Einstein Universe has a boundary at $r=R$. Here we consider the boundary at $r=R$ as a surface that connects the Einstein Universe with the thermal environment. In this realization of the Einstein Universe, it is characterized by a local temperature $T=1/(\pi R)$, which is analogous to the local temperature of the de Sitter state. Or, conversely, the temperature of environment heat bath determines the radius of the Universe, $R=1/\pi T$. The thermodynamics of the bounded Einstein Universe is also analogous to the thermodynamics of the de Sitter state. In particular, the entropy of the bounded Universe satisfies the holographic relation, $S=A/4G$, where $A=2\pi^2R^2$ is the area of the boundary. This shows that in thermodynamics the physical boundary of the static Einstein Universe plays the same role as the cosmological de Sitter horizon. In this Universe, Zeldovich's stiff matter is also preferred.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing by charged black hole with global monopole in strong field limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate gravitational lensing near a charged black hole with a global monopole in the strong field regime, focusing on two key observables: the angular separation between the first and subsequent images, and the ratio of the flux intensity of the first image to the cumulative flux intensity of all other images. By deriving analytical expressions for these observables, we explore the combined effects of the global monopole and black hole charge both analytically and numerically. Our results reveal that the dependence of the angular separation on charge is intricately tied to the deficit angle caused by the global monopole. In particular, we identify three critical values of the global monopole parameter that determine whether the angular separation increases monotonically, decreases monotonically, or exhibits extrema as the charge varies. A similar complex dependence is found for the flux ratio as a function of the deficit angle. These behaviors contrast sharply with the monotonic changes observed in the absence of either a global monopole or charge. Our findings highlight that the effects of the charge and global monopole on gravitational lensing cannot be described as simple additive contributions. Instead, their combined effects lead to a rich and interdependent behavior that enhances our understanding of strong-field gravitational lensing. While the charge and global monopole are expected to be small in typical astrophysical contexts, the results presented here could be experimentally explored in analogue gravity systems, where these parameters are not constrained. This opens the door to potential experimental verification of the phenomena predicted in this study.</description>

      <title>Global monopole in a Ricci-coupled Kalb-Ramond bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate black hole solutions in Einstein-Kalb-Ramond (EKR) bumblebee gravity sourced by a global monopole characterized by the charge $\eta$. This modified theory of gravity possesses the notable feature of incorporating local Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) via a spontaneous symmetry-breaking mechanism. We solve the field equations for a static and spherically symmetric metric with the Kalb-Ramond (KR) field fixed at its VEV, thereby obtaining new black hole solutions. These solutions simultaneously exhibit the LSB effects, codified by the $\gamma$ parameter, and the global monopole effects, codified by the charge $\eta$. Next, we study the impact of the global monopole and LSB corrections on two classical tests, namely, the advance of Mercury's perihelion and the light deflection. Furthermore, we compute the Hawking temperature, black hole shadows, and greybody factors. Ultimately, we estimate an upper bound for $\eta$ by comparing the theoretical results provided by the EKR model with observational data from the advance of Mercury's perihelion and light deflection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review explores modified theories of gravity, particularly $f(R)$ gravity, as extensions to General Relativity (GR) that offer alternatives to dark energy for explaining cosmic acceleration. These models generalize the Einstein-Hilbert action to include functions of the Ricci scalar, providing new insights into cosmology and astrophysics. The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) has enabled rigorous tests of $f(R)$ gravity, as deviations in GW propagation, speed, and polarization can signal modifications to GR. Constraints on $f(R)$ models arise from LIGO-Virgo observations of binary mergers, the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), and complementary tests in cosmology and weak-field regimes. Future GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope, will enhance sensitivity to smaller deviations from GR, necessitating advancements in theoretical modeling. Among competing theories -- including scalar-tensor, massive gravity, and Horndeski models -- $f(R)$ gravity remains a pivotal framework for understanding fundamental gravitational physics and cosmology. This review highlights key developments, challenges, and future directions in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and parametrize solutions to the constraint equations of general relativity in a neighborhood of Minkowski spacetime with arbitrary prescribed decay properties at infinity. We thus provide a large class of initial data for the results on stability of Minkowski which include a mass term in the asymptotics. Due to the symmetries of Minkowski, a naive linear perturbation fails. Our construction is based on a simplified conformal method, a reduction to transverse traceless perturbations and a nonlinear fixed point argument where we face linear obstructions coming from the cokernels of both the linearized constraint operator and the Laplace operator. To tackle these obstructions, we introduce a well-chosen truncated black hole around which to perturb. The control of the parameters of the truncated black hole is the most technical part of the proof, since its center of mass and angular momentum could be arbitrarily large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical predictions from a modified theory of gravity with a nonminimal coupling between matter and curvature are compared to data from recent cosmological surveys. We use type Ia supernovae data from the Pantheon+ sample and the recent 5-year Dark Energy Survey (DES) data release along with baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) to constrain the modified model's parameters and to compare its fit quality to the Flat-$\Lambda$CDM model. We find moderate to strong evidence for a preference of the nonminimally coupled theory over the current standard model for all dataset combinations. Although the modified model is shown to be capable of matching early-time observations from the cosmic microwave background and late-time supernovae data, we find that there is still some incoherence with respect to the conclusions drawn from baryon acoustic oscillation observations.</description>

      <title>Pulse-induced memory-like effect in cyclotron motion?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how a charged particle moving in a uniform magnetic field along its standard circular path (cyclotron motion) reacts to a short-duration, homogeneous, uniform electric field pulse injected in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. A `permanent' change in the radius of the initial circle and a shift of its centre is noted at later times, after the pulse is switched off. The velocity vector (components and magnitude) undergoes a change too, akin to a `velocity kick'. The cause behind this permanent change appears to be linked to the difference between the vector potentials before and after the duration of the electric pulse. Further, we show how such vector potentials in the past and future are related through a gauge transformation. In summary, our results suggest a pulse-induced `electromagnetic memory-like effect', which is not quite a `wave memory', but, nevertheless, has similar features within a simple, non-relativistic context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the modular flow and conjugation of time interval algebras of conformal Generalized Free Fields (GFF) in $(0+1)$-dimensions in vacuum. For non-integer scaling dimensions, for general time-intervals, the modular conjugation and the modular flow of operators outside the algebra are non-geometric. This is because they involve a Generalized Hilbert Transform (GHT) that treats positive and negative frequency modes differently. However, the modular conjugation and flows viewed in the dual bulk AdS$_2$ are local, because the GHT geometrizes as the local antipodal symmetry transformation that pushes operators behind the Poincar\'e horizon. These algebras of conformal GFF satisfy a $\textit{Twisted Modular Inclusion}$ and a $\textit{Twisted Modular Intersection}$ property. We prove the converse statement that the existence of a (twisted) modular inclusion/intersection in any quantum system implies a representation of the (universal cover of) conformal group $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$, respectively. We discuss the implications of our result for the emergence of Stringy AdS$_2$ geometries in large $N$ theories without a large gap. Our result applied to higher dimensional eternal AdS black holes explains the emergence of two copies of $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$ on future and past Killing horizons.</description>

Abstract: Both particle physics experiments and cosmological observations have been used to explore neutrino properties. Cosmological researches of neutrinos often rely on the early-universe cosmic microwave background observations or other late-universe probes, which mostly focus on large-scale structures. We introduce a distinct probe, the 21-cm forest, that differs from other probes in both time and scale. Actually, the 21-cm forest is a unique tool for studying small-scale structures in the early universe. Below the free-streaming scale, massive neutrinos suppress the matter power spectrum, influencing small-scale fluctuations in the distribution of matter. The one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum of the 21-cm forest can track these fluctuations across different scales, similar to the matter power spectrum, providing an effective method to constrain neutrino mass. Although heating effects in the early universe can also impact the 1D power spectrum of the 21-cm forest, we assess the potential of the 21-cm forest as a tool for measuring neutrino mass, given that the temperature of the intergalactic medium can be constrained using other methods within a certain range. In the ideal scenario, the 21-cm forest observation will have the ability to constrain the total neutrino mass to around 0.1 eV. With the accumulation of observational data and advancements in observational technology, the 21-cm forest holds great promise as an emerging and potent tool for measuring neutrino mass.</description>

      <title>Rapidly spinning dark matter-admixed neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17948</link>

Abstract: Millisecond pulsars, representing the older neutron star population, are believed to have undergone a prolonged period of dark matter accumulation, resulting in a higher dark matter content. Their extreme rotation makes them unique laboratories for studying rapidly rotating neutron stars admixed with dark matter. In this work, we model uniformly rotating neutron stars with a dark matter component that rotates independently from the baryon matter, allowing for the investigation of both co-rotating and counter-rotating scenarios. We examine the impact of dark matter rotation on the macroscopic properties of neutron stars, including the mass-radius relation, the mass-shedding Keplerian limit, and moments of inertia, for various dark matter particle masses and total fractions, considering both core and halo distributions. Our findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of how dark matter influences the equilibrium properties of rotating neutron stars, offering new insights into the astrophysical implications of self-interacting dark matter.</description>
