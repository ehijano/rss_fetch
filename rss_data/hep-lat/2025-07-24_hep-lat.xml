      <title>Modified L\"uscher zeta-function and the modified effective range expansion in the presence of a long-range force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An efficient numerical algoritm is proposed for the calculation of the modified L\"uscher zeta-function in the presence of a long-range force. Using the formalism developed in Ref.~\cite{Bubna:2024izx} for the analysis of synthetic data on the finite-volume energy levels in a toy model, it is demonstrated that, in contrast to the standard L\"uscher approach, the truncation of the higher partial waves has very little effect on the final result. Furthermore, the regularization and renormalization of the modified L\"uscher zeta-function is discussed in detail, as well as the problems arising within the cutoff regularization. It is shown that, using the renormalization scheme proposed in the present paper, one obtains modified effective range expansion parameters of natural size in all partial waves.</description>

      <title>Decoding the proton's gluonic density with lattice QCD-informed machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a first machine learning-based decoding of the gluonic structure of the proton from lattice QCD using a variational autoencoder inverse mapper (VAIM). Harnessing the power of generative AI, we predict the parton distribution function (PDF) of the gluon given information on the reduced pseudo-Ioffe-time distributions (RpITDs) as calculated from an ensemble with lattice spacing $a\! \approx\! 0.09$ fm and a pion mass of $M_\pi\! \approx\! 310$ MeV. The resulting gluon PDF is consistent with phenomenological global fits within uncertainties, particularly in the intermediate-to-high-$x$ region where lattice data are most constraining. A subsequent correlation analysis confirms that the VAIM learns a meaningful latent representation, highlighting the potential of generative AI to bridge lattice QCD and phenomenological extractions within a unified analysis framework.</description>

      <title>Resource-Efficient Simulations of Particle Scattering on a Digital Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop and demonstrate methods for simulating the scattering of particle wave packets in the interacting Thirring model on digital quantum computers, with hardware implementations on up to 80 qubits. We identify low-entanglement time slices of the scattering dynamics and exploit their efficient representation by tensor networks. Circuit compression based on matrix product state techniques yields on average a reduction by a factor of 3.2 in circuit depth compared to conventional approaches, allowing longer evolution times to be evaluated with higher fidelity on contemporary quantum processors. Utilizing zero-noise extrapolation in combination with Pauli twirling, on quantum hardware we accurately simulate the full scattering dynamics on 40 qubits, and further demonstrate the wave packet state-preparation on 80 qubits.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Muon Anomaly from $e^+ e^-\to$ Hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this talk, I revisit and present a more comprehensive estimate of the lowest order Hadronic Vacuum Polarization (HVP) contribution $a_\mu\vert_{hvp}^{lo}$ to the muon anomalous magnetic moment (muon anomaly) from $e^+e^-\to$ Hadrons obtained recently in Ref.[1]. New CMD-3 data on $e^+e^-\to 2\pi$ [2] and precise BABAR [3] and recent BELLE2 [4] $e^+e^-\to 3\pi$ data are usedto update the estimate of the $I=0$ isoscalar channel below the $\phi$-meson mass. Adding the data compiled by PDG22 [5] above 1 GeV and the QCD improved continuum used in Ref. [1], one deduces\,: $a_\mu\vert^{hvp}_{lo}=(7043\pm 37)\times 10^{-11} $.Including the Higher Order $a_\mu\vert_{hvp}^{ho}$ corrections, the phenomenological estimate of the Hadronic Light by Light scattering up to NLO and the QED and Electroweak (EW) contributions, one obtains\,: $\Delta a_\mu^{pheno}\equiv a_\mu^{exp}-a_{\mu}^{pheno}= (136\pm 41)\times 10^{-11}$ where the recent experimental value $a_\mu^{exp}$ [6] has been used. This result consolidates the previous one in Ref. [1] and can be compared with the one $\Delta a_\mu^{lattice}= (90\pm 56)\times 10^{-11}$ using the most precise Lattice result. Then, we deduce the (tentative) SM prediction average : $\Delta a_\mu^{SM}= (120\pm 33)\times 10^{-11}$. We complete the paper by reviewing our predictions on the LO HVP contributions to the $\tau$ anomaly $a_\tau\vert^{hvp}_{lo}=(3495\pm 25)\times 10^{-11} $and to $\Delta \alpha^{(5)}_{had}(M_Z^2)=(2766\pm 4.5)\times 10^{-5}$ for 5 flavours obtained in Ref.[1].</description>

      <title>Three-qubit encoding in ytterbium-171 atoms for simulating 1+1D QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating nuclear matter described by quantum chromodynamics using quantum computers is notoriously inefficient because of the assortment of quark degrees of freedom such as matter/antimatter, flavor, color, and spin. Here, we propose to address this resource efficiency challenge by encoding three qubits within individual ytterbium-171 atoms of a neutral atom quantum processor. The three qubits are encoded in three distinct sectors: an electronic "clock" transition, the spin-1/2 nucleus, and the lowest two motional states in one radial direction of the harmonic trapping potential. We develop a family of composite sideband pulses and demonstrate a universal gate set and readout protocol for this three-qubit system. We then apply it to single-flavor quantum chromodynamics in 1+1D axial gauge for which the three qubits directly represent the occupancy of quarks in the three colors. We show that two atoms are sufficient to simulate both vacuum persistence oscillations and string breaking. We consider resource requirements and connections to error detection/correction. Our work is a step towards resource-efficient digital simulation of nuclear matter and opens new opportunities for versatile qubit encoding in neutral atom quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo studies of the emergent spacetime in the polarized IKKT model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IKKT matrix model has been investigated as a promising nonperturbative formulation of superstring theory. One of the recent developments concerning this model is the discovery of the dual supergravity solution corresponding to the model obtained after supersymmetry-preserving mass deformation, which is dubbed the polarized IKKT model. Here we perform Monte Carlo simulations of this model in the case of matrix size N = 2 for a wide range of the deformation parameter Omega. While we reproduce precisely the known result for the partition function obtained by the localization method developed for supersymmetric theories, we also calculate the observables, which were not accessible by previous work, in order to probe the spacetime structure emergent from the dominant matrix configurations. In particular, we find that the saddle point corresponding to the original IKKT model is smoothly connected to the saddle represented by the fuzzy sphere dominant at large Omega, whereas the dominant configurations become diverging commuting matrices at small Omega.</description>

      <title>Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03647v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which is understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, $S$-duality, topological invariants, flat bands, and topologically quantized current in the incommensurate regimes. In essence, this work unveils an unexpected link between gravity and gauge fields, opens new avenues for studying analog gravity, e.g., the Unruh effect and universe expansions/contractions, suggests the existence of an $S$-duality of spacetime curvatures, and hints at novel pathways to quantized gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Regularizing 3D conformal field theories via anyons on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently introduced ''fuzzy sphere'' method has enabled accurate numerical regularizations of certain three-dimensional (3D) conformal field theories (CFTs). The regularization is provided by the non-commutative geometry of the lowest Landau level filled by electrons, such that the charge is trivially gapped due to the Pauli exclusion principle at filling factor $\nu=1$, while the electron spins encode the desired CFT. Successful applications of the fuzzy sphere to paradigmatic CFTs, such as the 3D Ising model, raise an important question: how finely tuned does the underlying electron system need to be? Here, we show that the 3D Ising CFT can also be realized at fractional electron fillings. In such cases, the CFT spectrum is intertwined with the charge-neutral spectrum of the underlying fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state -- a feature that is trivially absent in the previously studied $\nu=1$ case. Remarkably, we show that the mixing between the CFT spectrum and the FQH spectrum is strongly suppressed within the numerically-accessible system sizes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the CFT critical point is unaffected by the exchange statistics of the particles and by the nature of topological order in the charge sector. Our results set the stage for the fuzzy-sphere exploration of conformal critical points between topologically-ordered states.</description>
