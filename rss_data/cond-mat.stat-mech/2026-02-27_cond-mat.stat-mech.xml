      <title>An Information-theoretic Collective Variable for Configurational Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropy governs molecular self-assembly, phase transitions, and material stability, yet remains challenging to quantify and directly control in molecular systems. Here, we demonstrate that the computable information density (CID), a data compression-based information theoretic metric, provides an instantaneous general measure of configurational entropy in molecular dynamics simulations, reflecting both local and long-range structural organization. We validate the CID across systems of increasing complexity, beginning with single-component Lennard-Jones melting before examining binary phase separation, polymer condensation and dispersion, and assembly of amorphous carbon networks at multiple densities. Unlike conventional order parameters, CID requires no a priori knowledge of relevant structural features and captures entropic signatures across a variety of molecular systems and discretization resolutions. By establishing entropy as a directly accessible structural metric, this framework lays a foundation for future entropy-driven materials design and optimization strategies.</description>

      <title>Dephasing-induced relaxation in tight-binding chains with linear and nonlinear defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate thermalization in a tight-binding chain with an on-site defect subject to local dephasing noise implemented as random phase kicks. For a single linear defect of strength $\epsilon$, we obtain an exact analytical description of the system spectrum and formulate the dephasing-induced dynamics in the eigenstate basis. We derive an approximate kinetic equation for mode populations that describes a continuous-time random walk in action space. The walk transition rates are defined by the overlap matrix encoding the spatial structure of eigenstates that can be computed exactly. Analyzing the spectral properties of the equation, we show that defect-induced localized modes act as bottlenecks that strongly slow down relaxation, with rates scaling as $\epsilon^{-2}$ for strong defects. Using large-deviation theory, we characterize rare dynamical trajectories and identify distinct relaxation pathways associated with low- and high-activity regimes in action space. We provide numerical evidence that the large-deviation function exhibits a dynamical phase transition in the limit $\epsilon \to \infty$. We then extend our analysis to the nonlinear case, considering a single nonlinear defect embedded in either a linear or a fully nonlinear discrete Schr\"odinger equation. Numerical simulations reveal a qualitatively faster approach to equilibrium driven by the amplitude-dependent weakening of the defect. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding thermalization, rare fluctuations, and relaxation pathways in stochastic tight-binding systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic uncertainty relation under continuous measurement and feedback with quantum-classical-transfer entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) under quantum continuous measurement and feedback control. By incorporating the quantum-classical-transfer entropy, which quantifies the information gained by continuous measurement, we show that the precision of currents is constrained by information-thermodynamic costs such as the entropy production and information gain. Our result shows that information gain has the potential to enhance the precision of currents beyond the bounds set by the conventional TUR. We illustrate the bound with a driven two-level system under continuous measurement and feedback, demonstrating that feedback achieves higher precision of currents while suppressing the entropy production.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic fluctuation theory of particle systems driven by Poisson noise: study of the $q$-TASEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We pursue our study of integrable weak noise theories of directed polymer and interacting particle stochastic models in the 1D KPZ universality class. Here we focus on the $q$-TASEP in either continuous or discrete time. Each particle on $\mathbb{Z}$ jumps independently by $+1$ with a rate (or probability) depending on the gap to the next particle on its right. We consider initial conditions (either step or random) which are empty of particles on $\mathbb{Z}^+$, and focus on the dynamics of the $N$ rightmost particles. In the limit $q \to 1$ and at large time (and large gaps) we identify a new intermediate "mesoscopic" (i.e. finite $N$) regime which corresponds to weak noise. In that regime Poisson noise remains important. We obtain the large deviations of the position of a given particle by two methods. The first derives asymptotics of $q$-TASEP Fredholm determinant formula. The second maps the weak noise limit to a system of semi-discrete or fully discrete, non linear differential equations. These are obtained as saddle point classical equations of a dynamical field theory, and their solutions represent the optimal configurations in the large deviation regime. We show the classical integrability of these two systems, and exhibit their explicit Lax pair. In the case of the continuous time $q$-TASEP it provides the first instance of classical integrability arising in a stochastic system, with signatures of the Poisson noise persisting in the weak noise limit. For this model, we solve the scattering problem associated to its Lax pair and fully characterize the large deviations associated to the weak noise theory. Finally, we supplement this work with an Appendix on the first cumulant method to obtain the large deviations of several lattice polymer models (Strict Weak, Log Gamma, Beta).</description>

      <title>Memory-induced active particle ratchets: Mean currents and large deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse a continuous-time random walk model with stochastic reversals of direction. There is no external potential but the reorientation mechanism generates a non-zero current from asymmetry in the forward and backward waiting-time distributions (even when they have the same mean); the system can therefore can be considered as a type of active particle ratchet. We derive an explicit expression for the mean ratchet current with exponentially distributed reorientation times and also develop a general renewal-theory framework to obtain the full large deviations, using this to comment on the possibility of dynamical phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Partial Reversibility and Counterdiabatic Driving in Nearly Integrable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic (or reversible) processes are the key concept unifying our understanding of thermodynamics and dynamical systems. Reversibility in the thermodynamic sense is understood as entropy-preserving processes, such as in the idealized Carnot engine, whereas in integrable dynamical systems it is understood as the conservation of the action variables. Between these two idealized limits, however, where the phase space can become mixed, things are much less clear. In this work, we first determine the extent to which reversible processes are even possible in this regime. We then explore how the dissipative losses resulting from rapidly driving these kinds of systems can be fought by approximate counterdiabatic driving. Finally, we argue that much of the phenomenology should be the same for quantum many-body systems with large degeneracy in the presence of integrability breaking perturbations.</description>

      <title>Resurgence in the Virasoro Minimal String and 3d Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute non-perturbative, resurgent contributions to the Virasoro minimal string and 3d gravity using techniques from hermitian matrix models. In particular, we construct a fully non-perturbative partition function for the Virasoro minimal string in terms of a Zak transform. In this context, negative tension D-branes appear naturally, which in the matrix model correspond to anti-eigenvalues, or instantons on the involuted sheet of the spectral curve. We further extend this analysis to resolvents and observe resurgent wall crossing phenomena between ZZ- and FZZT-branes. Using recent results that relate the Virasoro minimal string to 3d gravity with end-of-the-world branes we proceed to study the resurgent consequences of summing over the genus in 3d gravity, where we find non-perturbative contributions of doubly exponential type. These statements are then tested using resurgent large-order asymptotics. Lastly, we compute the non-perturbative eigenvalue density for generic hermitian matrix models and identify the change of asymptotic behavior at the edge of the eigenvalue distribution with a Stokes transition. This allows us to identify oscillations in the eigenvalue density with anti-Stokes behavior of FZZT-branes. In the case of 3d gravity with end-of-the-world branes we comment how this Stokes transition coincides with the onset of black hole behaviour and compute the non-perturbative primary density. Furthermore, we apply these techniques to the eigenvalue density of JT gravity to compute higher genus corrections.</description>

      <title>Hidden $Z_{2}\times Z_{2}$ subspace symmetry protection for quantum scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the paradigmatic spin-1 XY chain under open boundary conditions, which hosts exact quantum many-body scars generated by an emergent Spectrum Generating Algebra (SGA). We show that the scar subspace possesses a symmetry-protected trivial (SPt) character that we attribute to a hidden $Z_{2}\times Z_{2}$ symmetry of another model, namely the commutant Hamiltonian, for which the scars are the ground states. We construct a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) type twist operator, which, for scar states, takes the value $-1,$ and, for ergodic states, approaches zero in the thermodynamic limit. A complementary understanding of the stability of the scars under different perturbations is obtained by analyzing the Loschmidt echo and Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) of the scars. Finite-size scaling analysis of the QFI reveals that the scars are much more sensitive to perturbations as compared to the nearby thermal states. Based on the analysis of QFI and different LSM twist operators, we obtain a classification of different SGA-preserving and SGA-breaking perturbations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation with Quantum Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations are intrinsic to microscopic systems and impose fundamental limits on nonequilibrium precision, as captured by the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR), which links current fluctuations to entropy production. While feedback control is expected to further suppress fluctuations, its role within the TUR framework has remained unclear, particularly in quantum systems where control is inherently information-driven. In this Letter, we consider open quantum systems weakly coupled to a thermal environment, in which quantum jumps are continuously monitored, and Markovian feedback is applied. Using quantum mutual information to quantify the information contribution induced by feedback, we derive a finite-time TUR for arbitrary time-integrated currents in terms of entropy production and mutual information. Our results uncover how feedback control suppresses fluctuations together with thermodynamic cost and establishes a fundamental precision bound imposed by information-based control. As an application, we analyze a quantum clock model and demonstrate that the clock precision can be enhanced by feedback control in the presence of a single thermal reservoir.</description>

      <title>Exact Rheology of Uniform Shear Flow in a Gas of Inelastic and Rough Maxwell Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the steady uniform shear flow of a granular gas composed of inelastic and rough Maxwell particles. Exploiting the mean-field character of the model, we derive exact expressions for the collisional production rates of the second-degree moments and obtain a closed nonlinear solution for the stress and spin-spin tensors. The rotational-to-translational temperature ratio and the proportionality between the spin-spin and stress tensors are shown to be independent of the coefficient of normal restitution and determined solely by roughness and moment of inertia. The reduced normal stresses, shear stress, and shear rate are obtained explicitly in terms of two effective parameters generalizing the cooling and stress relaxation rates of the smooth model. From these results we derive exact expressions for the non-Newtonian shear viscosity, the first viscometric function, and the friction coefficient. The dependence of the rheological properties on the normal and tangential restitution coefficients is analyzed in detail, revealing strong non-Newtonian behavior and nonmonotonic effects of roughness. The results reduce, in the appropriate limits, to those of the inelastic Maxwell model for smooth particles and to the Pidduck gas in the elastic perfectly rough case.</description>

      <title>Coupling between Phase Separation and Geometry on a Closed Elastic Curve: Free Energy Minimization and Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the free energy and dynamics of a closed elastic filament (a one-dimensional curve in two dimensions) whose local internal state is specified by curvature, stretch, and a scalar density field representing, for example, the concentration of an absorbed species. The density variable has a tendency to phase-separate whereas the local spontaneous curvature is concentration-dependent. There is also a coupling between concentration and the stretching of the filament, although our main interest is in the nearly inextensible regime. We formulate and simulate the dynamics, comprising a coupled Willmore flow and Cahn-Hilliard gradient flow on the full differential geometry of a closed filament, addressing issues that previous work typically sidestepped by restricting to the Monge gauge. We use a numerical strategy for global free energy minimization, presenting the equilibrium shapes and density profiles across a wide range of model parameters. The phase diagram is dominated by a relatively small number of simple shapes that exhibit, as expected, strong coupling between local curvature and concentration. We also find regimes where curvature and/or stretching energies suppress phase separation altogether. For selected parameter values we present fully dynamical results, tracking the time evolution of the various contributions to the free energy. The dynamics often arrive at metastable minima rather than the equilibrium state - for example, at states with more than the minimum number of interfaces between coexisting phases. The metastability of these states is absent for phase separation on a rigid circular domain and thus a direct result of the coupling between geometry and density.</description>

      <title>Discrete turn strategies emerge in information-limited navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigation up a sensory gradient is one of the simplest behaviours, and the simplest strategy is run and tumble. But some organisms use other strategies, such as reversing direction or turning by some angle. Here we ask what drives the choice of strategy, which we frame as maximising up-gradient speed using a given amount of sensory information per unit time. We find that, without directional information on which way to turn, behavioural strategies which make sudden turns perform better than gradual steering. We see various transitions where a different strategy becomes optimal, such as a switch from reversing direction to fully re-orienting tumbles as more information becomes available. And, among more complex re-orientation strategies, we show that discrete turn angles are best, and see transitions in how many such angles the optimal strategy employs.</description>

      <title>Arrested Relaxation in a Disorder-Free Coulomb Spin Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Coulomb spin liquids in classical spin-3/2 ice and show that the enlarged on-site Hilbert space gives rise to a qualitatively new class of such phases. Beyond the conventional magnetic monopoles of spin-1/2 ice, the system hosts additional low-energy crystal-field excitations, whose interplay with monopoles significantly modifies both equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties. Following a thermal quench, we find a pronounced dynamical arrest manifested in an exponentially long-lived {athermal} plateau in spin autocorrelations. This constitutes a rare example of dynamical arrest in a short-range interacting, disorder-free system. We demonstrate that the arrested dynamics originate from novel composite excitation structures unique to spin-3/2 ice and from kinetically constrained relaxation pathways that require activated processes. Our results establish higher-spin ice as a fertile platform for realising unconventional Coulomb spin liquids and dynamical arrest without quenched disorder.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Flat-Histogram Simulations of Non-Equilibrium Stochastic Processes with Continuous and Discontinuous Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As far as we know, there is no flat-histogram algorithm to sample the stationary distribution of non-equilibrium stochastic processes. The present work addresses this gap by introducing a generalization of the Wang-Landau algorithm, applied to non-equilibrium stochastic processes with local transitions. The main idea is to sample macroscopic states using a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm to generate trial moves, which are accepted or rejected with a probability that depends inversely on the stationary distribution. The stationary distribution is refined through the simulation by a modification factor, leading to convergence toward the true stationary distribution. A visitation histogram is also accumulated, and the modification factor is updated when the histogram satisfies a flatness condition. The stationary distribution is obtained in the limit where the modification factor reaches a threshold value close to unity. To test the algorithm, we compare simulation results for several stochastic processes with theoretically known behavior. In addition, results from the kinetic flat-histogram algorithm are compared with standard exact stochastic simulations. We show that the kinetic flat-histogram algorithm can be applied to phase transitions in stochastic processes with bistability, which describe a wide range of phenomena such as epidemic spreading, population growth, chemical reactions, and consensus formation. With some adaptations, the kinetic flat-histogram algorithm can also be applied to stochastic models on lattices and complex networks.</description>

      <title>Ruelle-Pollicott resonances of diffusive U(1)-invariant qubit circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Ruelle-Pollicott resonances of translationally invariant magnetization-conserving qubit circuits via the spectrum of the quasi-momentum-resolved truncated propagator of extensive observables. Diffusive transport of the conserved magnetization is reflected in the Gaussian quasi-momentum $k$ dependence of the leading eigenvalue (Ruelle-Pollicott resonance) of the truncated propagator for small $k$. This, in particular, allows us to extract the diffusion constant. For large $k$, the leading Ruelle-Pollicott resonance is not related to transport and governs the exponential decay of correlation functions. Additionally, we conjecture the existence of a continuum of eigenvalues below the leading diffusive resonance, which governs non-exponential decay, for instance, power-law hydrodynamic tails. We expect our conclusions to hold for generic systems with exactly one U(1) conserved quantity.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional lattice random walks in a Gaussian random potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23985v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study random walks evolving in continuous time on a one-dimensional lattice where each site $x$ hosts a quenched random potential $U_x$. The potentials on different sites are independent, identically distributed Gaussian random variables. We analyze three distinct models that specify how the transition rates depend on $U_x$: the random-force-like model, random walks with randomized stepping times, and the Gaussian trap model. Our analysis focuses on five key disorder-dependent quantities defined for a finite chain with $N$ sites: the probability current, its reciprocal (the resistance), the splitting probability $E_-$, the mean first-passage time $T_N$, and the diffusion coefficient $D_N$ in a periodic chain. By determining the moments of these random variables, we demonstrate that the probability current and resistance are not self-averaging, which leads to pronounced differences between their average and typical behaviors. In contrast, $E_-$, $T_N$ and $D_N$ become self-averaging when $N \to \infty$, though they exhibit strong sample-to-sample fluctuations for finite $N$.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic MCT theory resolves Giant Non-Gaussian Parameter and Flory's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending Prigogine's ideas to the interior of the system, we generalize mode-coupling theory from a microscopic to a mesoscopic formulation by incorporating the non-equilibrium eigen-phase. The resulting framework resolves two long-standing puzzles in glass transition physics with an error less than 0.01 against experiments: (i) the giant non-Gaussian parameter $\alpha_{2} \sim 1-10$ which exceeds standard MCT predictions (only 0.1) by two orders of magnitude; (ii) the universal WLF constant $C_{1}=17 \ln 10 /(3 \sqrt{42}-19) \approx 16.7$, empirically observed for seven decades but never derived from first principles(e.g. Adam-Gibbs $C_{1}=8.5$, while other theories are off by more than a factor of two). These results establish mesoscopic MCT as a measurable foundation for non-equilibrium thermodynamics, unifying dynamic heterogeneity and thermodynamic universality in glass-forming systems.</description>

      <title>peapods: A Rust-Accelerated Monte Carlo Package for Ising Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present peapods (github.com/PeaBrane/peapods), an open-source Python package for Monte Carlo simulation of Ising spin systems with arbitrary coupling constants on periodic Bravais lattices with user-specified neighbor offsets. The computational core is written in Rust and exposed to Python via PyO3, combining the ergonomic interface of Python with the performance of compiled, memory-safe code. The package implements Metropolis and Gibbs single-spin-flip algorithms, Swendsen-Wang and Wolff cluster updates, parallel tempering, and three replica cluster moves for spin glasses: the Houdayer isoenergetic cluster move, the Jorg stochastic variant, and the Chayes-Machta-Redner (CMR) blue-bond algorithm. Overlap statistics between replica pairs enable computation of the spin glass order parameter and Binder ratio. Replica-level parallelism is achieved through the Rayon work-stealing scheduler. We validate the implementation against the exact critical temperatures of the two-dimensional Ising model on the square and triangular lattices via finite-size scaling of the Binder cumulant.</description>

      <title>On the electrical double layer capacitance of the restricted primitive model: a link between the mesoscopic theory and the associative mean spherical approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The results for the electrical double layer capacitance and the charge density of ``free ions'' obtained from the mesoscopic theory are compared with the corresponding results of the associative mean spherical approximation. While the first theory takes into account the fluctuations of the charge density, the second theory assumes that the free ions and ion pairs are in chemical equilibrium according to the mass action law. Our results demonstrate a fairly good agreement between the two theories at high densities and low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Mixed-state Quantum Phases: Renormalization and Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open system quantum dynamics can generate a variety of long-range entangled mixed states, yet it has been unclear in what sense they constitute phases of matter. To establish that two mixed states are in the same phase, as defined by their two-way connectivity via local quantum channels, we use the renormalization group (RG) and decoders of quantum error correcting codes. We introduce a real-space RG scheme for mixed states based on local channels which ideally preserve correlations with the complementary system, and we prove this is equivalent to the reversibility of the channel's action. As an application, we demonstrate an exact RG flow of finite temperature toric code in two dimensions to infinite temperature, thus proving it is in the trivial phase. In contrast, for toric code subject to local dephasing, we establish a mixed state toric code phase using local channels obtained by truncating an RG-type decoder and the minimum weight perfect matching decoder. We also discover a precise relation between mixed state phase and decodability, by proving that local noise acting on toric code cannot destroy logical information without bringing the state out of the toric code phase.</description>

      <title>Free and Interacting Fermionic Conformal Field Theories on the Fuzzy Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fuzzy-sphere regularisation is a powerful tool to study conformal field theories (CFT) in three spacetime dimensions. In this paper, we extend its scope to CFTs with local fermionic operators. We realise the free-Majorana-fermion CFT on a set-up with one flavour of bosons and one flavour of fermions on the lowest Landau level with a $1/2$ angular momentum mismatch and allow conversion between two bosons and two fermions, and use a relative chemical potential as the tuning parameter. On the phase diagram, we observe two continuous transitions described respectively by a free Majorana fermion and a gauged Ising CFT. We numerically confirm the emergent conformal symmetry through the operator spectrum and the two-point correlation function of the local Majorana fermion. We further establish a correspondence between the fuzzy-sphere models and the field-theory Lagrangians, and extend it to an interacting fermionic CFT -- the super-Ising theory with emergent super-conformal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Quantum Complexity in Rule-Based Constrained Many-Body Models: Scars, Fragmentation, and Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic constraints in quantum many-body systems strongly restrict the accessible Hilbert space, giving rise to highly nontrivial dynamical behavior. In recent years, such systems have attracted growing interest as they provide insight into mechanisms of thermalization and into regimes where thermalization fails. In this work, we study a family of rule-based kinetically constrained models, including the celebrated Quantum Game of Life, from the perspective of quantum complexity, with a focus on entanglement, nonstabilizerness, and quantum chaos. Using spectral diagnostics such as level statistics and spectral form factors, we show that these models exhibit robust chaotic behavior while simultaneously supporting both strong and weak Hilbert-space fragmentation and quantum many-body scar states. To further elucidate the structure of these fragmented subspaces, we characterize them through their ability to generate quantum resources. In particular, we show that resource-generation capacity does not necessarily correlate with the dimensionality of a fragmented sector, and that entanglement structure and the ability to generate nonstabilizerness provide effective diagnostics for distinguishing dynamically disconnected sectors. Our work therefore explores kinetically constrained models in a general framework that is not restricted to Rydberg blockade-based constraints alone.</description>
