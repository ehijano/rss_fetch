      <title>Implicit degree bias in the link prediction task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link prediction -- a task of distinguishing actual hidden edges from random unconnected node pairs -- is one of the quintessential tasks in graph machine learning. Despite being widely accepted as a universal benchmark and a downstream task for representation learning, the validity of the link prediction benchmark itself has been rarely questioned. Here, we show that the common edge sampling procedure in the link prediction task has an implicit bias toward high-degree nodes and produces a highly skewed evaluation that favors methods overly dependent on node degree, to the extent that a ``null'' link prediction method based solely on node degree can yield nearly optimal performance. We propose a degree-corrected link prediction task that offers a more reasonable assessment that aligns better with the performance in the recommendation task. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree-corrected benchmark can more effectively train graph machine-learning models by reducing overfitting to node degrees and facilitating the learning of relevant structures in graphs.</description>

      <title>Node Accessibility Characterization of Radially-Grown Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems have motivated continuing interest from the scientific community, leading to new concepts and methods. Growing systems represent a case of particular interest, as their topological, geometrical, and also dynamical properties change along time, as new elements are incorporated into the existing structure. In the present work, an approach is the case in which systems grown radially around some straight axis of reference, such as particle deposition on electrodes, or urban expansion along avenues, roads, coastline, or rivers, among several other possibilities. More specifically, we aim at characterizing the topological properties of simulated growing structures, which are represented as graphs, in terms of a measurement corresponding to the accessibility of each involved node. The incorporation of new elements (nodes and links) is performed preferentially to the angular orientation respectively to the reference axis. Several interesting results are reported, including the tendency of structures grown preferentially to the orientation normal to the axis to have smaller accessibility.</description>

      <title>Encoder Embedding for General Graph and Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph encoder embedding, a recent technique for graph data, offers speed and scalability in producing vertex-level representations from binary graphs. In this paper, we extend the applicability of this method to a general graph model, which includes weighted graphs, distance matrices, and kernel matrices. We prove that the encoder embedding satisfies the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem on a per-observation basis. Under certain condition, it achieves asymptotic normality on a per-class basis, enabling optimal classification through discriminant analysis. These theoretical findings are validated through a series of experiments involving weighted graphs, as well as text and image data transformed into general graph representations using appropriate distance metrics.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Reflect Human Citation Patterns with a Heightened Citation Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Citation practices are crucial in shaping the structure of scientific knowledge, yet they are often influenced by contemporary norms and biases. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 introduces a new dynamic to these practices. Interestingly, the characteristics and potential biases of references recommended by LLMs that entirely rely on their parametric knowledge, and not on search or retrieval-augmented generation, remain unexplored. Here, we analyze these characteristics in an experiment using a dataset of 166 papers from AAAI, NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR, published after GPT-4's knowledge cut-off date, encompassing 3,066 references in total. In our experiment, GPT-4 was tasked with suggesting scholarly references for the anonymized in-text citations within these papers. Our findings reveal a remarkable similarity between human and LLM citation patterns, but with a more pronounced high citation bias in GPT-4, which persists even after controlling for publication year, title length, number of authors, and venue. Additionally, we observe a large consistency between the characteristics of GPT-4's existing and non-existent generated references, indicating the model's internalization of citation patterns. By analyzing citation graphs, we show that the references recommended by GPT-4 are embedded in the relevant citation context, suggesting an even deeper conceptual internalization of the citation networks. While LLMs can aid in citation generation, they may also amplify existing biases and introduce new ones, potentially skewing scientific knowledge dissemination. Our results underscore the need for identifying the model's biases and for developing balanced methods to interact with LLMs in general.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Relationship Between News Source Sharing and Political Beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an era marked by an abundance of news sources, access to information significantly influences public opinion. Notably, the bias of news sources often serves as an indicator of individuals' political leanings. This study explores this hypothesis by examining the news sharing behavior of politically active social media users, whose political ideologies were identified in a previous study. Using correspondence analysis, we estimate the Media Sharing Index (MSI), a measure that captures bias in media outlets and user preferences within a hidden space. During Argentina's 2019 election on Twitter, we observed a predictable pattern: center-right individuals predominantly shared media from center-right biased outlets. However, it is noteworthy that those with center-left inclinations displayed a more diverse media consumption, which is a significant finding. Despite a noticeable polarization based on political affiliation observed in a retweet network analysis, center-left users showed more diverse media sharing preferences, particularly concerning the MSI. Although these findings are specific to Argentina, the developed methodology can be applied in other countries to assess the correlation between users' political leanings and the media they share.</description>

      <title>CACL: Community-Aware Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning for Social Media Bot Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media bot detection is increasingly crucial with the rise of social media platforms. Existing methods predominantly construct social networks as graph and utilize graph neural networks (GNNs) for bot detection. However, most of these methods focus on how to improve the performance of GNNs while neglecting the community structure within social networks. Moreover, GNNs based methods still face problems such as poor model generalization due to the relatively small scale of the dataset and over-smoothness caused by information propagation mechanism. To address these problems, we propose a Community-Aware Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning framework (CACL), which constructs social network as heterogeneous graph with multiple node types and edge types, and then utilizes community-aware module to dynamically mine both hard positive samples and hard negative samples for supervised graph contrastive learning with adaptive graph enhancement algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework addresses the previously mentioned challenges and outperforms competitive baselines on three social media bot benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Faster maximal clique enumeration in large real-world link streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Link streams offer a good model for representing interactions over time. They consist of links $(b,e,u,v)$, where $u$ and $v$ are vertices interacting during the whole time interval $[b,e]$. In this paper, we deal with the problem of enumerating maximal cliques in link streams. A clique is a pair $(C,[t_0,t_1])$, where $C$ is a set of vertices that all interact pairwise during the full interval $[t_0,t_1]$. It is maximal when neither its set of vertices nor its time interval can be increased. Some of the main works solving this problem are based on the famous Bron-Kerbosch algorithm for enumerating maximal cliques in graphs. We take this idea as a starting point to propose a new algorithm which matches the cliques of the instantaneous graphs formed by links existing at a given time $t$ to the maximal cliques of the link stream. We prove its validity and compute its complexity, which is better than the state-of-the art ones in many cases of interest. We also study the output-sensitive complexity, which is close to the output size, thereby showing that our algorithm is efficient. To confirm this, we perform experiments on link streams used in the state of the art, and on massive link streams, up to 100 million links. In all cases our algorithm is faster, mostly by a factor of at least 10 and up to a factor of $10^4$. Moreover, it scales to massive link streams for which the existing algorithms are not able to provide the solution.</description>

      <title>Event Detection from Social Media for Epidemic Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media is an easy-to-access platform providing timely updates about societal trends and events. Discussions regarding epidemic-related events such as infections, symptoms, and social interactions can be crucial for informing policymaking during epidemic outbreaks. In our work, we pioneer exploiting Event Detection (ED) for better preparedness and early warnings of any upcoming epidemic by developing a framework to extract and analyze epidemic-related events from social media posts. To this end, we curate an epidemic event ontology comprising seven disease-agnostic event types and construct a Twitter dataset SPEED with human-annotated events focused on the COVID-19 pandemic. Experimentation reveals how ED models trained on COVID-based SPEED can effectively detect epidemic events for three unseen epidemics of Monkeypox, Zika, and Dengue; while models trained on existing ED datasets fail miserably. Furthermore, we show that reporting sharp increases in the extracted events by our framework can provide warnings 4-9 weeks earlier than the WHO epidemic declaration for Monkeypox. This utility of our framework lays the foundations for better preparedness against emerging epidemics.</description>

      <title>BBK: a simpler, faster algorithm for enumerating maximal bicliques in large sparse bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bipartite graphs are a prevalent modeling tool for real-world networks, capturing interactions between vertices of two different types. Within this framework, bicliques emerge as crucial structures when studying dense subgraphs: they are sets of vertices such that all vertices of the first type interact with all vertices of the second type. Therefore, they allow identifying groups of closely related vertices of the network, such as individuals with similar interests or webpages with similar contents. This article introduces a new algorithm designed for the exhaustive enumeration of maximal bicliques within a bipartite graph. This algorithm, called BBK for Bipartite Bron-Kerbosch, is a new extension to the bipartite case of the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm, which enumerates the maximal cliques in standard (non-bipartite) graphs. It is faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms and allows the enumeration on massive bipartite graphs that are not manageable with existing implementations. We analyze it theoretically to establish two complexity formulas: one as a function of the input and one as a function of the output characteristics of the algorithm. We also provide an open-access implementation of BBK in C++, which we use to experiment and validate its efficiency on massive real-world datasets and show that its execution time is shorter in practice than state-of-the art algorithms. These experiments also show that the order in which the vertices are processed, as well as the choice of one of the two types of vertices on which to initiate the enumeration have an impact on the computation time.</description>
