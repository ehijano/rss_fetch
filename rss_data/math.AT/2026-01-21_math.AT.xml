      <title>Periodic families in the homology of $GL_n(F_2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct infinite families of nonzero classes in $H_d(GL_n(F_2);F_2)$ along lines of the form $d =\frac{2}{3}n +$(constant), thereby showing that the known slope $\frac{2}{3}$-stability for these homology groups are optimal. Using the new stability Hopf algebra perspective of Randal-Williams, our computations in addition recover the slope-$\frac{2}{3}$ stability for $GL_n(Z)$ with coefficients in $F_2$, improve that for $Aut(F_n)$ to $\frac{2}{3}$, and demonstrate that those slopes are optimal. Perhaps of independent interest, we also provide a manual for computing stability Hopf algebras over $F_2$.</description>

      <title>On spaces of embeddings of circles in surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the space of embeddings of finitely many circles that bound disks in non-positively curved surfaces. We index the connected components of this space with finite rooted trees and show that the connected components are classifying spaces of the ``braided" automorphism groups of the associated trees. An intermediate step to proving these results is to construct a strong deformation retract onto the subspace of geometric circles; moreover, this strong deformation retraction is equivariant with respect to transformations of the surface.</description>

      <title>Non-finitely generated $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^k$-equivariant bordism ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1998, Mukherjee and Sankaran posed two problems concerning the algebraic structure of the equivariant bordism ring of smooth closed $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^k$-manifolds with only isolated fixed points. One is the property of being finitely generated as a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-algebra, and the other is the existence of indecomposable elements. This paper definitively resolves both problems for the fully effective case. Specifically, let $\mathcal{Z}_*((\mathbb{Z}_2)^k)$ denote the equivariant bordism ring of smooth closed manifolds equipped with fully effective smooth $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^k$-actions having only isolated fixed points. We prove that $\mathcal{Z}_*((\mathbb{Z}_2)^k)$ is not finitely generated as a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-algebra for all $k\geqslant 3$. Moreover, the proof explicitly constructs an infinite family of indecomposable elements with unbounded degrees, thereby settling the second problem simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Approximability for Lagrangian submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a notion of categorical approximability for metric spaces that can be viewed as a categorification of approximability for metric groups, as defined by Turing in 1938. Approximability as introduced here is a property of metric spaces that is more general than precompactness. It is shown that several classes of Lagrangian submanifolds - closed Lagrangian submanifolds in a cotangent disk bundle; equators on the sphere; weakly exact Lagrangians on the torus-endowed with the spectral metric are approximable in this sense. Among other geometric applications, we show that there are such examples of spaces of Lagrangians that are approximable but are not precompact.</description>

Abstract: We show that the homotopy type of the independence complex of the generalized Mycielskian of a graph $G$ is determined by the homotopy type of the independence complex of $G$ and the homotopy type of the independence complex of the Kronecker double cover of $G$. As an application we calculate the homotopy type for paths, cycles and the categorical product of two complete graphs.</description>

      <title>Angular pair-of-pants decompositions of complex varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the notion of torically hyperbolic varieties and we construct pair-of-pants decompositions for these in terms of angle sets of essential projective hyperplane complements. This construction generalizes the classical pair-of-pants decomposition for hyperbolic Riemann surfaces. In our first main theorem, we prove that the natural angle map associated to an essential projective hyperplane complement is a homotopy equivalence, extending earlier work of Salvetti and Bj\"orner-Ziegler. By a topological argument, we further show that the angle map for a finite Kummer covering of an essential projective hyperplane complement is likewise a homotopy equivalence. We then explain how these local building blocks can be glued along the dual intersection complex of a semistable degeneration. Using the theory of Kato-Nakayama spaces, we prove that the resulting space is homotopy equivalent to the original algebraic variety. We make this explicit for complete intersections in projective space using techniques from tropical geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a variety of coarse homology theories and natural transformations between them. We in particular study the commutativity of a square relating analytical and topological transgressions with algebraic and homotopy theoretic Chern characters. Here a transgression is a natural transformation from a coarse homology theory to a functor which factorizes over the Higson corona functor, and a Chern character is a transformation from a $K$-theory like coarse or Borel-Moore type homology theory to an ordinary version.</description>

      <title>Limit Computation Over Posets via Minimal Initial Functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that limits can be computed by restricting along an initial functor, and that this often simplifies limit computation. We systematically study the algorithmic implications of this idea for diagrams indexed by a finite poset. We say an initial functor $F\colon C\to D$ with $C$ small is \emph{minimal} if the sets of objects and morphisms of $C$ each have minimum cardinality, among the sources of all initial functors with target $D$. For $Q$ a finite poset or $Q\subseteq \mathbb N^d$ an interval (i.e., a convex, connected subposet), we describe all minimal initial functors $F\colon P\to Q$ and in particular, show that $F$ is always a subposet inclusion. We give efficient algorithms to compute a choice of minimal initial functor. In the case that $Q\subseteq \mathbb N^d$ is an interval, we give asymptotically optimal bounds on $|P|$, the number of relations in $P$ (including identities), in terms of the number $n$ of minima of $Q$: We show that $|P|=\Theta(n)$ for $d\leq 3$, and $|P|=\Theta(n^2)$ for $d&gt;3$. We apply these results to give new bounds on the cost of computing $\lim G$ for a functor $G \colon Q\to \mathbf{Vec}$ valued in vector spaces. For $Q$ connected, we also give new bounds on the cost of computing the \emph{generalized rank} of $G$ (i.e., the rank of the induced map $\lim G\to \mathop{\mathrm{colim}} G$), which is of interest in topological data analysis.</description>

      <title>Abelian gauge-like groups of $L_\infty$-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a finite type degree-wise nilpotent $L_\infty$-algebra, we construct an abelian group that acts on the set of Maurer-Cartan elements of the given $L_\infty$-algebra so that the quotient by this action becomes the moduli space of equivalence classes of Maurer-Cartan elements. Specializing this to degree-wise nilpotent dg Lie algebras, we find that the associated ordinary gauge group of the dg Lie algebra with the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff multiplication might be substituted by the underlying additive group. This additive group acts on the Maurer-Cartan elements, and the quotient by this action yields the moduli space of gauge-equivalence classes of Maurer-Cartan elements.</description>

      <title>Crystallinity for syntomic cohomology, \'etale cohomology, and algebraic $K$-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove for $n\geq c-1$ that the functor taking an animated ring $R$ to its mod $(p^c,v_1^{p^n})$ syntomic cohomology factors through the functor $R \mapsto R/p^{c(n+2)}$, a phenomenon we term crystallinity for mod $(p^c,v_1^{p^n})$ syntomic cohomology. As an application, we completely and explicitly compute the mod $(p,v_1 ^{p^{n}-1})$ algebraic $K$-theory of $\mathbb Z/p^{k}$ whenever $k \geq n+2$ and $p&gt;2$. As a second application, we deduce crystallinity for the mod $p^c$ syntomic complexes associated to smooth $p$-adic formal schemes, and in particular for the Galois equivariant mod $p^c$ \'etale cohomologies of their adic generic fibers. Finally, we strengthen known $p$-adic convergence theorems for the topological Hochschild homology of ring spectra, and as a result relate crystallinity for algebraic $K$-theory to Lichtenbaum--Quillen theorems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16049v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Quasi Zigzag Persistent Homology (QZPH) as a framework for analyzing time-varying data by integrating multiparameter persistence and zigzag persistence. To this end, we introduce a stable topological invariant that captures both static and dynamic features at different scales. We present an algorithm to compute this invariant efficiently. We show that it enhances the machine learning models when applied to tasks such as sleep-stage detection, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the evolving patterns in time-varying datasets.</description>

      <title>Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg isomorphism for derived Deligne-Mumford stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a Hochschild--Konstant--Rosenberg (HKR) theorem for arbitrary derived Deligne--Mumford (DM) stacks, extending the results of Arinkin-C\u{a}ld\u{a}raru-Hablicsek in the smooth, global quotient case, although with different methods. To formulate our result, we introduce the notion of orbifold inertia stack of a derived DM stack; this supplies a finely tuned derived enhancement of the classical inertia stack, which does not always coincide with the classical truncation of the free loop space. We show that, in characteristic 0, given a derived DM stack, the shifted tangent bundle of its orbifold inertia stack is equivalent to its free loop space. This yields a canonical HKR isomorphism of algebras between the Hochschild homology of a derived DM stack and the cohomology of differential forms on its orbifold inertia stack. Moreover, this isomorphism intertwines the natural circle action and the de Rham differential. Similarly, HKR theorems for derived DM stacks are established for Hochschild cohomology, cyclic homology, negative cyclic homology, and periodic cyclic homology. As applications, we provide a rich supply of computations of Hochschild homology and Hochschild cohomology for interesting derived DM stacks, such as weighted projective lines, root stacks, quotients by algebraic groups, and mapping stacks, among others.</description>

      <title>Jordan-Segmentable Masks: A Topology-Aware definition for characterizing Binary Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image segmentation plays a central role in computer vision. However, widely used evaluation metrics, whether pixel-wise, region-based, or boundary-focused, often struggle to capture the structural and topological coherence of a segmentation. In many practical scenarios, such as medical imaging or object delineation, small inaccuracies in boundary, holes, or fragmented predictions can result in high metric scores, despite the fact that the resulting masks fail to preserve the object global shape or connectivity. This highlights a limitation of conventional metrics: they are unable to assess whether a predicted segmentation partitions the image into meaningful interior and exterior regions.
  In this work, we introduce a topology-aware notion of segmentation based on the Jordan Curve Theorem, and adapted for use in digital planes. We define the concept of a \emph{Jordan-segmentatable mask}, which is a binary segmentation whose structure ensures a topological separation of the image domain into two connected components. We analyze segmentation masks through the lens of digital topology and homology theory, extracting a $4$-curve candidate from the mask, verifying its topological validity using Betti numbers. A mask is considered Jordan-segmentatable when this candidate forms a digital 4-curve with $\beta_0 = \beta_1 = 1$, or equivalently when its complement splits into exactly two $8$-connected components.
  This framework provides a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion with which to assess the structural coherence of segmentation masks. By combining digital Jordan theory and homological invariants, our approach provides a valuable alternative to standard evaluation metrics, especially in applications where topological correctness must be preserved.</description>
