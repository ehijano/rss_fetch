      <title>Correcting impedance measurements for background parasitics to characterize circuit components in cryogenic environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictable circuit response is a critical prerequisite for accurate electronic measurements. We describe a powerful, yet straightforward, experimental method and analysis model that utilizes an affordable LCR meter in conjunction with an in situ parasitic impedance background correction procedure to measure the temperature-dependent impedance (magnitude and phase) of individual passive circuit elements mounted in a cryostat. We show how the model unambiguously identified a 20x drop in capacitance for 22 microF 5XR multilayer ceramic capacitors cooled from 300 K to 360 mK in an environment with parasitic capacitance of order 300 pF. The same experimental procedure, based on a simple two-wire measurement, was also used to successfully measure 10 pF and 22 pF thin-film capacitors and 100 MOhm thick-film resistors. The results showed that the resistor values increased by up to an order of magnitude when the devices were cooled from 300 K to 360 mK. Most importantly, the simple data acquisition method and robust analysis model were shown to effectively extend the accuracy of a simple benchtop LCR meter beyond its manufacturer-guaranteed values for a wide range of measurement frequencies.</description>

      <title>Towards real-time additive-free dopamine detection at $10^{-8}$ mM with hardware accelerated platform integrated on camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracing physiological neurotransmitters such as dopamine (DA) with detection limits down to $\mathrm{1\times10^{-8}}$ mM is a critical goal in neuroscience for studying brain functions and progressing the understanding of cerebral disease. Addressing this problem requires enhancing the current state-of-the-art additive-free electrochemical workstation methods by over two orders of magnitude. In this work, we implement an ultra-sensitive, additive-free platform exploiting suitably engineered light-scattering membranes and optical accelerators integrated into commercial vision cameras, reporting real-time detection of DA in uric and ascorbic acid below the concentration of $\mathrm{10^{-8}}$ mM. These performances improve the current best technology by over two orders of magnitude in resolution while providing continuous, real-time detection at video rates. This technology also upgrades the bulk form factor of an electrochemical workstation with an imaging camera's compact and portable footprint. The optical accelerator implemented in this work is universal and trainable to detect a wide range of biological analytes. This technology's wide adoption could help enable early disease detection and personalized treatment adjustments while improving the management of neurological, mental, and immune-related conditions.</description>

      <title>Impact of embedded $^{163}$Ho on the performance of the transition-edge sensor microcalorimeters of the HOLMES experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of the performance of transition-edge sensor (TES) microcalorimeters with $^{163}$Ho atoms embedded by ion implantation, as part of the HOLMES experiment aimed at neutrino mass determination. The inclusion of $^{163}$Ho atoms introduces an excess heat capacity due to a pronounced Schottky anomaly, which can affect the detector's energy resolution, signal height, and response time. We fabricated TES arrays with varying levels of $^{163}$Ho activity and characterized their performance in terms of energy resolution, decay time constants, and heat capacity. The intrinsic energy resolution was found to degrade with increasing $^{163}$Ho activity, consistent with the expected scaling of heat capacity. From the analysis, we determined the specific heat capacity of $^{163}$Ho to be $(2.9 \pm 0.4 \mathrm{(stat)} \pm 0.7 \mathrm{(sys)})$ J/K/mol at $(94 \pm 1)$\,mK, close to the literature values for metallic holmium. No additional long decay time constants correlated with $^{163}$Ho activity were observed, indicating that the excess heat capacity does not introduce weakly coupled thermodynamic systems. These results suggest that our present TES microcalorimeters can tolerate $^{163}$Ho activities up to approximately 5 Bq without significant performance degradation. For higher activities, reducing the TES transition temperature is necessary to maintain energy resolution. These findings provide critical insights for optimizing TES microcalorimeters for future neutrino mass experiments and other applications requiring embedded radioactive sources. The study also highlights the robustness of TES technology in handling implanted radionuclides while maintaining high-resolution performance.</description>

      <title>Prospecting for lunar Helium-3 with a radio-frequency atomic magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12386v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mining $^3{\rm He}$ from lunar regolith has attracted significant interest in recent years due to the scarcity of $^3{\rm He}$ on Earth and its diverse applications, from cryogenics and medical imaging, to nuclear physics and future nuclear fusion. Given the stringent technical and economic challenges of mining lunar $^3{\rm He}$, precise prospecting is essential. Here we propose a prospecting methodology based on a radio-frequency atomic magnetometer, which can detect the dipolar magnetic field of thermally polarized $^3{\rm He}$ spins. With a 200 g regolith sample and an rf-magnetometer with sensitivity $1~{\rm fT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ we can detect $^3{\rm He}$ with abundance 5 ppb within a measurement time of just 5 min. The associated apparatus is lightweight and significantly more cost-effective than alternative measurement techniques. The proposed prospecting method is readily deployable and could substantially improve the technical and economic feasibility of mining lunar $^3{\rm He}$.</description>

      <title>Novel Silicon and GaAs Sensors for Compact Sampling Calorimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two samples of silicon pad sensors and two samples of GaAs sensors are studied in an electron beam with 5 GeV energy from the DESY-II test-beam facility. The sizes of the silicon and GaAs sensors are about 9$\times$9 cm$^2$ and 5$\times$8 cm$^2$, respectively. The thickness is 500 micrometer for both the silicon and GaAs sensors. The pad size is about 5$\times$5 mm$^2$. The sensors are foreseen to be used in a compact electromagnetic sampling calorimeter. The readout of the pads is done by metal traces connected to the pads and the front-end ASICs at the edges of the sensors. For the silicon sensors, copper traces on a Kapton foil are connected to the sensor pads with conducting glue. The pads of the GaAs sensors are connected to bond-pads via aluminium traces on the sensor substrate. The readout is based on a dedicated front-end ASIC, called FLAME. Pre-processing of the raw data and deconvolution is performed with FPGAs. The whole system is orchestrated by a Trigger Logic Unit. Results are shown for the signal-to-noise ratio, the homogeneity of the response, edge effects on pads, and for signals due to the readout traces.</description>

      <title>A custom experimental setup for scintillator characterization: application to a Ce-doped GAGG crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scintillators are widely used in radiation detection, with continuous advancements enhancing their performance and developing new materials. This study presents a custom experimental setup for the characterization of crystal scintillators under different temperature and pressure conditions. The setup is flexible and capable of providing prompt feedback, which is crucial for material development. We tested the setup with a Ce-doped Gd3Al2Ga3O12 (GAGG) scintillator, evaluating its response to different types of radiation, particularly alpha particles. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of GAGG's scintillation properties, including light output, quenching factors, and pulse-shape discrimination capabilities.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of Hamamatsu R11065-20 PMTs for use in the SABRE South NaI(Tl) Crystal Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The SABRE Experiment is a direct detection dark matter experiment using a target composed of multiple NaI(Tl) crystals. The experiment aims to be an independent check of the DAMA/LIBRA results with a detector in the Northern (Laboratori Nazionali Del Gran Sasso, LNGS) and Southern (Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory, SUPL) hemispheres. The SABRE South photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) will be used near the low energy noise threshold and require a detailed calibration of their performance and contributions to the background in the NaI(Tl) dark matter search, prior to installation. We present the development of the pre-calibration procedures for the R11065-20 Hamamatsu PMTs. These PMTs are directly coupled to the NaI(Tl) crystals within the SABRE South experiment. In this paper we present methodologies to characterise the gain, dark rate, and timing properties of the PMTs. We develop a method for in-situ calibration without a light injection source. Additionally we explore the application of machine learning techniques using a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) trained on the response of single PMTs to understand the information available for background rejection. Finally, we briefly present the simulation tool used to generate digitised PMT data from optical Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Results from a 2nd production run of low temperature wafer-wafer bonded pad-diodes for particle detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are investigating the use of low temperature wafer-wafer bonding in the fabrication of next-generation particle pixel detectors. This bonding technique could enable the integration of fully processed CMOS readout wafers with high-Z absorber materials, facilitating the creation of highly efficient X-ray imaging detectors. It might also facilitate the integration of structures embedded inside the wafer bulk, such as deep uniform gain layers. The bonding process results in a thin (nm-scale) amorphous layer at the bonding interface. To study the impact of this interface on detector operation, we fabricated simple wafer-wafer bonded pad diodes using high resistivity float-zone silicon wafers. Results from a first fabrication run of such diodes revealed that the presence of the bonding interface alters the depletion behaviour, with the interface acting as a heavily doped N++ layer. However, metal contamination of the bonding surfaces during fabrication compromised these results, making them unrepresentative of an ideal bonding interface. In this paper we present the results from a subsequent fabrication run, which does not exhibit this sort of metal contamination. These results confirm that the bonding interface behaves as a heavily doped N++ layer, even without contamination. Further, we discuss the reverse leakage current of the bonded samples, where current vs. voltage measurements show a behaviour which is consistent with current generated within the depletion region of the samples.</description>
