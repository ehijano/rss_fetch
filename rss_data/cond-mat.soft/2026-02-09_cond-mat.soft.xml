      <title>Mechanics of hierarchical twisted and coiled polymer artificial muscles: Decoupling force from kinematic limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermally actuated twisted and coiled polymer (TCP) artificial muscles exhibit exceptional specific work capacities but are limited by an inherent competition between load-bearing capacity and actuation stroke. To address this limitation, we investigate a hierarchical helical structure designed to decouple force generation from kinematic limits. We propose a coupled thermo-mechanical model incorporating inter-filamentary contact mechanics and geometric nonlinearities to predict the assembly's equilibrium response. The results indicate that this hierarchical topology significantly amplifies isometric actuation stress compared to monofilament baselines, while maintaining a biological-like contraction stroke of approximately 22%. A critical topological threshold governed by the balance between cooperative load-sharing and geometric confinement is identified. Beyond an optimal bundle complexity, the geometric jamming dominates, as excessive inter-filamentary friction hinders actuation. Furthermore, we elucidate a stiffness-stroke synergy in homochiral configurations, where high helical angles amplify the thermal untwisting torque to overcome increased structural rigidity. Crucially, the volumetric energy density exhibits scale invariance regarding the hierarchical radius, implying that absolute force output can be linearly scaled through geometric upsizing without compromising efficiency. These findings provide a mechanics-based rationale for the structural programming, demonstrating that soft actuator performance limits are dictated by topological order rather than intrinsic material properties.</description>

      <title>Elastoplastic Modelling of Cyclic Shear Deformation of Amorphous Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an energy-landscape based elasto-plastic model to understand the behaviour of amorphous solids under uniform and cyclic shear. Amorphous solids are modeled as being composed of mesoscopic sub-volumes, each of which may occupy states - termed mesostates -- drawn from a specified distribution. The energies of the mesostates under stress free conditions determine their stability range with respect to applied strain, and their plastic strain, at which they are stress free, forms an important additional property. Under applied global strain, mesostates that reach their stability limits transition to other permissible mesostates. Barring such transitions, which encompass plastic deformations that the solid may undergo, mesostates are treated as exhibiting linear elastic behavior, and the interactions between mesoscopic blocks are treated using the finite element method. The model reproduces known phenomena under uniform and cyclic shear, such as the brittle-to-ductile crossover with annealing and the Bauschinger effect for uniform shear, qualitative features of the yielding diagram under cyclic shear including the change in yielding behaviour with the degree of annealing, across a `threshold level', and dynamic phenomena such as the divergence of failure times on approach to the yield point and the non-monotonic evolution of the local yield rate. In addition to these results, we discuss the dependence of the observed behaviour on model choices, and open questions highlighted by our work.</description>

      <title>Interfacial dynamics induced by impacts across rigid and soft substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate impact-induced gas-liquid interfacial dynamics through experiments in which a liquid-filled container impacts substrates with elastic moduli from $O(10^{-1})$ MPa to $O(10^{5})$ MPa. Upon impact, the concave gas-liquid interface inside the container deforms and emits a focused jet. When the jet velocity is normalized by the container impact velocity, all data collapse onto a single curve when plotted against the Cauchy number, $Ca = \rho_{\rm e} V_{\rm i}^2 / E$, which represents the ratio of the inertial force of the container-liquid system to the elastic restoring force of the substrate. The dimensionless jet velocity remains nearly constant for $Ca&lt; 10^{-4}$, but decreases significantly for $Ca &gt; 10^{-4}$. Based on this observation, we define the boundary between the rigid-impact and soft-impact regimes using the Cauchy number, providing a quantitative criterion for what constitutes ``softness'' in impact-driven interfacial flows. To explain the reduction in jet velocity observed in the soft-impact regime, we introduce a framework in which only the impulse transferred within the effective time window for jet formation contributes to interface acceleration. This concept, referred to as the partial impulse, captures the situation where the impact interval (the duration of contact between the container and the substrate) exceeds the focusing interval (the time required for jet formation). By modelling the contact force using an elastic foundation model and solving the resulting momentum equation over the finite impulse window, we quantitatively reproduce the experimental results. This partial impulse framework unifies the dynamics of impact-driven jetting across both rigid and soft substrate regimes, extending the applicability of classical impulse-based models.</description>

      <title>Self-assembly of flexible patchy nanoparticles in solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-assembly of polymer grafted nanoparticles is more and more used in the field of functional materials. However, there is still a lack of analysis on the dynamic transformation paths of different self-assembly morphologies, which makes it impossible to achieve further precise regulation and targeted design in experiments and industrial production. In this work the effects of patchy property, grafted chain length, ratio and grafting density on the self-assembly behavior and structure of polymer grafted flexible patchy nanoparticles are investigated by dissipative particle dynamics simulation method through the construction of coarse-grained model of polymer grafted ternary nanoparticles. The influence and regulation mechanisms of these factors on the self-assembly structure transformation of flexible patchy nanoparticles are systematically studied, and a variety of structures such as dendritic structure, columnar structure, and bilayer membrane are obtained. The self-assembly structure of flexible patchy nanoparticles obtained in this work (such as bilayer membrane structure) provides a potential application basis for designing drug carriers. By precisely regulating the specific structural characteristics of the system, it is possible to achieve efficient loading of drugs and targeted delivery functions, thus significantly improving the bioavailability and effect of drugs.</description>

      <title>Ornstein-Uhlenbeck information particle: A new candidate of active agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An information particle can acquire active-like motion through transforming the information entropy into effective self-propulsion velocity/force using the attached information engine. We consider an underdamped Brownian particle additionally driven by either a constant self-propulsion force or an information engine using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) bath feedback control, such particles are called self-propelled particle (SPP) or OU information particle (OUIP). Compared to the widely-investigated SPP, the OUIP shows a significant different dynamical pattern, including two types of moving mode: a slow-speed diffusion mode and a high-speed traveling mode. The specific evolution of OUIP can be adjusted flexibly between such two modes through the inertial effect, thus acquiring a rich and non-trivial motion behavior. By tuning the strength of fluctuation of the OU bath, a wide range of net velocity can be achieved for OUIP. We highlight that OUIP could be an exceptional candidate for active agent.</description>

      <title>Diffusiophoresis of a non-polar fluid droplet laden with soluble ionic surfactants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the diffusiophoresis of a non-polarizable droplet laden with soluble ionic surfactant, for which the surface charge arises from adsorption of surfactant at the fluid-fluid interface. Unlike previous studies that assume either a fixed surface charge or instantaneous equilibrium between the interface and the adjacent electrolyte, we formulate the interfacial transport based on the mass-balance framework incorporating Langmuir adsorption-desorption kinetics and finite surface diffusivity. The coupled electrokinetic problem is solved using a perturbation approach. Analytical expressions for the droplet mobility and interfacial velocity are derived for insoluble surfactants. We demonstrate that assuming uniform, immobile surface charge leads to unphysical predictions, including negative chemiphoresis and singular mobility, whereas allowing the surface charge to evolve through interfacial surfactant redistribution yields continuous and physically consistent droplet diffusiophoresis. Interfacial kinetic exchange is found to play a central role. Increasing the desorption rate enhances surfactant redistribution and Marangoni stress, weakens the negative mobility, reverses the direction of motion through competition between electrophoretic and chemiphoretic contributions, and subsequently leads to a strong enhancement of positive mobility before eventual saturation in the transport-limited regime. The dependence of mobility on viscosity ratio and electrolyte composition of different salts further reveals how mixed electrolytes provides a robust means of tuning droplet motion. This study highlights the critical role of finite-rate surfactant dynamics and interfacial transport in determining the diffusiophoresis of fluid particles, with implications for manipulating droplets in microfluidic and varying-salinity environments.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal Binary-fluid Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although effective non-reciprocal interactions have been investigated in a variety of fields, their consequences have not been explored in hydrodynamical turbulence. We initiate such an exploration by introducing non-reciprocal binary-fluid tubulence and uncover its properties by developing a two-dimensional (2D) Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (NRCHNS) model. We show that, as we increase the strength of the non-reciprocal terms, this model displays a hitherto unanticipated type of turbulence, with an inverse cascade of energy and an energy spectrum $E(k)\sim k^{-5/3}$, reminiscent of the well-known inverse cascade in forced, 2D fluid turbulence, but distinct from it, in so far as it develops a non-reciprocal flux $\mathbf J$. We demonstrate how NRCHNS turbulence suppresses $J(t) = |\mathbf J|$, as the Reynolds number increases. We compare and contrast 2D NRCHNS turbulence with its fluid-turbulence counterpart by examining spectra, fluxes, spectral balances, flow topologies, and signatures of multifractality.</description>

      <title>Tissue-Intrinsic Shape Mechanics in Growing Pre-Migratory Tumor Spheroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the hallmarks of pre-migratory tumors is the progressive loss of compact morphology. To investigate how tumors may intrinsically regulate their shape during growth, we employ a three-dimensional (3D) vertex model of multicellular aggregates that incorporates key structural features of tumor spheroids, including its surface, a proliferative rim, and a necrotic core. Focusing exclusively on tumor-intrinsic mechanical interactions, we examine how their collective effects guide morphological evolution en route to metastasis. We show that spheroids acquire lobulated morphologies through an interplay between differential tensions at the spheroid surface and the living-necrotic interface (LNI), together with differential growth within the proliferative rim. In addition, spheroid shapes can be substantially modulated by tissue rheological properties emerging from active, cell-scale forces. Our cell- and tissue-scale simulations of tumor morphologies are enabled by a computational framework that overcomes a major limitation of 3D vertex models - the lack of cell-division - by introducing a graph-based polyhedral-division algorithm within the Graph Vertex Model (GVM).</description>

      <title>Universal Negative Energetic Elasticity in Polymer Chains: Crossovers among Random, Self-Avoiding, and Neighbor-Avoiding Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14992v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Negative energetic elasticity in gels challenges the conventional understanding of gel elasticity; despite extensive research, a concise explanation remains elusive. In this study, we use the weakly self-avoiding walk (the Domb-Joyce model; DJ model) and interacting self-avoiding walk (ISAW) to investigate the emergence of negative energetic elasticity in polymer chains. Using exact enumeration, we show that both the DJ model and ISAW exhibit negative energetic elasticity, which is caused by effective soft-repulsive interactions between polymer segments. Moreover, we find that a universal scaling law for the internal energy of both models, with a common exponent of $7/4$, holds consistently across both random-walk-self-avoiding-walk and self-avoiding-walk-neighbor-avoiding-walk crossovers. These findings suggest that negative energetic elasticity is a fundamental and universal property of polymer networks and chains.</description>

      <title>Boundary curvature-dependent dynamical trapping of undulating worms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of {\it Lumbriculus variegatus} in polygonal chambers and show that the worms align with the boundaries as they move forward and get dynamically trapped at concave corners over prolonged periods of time before escaping. We develop a kinematic model to calculate and describe the evolution of the worm's mean body orientation angle relative to the boundary. Performing simulations with a minimal active elastic dumbbell model, we then show that both the boundary aligning and corner trapping behavior of the worm are captured by steric interactions with the boundaries. The dimensionless ratio of the strength of forward motion and diffusion caused by the worm's undulatory and peristaltic strokes is shown to determine the boundary alignment dynamics and trapping time scales of the worm. The simulations show that that the body angle with the boundary while entering the concave corner is important to the trapping time distributions with shallow angles leading to faster escapes. Our study demonstrates that directed motion and limited angular diffusion can give rise to aggregation which can mimic shelter seeking behavior in slender undulating limbless worms even when thigmotaxis or contact seeking behavior is absent.</description>

      <title>Clogging-flowing transition of granular media in a two-dimensional vertical pipe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally and numerically investigate the clogging behavior of granular materials in a two-dimensional vertical pipe. The nonmonotonicity of clogging probability found in a cylindrical vertical pipe [L\'opez et al., Phys. Rev. E 102, 010902 (2020)] is also observed in the two-dimensional case. We numerically demonstrate that the clogging probability strongly correlates with the friction coefficient $\mu$ in addition to the pipe-to-particle diameter ratio $D/d$. We thus construct a clogging-flowing $D/d$-$\mu$ phase diagram within the $2&lt;D/d&lt;3$ range. Finally, by analyzing the geometrical arrangements of particles and using a simple analysis of forces and torques, we are able to predict the clogging-flowing transition in the $D/d$-$\mu$ phase diagram and explain the mechanism of the observed counterintuitive nonmonotonicity in more detail. We demonstrate that for pipe clogging, friction-mediated force and torque equilibrium are essential for arch formation.</description>

      <title>Diffusion through complex confining environments: fluctuating triply periodic minimal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport of individual entities through interconnected structures is a process of practical relevance both in biology and technology. Examples are given by diffusive dynamics of molecules in porous structures. In soft environments, this transport can be strongly influenced by fluctuations of the porous structure itself. Here, we focus on triply periodic membrane structures found both in cell organelles and in synthetic amphiphilic systems. We theoretically study the effect of a complex three-dimensional fluctuating environment on the diffusive motion of a test object, using a phase field approach. The rigid spherical test object is energetically forced to not penetrate the membrane. Generally, the pores of the membrane structure can be smaller than the diffusing object. Yet, fluctuations of the membrane can intermittently widen its pores, still allowing for the motion of the larger particles through them. Thus, the object stays trapped for a while inside one cavity formed by the membrane, before an appropriate fluctuation event widens a membrane pore in the right moment so that the object can jump into the next cavity. The process is reflected by a pronounced plateau in the time evolution of the mean squared displacement. We think that the described scenario should be directly observable, for instance, in protein diffusion through biological environments.</description>

      <title>Ultrastable 2D glasses and packings explained by local centrosymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the most recent numerical data by Bolton-Lum \emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 136, 058201 (2026)], we demonstrate that ideal ultrastable glasses in the athermal limit (or ultrastable ideal 2D disk packings) possess a remarkably high degree of local centrosymmetry. In particular, we find that the inversion-symmetry order parameter for local force transmission introduced in Milkus and Zaccone, [Phys. Rev. 93, 094204 (2016)], is as high as $F_{IS}= 0.84522$, to be compared with $F_{IS}=1$ for perfect centrosymmetric crystals free of defects, and with $F_{IS} \sim 0.3-0.5$ for standard random packings. This observation provides a clear, natural explanation for the ultra-high shear modulus of ideal packings and ideal glasses, because the high centrosymmetry prevents non-affine relaxations which decrease the shear modulus. The same mechanism explains the absence of boson peak-like soft vibrational modes. These results also confirm what was found previous work, i.e. that the bond-orientational order parameter is a very poor correlator for the vibrational and mechanical</description>

      <title>Probing Anharmonic and Heterogeneous Carrier Dynamics Across Sublattice Melting in a Minimal Model Superionic Conductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite decades of research, the microscopic origin of sublattice melting and fast ion transport in superionic conductors remains elusive. Here, we introduce a chemically neutral minimal binary model consisting of a rigid host lattice stabilized by short-range steric repulsion and a soft carrier sublattice interacting via long-range Wigner-type forces. This contrast naturally produces distinct melting temperatures and an intermediate sublattice-melting phase in which carriers become fluidlike while the host remains crystalline. Molecular-dynamics simulations identify three dynamical regimes-crystalline, sublattice-melt, and fully molten-marked by sharp changes in diffusivity, structural correlations, and dynamic heterogeneity. Near sublattice melting, carrier motion is strongly anharmonic and spatially heterogeneous, beyond mean-field hopping descriptions. By tuning the density, we demonstrate that sublattice melting can be continuously controlled, establishing a direct link between lattice softness, anharmonicity, and collective ion transport. This work provides a unified microscopic foundation for designing mechanically robust, high-performance superionic conductors operable near ambient conditions.</description>

Abstract: We study $N$ run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) in one dimension interacting via a double-well potential $W(r)=-k_0 \, r^2/2+g \, r^4/4$, which is repulsive at short interparticle distance $r$ and attractive at large distance. At large time, the system forms a bound state where the density of particles has a finite support. We focus on the determination of the total density of particles in the stationary state $\rho_s(x)$, in the limit $N\to+\infty$. We obtain an explicit expression for $\rho_s(x)$ as a function of the ''renormalized" interaction parameter $k=k_0-3m_2$ where $m_2$ is the second moment of $\rho_s(x)$. Interestingly, this stationary solution exhibits a transition between a connected and a disconnected support for a certain value of $k$, which has no equivalent in the case of Brownian particles. Analyzing in detail the expression of the stationary density in the two cases, we find a variety of regimes characterized by different behaviors near the edges of the support and around $x=0$. Furthermore, we find that the mapping $k_0\to k$ becomes multi-valued below a certain value of the tumbling rate $\gamma$ of the RTPs for some range of values of $k_0$ near the transition, implying the existence of two stable solutions. Finally, we show that in the case of a disconnected support, it is possible to observe steady states where the density $\rho_s(x)$ is not symmetric. All our analytical predictions are in good agreement with numerical simulations already for systems of $N = 100$ particles. The non-uniqueness of the stationary state is a particular feature of this model in the presence of active (RTP) noise, which contrasts with the uniqueness of the Gibbs equilibrium for Brownian particles. We argue that these results are also relevant for a class of more realistic interactions with both an attractive and a repulsive part, but which decay at infinity.</description>
