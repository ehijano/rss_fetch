      <title>Mirror Symmetry of the NMR Spectrum and the Connection with the Structure of Spin Hamiltonian Matrix Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding the symmetry properties of High-Resolution NMR spectra. We analyze the conditions under which a spectrum exhibits mirror symmetry (palindromicity). We demonstrate that such symmetry can arise from two distinct mechanisms: (1) the direct geometric bisymmetry of the Hamiltonian matrix in a generalized canonical basis (typical for balanced systems like $A_nB_n$ or $A_nX_n$), and (2) a more fundamental property of topological isospectrality (similarity) under parameter exchange induced by the internal symmetry of the spin system, which applies even when the matrix lacks geometric symmetry (as observed in $AA'BB'$ systems).</description>

      <title>Rethinking Balance Sheets: A Poisson-Nernst-Planck Based Approach for Modeling Concentration and Flux Profiles Inside an Electrochemical Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrochemical cells serve as a building block for producing and storing electrical energy from chemical reactions. The analysis of ion transport in these systems forms the foundation for understanding more complex electrochemical systems that are becoming increasingly present in the broader societal energy infrastructure. From a pedagogical perspective, the ``balance sheets" introduced in Chapter 4 of Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications by Alan J. Bard, Larry R. Faulkner and Henry S. White (hereafter referred to as BFW) provides a first-pass approach to analyze ion transport in electrochemical cells. However, the balance sheet approach lacks first-principles justifications from the underlying equations that describe the transport processes in electrochemical cells. In this work, we compare a first-principles approach via the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations to describe ion transport in electrochemical cells to that of the balance sheet approach. By re-working the examples presented in BFW, we illustrate that the balance sheet approach is only valid in limited scenarios. Furthermore, we show that the PNP equations provide a more physical route to analyze ion transport in electrochemical systems. We hope the approach outlined here will be adopted by electrochemical engineering researchers and instructors.</description>

      <title>Probing the structure of cyclic hydrocarbon molecules with X-ray-induced Coulomb explosion imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI) is a powerful experimental technique that maps a molecule's geometric structure onto the momenta of ionic molecular fragments produced by rapid multiple ionization. Here, we apply CEI induced by pulses from an X-ray free-electron laser in order to image and distinguish complex hydrocarbon isomers with the chemical formula C7H8: toluene, cycloheptatriene, and 1,6-heptadiyne. The measured fragment-ion momentum distributions show discernible differences between the three isomers and provide signatures of specific carbon and hydrogen sites in the molecule. In contrast to previous work, we demonstrate that distinct 'marker atoms' are not strictly required for constructing a meaningful molecular frame of reference for the interpretation of the momentum-space data. Our work paves the way for tracking the ultrafast motion of nuclei during isomerization reactions in pure hydrocarbons.</description>

      <title>Consistent GMTKN55 and molecular-crystal accuracy using minimally empirical DFT with XDM(Z) dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density-functional theory (DFT) has become the workhorse of modern computational chemistry, with dispersion corrections such as the exchange-hole dipole moment (XDM) model playing a key role in high-accuracy modelling of large-scale systems. All previous production implementations of XDM have used the two-parameter Becke--Johnson damping function based on atomic radii. Here, we introduce and implement a new XDM variant that uses a one-parameter damping function based on atomic numbers, recently proposed by Becke. Both this new Z damping and the canonical BJ-damping variants of XDM are benchmarked on the comprehensive GMTKN55 database using minimally empirical generalised-gradient-approximation, global hybrid, and range-separated hybrid functionals. This marks the first time that the XDM (and many-body dispersion, MBD) corrections have been tested on the GMTKN55 set. Using the new WTMAD-4 metric, an outlier analysis is performed for all new data, as well as for top-ranking functionals from the literature at each rung, providing insight into both performance and consistency across the dataset. To test Z damping's transferability to the solid state, four benchmarks involving molecular crystals are also considered. Across these molecular and solid-state benchmarks, the revPBE0 and B86bPBE0 hybrid functionals, paired with the Z damped XDM variant, show excellent performance.</description>

      <title>UGA-SSMRPT2 -- A Multireference Perturbation Theory Predicting Accurate Electronic Excitation Energies in Diverse Molecular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UGA-SSMRPT2, the spin-free perturbative analogue of Mukerjee's State-Specific Multireference Coupled Cluster Theory (MkMRCC) is known to be successful for size-extensive and intruder-free construction of dissociation curves. This work demonstrates that UGA-SSMRPT2 is also an accurate and computationally inexpensive framework for computing excitation energies. The method achieves near-chemical accuracy for the vast majority of $\pi \to \pi^*$, $n \to \pi^*$, charge-transfer, valence-Rydberg and Rydberg excited states commonly used for benchmarking electronic structure theories for excited states. Our results demonstrate that UGA-SSMRPT2 excitation energies lie within 0.20 eV of EOM-CCSD and/or well-established theoretical best estimates often surpassing the popular MRPT2 approaches like NEVPT2, CASPT2, and MCQDPT while typically requiring smaller active spaces. Its state-specific formulation circumvents the well-known intruder-state problem and eliminates the need for empirical parameters such as IPEA shifts in CASPT2. This work proposes UGA-SSMRPT2 as a robust, and scalable approach for modeling challenging electronic excited states.</description>

      <title>Unified MPI Parallelization of Wave Function Methods: iCIPT2 as a Showcase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of quantum chemical methods with high-performance computing is indispensable for handling large systems with modest accuracy or even small systems but with high accuracy. Continuing with the unified implementation of non-relativistic and relativistic wave functions methods within the MetaWave platform (J. Phys. Chem. A. 2025, 129, 5170), we present here a unified MPI parallelization of the methods by abstracting ever computational step of a method as a dynamically-scheduled loop via ghost process, followed by a global reduction of local results from each node. The algorithmic abstraction enables the use of a single MPI template in various steps of different methods. Taking iCIPT2 [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2021, 17, 949] as a showcase, the parallel efficiencies achieve 94% and 89% on 16 nodes (1024 cores) for the perturbation and whole calculations, respectively. Further combined with an improved algorithm for the matrix-vector product in the matrix diagonalization and an orbital-configuration-based semi-stochastic estimator for the perturbation correction, this renders large active space calculations possible, so as to obtain benchmarks for the automerization of cyclobutadiene, ground state energy of benzene and potential energy profile of ozone. It is also shown that the error of iCIPT2 follows a power law with respect to the number of configuration state functions.</description>

      <title>Beyond Learning on Molecules by Weakly Supervising on Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular representations are inherently task-dependent, yet most pre-trained molecular encoders are not. Task conditioning promises representations that reorganize based on task descriptions, but existing approaches rely on expensive labeled data. We show that weak supervision on programmatically derived molecular motifs is sufficient. Our Adaptive Chemical Embedding Model (ACE-Mol) learns from hundreds of motifs paired with natural language descriptors that are cheap to compute, trivial to scale. Conventional encoders slowly search the embedding space for task-relevant structure, whereas ACE-Mol immediately aligns its representations with the task. ACE-Mol achieves state-of-the-art performance across molecular property prediction benchmarks with interpretable, chemically meaningful representations.</description>

      <title>Intermolecular Interactions of Large Systems: Boron Nitrides, Acenes, and Coronenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent contribution [Fishman, V.; Lesiuk, M.; Martin, J.M.L.; Boese, A.D., J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2025, 21, 2311-2324], we introduced another angle at benchmarking non-covalent interactions by not just benchmarking interaction energies of different species, but by considering the evolution of interaction energies with increasing system size.
  Here, we extend the benchmark set to more species, such as electrostatically bound borazine dimers as well as the minima structures of parallel displaced acene and coronene dimers. While the minimum structures of the parallel displaced acene dimers yield similar results to previously published sandwich-structured acenes, the borazine dimers behave vastly different, yielding yet a more complete picture on non-covalent interactions and their scalability. In contrast, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon structures -- coronenes sandwich-stacked and coronenes parallel displaced -- give results consistent with those obtained for both types of the polyacene series, resulting in an updated estimate for the coronene dimer energy.</description>

      <title>Reducing the Cost of Unitary Coupled Cluster via Active Space Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) theory is a promising variational method for electronic structure calculations, especially for strongly correlated systems and quantum computers. However, its practical application is limited by the steep scaling of its non-terminating Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion. We introduce an active space UCCSD(4)/MP2 approach that leverages a fourth-order many-body perturbation theory truncation of UCCSD within a selected active space, while treating external excitations at the MP2 level. We explore two variants: a composite method that sums separate internal and external contributions and an interacting method that couples the amplitudes for greater accuracy. We test our approach on the GW100 dataset, a metaphosphate hydrolysis reaction, and the strongly correlated torsion of ethylene. Our results suggest that the interacting method with canonical orbitals is robust for weakly and moderately correlated systems and accurately reproduces the full UCCSD(4) potential energy curves using only 15-25% of the virtual orbitals in its active space. In comparison, the composite formulation exhibits greater sensitivity to the orbital basis and active space size, leading to less systematic behavior across the benchmark set. For ethylene torsion, a system dominated by strong static correlation, both composite and interacting formulations employing canonical orbitals closely track the full UCCSD(4) reference but do not alleviate the unphysical features inherited from the underlying single-reference UCCSD(4) description. This active space framework offers a tractable approach for modeling correlated molecules and reactions on classical computers and provides a viable path for scaling UCC calculations for resource-constrained quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>El Agente Estructural: An Artificially Intelligent Molecular Editor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present El Agente Estructural, a multimodal, natural-language-driven geometry-generation and manipulation agent for autonomous chemistry and molecular modelling. Unlike molecular generation or editing via generative models, Estructural mimics how human experts directly manipulate molecular systems in three dimensions by integrating a comprehensive set of domain-informed tools and vision-language models. This design enables precise control over atomic or functional group replacements, atomic connectivity, and stereochemistry without the need to rebuild extensive core molecular frameworks. Through a series of representative case studies, we demonstrate that Estructural enables chemically meaningful geometry manipulation across a wide range of real-world scenarios. These include site-selective functionalization, ligand binding, ligand exchange, stereochemically controlled structure construction, isomer interconversion, fragment-level structural analysis, image-guided generation of structures from schematic reaction mechanisms, and mechanism-driven geometry generation and modification. These examples illustrate how multimodal reasoning, when combined with specialized geometry-aware tools, supports interactive and context-aware molecular modelling beyond structure generation. Looking forward, the integration of Estructural into El Agente Quntur, an autonomous multi-agent quantum chemistry platform, enhances its capabilities by adding sophisticated tools for the generation and editing of three-dimensional structures.</description>

      <title>El Agente Quntur: A research collaborator agent for quantum chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum chemistry is a foundational enabling tool for the fields of chemistry, materials science, computational biology and others. Despite of its power, the practical application of quantum chemistry simulations remains in the hands of qualified experts due to methodological complexity, software heterogeneity, and the need for informed interpretation of results. To bridge the accessibility gap for these tools and expand their reach to chemists with broader backgrounds, we introduce El Agente Quntur, a hierarchical, multi-agent AI system designed to operate not merely as an automation tool but as a research collaborator for computational quantum chemistry. Quntur was designed following three main strategies: i) elimination of hard-coded procedural policies in favour of reasoning-driven decisions, ii) construction of general and composable actions that facilitate generalization and efficiency, and iii) implementation of guided deep research to integrate abstract quantum-chemical reasoning across subdisciplines and a detailed understanding of the software's internal logic and syntax. Although instantiated in ORCA, these design principles are applicable to research agents more generally and easily expandable to additional quantum chemistry packages and beyond. Quntur supports the full range of calculations available in ORCA 6.0 and reasons over software documentation and scientific literature to plan, execute, adapt, and analyze in silico chemistry experiments following best practices. We discuss the advances and current bottlenecks in agentic systems operating at the research level in computational chemistry, and outline a roadmap toward a fully autonomous end-to-end computational chemistry research agent.</description>

      <title>A universal waveguide mass--energy relation for lossy one-dimensional waves in nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite, lossy waveguides are ubiquitous: distributed attenuation with partial reflections produces feedback, resonance, delays and decay across electromagnetic, acoustic, photonic, quantum-transport and electrochemical interfaces. Yet standard impedance/scattering tools and weak-loss resonator approximations do not provide low-dimensional invariants that remain predictive under intrinsic asymmetry and realistic boundaries, nor do they cleanly separate total absorption from useful power delivered to a load. Here we develop a unified mass--energy framework for linear, single-mode, one-dimensional systems, in which energy-like and power-flow variables $(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{S})$ satisfy the universal invariant $\mathcal{U}^2-\mathcal{S}^2=|\Gamma_g|^2$, with the effective standing-wave ``mass'' $|\Gamma_g|$ becoming state-dependent under asymmetry. The Cai--Smith chart gives a bounded state-space map of stability, feedback proximity and operating states, and makes explicit the divergence between maximum absorption and useful delivery under loss. We derive four laws governing absorption and emission, validate the invariant in multiport optics via coherent perfect absorption at exceptional points using a basis-independent SVD criterion (reconciling quadratic vs quartic near-zero scaling), and map electrochemical polarization onto the same geometry by extracting $|\Gamma_g|$ from two-mode orthogonal fits to reveal a universal storage-to-transfer transition across pH. This framework provides a transferable design language for dissipative, boundary-controlled systems.</description>

      <title>Constructing Compact ADAPT Unitary Coupled-Cluster Ansatz with Parameter-Based Criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adaptive derivative-assembled pseudo-trotter variational quantum eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) is a promising hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for molecular ground state energy calculation, yet its practical scalability is hampered by redundant excitation operators and excessive measurement costs. To address these challenges, we propose Param-ADAPT-VQE, a novel improved algorithm that selects excitation operators based on a parameter-based criterion instead of the traditional gradient-based metric. This strategy effectively eludes redundant operators. We further develop a sub-Hamiltonian technique and integrate a hot-start VQE optimization strategy, achieving a significant reduction in measurement costs. Numerical experiments on typical molecular systems demonstrate that Param-ADAPT-VQE outperforms the original ADAPT-VQE in computational accuracy, ansatz size, and measurement costs. Furthermore, our scheme retains the fundamental framework of ADAPT-VQE and is thus fully compatible with its various modified versions, enabling further performance improvements in specific aspects. This work presents an efficient and scalable enhancement to ADAPT-VQE, mitigating the core obstacles that impede its practical implementation in the field of molecular quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Revealing the interfacial kinetic mechanisms in high-entropy doped Na$_3$V$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ through electrochemical investigation and distribution of relaxation times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We designed a high-entropy doped NASICON cathode, Na$_3$V$_{1.9}$(CrMoAlZrNi)$_{0.1}$(PO$_4$)$_3$ and investigate its electrochemical performance for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) to understand the diffusion mechanism including distribution of relaxation times analysis of interfacial kinetics. This trace doping induces high-entropy mixing at the vanadium site, tuning the lattice and enhancing specific capacity, activating V$^{4+}$/V$^{5+}$ redox couple 3.95~V. Interestingly, it delivers a reversible capacity of 119~mAh~g$^{-1}$ at 0.1~C, and demonstrate excellent stability of 68\% after 1000 cycles at 10~C. The calculated diffusion coefficient values are found within the range of \(10^{-11}\)--\(10^{-13}~\mathrm{cm^2\,s^{-1}}\). The systematic investigation of temperature and voltage-dependent impedance data using the distribution of relaxation times provides deeper insights into the underlying charge-transfer and transport processes. The full cells with hard carbon delivers 326~Wh~kg$^{-1}$ (with respect to cathode mass) at $\approx$3.2~V and retained $\sim$79\% capacity after 100 cycles at 2~C. Our study opens new avenues for developing high-entropy doped cathodes for enhanced structural stability, extended redox activity, and optimized electrochemical kinetics for practical implementation of SIBs.</description>

      <title>Atom Addition Formation of Thionylimide (HNSO) on Interstellar Dust Grains: Chemical routes requiring oxygen and nitrogen atom surface diffusion</title>

Abstract: We investigate the formation of the recently detected HNSO molecule using quantum chemical calculations on ices and astrochemical models in tandem. Our results indicate that HNSO is efficiently produced on grain surfaces through reactions involving atomic oxygen and nitrogen atoms with the radicals NS and SO, forming NSO as a key intermediate. Subsequent hydrogenation of NSO leads to HNSO, with a clear preference for the lowest energy cis conformer, while the trans form is metastable and may be short-lived under typical interstellar conditions. The models predict that solid HNSO can reach abundances comparable to icy OCS, placing it among the major sulfur-bearing species in interstellar ices. Gas-phase abundances, in contrast, remain lower than those of OCS. The implementation of a multibinding scheme in our models clarifies the role of diffusive chemistry in the production of HNSO at early times, improving agreement with observations. These findings suggest that reactions involving diffusing O and N atoms on icy grains contribute significantly to sulfur chemistry and beyond in dense clouds and motivate further searches for molecules containing simultaneously H, N, O and S in other astronomical environments.</description>

      <title>From Evaluation to Design: Using Potential Energy Surface Smoothness Metrics to Guide Machine Learning Interatomic Potential Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) sometimes fail to reproduce the physical smoothness of the quantum potential energy surface (PES), leading to erroneous behavior in downstream simulations that standard energy and force regression evaluations can miss. Existing evaluations, such as microcanonical molecular dynamics (MD), are computationally expensive and primarily probe near-equilibrium states. To improve evaluation metrics for MLIPs, we introduce the Bond Smoothness Characterization Test (BSCT). This efficient benchmark probes the PES via controlled bond deformations and detects non-smoothness, including discontinuities, artificial minima, and spurious forces, both near and far from equilibrium. We show that BSCT correlates strongly with MD stability while requiring a fraction of the cost of MD. To demonstrate how BSCT can guide iterative model design, we utilize an unconstrained Transformer backbone as a testbed, illustrating how refinements such as a new differentiable $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm and temperature-controlled attention reduce artifacts identified by our metric. By optimizing model design systematically based on BSCT, the resulting MLIP simultaneously achieves a low conventional E/F regression error, stable MD simulations, and robust atomistic property predictions. Our results establish BSCT as both a validation metric and as an "in-the-loop" model design proxy that alerts MLIP developers to physical challenges that cannot be efficiently evaluated by current MLIP benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: Femtosecond structural dynamics of diiodomethane ($\mathrm{CH_2I_2}$) triggered by ultraviolet (UV) photoabsorption at 290 nm and 330 nm are studied using time-resolved coincident Coulomb explosion imaging driven by a near-infrared probe pulse. We map the dominant single-photon process, the cleavage of the carbon-iodine bond producing rotationally excited $\mathrm{CH_2I}$ radical, identify the contributions of the three-body ($\mathrm{CH_2} + \mathrm{I} + \mathrm{I}$) dissociation and molecular iodine formation channels, which are primarily driven by the absorption of more than one UV photon, and demonstrate the existence of a weak reaction pathway involving the formation of short-lived transient species resembling iso-$\mathrm{CH_2I{-}I}$ geometries with a slightly shorter I-I separation compared to the ground-state $\mathrm{CH_2I_2}$. These transient molecular configurations, which can be separated from the other channels by applying a set of conditions on the correlated momenta of three ionic fragments, are formed within approximately 100 fs after the initial photoexcitation and decay within the next 100 fs.</description>

      <title>Accurate Chemistry Collection: Coupled cluster atomization energies for broad chemical space</title>

Abstract: Accurate thermochemical data with sub-chemical accuracy (i.e., within $\pm$1 kcal mol$^{-1}$ from sufficiently accurate experimental or theoretical reference data) is essential for the development and improvement of computational chemistry methods. Challenging thermochemical properties such as heats of formation and total atomization energies (TAEs) are of particular interest because they rigorously test the ability of computational chemistry methods to accurately describe complex chemical transformations involving multiple bond rearrangements. Yet, existing thermochemical datasets that confidently reach this level of accuracy are limited in either size or scope. Datasets with highly accurate reference values include a small number of data points, and larger datasets provide less accurate data or only cover a narrow portion of the chemical space. The existing datasets are therefore insufficient for developing data-driven methods with predictive accuracy over a large chemical space. The Microsoft Research Accurate Chemistry Collection (MSR-ACC) will address this challenge. Here, it offers the MSR-ACC/TAE25 dataset of 76,879 total atomization energies obtained at the CCSD(T)/CBS level via the W1-F12 thermochemical protocol. The dataset is constructed to exhaustively cover chemical space for all elements up to argon by enumerating and sampling chemical graphs, thus avoiding bias towards any particular subspace of the chemical space (such as drug-like, organic, or experimentally observed molecules). With this first dataset in MSR-ACC, we enable data-driven approaches for developing predictive computational chemistry methods with unprecedented accuracy and scope.</description>

      <title>Accurate and scalable exchange-correlation with deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14665v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the most widely used electronic structure method for predicting the properties of molecules and materials. Although DFT is, in principle, an exact reformulation of the Schr\"odinger equation, practical applications rely on approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Most existing XC functionals are constructed using a limited set of increasingly complex, hand-crafted features that improve accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Yet, no current approximation achieves the accuracy and generality for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments at chemical accuracy -- typically defined as errors below 1 kcal/mol. In this work, we present Skala, a modern deep learning-based XC functional that bypasses expensive hand-designed features by learning representations directly from data. Skala achieves chemical accuracy for atomization energies of small molecules while retaining the computational efficiency typical of semi-local DFT. This performance is enabled by training on an unprecedented volume of high-accuracy reference data generated using computationally intensive wavefunction-based methods. Notably, Skala systematically improves with additional training data covering diverse chemistry. By incorporating a modest amount of additional high-accuracy data tailored to chemistry beyond atomization energies, Skala achieves accuracy competitive with the best-performing hybrid functionals across general main group chemistry, at the cost of semi-local DFT. As the training dataset continues to expand, Skala is poised to further enhance the predictive power of first-principles simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate basic hydrogen quantities like the molecular bond length, the molecular dissociation energy and the van-der-Waals interaction in idealized situations in an effort to discern a suitable exchange-correlation functional for the molecular to metal transition in warm dense hydrogen. The best reproduction of bond length and dissociation energy is given by the r2SCAN functional, several vdW functionals and also HSE06 fair qualitatively and quantitatively no better than PBE or worse. In addition we investigate quantities like the static and dynamic ion structure factor, and the electronic DOS to determine differences between exchange-correlation functionals with and without van-der-Waals corrections in the transition region from the molecular to the metallic regime of hydrogen.</description>

      <title>PASPT2: a novel size-extensive and size-consistent partial-active-space multi-state multi-reference second-order perturbation theory for strongly correlated electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A partial-active-space (PAS) multi-state (MS) multi-reference second-order perturbation theory (MRPT2) for the electronic structure of strongly correlated systems of electrons, dubbed PASPT2, is formulated by linearizing the intermediate normalization-based general-model-space state-universal coupled-cluster theory with singles and doubles [IN-GMS-SU-CCSD; J. Chem. Phys. 119, 5320 (2003)]. At variance with the existence of disconnected terms in the IN-GMS-SU-CCSD amplitude equations, the disconnected terms in the PASPT2 amplitude equations can be avoided completely by choosing a special reference-specific zeroth-order Hamiltonian. The corresponding effective/intermediate Hamiltonian can also be made connected and closed, so as to render the energies obtained by diagonalization fully connected. As such, PASPT2 is strictly size-extensive, in sharp contrast with the parent IN-GMS-SU-CCSD. It is also size-consistent when the PAS of a supermolecule is chosen to be the direct product of those of the physically separated, non-interacting fragments. Prototypical systems are taken as showcases to reveal the efficacy of PASPT2.</description>
