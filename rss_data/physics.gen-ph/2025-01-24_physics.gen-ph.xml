      <title>Sketch of a gauge model of gravity with SU(2) symmetry on a Lorentzian manifold with tetrad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A gauge model with SU(2) symmetry is proposed to describe the gravitational interaction of fundamental fermions (leptons and quarks) on a Lorentzian manifold with a tetrad. From the system of Dirac-Yang-Mills equations underlying the Standard Model, we arrive at a model system of Dirac-Lanczos-Yang-Mills equations, written using second-order matrices. This system of equations has an additional gauge symmetry with respect to the unitary group SU(2). The Yang-Mills field associated with this gauge group is interpreted as the gravitational field interacting with fundamental fermions.</description>

      <title>Extending the solutions and the equations of quantum gravity past the big bang singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [8] we recently proved that in our model of quantum gravity the solutions to the quantized version of the full Einstein equations or to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation could be expressed as products of spatial and temporal eigenfunctions, or eigendistributions, of self-adjoint operators acting in corresponding separable Hilbert spaces. Moreover, near the big bang singularity we derived sharp asymptotic estimates for the temporal eigenfunctions. In this paper we show that, by using these estimates, there exists a complete sequence of unitarily equivalent eigenfunctions which can be extended past the singularity by even or odd mirroring as sufficiently smooth functions such that the extended functions are solutions of the appropriately extended equations valid in $\R[]$ in the classical sense. We also use this phenomenon to explain the missing antimatter.</description>

      <title>Symmetries in the many-body problems, a method to find its analytical solution, and Helium atom spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work it is shown that there are symmetries beyond the Euclidean group $E\left(3\right)$ in 3-body problem, and by extension in many-body problem, with inverse squared distance inter particle force. The symmetries in 3-body problem form a group: $SO\left(4\times3,2\times3\right)/\left(C\left(3\times2\right)\right)$, where $C\left(n\right)$ is the planar translation group in n dimensions, which forms its Spectrum-Generating group. Some of these quantities commute with the Hamiltonian. The existence of these conserved quantities was verified by calculating energy spectrum of the Helium atom. This method can also be used to find symmetries in many-body problem, and to calculate energy levels, and wave-functions of more complicated systems, which include every possible atomic and molecular systems in chemistry.</description>

      <title>A heuristic sketch how it could fit all together with time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a scientific meta-level, it is discussed how an overall understanding of the physical universe can be built on the basis of well-proven theories, observations, and recent experiments. In the light of almost a century of struggle to make (common) sense of Quantum Mechanics and to reconcile it with General Relativity, it is proposed to (for some time) forget about quantizing gravity or striving for one Theory of Everything or 'Weltformel', which would describe the whole of reality seamlessly without any joints or suture marks. Instead of one single monolithic formalism, a three-legged compound approach is argued for. Quantum Mechanics, Relativity and Thermodynamics are proposed as the main pillars of reality, each with its well-defined realm, specific features, and clearly marked interfaces between the three of them. Not only classical reality, which is rather directly accessible to us, is then comprehensively modelled by their encompassing combination. Quantum phenomena are understood as undoubtedly lying at the bottom of classical physics and at the same time, they become 'fully real' only when embedded in classical frames, i.e., preparation and measurements in time. It is then where thermodynamics steps in and provides the mediating glue as it does at interfaces towards gravity. Decoherence is understood as a smooth way of gradually transferring information and basically dumping entropy to a suitable environment. The aim of this short contribution is not to deliver novel quantitative results but rather to propose a comprehensive research program and to coarsely lay out a very roughly coherent sketch starting from the beginning of the one universe, which we inhabit. The all-embracing picture is claimed to be one of ('mutually induced') emergence.</description>
