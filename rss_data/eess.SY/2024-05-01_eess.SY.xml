      <title>A Hybrid Probabilistic Battery Health Management Approach for Robust Inspection Drone Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Health monitoring of remote critical infrastructure is a complex and expensive activity due to the limited infrastructure accessibility. Inspection drones are ubiquitous assets that enhance the reliability of critical infrastructures through improved accessibility. However, due to the harsh operation environment, it is crucial to monitor their health to ensure successful inspection operations. The battery is a key component that determines the overall reliability of the inspection drones and, with an appropriate health management approach, contributes to reliable and robust inspections. In this context, this paper presents a novel hybrid probabilistic approach for battery end-of-discharge (EOD) voltage prediction of Li-Po batteries. The hybridization is achieved in an error-correction configuration, which combines physics-based discharge and probabilistic error-correction models to quantify the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. The performance of the hybrid probabilistic methodology was empirically evaluated on a dataset comprising EOD voltage under varying load conditions. The dataset was obtained from real inspection drones operated on different flights, focused on offshore wind turbine inspections. The proposed approach has been tested with different probabilistic methods and demonstrates 14.8% improved performance in probabilistic accuracy compared to the best probabilistic method. In addition, aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties provide robust estimations to enhance the diagnosis of battery health-states.</description>

      <title>Age of Information Minimization using Multi-agent UAVs based on AI-Enhanced Mean Field Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms play an effective role in timely data collection from ground sensors in remote and hostile areas. Optimizing the collective behavior of swarms can improve data collection performance. This paper puts forth a new mean field flight resource allocation optimization to minimize age of information (AoI) of sensory data, where balancing the trade-off between the UAVs movements and AoI is formulated as a mean field game (MFG). The MFG optimization yields an expansive solution space encompassing continuous state and action, resulting in significant computational complexity. To address practical situations, we propose, a new mean field hybrid proximal policy optimization (MF-HPPO) scheme to minimize the average AoI by optimizing the UAV's trajectories and data collection scheduling of the ground sensors given mixed continuous and discrete actions. Furthermore, a long short term memory (LSTM) is leveraged in MF-HPPO to predict the time-varying network state and stabilize the training. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MF-HPPO reduces the average AoI by up to 45 percent and 57 percent in the considered simulation setting, as compared to multi-agent deep Q-learning (MADQN) method and non-learning random algorithm, respectively.</description>

      <title>RIS-aided Wireless Communication with Movable Elements Geometry Impact on Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) are known as a promising technology to improve the performance of wireless communication networks, and have been extensively studied. Movable Antennas (MA) are a novel technology that fully exploits the antenna placement for enhancing the system performance. This article aims at evaluating the impact of transmit power and number of antenna elements on the outage probability performance of an MA-enabled RIS structure (MA-RIS), compared to existing Fixed-Position Antenna RIS (FPA-RIS). The change in geometry caused by the movement of antennas and its implications for the effective number of illuminated elements, are studied for 1D and 2D array structures. Our numerical results confirm the performance advantage provided by MA-RIS, achieving 24\% improvement in outage probability, and 2 dB gain in Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), as compared to FPA-RIS.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Opacity-Enforcement in Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies information-theoretic opacity, an information-flow privacy property, in a setting involving two agents: A planning agent who controls a stochastic system and an observer who partially observes the system states. The goal of the observer is to infer some secret, represented by a random variable, from its partial observations, while the goal of the planning agent is to make the secret maximally opaque to the observer while achieving a satisfactory total return. Modeling the stochastic system using a Markov decision process, two classes of opacity properties are considered -- Last-state opacity is to ensure that the observer is uncertain if the last state is in a specific set and initial-state opacity is to ensure that the observer is unsure of the realization of the initial state. As the measure of opacity, we employ the Shannon conditional entropy capturing the information about the secret revealed by the observable. Then, we develop primal-dual policy gradient methods for opacity-enforcement planning subject to constraints on total returns. We propose novel algorithms to compute the policy gradient of entropy for each observation, leveraging message passing within the hidden Markov models. This gradient computation enables us to have stable and fast convergence. We demonstrate our solution of opacity-enforcement control through a grid world example.</description>

      <title>Koopman-based Deep Learning for Nonlinear System Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear differential equations are encountered as models of fluid flow, spiking neurons, and many other systems of interest in the real world. Common features of these systems are that their behaviors are difficult to describe exactly and invariably unmodeled dynamics present challenges in making precise predictions. In many cases the models exhibit extremely complicated behavior due to bifurcations and chaotic regimes. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven linear estimator that uses Koopman operator theory to extract finite-dimensional representations of complex nonlinear systems. The extracted model is used together with a deep reinforcement learning network that learns the optimal stepwise actions to predict future states of the original nonlinear system. Our estimator is also adaptive to a diffeomorphic transformation of the nonlinear system which enables transfer learning to compute state estimates of the transformed system without relearning from scratch.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate agent-based approach for system model identification with an emphasis on power distribution system applications. Departing from conventional practices of relying on historical data for offline model identification, we adopt an online update approach utilizing real-time data by employing the latest data points for gradient computation. This methodology offers advantages including a large reduction in the communication network's bandwidth requirements by minimizing the data exchanged at each iteration and enabling the model to adapt in real-time to disturbances. Furthermore, we extend our model identification process from linear frameworks to more complex non-linear convex models. This extension is validated through numerical studies demonstrating improved control performance for a synthetic IEEE test case.</description>

      <title>TALICS$^3$: Tape Library Cloud Storage System Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High performance computing data is surging fast into the exabyte-scale world, where tape libraries are the main platform for long-term durable data storage besides high-cost DNA. Tape libraries are extremely hard to model, but accurate modeling is critical for system administrators to obtain valid performance estimates for their designs. This research introduces a discrete event tape simulation platform that realistically models tape library behavior in a networked cloud environment, by incorporating real-world phenomena and effects. The platform addresses several challenges, including precise estimation of data access latency, rates of robot exchange, data collocation, deduplication/compression ratio, and attainment of durability goals through replication or erasure coding. The suggested simulator has the capability to compare the single enterprise configuration with multiple commodity library (RAIL) configurations, making it a useful tool for system administrators and reliability engineers. They can use the simulator to obtain practical and reliable performance estimates for their long-term, durable, and cost-effective cold data storage architecture designs.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Permissible Safe Control with Barrier Certificates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method of identifying a maximal set of safe strategies from data for stochastic systems with unknown dynamics using barrier certificates. The first step is learning the dynamics of the system via Gaussian process (GP) regression and obtaining probabilistic errors for this estimate. Then, we develop an algorithm for constructing piecewise stochastic barrier functions to find a maximal permissible strategy set using the learned GP model, which is based on sequentially pruning the worst controls until a maximal set is identified. The permissible strategies are guaranteed to maintain probabilistic safety for the true system. This is especially important for learning-enabled systems, because a rich strategy space enables additional data collection and complex behaviors while remaining safe. Case studies on linear and nonlinear systems demonstrate that increasing the size of the dataset for learning the system grows the permissible strategy set.</description>

      <title>A decomposition-based approach for large-scale pickup and delivery problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of self-driving cars, experts envision autonomous mobility-on-demand services in the near future to cope with overloaded transportation systems in cities worldwide. Efficient operations are imperative to unlock such a system's maximum improvement potential. Existing approaches either consider a narrow planning horizon or ignore essential characteristics of the underlying problem. In this paper, we develop an algorithmic framework that allows the study of very large-scale pickup and delivery routing problems with more than 20 thousand requests, which arise in the context of integrated request pooling and vehicle-to-request dispatching. We conduct a computational study and present comparative results showing the characteristics of the developed approaches. Furthermore, we apply our algorithm to related benchmark instances from the literature to show the efficacy. Finally, we solve very large-scale instances and derive insights on upper-bound improvements regarding fleet sizing and customer delay acceptance from a practical perspective.</description>

      <title>Enhance Planning with Physics-informed Safety Controllor for End-to-end Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a growing research interest in applications of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) on autonomous vehicle technology. The trend started with perception and prediction a few years ago and it is gradually being applied to motion planning tasks. Despite the performance of networks improve over time, DNN planners inherit the natural drawbacks of Deep Learning. Learning-based planners have limitations in achieving perfect accuracy on the training dataset and network performance can be affected by out-of-distribution problem. In this paper, we propose FusionAssurance, a novel trajectory-based end-to-end driving fusion framework which combines physics-informed control for safety assurance. By incorporating Potential Field into Model Predictive Control, FusionAssurance is capable of navigating through scenarios that are not included in the training dataset and scenarios where neural network fail to generalize. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by extensive experiments under various scenarios on the CARLA benchmark.</description>

      <title>Cell Switching in HAPS-Aided Networking: How the Obscurity of Traffic Loads Affects the Decision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to introduce the cell load estimation problem of cell switching approaches in cellular networks specially-presented in a high-altitude platform station (HAPS)-assisted network. The problem arises from the fact that the traffic loads of sleeping base stations for the next time slot cannot be perfectly known, but they can rather be estimated, and any estimation error could result in divergence from the optimal decision, which subsequently affects the performance of energy efficiency. The traffic loads of the sleeping base stations for the next time slot are required because the switching decisions are made proactively in the current time slot. Two different Q-learning algorithms are developed; one is full-scale, focusing solely on the performance, while the other one is lightweight and addresses the computational cost. Results confirm that the estimation error is capable of changing cell switching decisions that yields performance divergence compared to no-error scenarios. Moreover, the developed Q-learning algorithms perform well since an insignificant difference (i.e., 0.3%) is observed between them and the optimum algorithm.</description>

      <title>Employing Federated Learning for Training Autonomous HVAC Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Buildings account for 40 % of global energy consumption. A considerable portion of building energy consumption stems from heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), and thus implementing smart, energy-efficient HVAC systems has the potential to significantly impact the course of climate change. In recent years, model-free reinforcement learning algorithms have been increasingly assessed for this purpose due to their ability to learn and adapt purely from experience. They have been shown to outperform classical controllers in terms of energy cost and consumption, as well as thermal comfort. However, their weakness lies in their relatively poor data efficiency, requiring long periods of training to reach acceptable policies, making them inapplicable to real-world controllers directly. Hence, common research goals are to improve the learning speed, as well as to improve their ability to generalize, in order to facilitate transfer learning to unseen building environments. In this paper, we take a federated learning approach to training the reinforcement learning controller of an HVAC system. A global control policy is learned by aggregating local policies trained on multiple data centers located in different climate zones. The goal of the policy is to simultaneously minimize energy consumption and maximize thermal comfort. The federated optimization strategy indirectly increases both the rate at which experience data is collected and the variation in the data. We demonstrate through experimental evaluation that these effects lead to a faster learning speed, as well as greater generalization capabilities in the federated policy compared to any individually trained policy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a convex optimization framework for eco-driving and vehicle energy management problems. We will first show that several types of eco-driving and vehicle energy management problems can be modelled using the same notions of energy storage buffers and energy storage converters that are connected to a power network. It will be shown that these problems can be formulated as optimization problems with linear cost functions and linear dynamics, and nonlinear constraints representing the power converters. We will show that under some mild conditions, the (non-convex) optimization problem has the same (globally) optimal solution as a convex relaxation. This means that the problems can be solved efficiently and that the solution is guaranteed to be globally optimal. Finally, a numerical example of the eco-driving problem is used to illustrate this claim.</description>

      <title>The Loewner framework for parametric systems: Taming the curse of dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Loewner framework is an interpolatory framework for the approximation of linear and nonlinear systems. The purpose here is to extend this framework to linear parametric systems with an arbitrary number n of parameters. One main innovation established here is the construction of data-based realizations for any number of parameters. Equally importantly, we show how to alleviate the computational burden, by avoiding the explicit construction of large-scale n-dimensional Loewner matrices of size $N \times N$. This reduces the complexity from $O(N^3)$ to about $O(N^{1.4})$, thus taming the curse of dimensionality and making the solution scalable to very large data sets. To achieve this, a new generalized multivariate rational function realization is defined. Then, we introduce the n-dimensional multivariate Loewner matrices and show that they can be computed by solving a coupled set of Sylvester equations. The null space of these Loewner matrices then allows the construction of the multivariate barycentric transfer function. The principal result of this work is to show how the null space of the n-dimensional Loewner matrix can be computed using a sequence of 1-dimensional Loewner matrices, leading to a drastic computational burden reduction. Finally, we suggest two algorithms (one direct and one iterative) to construct, directly from data, multivariate (or parametric) realizations ensuring (approximate) interpolation. Numerical examples highlight the effectiveness and scalability of the method.</description>

      <title>A Modular Pragmatic Architecture for Multiuser MIMO with Array-Fed RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a power- and hardware-efficient, pragmatic, modular, multiuser/multibeam array-fed RIS architecture particularly suited to operate in very high frequency bands (high mmWave and sub-THz), where channels are typically sparse in the beamspace and line-of-sight (LOS) is required to achieve an acceptable received signal level. The key module is an active multi-antenna feeder (AMAF) with a small number of active antennas placed in the near field of a RIS with a much larger number of passive controllable reflecting elements. We propose a pragmatic approach to obtain a steerable beam with high gain and very low sidelobes. Then, $K$ independently controlled beams can be achieved by stacking $K$ of such AMAF-RIS modules. Our analysis takes in full account: 1) the near-end crosstalk (NEXT) between the modules, 2) the far-end crosstalk (FEXT) due to the sidelobes; 3) a thorough energy efficiency comparison with respect to conventional {\em active arrays} with the same beamforming performance. Overall, we show that the proposed architecture is very attractive in terms of spectral efficiency, ease of implementation (hardware complexity), and energy efficiency.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a method to identify a Koopman model of a feedback-controlled system given a known controller. The Koopman operator allows a nonlinear system to be rewritten as an infinite-dimensional linear system by viewing it in terms of an infinite set of lifting functions. A finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator can be identified from data by choosing a finite subset of lifting functions and solving a regression problem in the lifted space. Existing methods are designed to identify open-loop systems. However, it is impractical or impossible to run experiments on some systems, such as unstable systems, in an open-loop fashion. The proposed method leverages the linearity of the Koopman operator, along with knowledge of the controller and the structure of the closed-loop system, to simultaneously identify the closed-loop and plant systems. The advantages of the proposed closed-loop Koopman operator approximation method are demonstrated in simulation using a Duffing oscillator and experimentally using a rotary inverted pendulum system. An open-source software implementation of the proposed method is publicly available, along with the experimental dataset generated for this paper.</description>

      <title>Meta-State-Space Learning: An Identification Approach for Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>

Abstract: Available methods for identification of stochastic dynamical systems from input-output data generally impose restricting structural assumptions on either the noise structure in the data-generating system or the possible state probability distributions. In this paper, we introduce a novel identification method of such systems, which results in a dynamical model that is able to produce the time-varying output distribution accurately without taking restrictive assumptions on the data-generating process. The method is formulated by first deriving a novel and exact representation of a wide class of nonlinear stochastic systems in a so-called meta-state-space form, where the meta-state can be interpreted as a parameter vector of a state probability function space parameterization. As the resulting representation of the meta-state dynamics is deterministic, we can capture the stochastic system based on a deterministic model, which is highly attractive for identification. The meta-state-space representation often involves unknown and heavily nonlinear functions, hence, we propose an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based identification method capable of efficiently learning nonlinear meta-state-space models. We demonstrate that the proposed identification method can obtain models with a log-likelihood close to the theoretical limit even for highly nonlinear, highly stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>Model-Free Change Point Detection for Mixing Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the change point detection problem under dependent samples. In particular, we provide performance guarantees for the MMD-CUSUM test under exponentially $\alpha$, $\beta$, and fast $\phi$-mixing processes, which significantly expands its utility beyond the i.i.d. and Markovian cases used in previous studies. We obtain lower bounds for average-run-length (ARL) and upper bounds for average-detection-delay (ADD) in terms of the threshold parameter. We show that the MMD-CUSUM test enjoys the same level of performance as the i.i.d. case under fast $\phi$-mixing processes. The MMD-CUSUM test also achieves strong performance under exponentially $\alpha$/$\beta$-mixing processes, which are significantly more relaxed than existing results. The MMD-CUSUM test statistic adapts to different settings without modifications, rendering it a completely data-driven, dependence-agnostic change point detection scheme. Numerical simulations are provided at the end to evaluate our findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an implementation of interval analysis and mixed monotone interval reachability analysis as function transforms in Python, fully composable with the computational framework JAX. The resulting toolbox inherits several key features from JAX, including computational efficiency through Just-In-Time Compilation, GPU acceleration for quick parallelized computations, and Automatic Differentiability. We demonstrate the toolbox's performance on several case studies, including a reachability problem on a vehicle model controlled by a neural network, and a robust closed-loop optimal control problem for a swinging pendulum.</description>

      <title>Adaptive FRIT-based Recursive Robust Controller Design Using Forgetting Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive FRIT (A-FRIT) with exponential forgetting (EF) has been proposed for time-varying systems to improve the data dependence of FRIT, which is a direct data-driven tuning method. However, the EF-based method is not a reliable controller because it can cause significant degradation of the control performance and instability unless the persistent excitation (PE) condition is satisfied. To solve this problem, we propose a new A-FRIT method based on directional forgetting (DF) and exponential resetting that can forget old data without instability regardless of the PE condition. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, we applied it to artificial muscle control with strong asymmetric hysteresis characteristics and evaluated its robust performance against load changes during the experiment. The experimental results show that the proposed method based on DF achieves high control performance and is robust against changes in the characteristics and/or target trajectory. The proposed method is also practical because it does not require system identification, model structure, or prior experimentation.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Perspective on Fusing Gaussian Distributions on Lie Groups</title>

Abstract: Stochastic inference on Lie groups plays a key role in state estimation problems such as; inertial navigation, visual inertial odometry, pose estimation in virtual reality, etc. A key problem is fusing independent concentrated Gaussian distributions defined at different reference points on the group. In this paper we approximate distributions at different points in the group in a single set of exponential coordinates and then use classical Gaussian fusion to obtain the fused posteriori in those coordinates. We consider several approximations including the exact Jacobian of the change of coordinate map, first and second order Taylor's expansions of the Jacobian, and parallel transport with and without curvature correction associated with the underlying geometry of the Lie group. Preliminary results on SO(3) demonstrate that a novel approximation using parallel transport with curvature correction achieves similar accuracy to the state-of-the-art optimisation based algorithms at a fraction of the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Inverse Unscented Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid advances in designing cognitive and counter-adversarial systems have motivated the development of inverse Bayesian filters. In this setting, a cognitive 'adversary' tracks its target of interest via a stochastic framework such as a Kalman filter (KF). The target or 'defender' then employs another inverse stochastic filter to infer the forward filter estimates of the defender computed by the adversary. For linear systems, the inverse Kalman filter (I-KF) has been recently shown to be effective in these counter-adversarial applications. In the paper, contrary to prior works, we focus on non-linear system dynamics and formulate the inverse unscented KF (I-UKF) to estimate the defender's state based on the unscented transform, or equivalently, statistical linearization technique. We then generalize this framework to unknown systems by proposing reproducing kernel Hilbert space-based UKF (RKHS-UKF) to learn the system dynamics and estimate the state based on its observations. Our theoretical analyses to guarantee the stochastic stability of I-UKF and RKHS-UKF in the mean-squared sense show that, provided the forward filters are stable, the inverse filters are also stable under mild system-level conditions. We show that, despite being a suboptimal filter, our proposed I-UKF is a conservative estimator, i.e., I-UKF's estimated error covariance upper-bounds its true value. Our numerical experiments for several different applications demonstrate the estimation performance of the proposed filters using recursive Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound and non-credibility index (NCI).</description>

      <title>Collaborative Safety-Critical Control for Networked Dynamic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As modern systems become ever more connected with complex dynamic coupling relationships, the development of safe control methods for such networked systems becomes paramount. In this paper, we define a general networked model with coupled dynamics and local control and discuss the relationship of node-level safety definitions for individual agents with local neighborhood dynamics. We define a node-level barrier function (NBF), node-level control barrier function (NCBF), and collaborative node-level barrier function (cNCBF) and provide conditions under which sets defined by these functions will be forward invariant. We use collaborative node-level barrier functions to construct a novel distributed algorithm for the safe control of collaborating network agents and provide conditions under which the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a viable set of safe control actions for all agents or a terminally infeasible state for at least one agent. We introduce the notion of non-compliance of network neighbors as a metric of robustness for collaborative safety for a given network state and chosen barrier function hyper-parameters. We illustrate these results on a networked susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model.</description>
