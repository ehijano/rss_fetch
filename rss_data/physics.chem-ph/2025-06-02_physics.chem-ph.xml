      <title>Bubble-Burst Synthesis of Ammonia, Amino Acids, and Urea Under Ambient, Catalyst-Free Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23850v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a catalyst-free, ambient-temperature method for synthesizing nitrogen-based compounds critical to fertilizer production, including ammonia, urea, ammonium salts, and amino acids. The process relies on bubble-burst-induced microenvironments, where gas bubbles undergo rapid growth and collapse, releasing intense localized energy sufficient to dissociate nitrogen and water molecules. These high-energy zones produce reactive species, including atomic hydrogen (H*) that facilitate nitrogen fixation and drive subsequent chemical transformations without needing catalysts or elevated conditions. Experimental validation using colorimetric assays, Raman spectroscopy, and microscopy confirms the in situ formation of ammonia and its downstream conversion into structurally relevant compounds, including peptide-like assemblies. The system supports reaction tuning through dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) or organic acids and can be enhanced by low-energy inputs such as UV or ultrasound. Its simplicity, modularity, and ability to operate without external infrastructure offer a practical and scalable platform for decentralized fertilizer generation and sustainable biochemical production.</description>

      <title>Simulation of pulsed dynamic nuclear polarization in the steady state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In pulsed dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), enhancement of the polarization of bulk nuclei requires the repeated application of a microwave pulse sequence. So far, analysis of a one-time transfer of electron spin polarization to a dipolar-coupled nuclear spin has guided the design of DNP pulse sequences. This has obvious shortcomings, such as an inability to predict the optimal repetition time. In an actual pulsed DNP experiment, a balance is reached between the polarization arriving from the unpaired electrons and nuclear relaxation. In this article, we explore three algorithms to compute this stroboscopic steady state: (1) explicit time evolution by propagator squaring, (2) generation of an effective propagator using the matrix logarithm, and (3) direct calculation of the steady state with the Newton-Raphson method. Algorithm (2) is numerically unstable for this purpose. Algorithm (1) and (3) are both stable; algorithm (3) is the most efficient. We compare the steady-state simulations to existing experimental results at 0.34 T and 1.2 T and to the first experimental observation of X-inverse-X (XiX) DNP at 3.4 T: agreement is good, and improves further when electron-proton distance and electron Rabi frequency distributions are accounted for. We demonstrate that the trajectory of the spin system during one-time application of a microwave pulse sequence differs from the steady orbit. This has implications for DNP pulse sequence design.</description>

      <title>PySEQM 2.0: Accelerated Semiempirical Excited State Calculations on Graphical Processing Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the implementation of electronic excited states for semi-empirical quantum chemical methods at the configuration interaction singles (CIS) and time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) level of theory in the PySEQM software. Built on PyTorch, this implementation leverages GPU acceleration to significantly speed up molecular property calculations. Benchmark tests demonstrate that our approach can compute excited states for molecules with nearly a thousand atoms in under a minute. Additionally, the implementation also includes a machine learning interface to enable parameters re-optimization and neural network training for future machine learning applications for excited state dynamics.</description>

      <title>Motility-dependent selective transport of active matter in trap arrays: Separation methods based on trapping-detrapping and deterministic lateral displacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selecting active matter based on its motility represents a challenging task, as it requires different approaches than common separation techniques intended for separation based on, e.g., size, shape, density, and flexibility. This motility-based selection is important for, e.g., selecting biological species, such as bacteria or highly motile sperm cells for medically assisted reproduction. Common separation techniques are not applicable for separating species based on motility as such species can have indistinguishable physical properties, i.e., size, shape, density, and differ only by their ability to execute self-propelled motion as, e.g., motile, and immotile sperm cells. Therefore, selecting active species based on motility requires completely different approaches. Some of these have been developed including sperm cell selection techniques, e.g., swim-up techniques, passive selection methods based on the ability of highly motile sperm cells to swim across streamlines, as well as more sophisticated techniques. Here we theoretically demonstrate via numerical simulations various efficient methods of selection and separation based on the motility of active species using arrays of traps. Two approaches are proposed: one allowed the selective escape of motile species from traps, and the other one relying on a deterministic lateral displacement (DLD)-type method. As a model system, we consider self-propelled Janus particles whose motility can be tuned. The resulted separation methods are applicable for separation of biological motile species, such as bacteria or sperm cells, as well as for Janus micro- and nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>FDTD with Auxiliary Bath Fields for Condensed-Phase Polaritonics: Fundamentals and Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding condensed-phase polariton experiments requires accurately accounting for both realistic cavity geometries and the interplay between polaritons and material dark modes arising from microscopic molecular interactions. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) approach numerically propagates classical Maxwell's equations in the time domain, offering a versatile scheme for modeling polaritons in realistic cavities. However, the simple dielectric functions routinely used in FDTD often fail to describe molecular details. Consequently, standard FDTD calculations, to date, cannot accurately describe processes involving the complex coupling between polaritons and dark modes, such as polariton relaxation, transport, and condensation. For more faithful simulations of the energy flow between the polaritons and dark modes, herein, local bath degrees of freedom coupled to the material polarization are explicitly included in FDTD to describe the dark-mode dynamics. This method -- FDTD with auxiliary bath fields (FDTD-Bath) -- is implemented in the open-source MEEP package by adding a Lorentz-Bath material susceptibility, where explicit bath modes are coupled to conventional Lorentz oscillators. With this Lorentz-Bath susceptibility, linear polariton spectra and Rabi-splitting-dependent polariton relaxation rates in planar Fabry--P\'erot cavities are reproduced more accurately than those with the conventional Lorentz susceptibility. Supported by a user-friendly Python interface and efficient MPI parallelism, the FDTD-Bath approach implemented in MEEP is ready to model a wide range of polariton phenomena involving realistic cavity geometries.</description>

      <title>Machine learning meets $\mathfrak{su}(n)$ Lie algebra: Enhancing quantum dynamics learning with exact trace conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising tool for simulating quantum dissipative dynamics. However, existing methods often struggle to enforce key physical constraints, such as trace conservation, when modeling reduced density matrices (RDMs). While Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) aim to address these challenges, they frequently fail to achieve full physical consistency. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages the $\mathfrak{su}(n)$ Lie algebra to represent RDMs as a combination of an identity matrix and $n^2 - 1$ Hermitian, traceless, and orthogonal basis operators,where $n$ is the system's dimension. By learning only the coefficients associated with this basis, our framework inherently ensures exact trace conservation, as the traceless nature of the basis restricts the trace contribution solely to the identity matrix. This eliminates the need for explicit trace-preserving penalty terms in the loss function, simplifying optimization and improving learning efficiency. We validate our approach on two benchmark quantum systems: the spin-boson model and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex. By comparing the performance of four neural network (NN) architectures -- Purely Data-driven Physics-Uninformed Neural Networks (PUNN), $\mathfrak{su}(n)$ Lie algebra-based PUNN ($\mathfrak{su}(n)$-PUNN), traditional PINN, and $\mathfrak{su}(n)$ Lie algebra-based PINN ($\mathfrak{su}(n)$-PINN) -- we highlight the limitations of conventional methods and demonstrate the superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of our approach in learning quantum dissipative dynamics.</description>

      <title>A theory for diffusion-controlled reactions within nonequilibrium steady states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study diffusion-controlled processes in nonequilibrium steady states, where standard rate theory assumptions break down. Using transition path theory, we generalize the relations between reactive probability fluxes and measures of the rate of the reaction. Stochastic thermodynamics analysis reveals how work constrains the enhancement of rates relative to their equilibrium values. An analytically solvable ion pairing model under a strong electric field illustrates and validates our approach and theory. These findings provide deeper insights into diffusion-controlled reaction dynamics beyond equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Challenges in the Theory and Atomistic Simulation of Metal Electrodeposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrodeposition is a fundamental process in electrochemistry, and has applications in numerous industries, such as corrosion protection, decorative finishing, energy storage, catalysis, and electronics. While there is a long history of using electrodeposition, its application for controlled nanostructure growth is limited. The establishment of an atomic-scale understanding of the electrodeposition process and dynamics is crucial to enable the controlled fabrication of metal nanoparticles and other nanostructures. Significant advancements in molecular simulation capabilities and the electronic structure theory of electrified solid-liquid interfaces bring theory closer to realistic applications, but a gap remains between realistic applications, theoretical understanding of dynamics, and atomistic simulation. In this review we briefly summarize the current state-of-the-art computational techniques available for the simulation of electrodeposition and electrochemical growth on surfaces, and identify the remaining open challenges.</description>

      <title>Classifying destructive quantum interference in molecular junctions: Towards molecular quantum rulers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Destructive quantum interference in molecular junctions might be used to build molecular quantum rulers, allowing to quantify changes in external control parameters electrically. For this reason, it is important to understand which patterns of destructive quantum interference can occur inside the electronic excitation gap of a molecule, coupled to conducting electrodes. By considering a four-level model, we show that much more complex destructive quantum interference behavior can arise than expected for just two levels. We classify the destructive quantum interferences analytically and show that they may even occur in regions forbidden by the standard orbital rule for electron transport. Our results suggest that appropriate molecular design may indeed allow to construct highly sensitive molecular quantum rulers.</description>

      <title>Modified Transfer Matrix Method for the Extraction of Material Properties via Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy is a powerful technique for extracting the low-frequency optical properties of materials. However, the optical constants are difficult to determine directly from the experimental transfer function, such that various numerical approximations must be implemented to describe specific conditions. Here, we introduce a modified Transfer Matrix Method that uses a genetic algorithm for optimization to determine the refractive index of materials in the THz regime. We show that this approach is generally applicable across a wide range of refractive indices, structures, and frequency ranges. Our method is intuitive and yields accurate results compared to leading methods across a wide spectral range (0.1 - 15 THz).</description>
