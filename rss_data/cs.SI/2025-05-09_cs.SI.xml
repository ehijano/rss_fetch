      <title>Community and hyperedge inference in multiple hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergraphs, capable of representing high-order interactions via hyperedges, have become a powerful tool for modeling real-world biological and social systems. Inherent relationships within these real-world systems, such as the encoding relationship between genes and their protein products, drive the establishment of interconnections between multiple hypergraphs. Here, we demonstrate how to utilize those interconnections between multiple hypergraphs to synthesize integrated information from multiple higher-order systems, thereby enhancing understanding of underlying structures. We propose a model based on the stochastic block model, which integrates information from multiple hypergraphs to reveal latent high-order structures. Real-world hyperedges exhibit preferential attachment, where certain nodes dominate hyperedge formation. To characterize this phenomenon, our model introduces hyperedge internal degree to quantify nodes' contributions to hyperedge formation. This model is capable of mining communities, predicting missing hyperedges of arbitrary sizes within hypergraphs, and inferring inter-hypergraph edges between hypergraphs. We apply our model to high-order datasets to evaluate its performance. Experimental results demonstrate strong performance of our model in community detection, hyperedge prediction, and inter-hypergraph edge prediction tasks. Moreover, we show that our model enables analysis of multiple hypergraphs of different types and supports the analysis of a single hypergraph in the absence of inter-hypergraph edges. Our work provides a practical and flexible tool for analyzing multiple hypergraphs, greatly advancing the understanding of the organization in real-world high-order systems.</description>

      <title>How Social is It? A Benchmark for LLMs' Capabilities in Multi-user Multi-turn Social Agent Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expanding the application of large language models (LLMs) to societal life, instead of primary function only as auxiliary assistants to communicate with only one person at a time, necessitates LLMs' capabilities to independently play roles in multi-user, multi-turn social agent tasks within complex social settings. However, currently the capability has not been systematically measured with available benchmarks. To address this gap, we first introduce an agent task leveling framework grounded in sociological principles. Concurrently, we propose a novel benchmark, How Social Is It (we call it HSII below), designed to assess LLM's social capabilities in comprehensive social agents tasks and benchmark representative models. HSII comprises four stages: format parsing, target selection, target switching conversation, and stable conversation, which collectively evaluate the communication and task completion capabilities of LLMs within realistic social interaction scenarios dataset, HSII-Dataset. The dataset is derived step by step from news dataset. We perform an ablation study by doing clustering to the dataset. Additionally, we investigate the impact of chain of thought (COT) method on enhancing LLMs' social performance. Since COT cost more computation, we further introduce a new statistical metric, COT-complexity, to quantify the efficiency of certain LLMs with COTs for specific social tasks and strike a better trade-off between measurement of correctness and efficiency. Various results of our experiments demonstrate that our benchmark is well-suited for evaluating social skills in LLMs.</description>

      <title>UKElectionNarratives: A Dataset of Misleading Narratives Surrounding Recent UK General Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Misleading narratives play a crucial role in shaping public opinion during elections, as they can influence how voters perceive candidates and political parties. This entails the need to detect these narratives accurately. To address this, we introduce the first taxonomy of common misleading narratives that circulated during recent elections in Europe. Based on this taxonomy, we construct and analyse UKElectionNarratives: the first dataset of human-annotated misleading narratives which circulated during the UK General Elections in 2019 and 2024. We also benchmark Pre-trained and Large Language Models (focusing on GPT-4o), studying their effectiveness in detecting election-related misleading narratives. Finally, we discuss potential use cases and make recommendations for future research directions using the proposed codebook and dataset.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Multipolar Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying and understanding social networks is crucial for accurately defining ideological polarization, since they enable precise modeling of social structures. One of the limitations of many methods for quantifying polarization on networks is the assumption of a two-dimensional opinion space. This prevents accurate study of multipolar systems like multi-party political systems, where modeling more than two opinion poles is beneficial. Here, I experimentally compare methods for quantifying multipolar polarization on a network and find that the average pairwise distance extension of generalized Euclidean distance conforms to several desired properties, showing its advantages over other methods. This allows the study of multipolar polarized systems based on an empirically and intuitively good metric.</description>

      <title>$k$-local Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2017 Day et al. introduced the notion of locality as a structural complexity-measure for patterns in the field of pattern matching established by Angluin in 1980. In 2019 Casel et al. showed that determining the locality of an arbitrary pattern is NP-complete. Inspired by hierarchical clustering, we extend the notion to coloured graphs, i.e., given a coloured graph determine an enumeration of the colours such that colouring the graph stepwise according to the enumeration leads to as few clusters as possible. Next to first theoretical results on graph classes, we propose a priority search algorithm to compute the $k$-locality of a graph. The algorithm is optimal in the number of marking prefix expansions, and is faster by orders of magnitude than an exhaustive search. Finally, we perform a case study on a DBLP subgraph to demonstrate the potential of $k$-locality for knowledge discovery.</description>

      <title>ValuesRAG: Enhancing Cultural Alignment Through Retrieval-Augmented Contextual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring cultural values alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, as these models often embed Western-centric biases from their training data, leading to misrepresentations and fairness concerns in cross-cultural applications. Existing approaches such as role assignment and few-shot learning struggle to address these limitations effectively due to their reliance on pre-trained knowledge, limited scalability, and inability to capture nuanced cultural values. To address these issues, we propose ValuesRAG, a novel and effective framework that applies Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with In-Context Learning (ICL) to integrate cultural and demographic knowledge dynamically during text generation. Leveraging the World Values Survey (WVS) dataset, ValuesRAG first generates summaries of values for each individual. We subsequently curate several representative regional datasets to serve as test datasets and retrieve relevant summaries of values based on demographic features, followed by a reranking step to select the top-k relevant summaries. We evaluate ValuesRAG using 6 diverse regional datasets and show that it consistently outperforms baselines: including zero-shot, role-assignment, few-shot, and hybrid methods, both in main experiments and ablation settings. Notably, ValuesRAG achieves the best overall performance over prior methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in fostering culturally aligned and inclusive AI systems. Our findings underscore the potential of dynamic retrieval-based methods to bridge the gap between global LLM capabilities and localized cultural values.</description>
