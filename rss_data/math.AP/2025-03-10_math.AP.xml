      <description>arXiv:2503.04917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stabilization problem on a manifold with boundary for a wave equation with measure-valued linear damping. For a wide class of measures, containing Dirac masses on hypersurfaces as well as measures with fractal support, we establish an abstract energy decay result.</description>

      <title>Vectorial Kato inequality for $p$-harmonic maps with optimal constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the sharp vectorial Kato inequality for $p$-harmonic mappings. Surprisingly, the optimal constant differs from the one obtained for scalar valued $p$-harmonic functions by Chang, Chen, and Wei. As an application we demonstrate how this inequality can be used in the study of regularity of $p$-harmonic maps. Furthermore, in the case of $p$-harmonic maps from $B^3$ to $\mathbb{S}^3$, we enhance the known range of $p$ values for which regularity is achieved. Specifically, we establish that for $p \in [2, 2.642]$, minimizing $p$-harmonic maps must be regular.</description>

      <title>On the continuous properties for the 3D incompressible rotating Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Cauchy problem for the 3D Euler equations with the Coriolis force in the whole space. We first establish the local-in-time existence and uniqueness of solution to this system in $B^s_{p,r}(\R^3)$. Then we prove that the Cauchy problem is ill-posed in two different sense: (1) the solution of this system is not uniformly continuous dependence on the initial data in the same Besov spaces, which extends the recent work of Himonas-Misio{\l}ek \cite[Comm. Math. Phys., 296, 2010]{HM1} to the general Besov spaces framework; (2) the solution of this system cannot be H\"{o}lder continuous in time variable in the same Besov spaces. In particular, the solution of the system is discontinuous in the weaker Besov spaces at time zero. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one addressing the issue on the failure of H\"{o}lder continuous in time of solution to the classical Euler equations with(out) the Coriolis force.</description>

      <title>Mixed norm estimates for dilated averages over planar curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the mixed norm estimates for the operator $ T $associated with a dilated plane curve $(ut, u\gamma(t))$, defined by \[ Tf(x, u) := \int_{0}^{1} f(x_1 - ut, x_2 - u\gamma(t)) \, dt, \] where $ x := (x_1, x_2) $ and $\gamma $ is a general plane curve satisfying appropriate smoothness and curvature conditions. Our results partially address a problem posed by Hickman [J. Funct. Anal. 2016] in the two-dimensional setting. More precisely, we establish the $ L_x^p(\mathbb{R}^2) \rightarrow L_x^q L_u^r(\mathbb{R}^2 \times [1, 2]) $ (space-time) estimates for $ T $, whenever $(\frac{1}{p},\frac{1}{q})$ satisfy \[ \max\left\{0, \frac{1}{2p} - \frac{1}{2r}, \frac{3}{p} - \frac{r+2}{r}\right\} &lt; \frac{1}{q} \leq \frac{1}{p} &lt; \frac{r+1}{2r} \] and $$1 + (1 + \omega)\left(\frac{1}{q} - \frac{1}{p}\right) &gt; 0,$$ where $ r \in [1, \infty] $ and $ \omega := \limsup_{t \rightarrow 0^+} \frac{\ln|\gamma(t)|}{\ln t} $. These results are sharp, except for certain borderline cases. Additionally, we examine the $ L_x^p(\mathbb{R}^2) \rightarrow L_u^r L_x^q(\mathbb{R}^2 \times [1, 2]) $ (time-space) estimates for $T $, which are especially almost sharp when $p=2$.</description>

      <title>Growth-fragmentation model for a population presenting heterogeneity in growth rate: Malthus parameter and long-time behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of the present paper is to explore the long-time behavior of the growth-fragmentation equation formulated in the case of equal mitosis and variability in growth rate, under fairly general assumptions on the coefficients. The first results concern the monotonicity of the Malthus parameter with respect to the coefficients. Existence of a solution to the associated eigenproblem is then stated in the case of a finite set of growth rates thanks to Kre\u{i}n-Rutman theorem and a series of estimates on moments. Afterwards, adapting the classical general relative entropy (GRE) method enables us to ensure uniqueness of the eigenelements and derive the long-time asymptotics of the Cauchy problem. We prove convergence towards the steady state including in the case of individual exponential growth known to exhibit oscillations at large times in absence of variability. A few numerical simulations are eventually performed in the case of linear growth rate to illustrate our monotonicity results and the fact that variability, providing enough mixing in the heterogeneous population, is sufficient to re-establish asynchronicity.</description>

      <title>Transmission problems and domain decompositions for non-autonomous parabolic equations on evolving domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parabolic equations on evolving domains model a multitude of applications including various industrial processes such as the molding of heated materials. Such equations are numerically challenging as they require large-scale computations and the usage of parallel hardware. Domain decomposition is a common choice of numerical method for stationary domains, as it gives rise to parallel discretizations. In this study, we introduce a variational framework that extends the use of such methods to evolving domains. In particular, we prove that transmission problems on evolving domains are well posed and equivalent to the corresponding parabolic problems. This in turn implies that the standard non-overlapping domain decompositions, including the Robin-Robin method, become well defined approximations. Furthermore, we prove the convergence of the Robin--Robin method. The framework is based on a generalization of fractional Sobolev-Bochner spaces on evolving domains, time-dependent Steklov-Poincar\'e operators, and elements of the approximation theory for monotone maps.</description>

      <title>On the $\mathcal R$-boundedness of solution operators for a compressible fluid model of Korteweg type in general domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a resolvent problem arising from the free boundary problem for the compressible fluid model of the Korteweg type, which is called the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system, with surface tension in general domains. The Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system describes the liquid-vapor two-phase flow with non-zero thickness phase boundaries, which is often called the diffuse interface model. Our purpose is to show the solution operator families of the resolvent problem are $\mathcal R$-bounded, which gives us the generation of analytic semigroup and the maximal regularity in the $L_p$-in-time and $L_q$-in-space setting by applying the Weis operator valued Fourier multiplier theorem.</description>

      <title>Decay of solutions of nonlinear Dirac equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of small and large solutions to a broad class of nonlinear Dirac-type equations. Our results are classified in 1D massless and massive cases, 3D general and $n$ dimensional in generality. In the 1D massless case we prove that any globally defined solution converges to zero as time tends to infinity, within a spatial region expanding at a rate proportional to $ t \log^{-2} t$. This result holds without assumptions on the smallness of initial data or specific power of nonlinearity, ruling out the existence of standing breather-like or solitary wave structures in this regime. In the 1D massive case, solitary waves are known to exist. Introducing new virial identities adapted to the Dirac's distinctive algebra, we prove that there are ``holomorphic'' odd nonlinearities under which globally defined small odd solutions decay to zero on spatial compact sets as time tends to infinity. This result is extended to the 3D case under boundedness of the $H^1$ norm but without requiring the parity condition on the data, giving decay proofs for an important class of nonlinear Dirac models, and opening the door to the future use of virial identities to prove asymptotic stability of well-chosen Dirac solitary waves.
  Finally, in higher dimensions $ n \geq 1$, we prove the $L^2$ decay for global solutions of nonlinear Dirac equations in the ``exterior light-cone'' region. This confirms the non-existence of breathers and other solutions propagating faster than the speed of light. Our proofs rely on carefully constructed weighted virial identities.</description>

      <title>Steady bubbles and drops in inviscid fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct steady non-spherical bubbles and drops, which are traveling wave solutions to the axisymmetric two-phase Euler equations with surface tension, whose inner phase is a bounded connected domain. The solutions have a uniform vorticity distribution in this inner phase and they have a vortex sheet on its surface.
  Our construction relies on a perturbative approach around an explicit spherical solution, given by Hill's vortex enclosed by a spherical vortex sheet. The construction is sensitive to the Weber numbers describing the flow. At critical Weber numbers, we perform a bifurcation analysis utilizing the Crandall-Rabinowitz theorem in Sobolev spaces on the 2-sphere. Away from these critical numbers, our construction relies on the implicit function theorem.
  Our results imply that the model containing surface tension is richer than the ordinary one-phase Euler equations, in the sense that for the latter, Hill's spherical vortex is unique (modulo translations) among all axisymmetric simply connected uniform vortices of a given circulation.</description>

      <title>First order non-instantaneous corrections in collisional kinetic alignment models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work the standard kinetic theory assumption of instantaneous collisions is lifted. As a continuation of a previous paper by Kanzler, Schmeiser, and Tora [KRM, 2024], a model for higher order non-instantaneous alignment collisions is presented and studied in the asymptotic regime of short collision duration. A first order accurate approximative model is derived as a correction to the instantaneous limit. Rigorous results on its well-posedness and on the instantaneous limit are proven. The approximative model is a system of two equations. The possibility of finding an equally accurate scalar approximation is discussed.</description>

      <title>Global dissipative solutions of the 3D Naiver-Stokes and MHD equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any divergence free initial data in $H^\frac12$, we prove the existence of infinitely many dissipative solutions to both the 3D Navier-Stokes and MHD equations, whose energy profiles are continuous and decreasing on $[0,\infty)$. If the initial data is only $L^2$, our construction yields infinitely many solutions with continuous energy, but not necessarily decreasing. Our theorem does not hold in the case of zero viscosity as this would violate the weak-strong uniqueness principle due to Lions. This was achieved by designing a convex integration scheme that takes advantage of the dissipative term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07175v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a survey on the use of Fourier transformation methods in the treatment of boundary problems for the fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^a$ (0&lt;a&lt;1), and pseudodifferential generalizations P, over a bounded open set $\Omega$ in $R^n$. The presentation starts at an elementary level. Two points are explained in detail: 1) How the factor $d^a$, with $d(x)=dist(x,d\Omega)$, comes into the picture, related to the fact that the precise solution spaces for the homogeneous Dirichlet problem are so-called a-transmission spaces. 2) The natural definition of a local nonhomogeneous Dirichlet condition $\gamma_0(u/d^{a-1})=\varphi$. We also give brief accounts of some further developments: Evolution problems (for $d_t u - r^+Pu = f(x,t)$) and resolvent problems (for $Pu-\lambda u=f$), also with nonzero boundary conditions. Integration by parts, Green's formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the long-time behavior of solutions with small initial data to the viscoelastic Klein-Gordon equation with general smooth nonlinearity. Our analysis relies on the space-time resonances method to eliminate all nonresonant quadratic and cubic terms. We identify a sign condition for the remaining critical resonant term to be of absorption type, leading to global-in-time existence and diffusive decay of solutions with small initial data. Even when this condition fails, our analysis shows existence and diffusive decay of small solutions on exponentially long time intervals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12058v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate nonexistence of nontrivial nonnegative solutions to a class of semilinear parabolic equations with a positive potential, posed on weighted graphs. Assuming an upper bound on the Laplacian of the distance and a suitable weighted space-time volume growth condition, we show that no global solutions exists. We also discuss the optimality of the hypotheses, thus recovering a critical exponent phenomenon of Fujita type.</description>

      <title>Stochastic solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Dirichlet problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a nonlinear Dirichlet problem on a bounded domain whose Hamiltonian is given by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman operator with merely continuous and bounded coefficients. The objective of this paper is to study the existence of viscosity solutions from a stochastic point of view. Using a relaxed control framework, we define a candidate for a viscosity solution. We prove that this stochastic solution satisfies viscosity sub- and supersolution properties and that its upper and lower envelopes are viscosity sub- and supersolutions, respectively. Moreover, we establish a strong Markov selection principle, which shows that the stochastic solution can be realized through a strong Markov family. Building on the selection principle, we investigate regularity properties of the stochastic solution. For certain elliptic cases, we show that the strong Markov selection is a strong Feller selection, which propagates continuity to the stochastic solution. By means of an example, we also discuss the necessity of certain ellipticity assumptions for the continuity of the stochastic solution.</description>

      <title>Partial regularity for variational integrals with Morrey-H\"older zero-order terms, and the limit exponent in Massari's regularity theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the partial $\mathrm{C}^{1,\alpha}$ regularity theory for minimizers of non-parametric integrals with emphasis on sharp dependence of the H\"older exponent $\alpha$ on structural assumptions for general zero-order terms. A particular case of our conclusions carries over to the parametric setting of Massari's regularity theorem for prescribed-mean-curvature hypersurfaces and there confirms optimal regularity up to the limit exponent.</description>

      <title>A few finite and infinite identities involving Pochhammer and $q$- Pochhammer symbols obtained via analytical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present several identities with a form of polynomials or rational functions that involve Pochhammer and q-Pochhammer symbols and q-binomials (i.e. Gauss polynomials). All these identities were obtained by some analytical methods based on infinite expansions of the ratio of densities in a Fourier series of polynomials orthogonal with respect to the density in the denominator. We want a unified approach to justify many known and unknown identities. The purpose of studying these identities is to simplify calculations occurring while dealing with Pochhammer and q-Pochhammer symbols. Additional possible applications of the results presented in the paper are applications within the Combinatorics and the transformation formulae of hypergeometric and basic hypergeometric functions.</description>

      <title>Scattering for defocusing cubic NLS under locally damped strong trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in the scattering problem for the cubic 3D nonlinear defocusing Schr\"odinger equation with variable coefficients. Previous scattering results for such problems address only the cases with constant coefficients or assume strong variants of the non-trapping condition, stating that all the trajectories of the Hamiltonian flow associated with the operator are escaping to infinity. In contrast, we consider the most general setting, where strong trapping, such as stable closed geodesics, may occur, but we introduce a compactly supported damping term localized in the trapping region, to explore how damping can mitigate the effects of trapping. In addition to the challenges posed by the trapped trajectories, notably the loss of smoothing and of scale-invariant Strichartz estimates, difficulties arise from the damping itself, particularly since the energy is not, a priori, bounded. For $H^{1+\epsilon}$ initial data -- chosen because the local-in-time theory is a priori no better than for 3D unbounded manifolds, where local well-posedness of strong $H^1$ solutions is unavailable -- we establish global existence and scattering in $H^{s}$ for any $0 \leq s &lt;1$ in positive times, the inability to reach $H^1$ being related to the loss of smoothing due to trapping.</description>

      <title>1D pressureless gas dynamics systems in a strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct explicit measure-valued solutions to the one-dimensional pressureless gas dynamics system in a strip-like domain by introducing a new boundary potential. The constructed solutions satisfy an entropy condition, and depending on the boundary data and the behavior of the potentials, mass accumulation can occur at the boundaries. The approach relies on a systematic treatment of boundary potentials and their interactions with the initial data, providing a more precise understanding of the formation and propagation of singularities in measure-valued solutions.</description>

      <title>Supersonic flow of Chaplygin gases past a conical body with diamond-cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mathematical aspects of supersonic flow of a Chaplygin gas past a conical body with diamond-shaped cross sections. The flow under consideration is governed by the three-dimensional steady compressible Euler equations. In conical coordinates, the problem can be reformulated as an oblique derivative problem for a nonlinear degenerate elliptic equation. By establishing a crucial Lipschitz estimate, we show that the equation is uniformly elliptic in any subdomain that is strictly away from the degenerate boundary. Using this property, we finally prove the unique existence of a solution to this problem via the method of continuity, provided that the apex angle of the conical body is less than a critical angle determined by the oncoming flow.</description>

      <title>Some properties of the principal Dirichlet eigenfunction via simple random walk and Brownian motion couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study a discrete and continuous version of the spectral Dirichlet problem in an open bounded connected set $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, in dimension $d\geq 2$. More precisely, we consider the simple random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ killed upon exiting the (large) bounded domain $\Omega_N = (N\Omega)\cap \mathbb{Z}^d$. We denote by $P_N$ the corresponding transition matrix and we study the properties of its ($L^2$-normalized) principal eigenvector $\phi_N$. With probabilistic arguments (namely gambler's ruin estimates and coupling techniques) and under mild assumptions on the domain, we are able to give regularity estimates on $\phi_N$ (namely on its $k$-th order differences), with a uniform control inside $\Omega_N$. The same holds true for the first eigenfunction $\varphi_1$ of the corresponding continuous spectral Dirichlet problem, this being related to a Brownian motion killed upon exiting $\Omega$. As corollaries, we derive the $L^2$ and uniform convergence of $\phi_N$ to $\varphi_1$ in Lipschitz bounded domains.</description>
