      <title>ZeroOS: A Universal Modular Library OS for zkVMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: zkVMs promise general-purpose verifiable computation through ISA-level compatibility with modern programs and toolchains. However, compatibility extends further than just the ISA; modern programs often cannot run or even compile without an operating system and libc. zkVMs attempt to address this by maintaining forks of language-specific runtimes and statically linking them into applications to create self-contained unikernels, but this ad-hoc approach leads to version hell and burdens verifiable applications (vApps) with an unnecessarily large trusted computing base. We solve this problem with ZeroOS, a modular library operating system (libOS) for vApp unikernels; vApp developers can use off-the-shelf toolchains to compile and link only the exact subset of the Linux ABI their vApp needs. Any zkVM team can easily leverage the ZeroOS ecosystem by writing a ZeroOS bootloader for their platform, resulting in a reduced maintainence burden and unifying the entire zkVM ecosystem with consolidated development and audit resources. ZeroOS is free and open-sourced at https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/ZeroOS.</description>

      <title>CARTOS: A Charging-Aware Real-Time Operating System for Intermittent Batteryless Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents CARTOS, a charging-aware real-time operating system designed to enhance the functionality of intermittently-powered batteryless devices (IPDs) for various Internet of Things (IoT) applications. While IPDs offer significant advantages such as extended lifespan and operability in extreme environments, they pose unique challenges, including the need to ensure forward progress of program execution amidst variable energy availability and maintaining reliable real-time time behavior during power disruptions. To address these challenges, CARTOS introduces a mixed-preemption scheduling model that classifies tasks into computational and peripheral tasks, and ensures their efficient and timely execution by adopting just-in-time checkpointing for divisible computation tasks and uninterrupted execution for indivisible peripheral tasks. CARTOS also supports processing chains of tasks with precedence constraints and adapts its scheduling in response to environmental changes to offer continuous execution under diverse conditions. CARTOS is implemented with new APIs and components added to FreeRTOS but is designed for portability to other embedded RTOSs. Through real hardware experiments and simulations, CARTOS exhibits superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that it can serve as a practical platform for developing resilient, real-time sensing applications on IPDs.</description>
