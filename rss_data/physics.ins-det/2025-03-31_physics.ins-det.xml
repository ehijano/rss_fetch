      <title>Impact of the circuit layout on the charge collection in a monolithic pixel sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CERN's strategic R&amp;D programme on technologies for future experiments recently started investigating the TPSCo 65nm ISC CMOS imaging process for monolithic active pixels sensors for application in high energy physics. In collaboration with the ALICE experiment and other institutes, several prototypes demonstrated excellent performance, qualifying the technology. The Hybrid-to-Monolithic (H2M), a new test-chip produced in the same process but with a larger pixel pitch than previous prototypes, exhibits an unexpected asymmetric efficiency pattern.
  This contribution describes a simulation procedure combining TCAD, Monte Carlo and circuit simulations to model and understand this effect. It proved able to reproduce measurement results and attribute the asymmetric efficiency drop to a slow charge collection due to low amplitude potential wells created by the circuitry layout and impacting efficiency via ballistic deficit.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ScIDEP Collaboration is constructing muon telescopes based on scintillator technology to investigate the internal structure of the Egyptian Pyramid of Khafre at Giza near Cairo using cosmic-ray muons. The collaboration aims to scan the pyramid from multiple viewpoints, both inside the King's burial chamber that is located centrally at the base of the pyramid, and outside of the pyramid, to potentially identify any new internal structures. An overview of the project is presented, including the development of the data-acquisition system, the simulation framework, and very first detector studies.</description>

      <title>Terahertz frequency-domain 4x4 Mueller matrix ellipsometer instrument designed for high-frequency magnetic resonance measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a Mueller matrix ellipsometer design using dual continuously rotating anisotropic meta wave plates which determines the full set of Mueller matrix elements in the terahertz spectral range. The instrument operates in the frequency domain and employs a frequency tunable, solid state synthesizer based, continuous wave terahertz source with sub-MHz bandwidth. The implemented source permits operation within 82-125 GHz and 170-250 GHz, without and with an additional frequency doubler, respectively. The terahertz transparent meta wave plates consist of 3D-printed polymer based columnar thin film structures with subwavelength dimensions. The rotating wave plates produce sufficient modulation of the Stokes vector components of transmitted terahertz light to use the wave plates in polarization state generator and polarization state detector devices. Fast terahertz light detection rate of a quasi optical solid state detector permits acquisition with few microsecond temporal resolution and electronic sweeping control of the source frequency. We develop a fast frequency sweeping scheme while continuously rotating the terahertz wave plates. Subsequent sorting of measured data permits measurements of Mueller matrix elements at hundreds of different wavelengths. The Mueller matrix elements are obtained by forward numerical reduction of the measured data using an algorithm developed by Ruder et al.[Opt. Lett. 45, 3541 (2020)]. The instrument is combined with a magnetocryostat capable of reaching magnetic field strengths at the sample position of -8 T...8 T and sample temperatures from 4 K...400 K. Hence, the instrument is suitable to measure the full Mueller matrix of samples with magnetic resonances as demonstrated recently by Rindert et al. [Phys. Rev. B 110, 054413 (2024)]. We discuss design, calibration, and example applications.</description>

      <title>Fast Magnetic Coil Controller for Cold Atom Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold atoms experiments employ magnetic fields, commonly generated by coils, as an essential tool to control and manipulate atomic samples. In these experiments, it is often necessary to rapidly switch the magnetic field between two values. However, typical power supplies have a limited switching time for the current flowing through the coil that is inversely proportional to the maximum voltage they can supply and directly proportional to the inductance of the coil. We present a control scheme implemented as an electronic circuit that overcomes this limitation, a faster control is achieved by momentarily applying an on-demand high voltage when the control signal variation surpasses the limits that the conventional power supply can follow, allowing a faster current flow into the magnetic coil. In our specific application, we show that with this control the coil current can follow control signals continuously from negative to positive and vice versa with a ~5 kHz bandwidth and a maximum switching speed of ~40 $\mu$s between -1A and 1 A even though the time constant of the coil is of ~2 ms. Improving by more than a factor of ten the bandwidth and making the switching speed 20 times faster than that of a typical power supply. By appropriately selecting the components of the circuit, the switching time and the bandwidth can be finely tuned to any desired value. Moreover, our scheme can be easily adapted to different applications within a wide range of inductive and power requirements.</description>

      <title>Depolarization studies on low-depolarizing Cu/Ti and Ni(Mo)/Ti neutron supermirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron supermirrors (SMs) are a crucial part of many scattering and particle physics experiments. So far, Ni(Mo)/Ti SMs have been used in experiments that require to transport a polarized neutron beam due to their lower saturation magnetization compared to Ni/Ti SMs. However, next generation $\beta$ decay experiments require SMs that depolarize below $10^{-4}$ per reflection to reach their targeted precision. The depolarization of a polarized neutron beam due to reflection from Ni(Mo)/Ti SMs has not yet been measured to that precision. Recently developed Cu/Ti SMs with a very low saturation magnetization compared to Ni(Mo)/Ti may serve as an alternative. In this paper, we test the performance of both mirrors. At a first stage, we present four-states polarized neutron reflectivity (PNR) curves of Ni(Mo) and Cu monolayers measured at the neutron reflectometer SuperADAM and perform a full polarization analysis, showing a difference between the magnetic scattering length density (mSLD) of both materials, with Cu having a lower mSLD than Ni(Mo). These results are corroborated with the full polarization analysis of four-states PNR curves of $m=2$ Ni(Mo)/Ti and Cu/Ti SMs. In a second stage, we measured the depolarization ($D$) that a polarized neutron beam suffers after reflection from the same Ni(Mo)/Ti and Cu/Ti SMs by using the Opaque Test Bench setup. We find upper limits for the depolarization of $D_\text{Cu/Ti(4N5)}&lt;7.6\times 10^{-5}$, $D_\text{Ni(Mo)/Ti}&lt;8.5\times 10^{-5}$, and $D_\text{Cu/Ti(2N6)}&lt;6.0\times 10^{-5}$ at the $1\sigma$ confidence level, where (4N5) corresponds to a Ti purity of $99.995\%$ and (2N6) to $99.6\%$. The uncertainties are statistical. These results show that all three SMs are suitable for being used in next generation $\beta$ decay experiments. We found no noticeable dependence of $D$ on the $q$ value or the magnetizing field, in which the samples were placed.</description>

      <title>Machine learning based parametrization of the resolution function for the first experimental area (EAR1) of the n_TOF facility at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses a challenge of parametrizing a resolution function of the neutron beam from the neutron time of flight facility n_TOF at CERN. A difficulty stems from a fact that a resolution function exhibits rather strong variations in shape, over approximately 10 orders of magnitude in neutron energy. In order to avoid a need for a manual identification of the appropriate analytical forms - hindering past attempts at its parametrization - we take advantage of the versatile machine learning techniques. In particular, we parametrize it by training a multilayer feedforward neural network, relying on a key idea that such networks act as the universal approximators. The proof of concept is presented for a resolution function for the first experimental area of the n_TOF facility, from the third phase of its operation. We propose an optimal network structure for a resolution function in question, which is also expected to be optimal or near-optimal for other experimental areas and for different phases of n_TOF operation. In order to reconstruct several resolution function forms in common use from a single parametrized form, we provide a practical tool in the form of a specialized C++ class encapsulating the computationally efficient procedures suited to the task. Specifically, the class allows an application of a user-specified temporal spread of a primary proton beam (from a neutron production process at n_TOF) to a desired resolution function form.</description>

      <title>High-resolution cryoEM structure determination of soluble proteins after soft-landing ESIBD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft-landing electrospray ion beam deposition (ESIBD), i.e. the chemically selective, intact deposition of large and complex molecules on surfaces in vacuum, is a well-established sample preparation method for scanning probe microscopy (SPM), where it facilitates the high-resolution imaging of large and complex molecules. Inherited from mass spectrometry, the advantageous properties of ESIBD, chemical purity and selectivity, as well as precise control over the sample environment in vacuum, are also desirable in combination with other analytical methods. Therefore, recently ESIBD has been pursued for the fabrication of samples for electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) with proteins introduced into the gas phase via native electrospray ionisation (native ESIBD). However, the general applicability of this approach and the optimal conditions for an ESIBD-based cryoEM workflow remain unclear. Here, we present instrumentation and methods for a dedicated ESIBD+cryoEM workflow, based on precise control over deposition conditions and sample environment. We establish optimal conditions for gentle deposition of the proteins, for growing homogeneous, ultra-thin, amorphous ice, and for avoiding contamination, which allows for atomic-resolution cryoEM imaging of multiple protein systems. Our results confirm the retention of the protein's native secondary structure and general shape. ESIBD+cryoEM directly links native MS chemical insights with cryoEM's structural precision, offering a versatile platform for structural biology applications.</description>

      <title>Charged Lepton Flavour Violations searches with muons: present and future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charged-lepton flavor violation (cLFV) is one of the most powerful probes for New Physics (NP). Since lepton flavor conservation is an accidental symmetry in the Standard Model (SM), it is naturally violated in many NP models, with contributions at the level of the current experimental sensitivities. Moreover, the negligible SM contributions would make the observation of cLFV unambiguous evidence of NP. It makes these searches extremely sensitive and, at the same time, extremely pure. Thanks to the intense muon beams currently available, their intriguing upgrade programs, and the progress in the detection techniques, cLFV muon processes are the golden channels in this field. Experimental programs to search for $\mu^+ \to e^+ \gamma$, $\mu^+ \to e^+ e^+ e^-$ and the $\mu \to e$ conversion in the nuclear field are currently ongoing. We review the current status and the strategic plans for future searches. This document is an update of the prior cLFV submission to the 2018 European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP); the earlier submission should be consulted for more experimental details.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs) are widely used in particle physics experiments. They use light and charge released in events to reconstruct and analyze them. Light information collected by the Photon Detection System (PDS) is used mainly to determine the initial time stamp, $t_0$, and to support determining the total energy of the event. For these purposes, it is important to simulate and predict the propagation of light inside the detector. There are several approaches to this, and this work discusses some of the options.</description>

      <title>A Demonstration of Slowed Electron ${\bf E} \times {\bf B}$ Drift for PTOLEMY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10025v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The novel transverse electromagnetic filtering system proposed by the PTOLEMY collaboration necessitates the precise control of $\beta$-decay electron motion via ${\bf E} \times {\bf B}$ drift. In particular, drift speed must be slowed substantially to contain electrons within the radio-frequency antenna region and accurately tune voltage potentials within the filter. This paper presents the experimental design to vary ${\bf E} \times {\bf B}$ drift speed of carbon-14 $\beta$-decay electrons using a custom electrode field cage situated between the pole faces of an electromagnet. Matching our results with high-fidelity simulation, we deduce a capacity to increase particle time of flight by a factor of 5 in the field cage's slow drift region. Limited only by the dimensions of our system, we assert drift speed can be arbitrarily slowed to meet the needs of PTOLEMY's future detector.</description>

      <title>High efficiency veto hadron calorimeter in the NA64 experiment at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: NA64 is a fixed-target experiment at the CERN SPS designed to search for Light particle Dark Matter (LDM) candidates with masses in the sub-GeV range. During the 2016-2022 runs, the experiment obtained the world-leading constraints, leaving however part of the well-motivated region of parameter space suggested by benchmark LDM models still unexplored. To further improve sensitivity, as part of the upgrades to the setup of NA64 at the CERN SPS H4 beamline, a prototype veto hadron calorimeter (VHCAL) was installed in the downstream region of the experiment during the 2023 run. The VHCAL, made of Cu-Sc layers, was expected to be an efficient veto against upstream electroproduction of large-angle hadrons or photon-nuclear interactions, reducing the background from secondary particles escaping the detector acceptance. With the collected statistics of $4.4\times10^{11}$ electrons on target (EOT), we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by rejecting this background by more than an order of magnitude. This result provides an essential input for designing a full-scale optimized VHCAL to continue running background-free during LHC Run 4, when we expect to collect $10^{13}$ EOT. Furthermore, this technique combined with improvements in the analysis enables us to decrease our missing energy threshold from 50 GeV to 40 GeV thereby enhancing the signal sensitivity of NA64.</description>
