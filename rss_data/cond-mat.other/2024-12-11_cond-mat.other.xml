      <title>Deterministic Storage of Quantum Information in the Genetic Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DNA has been proposed as a chemical platform for computing and data storage, paving the way for building DNA-based computers. Recently, DNA has been hypothesized as an ideal quantum computer with the base pairs working as Josephson junctions. There are still major challenges to be overcome in these directions, but they do not prevent deviceful perspectives of the main problem. The present paper explores DNA base pairs as elementary units for a scalable nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computer (NMRQC). First, it presents an overview of the proton transfer (PT) mechanism during the prototropic tautomerism in the base pairs, scoring the current stage. Second, as a proof-of-principle, the paper examines these molecular structures as quantum processing units (QPUs) of a biochemical quantum device. For the model proposed here, it is theoretically demonstrated that the nuclear spins involved in the PT of base pairs can be deterministically prepared in a superposition of triplet states. Under appropriate conditions, the proton dynamics provides the minimal two-qubit entanglement required for quantum computing. The dynamics between the canonical and tautomeric quantum states (CQS and TQS, respectively) is determined from a thermally dependent Watson-Crick quantum superposition (WCQS); i.e., |WCQS&gt; = a(T)|CQS&gt; + b(T)|TQS&gt; with |a(T)|^2 + |b(T)|^2 = 1. If the DNA structure is sufficiently protected to avoid environment-induced decoherence of the confined-proton quantum states, quantum information can be successfully encoded in several base pairs along the coiled double strand. As a potential applicability, a crystalline DNA device could be employed for quantum computing and cryptography controlled by a sequence of Ramsey pulses. Finally, this study critically evaluates these possibilities toward a proof-of-concept of a DNA-based quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Quasi-universal behaviour of shear relaxation times in simple fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the shear relaxation times in four important simple monatomic model fluids: Lennard-Jones, Yukawa, soft-sphere and hard-sphere fluids. It is observed that in properly reduced units, the shear relaxation times exhibit quasi-universal behaviour when the density increases from the gas-like low values to the high-density regime near crystallization. They first decrease with density at low densities, reach minima at moderate densities, and then increase toward the freezing point. The reduced relaxation times at the minima and at the fluid-solid phase transition are all comparable for the various systems investigated, despite more than ten orders of magnitude difference in real systems. Important implications of these results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Parametric tuning of quantum phase transitions in ultracold reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in atomic physics have led to the possibility of a coherent transformation between ultra-cold atoms and molecules including between completely bosonic condensates. Such transformations are enabled by the magneto-association of atoms at a Feshbach resonance which results in a passage through a quantum critical point. In this study, we show that the presence of generic interaction between the constituent atoms and molecules can fundamentally alter the nature of the critical point, change the yield of the reaction and the order of the consequent phase transition. We find that the correlations introduced by this interaction induce nontrivial many-body physics such as coherent oscillations between atoms and molecules, and a selective formation of squeezed molecular quantum states and quantum cat states. We provide analytical and numerical descriptions of these effects, along with scaling laws for the reaction yield in non-adiabatic regimes.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen Diffusion in Magnesium Using Machine Learning Potentials: a comparative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and accurately predicting hydrogen diffusion in materials is challenging due to the complex interactions between hydrogen defects and the crystal lattice. These interactions span large length and time scales, making them difficult to address with standard ab initio techniques. This work addresses this challenge by employing accelerated machine learning (ML) molecular dynamics simulations through active learning. We conduct a comparative study of different ML-based interatomic potential schemes, including VASP, MACE, and CHGNet, utilizing various training strategies such as on-the-fly learning, pre-trained universal models, and fine-tuning.By considering different temperatures and concentration regimes, we obtain hydrogen diffusion coefficients and activation energy values which align remarkably well with experimental results, underlining the efficacy and accuracy of ML-assisted methodologies in the context of diffusive dynamics. Particularly, our procedure significantly reduces the computational effort associated with traditional transition state calculations or ad-hoc designed interatomic potentials. The results highlight the limitations of pre-trained universal solutions for defective materials and how they can be improved by fine-tuning. Specifically, fine-tuning the models on a database produced during on-the-fly training of VASP ML force-field allows the retrieving of DFT-level accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the confinement string in (2 + 1)-dimensional Quantum Electrodynamics with a trapped-ion quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compact lattice Quantum Electrodynamics is a complex quantum field theory with dynamical gauge and matter fields and it has similarities with Quantum Chromodynamics, in particular asymptotic freedom and confinement. We consider a (2+1)-dimensional lattice discretization of Quantum Electrodynamics with the inclusion of dynamical fermionic matter. We define a suitable quantum algorithm to measure the static potential as a function of the distance between two charges on the lattice and we use a variational quantum calculation to explore the Coulomb, confinement and string breaking regimes. A symmetry-preserving and resource-efficient variational quantum circuit is employed to prepare the ground state of the theory at various values of the coupling constant, corresponding to different physical distances, allowing the accurate extraction of the static potential from a quantum computer. We demonstrate that results from quantum experiments on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion device and emulator, with full connectivity between qubits, agree with classical noiseless simulations using circuits with 10 and 24 qubits. Moreover, we visualize the electric field flux configurations that mostly contribute in the wave-function of the quantum ground state in the different regimes of the potential, thus giving insights into the mechanisms of confinement and string breaking. These results are a promising step forward in the grand challenge of solving higher dimensional lattice gauge theory problems with quantum computing algorithms.</description>
