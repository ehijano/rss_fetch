      <title>Structural Morphing Metasurface for Electromagnetic Beam Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a novel concept of a 3D structural metasurface with mechanically morphing capability that can be used as a transmit- or reflect-array to manipulate electromagnetic beams for applications in RF sensing and communications for both space and ground stations. They can be controlled using low-power actuators to deform the surface profile which is then utilised as a lens or a reflector for beamforming and steering. The proposed simulated structural metasurfaces can be used for either beam-steering or to generate bespoke contour beams for satellite communication and sensing.</description>

      <title>Straight outta photosphere: Open solar flux without coronal modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The open solar flux, that is, the total magnetic flux escaping the Sun, is one of the most important parameters connecting solar activity to the Earth. The open solar flux is commonly estimated from photospheric magnetic field measurements by making model assumptions about the solar corona. However, the question in which way the open solar flux is directly related to the distribution of the photospheric magnetic field is still partly unknown. We aim to reconstruct the open solar flux directly from the photospheric magnetic fields without making any assumptions about the corona and without using coronal hole observations, for instance. We modified an earlier vector sum method by taking magnetic field polarities into account and applied the method to the synoptic magnetograms of six instruments to determine the open solar flux from solar cycles 21-24. Results. The modified vector sum method produces a vector of the global solar magnetic field whose magnitude closely matches the open solar flux from the potential field source surface (PFSS) model both by the absolute scale and the overall time evolution for each of the six magnetograms. The latitude of this vector follows the Hale cycle by always pointing toward the dominantly positive-polarity hemisphere, and its longitude coincides with the location of the main coronal holes of the McIntosh Archive. We find multi-year periods during which the longitude of the vector slowly drifts or stays rather stationary in the Carrington frame. These periods are punctuated by times when the longitude moves rapidly in the Carrington frame. By comparing the magnitude of this vector to the open solar flux calculated from the PFSS model with different source surface heights, we find that the best match is produced with a source surface height $R_{ss} = 2.4 - 2.5R_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Calculation for Two-Stream Instability and Advection Test of Vlasov-Maxwell Equations: Numerical Evaluation of Hamiltonian Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vlasov-Maxwell equations provide kinetic simulations of collisionless plasmas, but numerically solving them on classical computers is often impractical. This is due to the computational resource constraints imposed by the time evolution in the 6-dimensional phase space, which requires broad spatial and temporal scales. In this study, we develop a quantum-classical hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell solver. Specifically, the Vlasov solver implements the Hamiltonian simulation based on Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT), coupled with a classical Maxwell solver. We perform numerical simulation of a 1D advection test and a 1D1V two-stream instability test on the Qiskit-Aer-GPU quantum circuit emulator with an A100 GPU. The computational complexity of our quantum algorithm can potentially be reduced from the classical $O(N^6T^2)$ to $O(\text{poly}(\log(N),N,T))$ for the $N$ grid system and simulation time $T$. Furthermore, the numerical analysis reveals that our quantum algorithm is robust under larger time steps compared with classical algorithms with the constraint of Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition.</description>
