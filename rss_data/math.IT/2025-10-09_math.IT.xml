      <title>A doubly composite Chernoff-Stein lemma and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a sequence of random variables $X^n=X_1,\ldots, X_n$, discriminating between two hypotheses on the underlying probability distribution is a key task in statistics and information theory. Of interest here is the Stein exponent, i.e. the largest rate of decay (in $n$) of the type II error probability for a vanishingly small type I error probability. When the hypotheses are simple and i.i.d., the Chernoff-Stein lemma states that this is given by the relative entropy between the single-copy probability distributions. Generalisations of this result exist in the case of composite hypotheses, but mostly to settings where the probability distribution of $X^n$ is not genuinely correlated, but rather, e.g., a convex combination of product distributions with components taken from a base set. Here, we establish a general Chernoff-Stein lemma that applies to the setting where both hypotheses are composite and genuinely correlated, satisfying only generic assumptions such as convexity (on both hypotheses) and some weak form of permutational symmetry (on either hypothesis). Our result, which strictly subsumes most prior work, is proved using a refinement of the blurring technique developed in the context of the generalised quantum Stein's lemma [Lami, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2025]. In this refined form, blurring is applied symbol by symbol, which makes it both stronger and applicable also in the absence of permutational symmetry. The second part of the work is devoted to applications: we provide a single-letter formula for the Stein exponent characterising the discrimination of broad families of null hypotheses vs a composite i.i.d. or an arbitrarily varying alternative hypothesis, and establish a 'constrained de Finetti reduction' statement that covers a wide family of convex constraints. Applications to quantum hypothesis testing are explored in a related paper [Lami, arXiv:today].</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-leakage Interpretation of R\'{e}nyi Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $\tilde{f}(t) = \exp(\frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha}t)$, this paper shows that the Sibson mutual information is an $\alpha$-leakage averaged over the adversary's $\tilde{f}$-mean relative information gain (on the secret) at elementary event of channel output $Y$ as well as the joint occurrence of elementary channel input $X$ and output $Y$. This interpretation is used to derive a sufficient condition that achieves a $\delta$-approximation of $\epsilon$-upper bounded $\alpha$-leakage. A $Y$-elementary $\alpha$-leakage is proposed, extending the existing pointwise maximal leakage to the overall R\'{e}nyi order range $\alpha \in [0,\infty)$. Maximizing this $Y$-elementary leakage over all attributes $U$ of channel input $X$ gives the R\'{e}nyi divergence. Further, the R\'{e}nyi capacity is interpreted as the maximal $\tilde{f}$-mean information leakage over both the adversary's malicious inference decision and the channel input $X$ (represents the adversary's prior belief). This suggests an alternating max-max implementation of the existing generalized Blahut-Arimoto method.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Fronthaul Quantization for Flexible User Load in Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the physical layer (PHY) spectral efficiency and fronthaul network load of a scalable user-centric cell-free massive MIMO system. Each user-centric cluster processor responsible for cluster-level signal processing is located at one of multiple decentralized units (DUs). Thus, the radio units in the cluster must exchange data with the corresponding DU over the fronthaul. Because the fronthaul links have limited capacity, this data must be quantized before it is sent over the fronthaul. We consider a routed fronthaul network, where the cluster processor placement and fronthaul traffic routing are jointly optimized with a mixed-integer linear program. For different numbers of users in the network, we investigate the effect of fronthaul quantization rates, a system parameter computed based on rate-distortion theory. Our results show that with optimized quantization rates, the fronthaul load is quite stable for a wide range of user loads without significant PHY performance loss. This demonstrates that the cell-free massive MIMO PHY and fronthaul network are resilient to varying user densities.</description>

      <title>Multi-hop Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding with Deep Hash Distillation for Semantically Aligned Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider image transmission via deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) over multi-hop additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels by training a DeepJSCC encoder-decoder pair with a pre-trained deep hash distillation (DHD) module to semantically cluster images, facilitating security-oriented applications through enhanced semantic consistency and improving the perceptual reconstruction quality. We train the DeepJSCC module to both reduce mean square error (MSE) and minimize cosine distance between DHD hashes of source and reconstructed images. Significantly improved perceptual quality as a result of semantic alignment is illustrated for different multi-hop settings, for which classical DeepJSCC may suffer from noise accumulation, measured by the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) metric.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Geometric Analysis on Multi-cell Pinching-antenna Systems under Blockage Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the study on pinching-antenna technique has attracted significant attention. However, most relevant literature focuses on a single-cell scenario, where the effect from the interfering pinching-antennas on waveguides connected to spatially distributed base stations (BSs) was ignored. To fulfill this knowledge gap, this letter aims to provide an analytical framework on performance evaluation for multi-cell pinching-antenna systems where spatially distributed waveguides which are connected to different BSs are considered. In particular, tools from stochastic geometry is applied for system modeling. The expression for the outage probability is obtained. Simulation results are provided to verify the accuracy of the analysis and demonstrate the superior performance of pinching-antenna system compared to fixed-antenna systems.</description>

      <title>Lossless Compression of Time Series Data: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our increasingly digital and connected world has led to the generation of unprecedented amounts of data. This data must be efficiently managed, transmitted, and stored to preserve resources and allow scalability. Data compression has therein been a key technology for a long time, resulting in a vast landscape of available techniques. This largest-to-date study analyzes and compares various lossless data compression methods for time series data. We present a unified framework encompassing two stages: data transformation and entropy encoding. We evaluate compression algorithms across both synthetic and real-world datasets with varying characteristics. Through ablation studies at each compression stage, we isolate the impact of individual components on overall compression performance -- revealing the strengths and weaknesses of different algorithms when facing diverse time series properties. Our study underscores the importance of well-configured and complete compression pipelines beyond individual components or algorithms; it offers a comprehensive guide for selecting and composing the most appropriate compression algorithms tailored to specific datasets.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Covariance Estimators with Application in Activity Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07044v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first part of this work considers a general class of covariance estimators. Each estimator of that class is generated by a real-valued function $g$ and a set of model covariance matrices $H$. If $\bf{W}$ is a potentially perturbed observation of a searched covariance matrix, then the estimator is the minimizer of the sum of $g$ applied to each eigenvalue of $\bf{W}^\frac{1}{2}\bf{Z}^{-1}\bf{W}^\frac{1}{2}$ under the constraint that $\bf{Z}$ is from $H$. It is shown that under mild conditions on $g$ and $H$ such estimators are robust, meaning the estimation error can be made arbitrarily small if the perturbation of $\bf{W}$ gets small enough. \par In the second part of this work the previous results are applied to activity detection in random access with multiple receive antennas. In activity detection recovering the large scale fading coefficients is a sparse recovery problem which can be reduced to a structured covariance estimation problem. The recovery can be done with a non-negative least squares estimator or with a relaxed maximum likelihood estimator. It is shown that under suitable assumptions on the distributions of the noise and the channel coefficients, the relaxed maximum likelihood estimator is from the general class of covariance estimators considered in the first part of this work. Then, codebooks based upon a signed kernel condition are proposed. It is shown that with the proposed codebooks both estimators can recover the large-scale fading coefficients if the number of receive antennas is high enough and $S\leq\left\lceil\frac{1}{2}M^2\right\rceil-1$ where $S$ is the number of active users and $M$ is number of pilot symbols per user.</description>

      <title>A Theoretically-Grounded Codebook for Digital Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of a learnable codebook provides an efficient way for semantic communications to map vector-based high-dimensional semantic features onto discrete symbol representations required in digital communication systems. In this paper, the problem of codebook-enabled quantization mapping for digital semantic communications is studied from the perspective of information theory. Particularly, a novel theoretically-grounded codebook design is proposed for jointly optimizing quantization efficiency, transmission efficiency, and robust performance. First, a formal equivalence is established between the one-to-many synonymous mapping defined in semantic information theory and the many-to-one quantization mapping based on the codebook's Voronoi partitions. Then, the mutual information between semantic features and their quantized indices is derived in order to maximize semantic information carried by discrete indices. To realize the semantic maximum in practice, an entropy-regularized quantization loss based on empirical estimation is introduced for end-to-end codebook training. Next, the physical channel-induced semantic distortion and the optimal codebook size for semantic communications are characterized under bit-flip errors and semantic distortion. To mitigate the semantic distortion caused by physical channel noise, a novel channel-aware semantic distortion loss is proposed. Simulation results on image reconstruction tasks demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed theoretically-grounded codebook that achieves a 24.1% improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and a 46.5% improvement in learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) compared to the existing codebook designs when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 10 dB.</description>

      <title>Spectral Graph Clustering under Differential Privacy: Balancing Privacy, Accuracy, and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of spectral graph clustering under edge differential privacy (DP). Specifically, we develop three mechanisms: (i) graph perturbation via randomized edge flipping combined with adjacency matrix shuffling, which enforces edge privacy while preserving key spectral properties of the graph. Importantly, shuffling considerably amplifies the guarantees: whereas flipping edges with a fixed probability alone provides only a constant epsilon edge DP guarantee as the number of nodes grows, the shuffled mechanism achieves (epsilon, delta) edge DP with parameters that tend to zero as the number of nodes increase; (ii) private graph projection with additive Gaussian noise in a lower-dimensional space to reduce dimensionality and computational complexity; and (iii) a noisy power iteration method that distributes Gaussian noise across iterations to ensure edge DP while maintaining convergence. Our analysis provides rigorous privacy guarantees and a precise characterization of the misclassification error rate. Experiments on synthetic and real-world networks validate our theoretical analysis and illustrate the practical privacy-utility trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Toward Uncertainty-Aware and Generalizable Neural Decoding for Quantum LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for scalable quantum computing, yet decoding errors via conventional algorithms result in limited accuracy (i.e., suppression of logical errors) and high overheads, both of which can be alleviated by inference-based decoders. To date, such machine-learning (ML) decoders lack two key properties crucial for practical fault tolerance: reliable uncertainty quantification and robust generalization to previously unseen codes. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{QuBA}, a Bayesian graph neural decoder that integrates attention to both dot-product and multi-head, enabling expressive error-pattern recognition alongside calibrated uncertainty estimates. Building on QuBA, we further develop \textbf{SAGU }\textbf{(Sequential Aggregate Generalization under Uncertainty)}, a multi-code training framework with enhanced cross-domain robustness enabling decoding beyond the training set. Experiments on bivariate bicycle (BB) codes and their coprime variants demonstrate that (i) both QuBA and SAGU consistently outperform the classical baseline belief propagation (BP), achieving a reduction of on average \emph{one order of magnitude} in logical error rate (LER), and up to \emph{two orders of magnitude} under confident-decision bounds on the coprime BB code $[[154, 6, 16]]$; (ii) QuBA also surpasses state-of-the-art neural decoders, providing an advantage of roughly \emph{one order of magnitude} (e.g., for the larger BB code $[[756, 16, \leq34]]$) even when considering conservative (safe) decision bounds; (iii) SAGU achieves decoding performance comparable to or even outperforming QuBA's domain-specific training approach.</description>

      <title>Generalised quantum Sanov theorem revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two families of quantum states $A$ and $B$, called the null and the alternative hypotheses, quantum hypothesis testing is the task of determining whether an unknown quantum state belongs to $A$ or $B$. Mistaking $A$ for $B$ is a type I error, and vice versa for the type II error. In quantum Shannon theory, a fundamental role is played by the Stein exponent, i.e. the asymptotic rate of decay of the type II error probability for a given threshold on the type I error probability. Stein exponents have been thoroughly investigated -- and, sometimes, calculated. However, most currently available solutions apply to settings where the hypotheses simple (i.e. composed of a single state), or else the families $A$ and $B$ need to satisfy stringent constraints that exclude physically important sets of states, such as separable states or stabiliser states. In this work, we establish a general formula for the Stein exponent where both hypotheses are allowed to be composite: the alternative hypothesis $B$ is assumed to be either composite i.i.d. or arbitrarily varying, with components taken from a known base set, while the null hypothesis $A$ is fully general, and required to satisfy only weak compatibility assumptions that are met in most physically relevant cases -- for instance, by the sets of separable or stabiliser states. Our result extends and subsumes the findings of [BBH, CMP 385:55, 2021] (that we also simplify), as well as the 'generalised quantum Sanov theorem' of [LBR, arXiv:2408.07067]. The proof relies on a careful quantum-to-classical reduction via measurements, followed by an application of the results on classical Stein exponents obtained in [Lami, arXiv:today]. We also devise new purely quantum techniques to analyse the resulting asymptotic expressions.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Label Noise on the Information Content of Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In supervised classification tasks, models are trained to predict a label for each data point. In real-world datasets, these labels are often noisy due to annotation errors. While the impact of label noise on the performance of deep learning models has been widely studied, its effects on the networks' hidden representations remain poorly understood. We address this gap by systematically comparing hidden representations using the Information Imbalance, a computationally efficient proxy of conditional mutual information. Through this analysis, we observe that the information content of the hidden representations follows a double descent as a function of the number of network parameters, akin to the behavior of the test error. We further demonstrate that in the underparameterized regime, representations learned with noisy labels are more informative than those learned with clean labels, while in the overparameterized regime, these representations are equally informative. Our results indicate that the representations of overparameterized networks are robust to label noise. We also found that the information imbalance between the penultimate and pre-softmax layers decreases with cross-entropy loss in the overparameterized regime. This offers a new perspective on understanding generalization in classification tasks. Extending our analysis to representations learned from random labels, we show that these perform worse than random features. This indicates that training on random labels drives networks much beyond lazy learning, as weights adapt to encode labels information.</description>

      <title>SDQM: Synthetic Data Quality Metric for Object Detection Dataset Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of machine learning models depends heavily on training data. The scarcity of large-scale, well-annotated datasets poses significant challenges in creating robust models. To address this, synthetic data generated through simulations and generative models has emerged as a promising solution, enhancing dataset diversity and improving the performance, reliability, and resilience of models. However, evaluating the quality of this generated data requires an effective metric. This paper introduces the Synthetic Dataset Quality Metric (SDQM) to assess data quality for object detection tasks without requiring model training to converge. This metric enables more efficient generation and selection of synthetic datasets, addressing a key challenge in resource-constrained object detection tasks. In our experiments, SDQM demonstrated a strong correlation with the mean Average Precision (mAP) scores of YOLOv11, a leading object detection model, while previous metrics only exhibited moderate or weak correlations. Additionally, it provides actionable insights for improving dataset quality, minimizing the need for costly iterative training. This scalable and efficient metric sets a new standard for evaluating synthetic data. The code for SDQM is available at https://github.com/ayushzenith/SDQM</description>

      <title>Utilizing Information Theoretic Approach to Study Cochlear Neural Degeneration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hidden hearing loss, or cochlear neural degeneration (CND), disrupts suprathreshold auditory coding without affecting clinical thresholds, making it difficult to diagnose. We present an information-theoretic framework to evaluate speech stimuli that maximally reveal CND by quantifying mutual information (MI) loss between inner hair cell (IHC) receptor potentials and auditory nerve fiber (ANF) responses and acoustic input and ANF responses. Using a phenomenological auditory model, we simulated responses to 50 CVC words under clean, time-compressed, reverberant, and combined conditions across different presentation levels, with systematically varied survival of low-, medium-, and high-spontaneous-rate fibers. MI was computed channel-wise between IHC and ANF responses and integrated across characteristic frequencies. Information loss was defined relative to a normal-hearing baseline. Results demonstrate progressive MI loss with increasing CND, most pronounced for time-compressed speech, while reverberation produced comparatively smaller effects. These findings identify rapid, temporally dense speech as optimal probes for CND, informing the design of objective clinical diagnostics while revealing problems associated with reverberation as a probe.</description>

      <title>On Convex Functions of Gaussian Variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a convexity properties for normalized log moment generating function continuing a recent investigation of Chen of convex images of Gaussians. We show that any variable satisfying a ``Ehrhard-like'' property for its distribution function has a strictly convex normalized log moment generating function, unless the variable is Gaussian, in which case affine-ness is achieved. Moreover we characterize variables that satisfy the Ehrhard-like property as the convex images of Gaussians. As applications, we derive sharp comparisons between R\'enyi divergences for a Gaussian and a strongly log-concave variable, and characterize the equality case. We also demonstrate essentially optimal concentration bounds for the sequence of conic intrinsic volumes associated to convex cone and we obtain a reversal of McMullen's inequality between the sum of the (Euclidean) intrinsic volumes associated to a convex body and the body's mean width that generalizes and sharpens a result of Alonso-Hernandez-Yepes.</description>

      <title>Constant-Overhead Addressable Gates via Single-Shot Code Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a major challenge to perform addressable and parallel logical operations on constant-rate quantum LDPC (qLDPC) codes. Indeed, the overhead of targeting specific logical qubits represents a crucial bottleneck in many quantum fault-tolerance schemes.
  We introduce fault-tolerant protocols for performing various addressable as well as parallel logical operations with constant space-time overhead, on a family of constant-rate and polynomial-distance qLDPC codes. Specifically, we construct gadgets for a large class of permutations of logical qubits. We apply these logical permutations to construct gadgets for applying a targeted Hadamard (or $CNOT$) gate on any chosen logical qubit (pair). We also construct gadgets for preparing logical code states, and for applying Hadamard gates on all logical qubits in a codeblock. All of our gadgets use constant quantum space-time overhead along with polynomially bounded classical computation. Prior protocols for such operations required larger overhead, or else relied on codes with certain symmetries that lack known asymptotic constructions.
  Our codes are given by tensor products of classical codes constructed from lossless expander graphs. Our core technical contribution is a constant-overhead code-switching procedure between 2- and 3-dimensional product codes, which generalizes Bombin's dimensional jump (arXiv:1412.5079). We prove that all of our gadgets exhibit a constant threshold under locally stochastic noise. Along the way, we develop a small-set flip decoder for high-dimensional product codes from lossless expanders. Our techniques yield additional interesting consequences, such as single-shot state preparation of 2-dimensional product codes with constant space-time overhead. We also propose a method for performing parallel non-Clifford gates by extending our techniques to codes supporting transversal application of such gates.</description>

      <title>Near-Asymptotically-Good Quantum Codes with Transversal CCZ Gates and Sublinear-Weight Parity-Checks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a major challenge to construct good quantum codes supporting fault-tolerant (e.g. transversal) non-Clifford gates with low-weight parity-check measurements. In this paper, we construct the first known quantum codes with linear dimension and distance supporting transversal non-Clifford gates that have sublinear locality (i.e. parity-check weight). Specifically, we construct codes with transversal $CCZ$ gates that have dimension and distance $\Theta(N)$ and locality $O(\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ denotes the block length. We furthermore design an efficient decoding algorithm for these codes. The alphabet size of these codes is $q=\Theta(\sqrt{N})$, but it can be reduced to a constant (e.g. $q=2$) while incurring a polylogarithmic loss in other parameters. We also show how to decrease the locality to $O(N^{1/3})$, albeit with a larger alphabet size and slightly lower distance.
  We construct these codes as products of classical codes with appropriate algebraic structure. While our quantum codes are subsystem codes with non-commuting gauge operators, we show they nevertheless permit error correction from noisy syndrome measurements.
  As byproducts, we prove multiple technical results of independent interest. In particular, our efficient decoder can be viewed as a new multivariate generalization of Prony's method for reconstructing a function from partial access to its Fourier transform. Meanwhile, our distance analysis involves new connections to the classical study of maximally recoverable codes. Our results on product codes also resolve a conjecture of Bravyi &amp; Hastings (2014) in the large-alphabet regime, by providing a new construction of quantum codes with dimension and distance $\Theta(N)$ and locality $N^\epsilon$ for arbitrary $\epsilon&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Sensing Management for Pilot-Free Predictive Beamforming in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a sensing management method for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Conventional communication systems employ channel estimation procedures that impose significant overhead during data transmission, consuming resources that could otherwise be utilized for data. To address this challenge, we propose a state-based approach that leverages sensing capabilities to track the user when there is no communication request. Upon receiving a communication request, predictive beamforming is employed based on the tracked user position, thereby reducing the need for channel estimation. Our framework incorporates an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based tracking algorithm with adaptive sensing management to perform sensing operations only when necessary to maintain high tracking accuracy. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed sensing management approach provides uniform downlink communication rates that are higher than with existing methods by achieving overhead-free predictive beamforming.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel cooperative vehicular communication algorithm tailored for future 6G ultra-massive vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks leveraging integrated space-air-ground communication systems. Specifically, we address the challenge of real-time information exchange among rapidly moving vehicles. We demonstrate the existence of an upper bound on channel capacity given a fixed number of relays, and propose a low-complexity relay selection heuristic algorithm. Simulation results verify that our proposed algorithm achieves superior channel capacities compared to existing cooperative vehicular communication approaches.</description>

      <title>Haar random codes attain the quantum Hamming bound, approximately</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the error correcting properties of Haar random codes, in which a $K$-dimensional code space $\boldsymbol{C} \subseteq \mathbb{C}^N$ is chosen at random from the Haar distribution. Our main result is that Haar random codes can approximately correct errors up to the quantum Hamming bound, meaning that a set of $m$ Pauli errors can be approximately corrected so long as $mK \ll N$. This is the strongest bound known for any family of quantum error correcting codes (QECs), and continues a line of work showing that approximate QECs can significantly outperform exact QECs [LNCY97, CGS05, BGG24]. Our proof relies on a recent matrix concentration result of Bandeira, Boedihardjo, and van Handel.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Codes: Self-Correction from Small(er)-Set Expansion with Tunable Non-locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal constructions of classical LDPC codes can be obtained by choosing the Tanner graph uniformly at random among biregular graphs. We introduce a class of codes that we call ``diffusion codes'', defined by placing each edge connecting bits and checks on some graph, and acting on that graph with a random SWAP network. By tuning the depth of the SWAP network, we can tune a tradeoff between the amount of randomness -- and hence the optimality of code parameters -- and locality with respect to the underlying graph. For diffusion codes defined on the cycle graph, if the SWAP network has depth $\sim Tn$ with $T&gt; n^{2\beta}$ for arbitrary $\beta&gt;0$, then we prove that almost surely the Tanner graph is a lossless ``smaller set'' vertex expander for small sets up size $\delta \sim \sqrt T \sim n^{\beta}$, with bounded bit and check degree. At the same time, the geometric size of the largest stabilizer is bounded by $\sqrt T$ in graph distance. We argue, based on physical intuition, that this result should hold more generally on arbitrary graphs. By taking hypergraph products of these classical codes we obtain quantum LDPC codes defined on the torus with smaller-set boundary and co-boundary expansion and the same expansion/locality tradeoffs as for the classical codes. These codes are self-correcting and admit single-shot decoding, while having the geometric size of the stabilizer growing as an arbitrarily small power law. Our proof technique establishes mixing of a random SWAP network on small subsystems at times scaling with only the subsystem size, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Kaniadakis entropy as a measure of quantum correlations through implicit bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present article, we examine the relationship of negative conditional quantum Kaniadakis entropy ($\alpha-$CQKE) with the fully entangled fraction (FEF) which is a substantial yardstick for quantum information processing protocols including teleportation, and quantum steerability, executed over four vital quantum states with maximally mixed marginals, the 2-qubit Werner state, the 2-qubit Weyl state, the 2-qudit Werner state and the isotropic state. We initiate our analysis in 2$\otimes$2 systems where we derive implicit bounds on FEF when the $\alpha-$CQKE takes negative values, i.e. when $\alpha-$CQKE $\in$ $R^{-}$ for 2-qubit Werner state. Consequently, we derive the sufficient implicit bounds for a definitive claim on the non-usefulness of Werner state for quantum teleportation provided its visibility parameter succeeds to elude a critical region, the exception region 1, where the situation becomes inconclusive. Subsequently, we replicate the same for the 2-qubit Weyl state with some constraints augmented by an analogous exception region 2 and the correlation tensor matrix elements. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to d $\otimes$ d states, commencing our analysis with the Isotropic state. We derive implicit bounds on FEF of the Isotropic state and the 2-qudit Werner state resembling the ones in the 2$\otimes$2 analysis. Additionally, we utilize the convoluted relationship between the FEF and quantum steerability to formulate propositions linking negative $\alpha-$CQKE to the k-copy steerability of isotropic states for projective measurements, thereby reducing the intricacy of the study of k-copy steerability directly via FEF. In the appendix section of the article, we provide corroborative calculations and supplementary materials to the theorems presented in the main sections.</description>

      <title>Efficient reductions from a Gaussian source with applications to statistical-computational tradeoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a single observation from a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean $\theta$, we design computationally efficient procedures that can approximately generate an observation from a different target distribution $Q_{\theta}$ uniformly for all $\theta$ in a parameter set. We leverage our technique to establish reduction-based computational lower bounds for several canonical high-dimensional statistical models under widely-believed conjectures in average-case complexity. In particular, we cover cases in which:
  1. $Q_{\theta}$ is a general location model with non-Gaussian distribution, including both light-tailed examples (e.g., generalized normal distributions) and heavy-tailed ones (e.g., Student's $t$-distributions). As a consequence, we show that computational lower bounds proved for spiked tensor PCA with Gaussian noise are universal, in that they extend to other non-Gaussian noise distributions within our class.
  2. $Q_{\theta}$ is a normal distribution with mean $f(\theta)$ for a general, smooth, and nonlinear link function $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Using this reduction, we construct a reduction from symmetric mixtures of linear regressions to generalized linear models with link function $f$, and establish computational lower bounds for solving the $k$-sparse generalized linear model when $f$ is an even function. This result constitutes the first reduction-based confirmation of a $k$-to-$k^2$ statistical-to-computational gap in $k$-sparse phase retrieval, resolving a conjecture posed by Cai et al. (2016). As a second application, we construct a reduction from the sparse rank-1 submatrix model to the planted submatrix model, establishing a pointwise correspondence between the phase diagrams of the two models that faithfully preserves regions of computational hardness and tractability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for physics-aware sparse signal recovery in measurement systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike conventional compressed sensing approaches that treat measurement systems as simple linear systems, our method explicitly incorporates the underlying physics through numerical PDE solvers and automatic differentiation (AD). We present physics-aware iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (PA-ISTA), which combines the computational efficiency of ISTA with accurate physical modeling to achieve improved signal reconstruction. Using optical fiber channels as a concrete example, we demonstrate how the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) can be integrated into the recovery process. Our approach leverages deep unfolding techniques for parameter optimization. Numerical experiments show that PA-ISTA significantly outperforms conventional recovery methods. While demonstrated on optical fiber systems, the proposed framework provides a general methodology for physics-aware signal recovery applicable to a wide range of various PDE-governed measurement systems.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian-Constrained Holographic Beamforming Optimization in Multi-user Networks with Dynamic Metasurface Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are promising alternatives to fully digital (FD) architectures, enabling hybrid beamforming via low-cost reconfigurable metasurfaces. In DMAs, holographic beamforming is achieved through tunable elements by Lorentzian-constrained holography (LCH), significantly reducing the need for radio-frequency (RF) chains and analog circuitry. However, the Lorentzian constraints and limited RF chains introduce a trade-off between reduced system complexity and beamforming performance, especially in dense network scenarios. This paper addresses resource allocation in multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MISO) networks under the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) constraints, aiming to minimize total transmit power. We propose a holographic beamforming algorithm based on the Generalized Method of Lorentzian-Constrained Holography (GMLCH), which optimizes DMA weights, yielding flexibility for using various LCH techniques to tackle the aforementioned trade-offs. Building upon GMLCH, we further propose a new algorithm i.e., Adaptive Radius Lorentzian Constrained Holography (ARLCH), which achieves optimization of DMA weights with additional degree of freedom in a greater optimization space, and provides lower transmitted power, while improving scalability for higher number of users. Numerical results show that ARLCH reduces power consumption by over 20\% compared to benchmarks, with increasing effectiveness as the number of users grows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the notions of $(n,\sigma)$-isometry and $(n,\sigma)$-equivalence introduced by Ou-azzou et al coincide for most skew $(\sigma,a)$-constacyclic codes of length $n$. To prove this, we show that all Hamming-weight-preserving homomorphisms between their ambient algebras must have degree one when those algebras are nonassociative. We work in the general setting of commutative base rings $S$. As a consequence, we propose new definitions of equivalence and isometry of skew constacyclic codes that exactly capture all Hamming-preserving isomorphisms, and lead to tighter classifications. In the process we determine homomorphisms between nonassociative Petit algebras, prioritizing the algebras $S[t;\sigma]/S[t;\sigma](t^n-a)$, which give rise to skew constacyclic codes.</description>

      <title>Reverse-type Data Processing Inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19890v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum data processing inequality asserts that two quantum states become harder to distinguish when a noisy channel is applied. On the other hand, a reverse quantum data processing inequality characterizes whether distinguishability is preserved after the application of a noisy channel. In this work, we explore these concepts through contraction and expansion coefficients of the relative entropy of quantum channels. Our first result is that quantum channels with an input dimension greater than or equal to the output dimension do not have a non-zero expansion coefficient, which means that they cannot admit a reverse data-processing inequality. We propose a comparative approach by introducing a relative expansion coefficient, to assess how one channel expands relative entropy compared to another. We show that this relative expansion coefficient is positive for three important classes of quantum channels: depolarizing channels, generalized dephasing channels, and amplitude damping channels. As an application, we give the first rigorous construction of level-1 less noisy quantum channels that are non-degradable.</description>

      <title>Token-based Audio Inpainting via Discrete Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio inpainting seeks to restore missing segments in degraded recordings. Previous diffusion-based methods exhibit impaired performance when the missing region is large. We introduce the first approach that applies discrete diffusion over tokenized music representations from a pre-trained audio tokenizer, enabling stable and semantically coherent restoration of long gaps. Our method further incorporates two training approaches: a derivative-based regularization loss that enforces smooth temporal dynamics, and a span-based absorbing transition that provides structured corruption during diffusion. Experiments on the MusicNet and MAESTRO datasets with gaps up to 750 ms show that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines across range of gap lengths, for gaps of 150 ms and above. This work advances musical audio restoration and introduces new directions for discrete diffusion model training. Audio examples of our proposed method can be found at https://iftach21.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Sustainable LSTM-Based Precoding for RIS-Aided mmWave MIMO Systems with Implicit CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a sustainable long short-term memory (LSTM)-based precoding framework for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems. Instead of explicit channel state information (CSI) estimation, the framework exploits uplink pilot sequences to implicitly learn channel characteristics, reducing both pilot overhead and inference complexity. Practical hardware constraints are addressed by incorporating the phase-dependent amplitude model of RIS elements, while a multi-label training strategy improves robustness when multiple near-optimal codewords yield comparable performance. Simulations show that the proposed design achieves over 90% of the spectral efficiency of exhaustive search (ES) with only 2.2% of its computation time, cutting energy consumption by nearly two orders of magnitude. The method also demonstrates resilience under distribution mismatch and scalability to larger RIS arrays, making it a practical and energy-efficient solution for sustainable 6G wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reverse Shannon Theorem Simplified</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the quantum reverse Shannon theorem, a central result in quantum information theory that characterizes the resources needed to simulate quantum channels when entanglement is freely available. We derive a universal additive upper bound on the smoothed max-information in terms of the sandwiched R\'enyi mutual information. This bound yields tighter single-shot results, eliminates the need for the post-selection technique, and leads to a conceptually simpler proof of the quantum reverse Shannon theorem. By consolidating and streamlining earlier approaches, our result provides a clearer and more direct understanding of the resource costs of simulating quantum channels.</description>
