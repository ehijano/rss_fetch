      <title>High-pressure Ion Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A High-Pressure Ion Trap operating at pressure ~1 Torr is a core component of the portable hand-held mass-spectrometric gas analyzer. A comprehensive mathematical model of the HPIT is described in this paper. The influence of the instrumental parameters (gas composition, pressure, and temperature; applied voltages; ion trap size and geometry) and ion properties (mass, diffusion, and mobility) on the ion trap analytical parameters (mass-spectral peak position, height, and width) is examined. The model explained the difference between a high-pressure and regular low-pressure ion trap.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Hydration Shell Inclusion and Chain Exclusion in the Efficacy of Reaction Coordinates for Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Ice Nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ice nucleation plays a pivotal role in many natural and industrial processes, and molecular simulations play have proven vital in uncovering its kinetics and mechanisms. A fundamental component of such simulations is the choice of an order parameter (OP) that quantifies the progress of nucleation, with the efficacy of an OP typically measured by its ability to predict the committor probabilities. Here, we leverage a machine learning framework introduced in our earlier work (Domingues,~\emph{et al.}, \emph{J. Phys. Chem. Lett.}, 15, 1279, {\bf 2024}) to systematically investigate how key implementation details influence the efficacy of standard Steinhardt OPs in capturing the progress of both homogeneous and heterogeneous ice nucleation. Our analysis identify distance and $q_6$ cutoffs, as the primary determinants of OP performance, regardless of the mode of nucleation. We also examine the impact of two popular refinement strategies, namely chain exclusion and hydration shell inclusion, on OP efficacy. We find neither strategy to exhibit a universally consistent impact. Instead, their efficacy depends strongly on the chosen distance and $q_6$ cutoffs. Chain exclusion enhances OP efficacy when the underlying OP lacks sufficient selectivity, whereas hydration shell inclusion is beneficial for overly selective OPs. Consequently, we demonstrate that selecting optimal combinations of such cutoffs can eliminate the need for these refinement strategies altogether. These findings provide a systematic understanding of how to design and optimize OPs for accurately describing complex nucleation phenomena, offering valuable guidance for improving the predictive power of molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>"Ensemblization" of density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) has transformed our ability to investigate and understand electronic ground states. In its original formulation, however, DFT is not suited to addressing (e.g.) degenerate ground states, mixed states with different particle numbers, or excited states. All these issues can be handled, in principle exactly, via ensemble DFT (EDFT). This Perspective provides a detailed introduction to and analysis of EDFT, in an in-principle exact framework that is constructed to avoid uncontrolled errors and inconsistencies that may be associated with {\it ad hoc} extensions of conventional DFT. In particular, it focuses on the "ensemblization" of both exact and approximate density functionals, a term we coin to describe a rigorous approach that lends itself to the construction of novel approximations consistent with the general ensemble framework, yet applicable to practical problems where traditional DFT tends to fail or does not apply at all. Specifically, symmetry considerations and ensemble properties are shown to enable each other in shaping a practical DFT-based methodology that extends beyond the ground state and, in doing so, highlights the need to look outside the standard ground state Kohn-Sham treatment.</description>

      <title>Universal Structure of Computing Moments for Exact Quantum Dynamics: Application to Arbitrary System-Bath Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general procedure for computing higher-order moments of correlation functions in open quantum systems, extending the scope of our recent work on Memory Kernel Coupling Theory (MKCT) [W. Liu, Y. Su, Y. Wang, and W. Dou, arXiv:2407.01923 (2024)]. This approach is demonstrated for arbitrary system-bath coupling that can be expressed as polynomial, $H_{SB} = \hat{V} (\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \hat{q} + \alpha_2 \hat{q}^2+ \dots)$, where we show that the recursive commutators of a system operator obey a universal hierarchy. Exploiting this structure, the higher-order moments are obtained by evaluating the expectation values of the system and bath operators separately, with bath expectation values derived from the derivatives of a generating function. We further apply MKCT to compute the dipole autocorrelation function for the spin-boson model with both linear and quadratic coupling, achieving agreement with the hierarchical equations of motion approach. Our findings suggest a promising path toward accurate dynamics for complex open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Bridging-induced Aggregation in Neutral Polymers: Dynamics and Morphologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the aggregation behavior of neutral stiff (rod-like) and flexible polymer chains mediated by attractive crowders. Attractive crowders serve as bridging agents, inducing aggregation through effective intra-polymer attractions. The critical monomer-crowder attraction strength ($\epsilon_{mc}^*$) required for aggregation differs notably between rigid rods and flexible polymers. Interestingly, this aggregation threshold closely matches the critical attraction required for the extended-to-collapsed (coil-globule) transition of a single flexible polymer chain, suggesting a fundamental connection between single-chain collapse and multi-chain aggregation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $\epsilon_{mc}^*$ decreases with increasing system density and larger crowder sizes, highlighting the synergistic roles of crowding effects and crowder dimensions. Aggregate morphologies exhibit strong dependence on polymer flexibility: rigid rods predominantly form elongated cylindrical bundles, whereas flexible polymers aggregate into compact spherical clusters. These findings provide comprehensive insights into how bridging interactions driven by attractive crowders regulate polymer aggregation dynamics and morphologies, emphasizing the importance of polymer rigidity, crowder size, and system density.</description>

      <title>Application of a spherically averaged pair potential in \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo simulations of the warm dense electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spherically averaged periodic pair potentials offer the enticing promise to provide accurate results at a drastically reduced computational cost compared to the traditional Ewald sum. In this work, we employ the pair potential by Yakub and Ronchi [\textit{J.~Chem.~Phys.}~\textbf{119}, 11556 (2003)] in \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations of the warm dense uniform electron gas. Overall, we find very accurate results with respect to Ewald reference data for integrated properties such as the kinetic and potential energy, whereas wavenumber resolved properties such as the static structure factor $S(\mathbf{q})$, the static linear density response $\chi(\mathbf{q})$ and the static quadratic density response $\chi^{(2)}(\mathbf{q},0)$ fluctuate for small $q$. In addition, we perform an analytic continuation to compute the dynamic structure factor $S(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ from PIMC results of the imaginary-time density--density correlation function $F(\mathbf{q},\tau)$ for both pair potentials. Our results have important implications for future PIMC calculations, which can be sped up significantly using the YR potential for the estimation of equation-of-state properties or $q$-resolved observables in the non-collective regime, whereas a full Ewald treatment is mandatory to accurately resolve physical effects manifesting for smaller $q$, including the evaluation of compressibility sum rules, the interpretation of x-ray scattering experiments at small scattering angles, and the estimation of optical and transport properties.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Framework for the Electronic Structure of Water: Towards a Universal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately modeling the electronic structure of water across scales, from individual molecules to bulk liquid, remains a grand challenge. Traditional computational methods face a critical trade-off between computational cost and efficiency. We present an enhanced machine-learning Deep Kohn-Sham (DeePKS) method for improved electronic structure, DeePKS-ES, that overcomes this dilemma. By incorporating the Hamiltonian matrix and their eigenvalues and eigenvectors into the loss function, we establish a universal model for water systems, which can reproduce high-level hybrid functional (HSE06) electronic properties from inexpensive generalized gradient approximation (PBE) calculations. Validated across molecular clusters and liquid-phase simulations, our approach reliably predicts key electronic structure properties such as band gaps and density of states, as well as total energy and atomic forces. This work bridges quantum-mechanical precision with scalable computation, offering transformative opportunities for modeling aqueous systems in catalysis, climate science, and energy storage.</description>

      <title>GP-MoLFormer: A Foundation Model For Molecular Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based models trained on large and general purpose datasets consisting of molecular strings have recently emerged as a powerful tool for successfully modeling various structure-property relations. Inspired by this success, we extend the paradigm of training chemical language transformers on large-scale chemical datasets to generative tasks in this work. Specifically, we propose GP-MoLFormer, an autoregressive molecular string generator that is trained on more than 1.1B (billion) chemical SMILES. GP-MoLFormer uses a 46.8M parameter transformer decoder model with linear attention and rotary positional encodings as the base architecture. GP-MoLFormer's utility is evaluated and compared with that of existing baselines on three different tasks: de novo generation, scaffold-constrained molecular decoration, and unconstrained property-guided optimization. While the first two are handled with no additional training, we propose a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for the last task, which uses property-ordered molecular pairs as input. We call this new approach pair-tuning. Our results show GP-MoLFormer performs better or comparable with baselines across all three tasks, demonstrating its general utility for a variety of molecular generation tasks. We further report strong memorization of training data in GP-MoLFormer generations, which has so far remained unexplored for chemical language models. Our analyses reveal that training data memorization and novelty in generations are impacted by the quality and scale of the training data; duplication bias in training data can enhance memorization at the cost of lowering novelty. We further establish a scaling law relating inference compute and novelty in generations.</description>

      <title>Viscosity of polymer melts using non-affine theory based on vibrational modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.</description>
