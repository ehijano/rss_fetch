      <title>Tightness of Chekanov's bound on displacement energy for some Lagrangian knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By a classical theorem of Chekanov, the displacement energy, $e$, of a Lagrangian submanifold is bounded from below by the minimal area of pseudo-holomorphic disks with boundary on the Lagrangian, $\hbar$. We compute $e$ and $\hbar$ for displaceable Chekanov tori in $\mathbb{C}P^n$, and for an infinite family of exotic tori in $\mathbb{C}^3$ constructed by Brendel. In these families, $e=\hbar$.
  We compare continuity properties of $e$ and $\hbar$ on the space of Lagrangians. This provides an example (suggested by Fukaya, Oh, Ohta, and Ono) where $e&gt;\hbar$.
  Our calculations have further applications such as a new proof, inspired by work of Auroux, that Brendel's family of exotic tori consists of infinitely many distinct Lagrangians.</description>

      <title>Sandwiched singularities and nearly Lefschetz fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Milnor fibers and symplectic fillings of links of sandwiched singularities, with the goal of contrasting their algebro-geometric deformation theory and symplectic topology. In the algebro-geometric setting, smoothings of sandwiched singularities are described by de Jong--van Straten's theory: all Milnor fibers are generated from deformations of a singular plane curve germ associated to the surface singularity. We develop an analog of this theory in the symplectic setting, showing that all minimal symplectic fillings of the links are generated by certain immersed disk arrangements resembling de Jong--van Straten's picture deformations. This paper continues our previous work for a special subclass of singularities; the general case has additional difficulties and new features. The key new ingredient in the present paper is given by spinal open books and nearly Lefschetz fibrations: we use recent work of Roy--Min--Wang to understand symplectic fillings and encode them via multisections of certain Lefschetz fibrations. As an application, we discuss arrangements that generate unexpected Stein fillings that are different from all Milnor fibers, showing that the links of a large class of sandwiched singularities admit unexpected fillings.</description>

      <title>Stratified manifolds with corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define categories of stratified manifolds (s-manifolds) and stratified manifolds with corners (s-manifolds with corners). An s-manifold $\bf X$ of dimension $n$ is a Hausdorff, locally compact topological space $X$ with a stratification $X=\coprod_{i\in I}X^i$ into locally closed subsets $X^i$ which are smooth manifolds of dimension $\le n$, satisfying some conditions.
  S-manifolds can be very singular, but still share many good properties with ordinary manifolds, e.g. an oriented s-manifold $\bf X$ has a fundamental class $[\bf X]_{\rm fund}$ in Steenrod homology $H_n^{St}(X,\mathbb Z)$, and transverse fibre products exist in the category of s-manifolds.
  S-manifolds are designed for applications in Symplectic Geometry. In future work we hope to show that after suitable perturbations, the moduli spaces $\mathcal M$ of $J$-holomorphic curves used to define Gromov-Witten invariants, Lagrangian Floer cohomology, Fukaya categories, and so on, can be made into s-manifolds or s-manifolds with corners, and their fundamental classes used to define Gromov-Witten invariants, Lagrangian Floer cohomology, ....</description>

      <title>Spectral selectors and contact orderability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the notion of orderability of isotopy classes of Legendrian submanifolds and their universal covers, with some weaker results concerning spaces of contactomorphisms. Our main result is that orderability is equivalent to the existence of spectral selectors analogous to the spectral invariants coming from Lagrangian Floer Homology. A direct application is the existence of Reeb chords between any closed Legendrian submanifolds of a same orderable isotopy class. Other applications concern the Sandon conjecture, the Arnold chord conjecture, Legendrian interlinking, the existence of time-functions and the study of metrics due to Hofer-Chekanov-Shelukhin, Colin-Sandon, Fraser-Polterovich-Rosen and Nakamura.</description>

      <title>Corks, exotic 4-manifolds and genus functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18584v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that every 4-dimensional oriented handlebody without 3- and 4-handles can be modified to admit infinitely many exotic smooth structures, and further that their genus functions are pairwise equivalent. We furthermore show that, for any 4-manifold admitting an embedding into a symplectic 4-manifold with weakly convex boundary, its genus function is algebraically realized as those of infinitely many pairwise exotic 4-manifolds. We also prove that, for any two 4-manifolds with non-degenerate intersection forms, algebraic inequivalences of genus functions are stable under connected sums and boundary sums with a certain type of 4-manifolds having arbitrarily large second Betti numbers. Furthermore, we introduce a notion of genus function type for diffeomorphism invariants and show that similar results hold for any such invariant. As an application of our exotic 4-manifolds, we also prove that for any (possibly non-orientable) 4-manifold, every submanifold of codimension less than two satisfying a mild condition can be modified to admit infinitely many exotically knotted copies.</description>
