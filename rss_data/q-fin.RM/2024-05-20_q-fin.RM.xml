      <title>Risk, utility and sensitivity to large losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Risk and utility functionals are fundamental building blocks in economics and finance. In this paper we investigate under which conditions a risk or utility functional is sensitive to the accumulation of losses in the sense that any sufficiently large multiple of a position that exposes an agent to future losses has positive risk or negative utility. We call this property sensitivity to large losses and provide necessary and sufficient conditions thereof that are easy to check for a very large class of risk and utility functionals. In particular, our results do not rely on convexity and can therefore also be applied to most examples discussed in the recent literature, including (non-convex) star-shaped risk measures or S-shaped utility functions encountered in prospect theory. As expected, Value at Risk generally fails to be sensitive to large losses. More surprisingly, this is also true of Expected Shortfall. By contrast, expected utility functionals as well as (optimized) certainty equivalents are proved to be sensitive to large losses for many standard choices of concave and nonconcave utility functions, including $S$-shaped utility functions. We also show that Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall become sensitive to large losses if they are either properly adjusted or if the property is suitably localized.</description>

      <title>Risk-neutral valuation of options under arithmetic Brownian motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On April 22, 2020, the CME Group switched to Bachelier pricing for a group of oil futures options. The Bachelier model, or more generally the arithmetic Brownian motion (ABM), is not so widely used in finance, though. This paper provides the first comprehensive survey of options pricing under ABM. Using the risk-neutral valuation, we derive formulas for European options for three underlying types, namely an underlying that does not pay dividends, an underlying that pays a continuous dividend yield, and futures. Further, we derive Black-Scholes-Merton-like partial differential equations, which can in principle be utilized to price American options numerically via finite difference.</description>
