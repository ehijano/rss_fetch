      <title>Representations of noncommutative cubes and prisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representations of the operator system determined by the canonical generators of the free product of two cyclic groups of order $2$ and $k$, or $d$ cyclic groups of order $2$, are studied for the purpose of shedding light on the noncommutative geometry of noncommutative $d$-cubes and $k$-prisms. By way of the duality of the categories NCConv and OpSys of noncommutative convex sets and operator systems, respectively, an analysis of noncommutative extreme points, exactness, the lifting property, automatic complete positivity, controlled completely positive extensions, tensor products, and operator system duality is undertaken. Of note is the pairing of two classical dilation theorems of Halmos and Mirman to give a complete description of the noncommutative triangular prism in terms of joint unitary dilations.</description>

      <title>Circulant quantum channels and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note introduces a family of circulant quantum channels -- a subclass of the mixed-permutation channels -- and investigates its key structural and operational properties. We show that the image of the circulant quantum channel is precisely the set of circulant matrices. This characterization facilitates the analysis of arbitrary $n$-th order Bargmann invariants. Furthermore, we prove that the channel is entanglement-breaking, implying a substantially reduced resource cost for erasing quantum correlations compared to a general mixed-permutation channel. Applications of this channel are also discussed, including the derivation of tighter lower bounds for $\ell_p$-norm coherence and a characterization of its action in bipartite systems.</description>

      <title>Crossed products by compact group actions with the weak tracial Rokhlin property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce compact group actions with the weak tracial Rokhlin property. This concept simultaneously generalizes finite group actions with the weak tracial Rokhlin property and compact group actions with the tracial Rokhlin property (in the sense of the Elliott program). Under this framework, we prove that simplicity, pure infiniteness, tracial $\mathcal{Z}$-stability and the combination of nuclearity and $\mathcal{Z}$-stability can be transferred from the original algebra to the crossed product. We also show that the radius of comparison of the fixed point algebra does not exceed that of the original algebra. Furthermore, we discuss the relationship between our definition and natural generalization of the finite group case in non-Elliott program settings. Finally, we provide a nontrivial example of a compact group action with the weak tracial Rokhlin property with comparison: an action of $(S_2)^\mathbb{N}$ on the Jiang-Su algebra $\mathcal{Z}$. Since $\mathcal{Z}$ contains no nontrivial projections, this action does not possess the tracial Rokhlin property.</description>

      <title>Boundary representations, geometry of matrix ranges, and C$^*$-envelopes of finite-dimensional operator systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An analysis of the boundary representations and C$^*$-envelopes of some finite-dimensional operator systems $\mathcal R$ is undertaken by considering relationships between operator-theoretic properties of a $d$-tuple $\mathfrak x=(x_1,\dots, x_d)$ of elements in a unital C$^*$-algebra $\mathcal A$ and operator-system properties of the linear span $\mathcal O_{\mathfrak x}$ of $\{1_\mathcal A,x_1,x_1^*,\dots,x_d,x_d^*\}$. This approach lends itself well to the study of certain phenomena in single- and several-variable operator theory, such as the Smith-Ward property. The matrix range of a $d$-tuple of elements $\mathfrak x$ is matrix-affinely homeomorphic to the matrix state space of the operator system determined by $\mathfrak x$, and many of our methods connect the geometry of these compact matrix convex sets to operator system properties, including various forms of nuclearity and lifting properties.</description>

      <title>A Game-Theoretic Unital Classification Theorem for $C^*$-Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the complexity of the $KK$-equivalence relation on unital $C^*$-algebras, in the sense of descriptive set theory. We prove that $KK$-equivalence is analytic, which in turn shows that the set of separable $C^*$-algebras satisfying the UCT is analytic. This allows us to prove a game-theoretic refinement of the unital classification theorem: there is a transfer of strategies between Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e games (of various lengths) on classifiable $C^*$-algebras and their invariants.</description>

      <title>Planar algebras for the Young graph and the Khovanov Heisenberg category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies planar algebras of Jones' style associated with the Young graph. We first see that, given a positive real valued function on the Young graph, we may obtain a planar algebra whose structure is defined in terms of a state sum over the ways of filling planar tangles with Young diagrams. We delve into the case that the function is harmonic and related to the Plancherel measures on Young diagrams. Along with an element that is depicted as a cross of two strings, we see that the defining relations among morphisms for the Khovanov Heisenberg category are recovered in the planar algebra. We also identify certain elements in the planar algebra with particular functions of Young diagrams that include the moments, Boolean cumulants and normalized characters. This paper thereby bridges diagramatical categorification and asymptotic representation theory. In fact, the Khovanov Heisenberg category is one of the most fundamental examples of diagramatical categorification whereas the harmonic functions on the Young graph have been a central object in the asymptotic representation theory of symmetric groups.</description>
