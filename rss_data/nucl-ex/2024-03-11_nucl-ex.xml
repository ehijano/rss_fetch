      <title>Shape of 12C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have examined the hypothesis by Bijker and Iachello who asserted that 12C has an internal structure with three alpha particles arranged in a triangular shape, leading to the formation of the ground rotational band consisting of 0+, 2+, 3-, 4$^\pm$ and 5- states. Following this idea, we reconstructed the intrinsic shape of 12C using experimental electron scattering data with minimal theoretical assumption. Our sole assumption was that the observed 0+, 2+, 3-, and 4+ states share a common internal structure, forming a rotational spectrum. The reconstructed intrinsic density showed a beautiful triangular shape with three peaks implying alpha cluster formation in the ground band.</description>

      <title>Enhanced deuteron coalescence probability in jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transverse-momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) spectra and coalescence parameters $B_2$ of (anti)deuterons are measured in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV for the first time in and out of jets. In this measurement, the direction of the leading particle with the highest $p_{\rm T}$ in the event ($p_{\rm T}^{\rm{ lead}} &gt; 5$ GeV/$c$) is used as an approximation for the jet axis. The event is consequently divided into three azimuthal regions and the jet signal is obtained as the difference between the Toward region, that contains jet fragmentation products in addition to the underlying event (UE), and the Transverse region, which is dominated by the UE. The coalescence parameter in the jet is found to be approximately a factor of 10 larger than that in the underlying event. This experimental observation is consistent with the coalescence picture and can be attributed to the smaller average phase-space distance between nucleons inside the jet cone as compared to the underlying event. The results presented in this Letter are compared to predictions from a simple nucleon coalescence model, where the phase space distributions of nucleons are generated using PYTHIA 8 with the Monash 2013 tuning, and to predictions from a deuteron production model based on ordinary nuclear reactions with parametrized energy-dependent cross sections tuned on data. The latter model is implemented in PYTHIA 8.3. Both models reproduce the observed large difference between in-jet and out-of-jet coalescence parameters, although the almost flat trend of the $B^{\rm Jet}_2$ is not reproduced by the models, which instead give a decreasing trend.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Electron-Neutrino Charged-Current Cross Sections on ${}^{127}$I with the COHERENT NaI$\nu$E detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using an 185-kg NaI[Tl] array, COHERENT has measured the inclusive electron-neutrino charged-current cross section on ${}^{127}$I with pion decay-at-rest neutrinos produced by the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Iodine is one the heaviest targets for which low-energy ($\leq$ 50 MeV) inelastic neutrino-nucleus processes have been measured, and this is the first measurement of its inclusive cross section. After a five-year detector exposure, COHERENT reports a flux-averaged cross section for electron neutrinos of $9.2^{+2.1}_{-1.8} \times 10^{-40}$ cm$^2$. This corresponds to a value that is $\sim$41% lower than predicted using the MARLEY event generator with a measured Gamow-Teller strength distribution. In addition, the observed visible spectrum from charged-current scattering on $^{127}$I has been measured between 10 and 55 MeV, and the exclusive zero-neutron and one-or-more-neutron emission cross sections are measured to be $5.2^{+3.4}_{-3.1} \times 10^{-40}$ and $2.2^{+3.5}_{-2.2} \times 10^{-40}$ cm$^2$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Towards three-dimensional nucleon structures at the Electron-Ion Collider in China: A study of the Sivers function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs) provide three-dimensional imaging of the nucleon in the momentum space. With its fundamental importance in understanding the spin structure of the nucleon, the precise measurement of TMDs is considered as one of the main physics topics of the proposed Electron-Ion Collider in China (EicC). In this paper, we investigate the impact of future semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) data from EicC on the extraction of TMDs. Taking the Sivers function as an example, we revisited the world SIDIS data, which serves as the input for the simulated EicC data. By performing a combined analysis of the world data and the EicC simulated data, we quantitatively demonstrate that the Sivers functions can be precisely determined for various quark flavors, especially for sea quarks, in the region, $x&gt;0.005$, directly covered by the EicC.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Green's function approach to low-energy fission dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of a compound nucleus was proposed by Bohr in 1936 to explain narrow resonances in neutron scattering off a nucleus. While a compound nucleus has been understood in terms of statistical mechanics, its description based on a many-body Hamiltonian has yet to be developed. Here we present a microscopic modeling of a compound nucleus starting from a nucleonic degree of freedom. We focus in particular on a decay of a heavy compound nucleus, that is, fission and radiative capture. To this end, we develop an approach based on a non-equilibrium Green's function, which is combined with a configuration interaction (CI) approach based on a constrained density-functional theory (DFT). We apply this approach to a barrier-top fission of $^{236}$U, restricting the model space to seniority zero configurations of neutrons and protons. Our calculation with a Skyrme energy functional yields the fission-to-capture branching ratio of around 0.07. While this value is still reasonable, the calculation underestimates the branching ratio by about a factor of 40 as compared to the empirical value, indicating a necessity of seniority non-zero configurations in the model space. We also find that the distribution of the fission probability approximately follows the chi-squared distribution with the number of degrees of freedom of the order of 1, which is consistent with the experimental finding.</description>
