      <title>Four-dimensional Stationary Algebraically Special Solutions and Soft Hairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the Ricci-flat metrics in four dimensions that are stationary and algebraically special, together with the locally asymptotically flat conditions in the Bondi-Sachs framework. The solutions consist of a pair of arbitrary holomorphic and antiholomorphic functions analogous to the Virasoro modes, and also three constant parameters originated from the $Y_{1,m}$ modes in spherical harmonic expansion. We show that the higher modes of the (anti-)holomorphic function contain an infinite tower of soft hairs from the perspectives of both the local gravitational degree of freedom and the asymptotic supertranslation charges. Within our general ansatz, we obtain from the zero modes the complete set of algebraic Petrov type-D solutions of four free parameters. We show that one parameter does not belong to the Plebanski-Demianski class and, therefore, yields a new type-D metric.</description>

      <title>Quantum corrections to the path integral of near extremal de Sitter black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum corrections to the Euclidean path integral of charged and static four-dimensional de Sitter (dS$_4$) black holes near extremality. These black holes admit three different extremal limits (Cold, Nariai and Ultracold) which exhibit AdS$_2 \times S^2 $, dS$_2 \times S^2 $ and $\text{Mink}_2 \times S^2$ near horizon geometries, respectively. The one-loop correction to the gravitational path integral in the near horizon geometry is plagued by infrared divergencies due to the presence of tensor, vector and gauge zero modes. Inspired by the analysis of black holes in flat space, we regulate these divergences by introducing a small temperature correction in the Cold and Nariai background geometries. In the Cold case, we find a contribution from the gauge modes which is not present in previous work in asymptotically flat spacetimes. Several issues concerning the Nariai case, including the presence of negative norm states and negative eigenvalues, are discussed, together with problems faced when trying to apply this procedure to the Ultracold solution.</description>

      <title>The wavefunction of a quantum $S^1 \times S^2$ universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum gravity corrections to the no-boundary wavefunction describing a universe with spatial topology $S^1\times S^2$. It has been suggested that quantum effects become increasingly important when the size of the circle is large relative to the sphere. In this paper, we confirm this claim by an explicit four-dimensional one-loop calculation of the gravitational path integral preparing such a state. In the process, we clarify some aspects of the gravitational path integral on complex spacetimes. These quantum corrections play a crucial role in ensuring that the norm of the wavefunction is naturally expressed in terms of a path integral over $S^2 \times S^2$ at the classical level. We extend some of the analysis to more general spatial topologies, as well as to the inclusion of fermions.</description>

      <title>Unfolding the Six-Dimensional Tensor Multiplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a manifestly superconformally covariant unfolded formulation of the free (2,0) tensor multiplet. The unfolded system consists of an abelian two-form and an infinite-dimensional, chiral Weyl zero-form realized using superoscillators. The construction of the cocycle gluing these forms on a general superconformal background goes one step beyond previous results in super-Poincar\'e backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Higher-point correlators in the BFSS matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate higher-point correlators in the BFSS matrix model, a non-conformal theory dual to type IIA string theory, using Witten diagrams and techniques from the amplitudes program. While the Witten diagrams are more complex than those relevant for conformal holographic theories, we find that the added complexity is minimal. As an illustration, we compute the leading three-point Witten diagram, evaluating it in a squeezed limit using the method of regions. Our results provide new targets for future Monte-Carlo and quantum simulations of the BFSS matrix model.</description>

      <title>Duality symmetry, zero energy modes and boundary spectrum of the sine-Gordon/massive Thirring model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the one-dimensional massive Thirring model, which is equivalent to the one-dimensional sine-Gordon model, with two types of Dirchlet boundary conditions: open boundary conditions (OBC) and twisted open boundary conditions ($\widehat{\text{OBC}}$). The system exhibits a duality symmetry which relates models with opposite bare mass parameters and boundary conditions, i.e: $m_0 \leftrightarrow - m_0$, $\text{OBC}\leftrightarrow\widehat{\text{OBC}}$. For $m_0&lt;0$ and OBC, the system is in a trivial phase whose ground state is unique, as in the case of periodic boundary conditions. In contrast, for $m_0&lt;0$ and $\widehat{\text{OBC}}$, the system is in a topological phase characterized by the existence of zero energy modes (ZEMs) localized at each boundary. As dictated by the duality symmetry, for $m_0&gt;0$ and $\widehat{\text{OBC}}$, the trivial phase occurs, whereas the topological phase occurs for $m_0&gt;0$ and OBC. In addition, we analyze the structure of the boundary excitations, finding significant differences between the attractive $(g&gt;0)$ and the repulsive $(g&lt;0)$ regimes.</description>

      <title>Phases and propagation of closed p-brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study phases and propagation of closed $p$-brane within the framework of effective field theory with higher-form global symmetries, i.e., {\it brane-field theory}. We extend our previous studies by including the kinetic term of the center-of-mass motion as well as the kinetic term for the relative motions constructed by the area derivatives. This inclusion gives rise to another scalar Nambu-Goldstone mode in the broken phase, enriching the phase structures of $p$-brane. For example, when the higher-form global symmetries are discrete ones, we show that the low-energy effective theory in the broken phase is described by a topological field theory of the axion $\varphi(X)$ and $p$-form field $A_p^{}(X)$ with multiple (emergent) higher-form global symmetries. After the mean-field analysis, we investigate the propagation of $p$-brane in the present framework. We find the (functional) plane-wave solutions for the kinetic terms and derive a path-integral representation of the brane propagator. This representation motivates us to study the brane propagation within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where the volume of $p$-brane is treated as constant. In the volume-less limit (i.e. point-particle limit), the propagator reduces to the ordinary propagator of relativistic particle, whereas it describes the propagation of the area elements in the large-volume limit. Correspondingly, it is shown that the Hausdorff dimension of $p$-brane varies from $2$ to $2(p+1)$ as we increase the $p$-brane volume within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Although these results are quite intriguing, we also point out that the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is invalid in the point-particle limit, highlighting the quantum nature of $p$-brane as an extended object in spacetime.</description>

      <title>Axion Stabilization in Modular Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\alpha$-attractor models have plateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The potential in the axion direction is almost exactly flat during inflation, hence, the axion field remains nearly massless. In this paper, we develop a generalized class of such models, where the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry is preserved, but the axion acquires a large mass and becomes strongly stabilized during inflation, which eliminates isocurvature perturbations in this scenario. Inflation in such two-field models occurs as in the single-field $\alpha$-attractors and leads to the same cosmological predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider N=1 supersymmetric systems in d=4, 6 and 10 dimensions which consist of reducible bosonic and fermionic massless representations of the Poincare group. We show in detail how to decompose the corresponding Lagrangians into a sum of Lagrangians for irreducible representations of the Poincare group. We also outline a modification of this procedure in the case of an anti-de Sitter background.</description>

      <title>The integrable Bullough-Dodd model under celestial holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study celestial amplitudes for the S-matrix of the 2d integrable Bullough-Dodd model. This model has bound states that appear as poles in the physics strip of its 2d S-matrix, which complicates the computation of celestial amplitudes. However, it turns out that the celestial amplitudes are, in fact, well-structured. The celestial bootstrap (arising from the unitarity and crossing symmetry of 2d S-matrix) can be decomposed into a finite-dimensional linear space, whose base-integrals evaluate into harmonic numbers. This clean structure replaces the complicated integration with simple algebra of elementary functions, and the celestial bootstrap reduces to a programmable recursion process of simple algebra. So the celestial dual of the 2d integrable Bullough-Dodd model turns out to be 'bootstrapable' in the practical sense, that is, a programmable recursion process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the moduli space metric of a single vortex gets corrections because of the excitation of the radially symmetric shape mode. It leads to a non-zero amount of the shape mode carried by the vortex when moving with a constant velocity. However, due to the radial symmetry, this effect does not reproduce the Lorentz contraction of the moving vortex. We apply the Derrick mode approximation in order to recover the Lorentz contraction on the level of the collective model.</description>

      <title>Separation of variables for higher rank integrable models: review of recent progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Separation of variables (SoV) is a powerful method expected to be applicable for a wide range of quantum integrable systems, from models in condensed matter physics to gauge and string theories. Yet its full implementation for many higher rank examples, such as SU(N) spin chains with N&gt;2, has remained elusive for a long time. In this pedagogical review we discuss the major progress achieved recently in understanding SoV for models of this type. In particular, for rational SU(N) spin chains we describe different constructions of the SoV basis, novel compact forms for spin chain eigenstates, the functional SoV approach, and explicit computation of the SoV measure. We also discuss key first applications of these results, namely the new compact determinant representations for many observables such as scalar products and correlators.</description>

      <title>Quantized Coulomb branch of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $Sp(N)$ gauge theory and spherical DAHA of $(C_N^{\vee}, C_N)$-type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study BPS loop operators in a 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $Sp(N)$ gauge theory with four hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation and one hypermultiplet in the anti-symmetric representation. The algebra of BPS loop operators in the $\Omega$-background provides a deformation quantization of the Coulomb branch, which is expected to coincide with the quantized K-theoretic Coulomb branch in the mathematical literature. For the rank-one case, i.e., $Sp(1) \simeq SU(2)$, we show that the quantization of the Coulomb branch, evaluated using the supersymmetric localization formula, agrees with the polynomial representation of the spherical part of the double affine Hecke algebra (spherical DAHA) of $(C_1^{\vee}, C_1)$-type. For higher-rank cases, where $N \geq 2$, we conjecture that the quantized Coulomb branch of the 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $Sp(N)$ gauge theory is isomorphic to the spherical DAHA of $(C_N^{\vee}, C_N)$-type . As evidence for this conjecture, we demonstrate that the quantization of an 't Hooft loop agrees with the Koornwinder operator in the polynomial representation of the spherical DAHA.</description>

      <title>Continuous Tambara-Yamagami tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new model for continuous tensor categories as algebra objects in the Morita bicategory of $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras. In this setting, we generalize the construction of Tambara-Yamagami tensor categories from finite abelian groups to locally compact abelian groups, and provide a classification of continuous Tambara-Yamagami tensor categories for a locally compact group $G$. A continuous Tambara-Yamagami tensor category associated to a locally compact group $G$ is a continuous tensor category that has a single non-invertible simple object $\tau$ such that $\tau\otimes \tau$ decomposes as a direct integral indexed over $G$, meaning $\tau\otimes\tau \cong L^2(G)$. We show that continuous Tambara-Yamagami tensor categories for $G$ are classified by a continuous symmetric nondegenerate bicharacter $\chi: G\times G\to U(1)$ and a sign $\xi\in\{\pm 1\}$. We also prove that, if a $\mathrm{W}^*$-tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ obeys the Tambara-Yamagami fusion rules, then its associators are automatically continuous in the sense that $\mathcal{C}$ is obtained from a continuous tensor category by forgetting its topology.</description>

      <title>Rotating Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton Black Hole as a Particle Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Similar to particle accelerators, black holes also have the ability to accelerate particles, generating significant amounts of energy through particle collisions. In this study, we examine the horizon and spacetime structures of a rotating black hole within the framework of Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton gravity. Additionally, we extend the analysis to explore particle collisions and energy extraction near this black hole using the Banados-Silk-West mechanism. Our findings reveal that the mass and angular momentum of the colliding particles significantly influence the center of mass energy, more so than the parameters of the black hole itself. Furthermore, we apply the Banados-Silk-West mechanism to massless particles, particularly photons, while disregarding their intrinsic spin in plasma; an aspect that has not been previously explored. The Banados-Silk-West mechanism cannot be directly applied, as the refractive index condition only permits photon propagation, meaning that massive particles in vacuum cannot be included in this study. We derive the propagation conditions for photons and analyze photon collisions by treating them as massive particles in a dispersive medium. The impact of the plasma parameter on the extracted center of mass energy is also examined. Our results show that the plasma parameter has a relatively weak and unchanged effect on the center of mass energy across all cases, indicating that energy losses due to friction within the medium are a contributing factor.</description>

      <title>Discrete-to-Continuum Approach for the Analytic Continuation of One-Particle Propagator on the Circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the simplicity of one-particle dynamics, explicit expressions for the one-dimensional propagator on a circle suitable to numerical evaluation are surprisingly lacking -- not only in the presence of potentials but even in the free case. Using a lattice regularization of the circle, we derive finite expressions for the free discrete propagator through an algebraic approach, aiming to provide physical insight into the readout of a digital quantum simulation. Moreover, these expressions allow for the reconstruction of the propagator in the continuous circle limit, which exhibits in the free case a peculiar non-analytic behavior in its transition between irrational and rational times. The latter propagator yields a finite analytic continuation of the corresponding elliptic theta function at the locus of essential singularities for real times, achieved through the introduction of a $\sigma$ distribution -- the ``square-root'' of the Dirac delta. We also show that the well-known infinite line limit is consistently recovered within this approach. In addition, we apply these results by studying numerically the dynamics of wave packets in cosine and random potentials. At early simulation times, we observe evidence of the semi-classical limit, where the probability density maximum follows the minimum of the propagator phase.</description>

      <title>Cosmological gravitational particle production: Starobinsky vs Bogolyubov, uncertainties, and issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study production of free and feebly interacting scalars during inflation using the Bogolyubov coefficient and Starobinsky stochastic approaches. While the two methods agree in the limit of infinitely long inflation, the Starobinsky approach is more suitable for studying realistic situations, where the duration of inflation is finite and the scalar field has non-trivial initial conditions. We find that the abundance of produced particles is sensitive to pre-inflationary initial conditions, resulting in the uncertainty of many orders of magnitude. Nevertheless, a lower bound on the particle abundance can be obtained. High scale inflation is very efficient in particle production, which leads to strong constraints on the existence of stable scalars with masses below the inflationary Hubble rate. For example, free stable scalars are allowed only if they have masses below an eV or the reheating temperature is in the GeV range or below. We find universal scaling behavior of the particle abundance, which covers free and feebly interacting scalars as well as those with a small non-minimal coupling to gravity. These considerations are important in the context of non-thermal dark matter since inflationary particle production provides an irreducible background for other production mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the thermal effects into the $e^{+}e^{-}\to \ell^{+}\ell^{-}$ scattering in a non-hermitian extension of QED. We compute the thermal contributions to this scattering cross-section within the Thermo Field Dynamics approach. In order to highlight the non-hermitian effects we have considered some limits of interest: i) zero-temperature limit and high-energy limit and ii) high-temperature regime. Since this type of scattering possesses accurate experimental data for the cross-section (for muon and tau at the final state) it can be used to set stringent bounds upon the non-hermitian parameters.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the fine-tunings of nuclear reactions in the Big Bang and in stars and draw some conclusions on the emergence of the light elements and the life-relevant elements carbon and oxygen. We also stress how to improve these calculations in the future. This requires a concerted effort of different communities, especially in nuclear reaction theory, lattice QCD for few-nucleon systems, stellar evolution calculations, particle physics and philosophy.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Quasinormal Modes and the Violation of Isospectrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the Schwarzschild black hole under a noncommutative (NC) deformation of spacetime, constructed via a Drinfeld twist formalism. In this approach, the usual Regge--Wheeler (axial) and Zerilli (polar) equations acquire additional contributions that depend on the NC parameter. Employing semi-analytical approximations (high-order WKB, P\"oschl--Teller and Rosen--Morse), we calculate the corresponding QNM spectra. Our results show that whereas the commutative case preserves the isospectrality of axial and polar modes, noncommutativity systematically violates this degeneracy. The discrepancy grows with the strength of the NC parameter, becoming evident through distinct real and imaginary parts in the ringdown frequencies. These findings highlight the potential of black hole QNMs to serve as probes of quantum-spacetime corrections in strong-field regimes.</description>

      <title>Primordial correlators from multi-point propagators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key step in the comparison between inflationary predictions and cosmological observations is the computation of primordial correlators. Numerical methods have been developed that overcome some of the difficulties arising in analytical calculations when the models considered are complex. The PyTransport package, which implements the transport formalism, allows computation of the tree-level 2- and 3-point correlation functions for multi-field models with arbitrary potentials and a curved field space. In this work we investigate an alternative numerical implementation of the transport approach, based on the use of transfer ''matrices'' called multi-point propagators (MPP). We test the novel MPP method, and extensively compare it with the traditional implementation of the transport approach provided in PyTransport. We highlight advantages of the former, discussing its performance in terms of accuracy, precision and running time, as well as dependence on the number of e-folds of sub-horizon evolution and tolerance settings. For topical ultra-slow-roll models of inflation we show that MPPs (i) precisely track the decay of correlators even when PyTransport produces erroneous results, (ii) extend the computation of squeezed bispectra for squeezing values at least one decade beyond those attainable with PyTransport.</description>

      <title>No Flavor Anisotropy in the High-Energy Neutrino Sky Upholds Lorentz Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering Lorentz-invariance violation (LIV) would upend the foundations of modern physics. Because LIV effects grow with energy, high-energy astrophysical neutrinos provide the most sensitive tests of Lorentz invariance in the neutrino sector. We examine an understudied yet phenomenologically rich LIV signature: compass asymmetries, where neutrinos of different flavors propagate preferentially along different directions. Using the directional flavor composition of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, i.e., the abundances of $\nu_{e}$, $\nu_{\mu}$, and $\nu_{\tau}$ across the sky, we find no evidence of LIV-induced flavor anisotropy in 7.5 years of IceCube High-Energy Starting Events. Thus, we place upper limits on the values of hundreds of LIV parameters with operator dimensions 2-8, tightening existing limits by orders of magnitude and bounding hundreds of parameters for the first time.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Operator Superalgebras and BFV-BRST Operators for Lagrangian Description of Mixed-symmetry HS Fields in AdS Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0812.2329</link>
      <description>arXiv:0812.2329v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the properties of nonlinear superalgebras $\mathcal{A}$ and algebras $\mathcal{A}_b$ arising from a one-to-one correspondence between the sets of relations that extract AdS-group irreducible representations $D(E_0,s_1,s_2)$ in AdS$_d$-spaces and the sets of operators that form $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{A}_b$, respectively, for fermionic, $s_i=n_i+{1/2}$, and bosonic, $s_i=n_i$, $n_i \in \mathbb{N}_0$, $i=1,2$, HS fields characterized by a Young tableaux with two rows. We consider a method of constructing the Verma modules $V_\mathcal{A}$, $V_{\mathcal{A}_b}$ for $\mathcal{A}$, $\mathcal{A}_b$ and establish a possibility of their Fock-space realizations in terms of formal power series in oscillator operators which serve to realize an additive conversion of the above (super)algebra ($\mathcal{A}$) $\mathcal{A}_b$, containing a set of 2nd-class constraints, into a converted (super)algebra $\mathcal{A}_{b{}c}$ = $\mathcal{A}_{b}$ + $\mathcal{A}'_b$ ($\mathcal{A}_c$ = $\mathcal{A}$ + $\mathcal{A}'$), containing a set of 1st-class constraints only. For the algebra $\mathcal{A}_{b{}c}$, we construct an exact nilpotent BFV--BRST operator $Q'$ having nonvanishing terms of 3rd degree in the powers of ghost coordinates and use $Q'$ to construct a gauge-invariant Lagrangian formulation (LF) for HS fields with a given mass $m$ (energy $E_0(m)$) and generalized spin $\mathbf{s}$=$(s_1,s_2)$. LFs with off-shell algebraic constraints are examined as well.</description>

      <title>Local Zeta Functions of Multiparameter Calabi-Yau Threefolds from the Picard-Fuchs Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deformation approach of arXiv:2104.07816 for computing zeta functions of one-parameter Calabi-Yau threefolds is generalised to cover also multiparameter manifolds. Consideration of the multiparameter case requires the development of an improved formalism. This allows us, among other things, to make progress on some issues left open in previous work, such as the treatment of apparent and conifold singularities and changes of coordinates. We also discuss the efficient numerical computation of the zeta functions. As examples, we compute the zeta functions of the two-parameter mirror octic, a non-symmetric split of the quintic threefold also with two parameters, and the $S_5$ symmetric five-parameter Hulek-Verrill manifolds. These examples allow us to exhibit the several new types of geometries for which our methods make practical computations possible. They also act as consistency checks, as our results reproduce and extend those of arXiv:hep-th/0409202 and arXiv:math/0304169. To make the methods developed here more approachable, a Mathematica package "CY3Zeta" for computing the zeta functions of Calabi-Yau threefolds, which is attached to this paper, is presented.</description>

      <title>Stochastic inflation and entropy bound in de Sitter spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the entropy dynamics of de Sitter spacetime during the inflationary phase. The cosmological horizon in de Sitter spacetime, which limits the causally accessible region for an observer, exhibits thermal properties similar to a black hole event horizon. According to holographic principles, the entropy within a causally connected region is bounded by its surface area. However, this entropy bound is violated during the eternal phase of inflation. To address these violations from a quantum information perspective, we adopt a stochastic approach to cosmic inflation. Specifically, we analyze the Shannon entropy of the inflaton field's probability distribution, which mirrors the behavior of the entanglement entropy of a Hubble-sized region in stochastic inflation. Using the volume-weighted probability distribution for the inflaton field, we demonstrate a significant entropy behavior in de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <title>Exploring $G$-ality defects in 2-dim QFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Tambara-Yamagami (TY) fusion category symmetry $\text{TY}(\mathbb{A},\chi,\epsilon)$ describes the enhanced non-invertible self-duality symmetry of a $2$-dim QFT under gauging a finite Abelian group $\mathbb{A}$. We generalize the enhanced non-invertible symmetries by considering twisted gauging which allows stacking $\mathbb{A}$-SPT before and after the gauging. Such non-invertible symmetries correspond to invertible anyon permutation symmetries of the $3$-dim SymTFT. Consider a finite group $G$ formed by (un)twisted gaugings of $\mathbb{A}$, a $2$-dim QFT invariant under topological manipulations in $G$ admits non-invertible $\textit{$G$-ality defects}$. We study the classification and the physical implication of the $G$-ality defects using SymTFT and the group-theoretical fusion categories, with three concrete examples. 1) Triality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$ where $N$ is coprime with $3$. The classification is acquired previously by Jordan and Larson where the data is similar to the $\text{TY}$ fusion categories, and we determine the anomaly of these fusion categories. 2) $p$-ality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p$ where $p$ is an odd prime. We consider two such categories $\mathcal{P}_{\pm,m}$ which are distinguished by different choices of the symmetry fractionalization, a new data that does not appear in the TY classification, and show that they have distinct anomaly structures and spin selection rules. 3) $S_3$-ality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$. We study their classification explicitly for $N &lt; 20$ via SymTFT, and provide a group-theoretical construction for certain $N$. We find $N=5$ is the minimal $N$ to admit an $S_3$-ality and $N=11$ is the minimal $N$ to admit a group-theoretical $S_3$-ality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the SVD entanglement entropy, which has recently come up as a successor to the pseudo entropy. This paper is a first of-its-kind application of SVD entanglement entropy to a system of chiral Dirac oscillators which prove to be a natural system to study the SVD formalism because the two chiral oscillator ground states can be taken as the pre-selected and post-selected states. We argue how this alternative for entanglement entropy is better and more intuitive than the von Neumann one to study quantum phase transition. It is shown that SVD entropy diverges at the critical point, matching von Neumann entropy in the left-handed regime but differing in the right-handed regime. We also provide as an illustrative example, a new generalized proof of the SVD entanglement entropy being log2 for a pair of Bell states that differ from each other by relative phases</description>

      <title>The BRST quantisation of chiral BMS-like field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The BMS$_3$ Lie algebra belongs to a one-parameter family of Lie algebras obtained by centrally extending abelian extensions of the Witt algebra by a tensor density representation. In this paper we call such Lie algebras $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\lambda$, with BMS$_3$ corresponding to the universal central extension of $\lambda = -1$. We construct the BRST complex for $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\lambda$ in two different ways: one in the language of semi-infinite cohomology and the other using the formalism of vertex operator algebras. We pay particular attention to the case of BMS$_3$ and discuss some natural field-theoretical realisations. We prove two theorems about the BRST cohomology of $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\lambda$. The first is the construction of a quasi-isomorphic embedding of the chiral sector of any Virasoro string as a $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\lambda$ string. The second is the isomorphism (as Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras) of any $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\lambda$ BRST cohomology and the chiral ring of a topologically twisted $N{=}2$ superconformal field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19931v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate T-duality transformation on an almost bi-hermitian space with torsion. By virtue of the Buscher rule, we completely describe not only the covariant derivative of geometrical objects but also the Nijenhuis tensor. We apply this description to an almost bi-hermitian space with isometry and investigate integrability on its T-dualized one. We find that hermiticity is not a sufficient condition to preserve integrability under T-duality transformations. However, in the presence of the K\"{a}hler condition, the T-dualized space still admits integrability of the almost complex structures. We also observe that the form of H-flux is suitable for string compactification scenarios.</description>

      <title>Superfield twist-$2$ operators in $\mathcal{N} = 1$ SCFTs and their renormalization-group improved generating functional in $\mathcal{N} = 1$ SYM theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a new construction of superfield collinear twist-$2$ operators as infinite-dimensional, irreducible representations of the collinear superconformal algebra in $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories. As an application, we realize the above representations in terms of free superfields, in a manifestly gauge-invariant and supersymmetric-covariant fashion, in the zero coupling limit of $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory. This realization makes manifest their mixing and renormalization properties at one loop. We also extend to the superfield formalism the perturbative and nonperturbative techniques in [1-7] to a large class of supersymmetric theories that are superconformal in the zero-coupling limit. Specifically, we compute the generating functional of superfield twist-$2$ operators in $\mathcal{N}=1$ SU($N$) SYM theory in the zero coupling limit. We also work out in a closed form the corresponding asymptotic renormalization-group improved generating functional in Euclidean superspace and its planar and leading nonplanar large-$N$ expansion. We verify -- as originally predicted in [5] and verified in the component formalism [3, 4, 6, 7] -- that the leading nonplanar asymptotic RG-improved generating functional matches the structure of logarithm of a functional superdeterminant of the corresponding nonperturbative object, which it should be asymptotic to at short distances because of the asymptotic freedom. Hence, our large-$N$ computation sets strong ultraviolet asymptotic constraints on the nonperturbative solution of large-$N$ $\mathcal{N} = 1$ SYM theory that may be a pivotal guide for the search of such a solution.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Calabi-Yau manifolds in high-precision black hole scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the worldline quantum field theory formalism, we compute the radiation-reacted impulse, scattering angle, radiated energy and recoil of a classical black hole (or neutron star) scattering event at fifth post-Minkowskian and sub-leading self-force orders (5PM-1SF). This state-of-the-art four-loop computation employs advanced integration-by-parts and differential equation technology, and is considerably more challenging than the conservative 5PM-1SF counterpart. As compared with the conservative 5PM-1SF, in the radiation sector Calabi-Yau three-fold periods appear and contribute to the radiated energy and recoil observables. We give an extensive exposition of the canonicalization of the differential equations and provide details on boundary integrations, Feynman rules, and integration-by-parts strategies. Comparisons to numerical relativity are also performed.</description>

      <title>Gravity and Unification: Insights from SL(2N,C) Gauge Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11854v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The perspective that gravity may govern the unification of all known elementary forces calls for an extension of the gauge gravity symmetry group $SL(2,C)$ to the broader local symmetry $SL(2N,C)$, where $N$ reflects the internal $SU(N)$ symmetry subgroup. This extension is shown to lead to a consistent hyperunification framework, provided that the tetrad fields of $% SL(2,C)$ retain their invertibility condition in the extended theory, thus maintaining their connection to gravity. As a result -- while the full gauge multiplet of $SL(2N,C)$ typically comprises vector, axial-vector and tensor field submultiplets of $SU(N)$ -- only the vector submultiplet and singlet tensor field may manifest in an observed particle spectrum. The axial-vector submultiplet remains decoupled from ordinary matter, while the tensor submultiplet acquires the Planck scale order mass. Consequently, the effective symmetry of the theory reduces to $SL(2,C)\times SU(N)$, bringing together $SL(2,C)$ gauge gravity and $SU(N)$ grand unification. As all states in $SL(2N,C)$ are also classified by their spin magnitudes, some $% SU(N)$ grand unified models, including the standard $SU(5)$, appear unsuitable for the standard spin-1/2 quarks and leptons. However, applying $% SL(2N,C)$ symmetry to a model of composite quarks and leptons, where constituent chiral preons form the fundamental representations, identifies $% SL(16,C)$ with its effective $SL(2,C)\times SU(8)$ symmetry accommodating all three quark-lepton families, as the most compelling candidate for hyperunification of the existing fundamental forces.</description>

      <title>Conformal Mapping of Non-Lorentzian Geometries in SU(1,2) Conformal Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11951v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We realize an explicit conformal mapping between the state and operator pictures in a class of (2+1)-dimensional non-Lorentzian field theories with SU(1,2)$\times$U(1) conformal symmetry. The state picture arises from null reducing four-dimensional relativistic conformal field theories on a three-sphere, yielding a non-Lorentzian geometry with the conformal Killing symmetry group SU(1,2). This is complementary to the operator picture recently studied by Lambert et al., where the geometry acquires an $\Omega$-deformation. We then use the geometric mapping between the two pictures to derive a correspondence between the generators. This provides a concrete realization of the state-operator correspondence in non-Lorentzian conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>The Loop-by-Loop Baikov Representation -- Strategies and Implementation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the Baikov representation of Feynman integrals in its standard and loop-by-loop variants. The Baikov representation is a parametric representation, which has as its defining feature the fact that the integration variables are the propagators of the Feynman integral. For the loop-by-loop Baikov representation, we discuss in detail a strategy for how to make an optimal parametrization which is one that minimizes the number of extra integration variables that have to be introduced for a given Feynman integral. Furthermore, we present a Mathematica implementation, named BaikovPackage, that is able to generate the Baikov representation in its standard and loop-by-loop varieties. We also discuss some subtleties and open problems regarding Baikov representations.</description>

      <title>Something Anomalies can tell about SM and Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07470v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This ia a review/research paper on anomalies applied to a bottom-up approach to standard model and gravity. It is divided in two parts. The first consists in a review proper of anomalies in quantum field theories. Anomalies are analyzed according to three different methods: a perturbative one based on Feynman diagram, a non-perturbative one relying on the Schwinger-DeWitt approach and, third, the one hinging on the Atiyah-Singer family's index theorem. The three methods are applied both to chiral gauge anomalies and trace anomalies. The fundamental distinction that our presentation leads to is between obstructive (O) and non-obstructive (NO) anomalies. The former are tied to the non-existence of fermion propagators, which fatally maim the corresponding theory. In the second part we apply this analysis to the SM and various of its extensions immersed in a gravitational background, and find that they all are plagued by a residual chiral trace anomaly. To completely eliminate all kind of dangerous anomalies in SM-like theories we propose a somewhat unconventional scheme, and exemplify it by means of an explicit model. The latter is a left-right symmetric model. We embed it in a Weyl geometry to render it conformal invariant. We then deal with some of its quantum aspects, in particular its even (NO) trace anomalies and the means to preserve its confomal invariance at the quantum level. We briefly review renormalization and unitarity in the framework of similar models discussed in the existing literature. Finally we present a possible (conjectural) application of the model to describe the junction between cosmology and quantum field theory.</description>

Abstract: We study the Borel plane of the topological string free energy on all hypergeometric one-parameter Calabi-Yau models close to singular points in moduli space, focusing on the location of Borel singularities and the value of the associated Stokes constants. We find in particular that in models which exhibit massless D-branes at a singular point, the central charge of the D-brane close to the singular point coincides with the location of the leading Borel singularity, and the generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariant associated to the charge of the D-brane, in as far as its value is known, coincides with the Stokes constant associated to the Borel singularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generally classify the equivalence classes of the $T^2/Z_m$ $(m=2,3,4,6)$ orbifold boundary conditions (BCs) for the $SO(N)$ gauge group. Higher-dimensional gauge theories are defined by gauge groups, matter field contents, and the BCs. The numerous patterns of the BCs are classified into the finite equivalence classes, each of which consists of the physically equivalent BCs. In this paper, we reconstruct the canonical forms of the BCs for the $SO(N)$ gauge group through the ``re-orthogonalization method." All the possible equivalent relations between the canonical forms are examined by using the trace conservation laws. The number of the equivalence classes in each orbifold model is obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has recently been pointed out that rotation in internal space can induce superradiance. We explore this effect in non-topological solitons of the two-field Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin model. This renormalizable model admits very large solitons, making the perturbative scattering equations highly sensitive to boundary conditions and requiring a relaxation method for their solution. We find that the energy extraction rate is strongly influenced by the mass hierarchy of the two scalars, and solitons with lower internal frequencies lead to more peaks in the spectra of the amplification factors. Additionally, we derive absolute bounds on the amplification factors for general ingoing modes using a linear fractional optimization algorithm and establish analytical bounds near the mass gap.</description>

      <title>Freelance Holography, Part I: Setting Boundary Conditions Free in Gauge/Gravity Correspondence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore AdS/CFT duality in the large $N$ limit, where the duality reduces to gauge/gravity correspondence, from the viewpoint of covariant phase space formalism (CPSF). In particular, we elucidate the role of the $W, Y$, and $Z$ freedoms (also known as ambiguities) in the CPSF and their meaning in the gauge/gravity correspondence. We show that $W$-freedom is associated with the choice of boundary conditions and slicing of solution space in the gravity side, which has been related to deformations by multi-trace operators in the gauge theory side. The gauge/gravity correspondence implies the equivalence of on-shell symplectic potentials on both sides, thereby the $Y$-freedom of the gravity side specifies the on-shell symplectic form of the gauge theory side. The $Z$-freedom, which determines the corner Lagrangian on the gravity side, establishes the boundary conditions and choice of slicing in the boundary theory and its solution space. We utilize these results to systematically formulate freelance holography in which boundary conditions of the fields on the gravity side are chosen freely and are not limited to Dirichlet boundary conditions and discuss some examples with different boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: We continue developing the freelance holography program, formulating gauge/gravity correspondence where the gravity side is formulated on a space bounded by a generic timelike codimension-one surface inside AdS and arbitrary boundary conditions are imposed on the gravity fields on the surface. Our analysis is performed within the Covariant Phase Space Formalism (CPSF). We discuss how a given boundary condition on the bulk fields on a generic boundary evolves as we move the boundary to another boundary inside AdS and work out how this evolution is encoded in deformations of the holographic boundary theory. Our analyses here extend the extensively studied T$\bar{\text{T}}$-deformation by relaxing the boundary conditions at asymptotic AdS or at the cutoff surface to be any arbitrary one (besides Dirichlet). We discuss some of the implications of our general freelance holography setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1906.00340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum groups and quantum algebras have received considerable attention in the last decades because they are very useful as mathematical tools of research. Existing proposals for quantum groups have always suggested the idea of deforming a classical object. Motivated by the possibility of anyons in three dimensions ($d=3$), with important consequences to a wide range of fields of physics, in the present work we investigate how the magnetization and other thermodynamic quantities, associated to the Landau diamagnetism problem, depend on the deforming parameter of two models with intermediate statistics: (i) $q$-fermions and (ii) $F$-anyons, and make {\it comparisons between both cases}. In particular, we extend the results from the literature for $q$-fermions by considering {\it second order terms} in the expansion of the grand partition function. Also, we find that for $F$-anyons statistics the magnetization shows a stronger response with respect to magnetic fields compared to magnetization for $q$-fermions statistics. This theoretical outcome may be experimentally verified for instance in superconductors, that are perfect diamagnetic materials with strong magnetic susceptibility, by adjusting impurities or pressure. The latter can be associated to the deforming parameter $q$.</description>

Abstract: We discuss an extra-dimensional braneworld with a 5th dimension compactified on a circle. As a characteristic feature, the warp factor is hyperbolic and separates the hidden and visible branes by a bulk horizon without a singularity. The two most widely separated scales of 4D physics - the 4D Planck mass and 4D cosmological constant - are determined by two physical scales in the extra dimension, namely: $(i)$ the proper size of the extra dimension, $R$, and, $(ii)$ the distance between the visible brane and the horizon, $R_0$. A realistic scale hierarchy between 4D Planck mass and 4D cosmological constant is obtained for $R/R_0\sim2.34$. The usual fine tuning is not reduced but promoted to a fine tuning of two separate brane energy densities that must approach the fundamental scale of the model with very high precision. Our scenario is based on an exact solution to the 5D Einstein equations with a strictly empty bulk and Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric on the 4D branes. This requires positive 4D brane energy densities and describes an adiabatic runaway solution in agreement with the de Sitter swampland conjecture. The Kaluza-Klein (KK) graviton states are solutions of a modified P\"oschl-Teller potential which permits a discrete graviton spectrum of exactly two modes. In addition to the usual massless graviton, our scenario predicts an extra massive spin-2 graviton with a mass gap of $m_1=\sqrt{2}H_0\approx2\times10^{-33}\,\mathrm{eV}$ which might be detectable in the foreseeable future. A KK tower of gravitons, or a possible continuum of massive graviton states, is prohibited by unitarity with respect to the horizon. We discuss hurdles in turning this model into a realistic cosmology at all times, which points us towards 4D brane tensions that that must be raising towards the fundamental scale of the model, while the observable 4D expansion rate is decreasing.</description>

      <title>Nature of Andreev bound states in Josephson junctions of triple-point semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study superconductor-barrier-superconductor (S-B-S) Josephson junctions constructed out of two-dimensional and three-dimensional triple-point semimetals, which feature a threefold degeneracy at a single nodal point. We assume a weak and homogeneous s-wave pairing in each superconducting region, and a potential difference is applied across a piece of normal-state semimetal to create the barrier region. We compute the wavefunctions of the Andreev bound states (ABSs), considering the thin-barrier limit. The appropriate boundary conditions at the S-B and B-S junctions allow us to compute the discrete energy eigenvalues $\pm |\varepsilon| $ of the ABSs. We get two distinct solutions for $|\varepsilon| $. This result differs from that in graphene and Weyl semimetals, where one obtains only one solution for $|\varepsilon| $. The multifold nature of the triple-point fermions is responsible for this difference. We also illustrate the behaviour of the Josephson current flowing across the S-B-S junction.</description>

      <title>Vector-like Quark Stabilised Higgs Inflation: Implications for Particle Phenomenology, Primordial Gravitational Waves and the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02399v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) Higgs potential is likely to be metastable, in which case Higgs Inflation requires an extension of the SM to sufficiently stabilise the Higgs potential. Here we consider stabilisation by adding $n_{Q} \leq 3$ Vector-Like Quarks (VLQs) of mass $m_{Q}$. We consider isosinglet $T$ and $B$ vector quarks. Requiring stability of the finite temperature effective potential, we find that the upper bounds on $m_{Q}$ for $T$ quarks are 5.8 TeV (for $n_{Q} = 2$) and 55 TeV (for $n_{Q} = 3$). The upper bounds are generally smaller for $B$ vector quarks and are sensitive to the $t$-quark mass. The inflation predictions depend upon the conformal frame in which the model is renormalised. For renormalisation in the Einstein frame (Prescription I) the predictions are almost indistinguishable from the classical values: $n_s = 0.966$ and $r = 3.3 \times 10^{-3}$. Renormalisation in the Jordan frame (Prescription II) predicts larger values of $n_{s}$ and $r$, with $n_{s}$ generally in the range 0.980 to 0.990 and $r$ of the order of 0.01. The predicted range of $n_{s}$ is consistent with the CMB range obtained in Hubble tension solutions which modify the sound horizon at decoupling, whilst the predicted values of $r$ will be easily observable by forthcoming CMB experiments. The observational upper bound on $r$ generally imposes a stronger upper bound on $m_{Q}$ in Prescription II than the requirement of stability. We conclude that VLQ-stabilised Higgs Inflation with Prescription II renormalisation favours 1-10 TeV vector-like quarks that will be accessible to future colliders, and predicts a tensor-to-scalar ratio that will be observable in forthcoming CMB experiments and values of $n_{s}$ that favour an early-time solution to the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>On a Matrix Ensemble for Arbitrary Complex Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analytical study of a variation of the eigenvector ensemble initially proposed by Deutsch for the foundations of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). This ensemble, called the $C$-ensemble, incorporates additional system-dependent information, enabling the study of complex quantum systems beyond the universal predictions of Random Matrix Theory (RMT). Specifically, we focus on how system-specific details influence late-time behavior in correlation functions, such as the spectral form factor, and how explicit Hamiltonian corrections not captured by RMT can be included. We demonstrate the consistency of this ensemble with respect to the universal (Haar) results by showing that it defines a unitary 1-design for arbitrary systems and for strongly chaotic systems it becomes an approximated 2-design. Universal expressions for two- and four-point ensemble-averaged correlation functions are derived, revealing how system-dependent information is spectrally decoupled. Furthermore, we show that for small energy windows, the correlation functions defined by this ensemble reduce to the predictions made by the ETH.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative quasinormal modes of Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01402v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational perturbations of the Schwarzschild metric in the context of noncommutative gravity. $r-\varphi$ and $r-t$ noncommutativity are introduced through a Moyal twist of the Hopf algebra of diffeomorphisms. Differential geometric structures such as curvature tensors are also twisted. Noncommutative equations of motion are derived from the recently proposed NC vacuum Einstein equation. Here, in addition to previously calculated axial NC potential, we present the polar solution which generalizes the work done by Zerilli. Quasinormal mode frequencies of the two potentials are calculated using three methods: WKB, P\"oschl-Teller and Rosen-Morse. Notably, we apply the WKB method up to the 13th order and determine the optimal order for each noncommutative parameter value individually. Additionally, we provide comprehensive error estimations for the higher-order WKB calculations, offering insights into the accuracy of our results. By comparing the spectra, we conclude that the classical isospectrality of axial and polar modes is broken upon spacetime quantization. Isospectrality is restored in the eikonal limit.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the two-body problem in Yukawa gravity and in a gravitational extension of the Buckingham potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Keplerian-like parametrization of the two-body problem in Yukawa gravity studied in the literature. Some inconsistencies, which spoil Bertrand's theorem, observed in the $\eta$ parametrization of the true anomaly $\theta$ and in the formulae for the pericenter's advance are resolved. Moreover, inspired in this kind of study, we couple the Buckingham potential, a variation of the Lennard-Jones intermolecular potential, with the gravitational Newtonian potential and find a Keplerian-like parametrization for the solution of the two-body problem in this sort of gravity. The outcomes for the advance of the pericenter in both types of gravity are corroborated by using the Landau and Lifshitz's method. We also tested the expressions thus obtained against Solar System and S2 star data. The result for both models is that while some deviation from general relativity (GR) is allowed, GR cannot be discarded by the current analysis.</description>

      <title>Statistical features of quantum chaos using the Krylov operator complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of Lanczos coefficients over an ensemble of random initial operators generating the Krylov space. We propose two statistical quantities that are important in characterizing the complexity: the average correlation matrix $\langle x_{i} x_{j}\rangle$ of Lanczos coefficients and the resulting distribution of the variance of Lanczos coefficients. Their resulting statistics are the Wishart distribution and the (rescaled) chi-square distribution respectively, which are independent of the distributions of initial operators and become the normal distribution in the case of large matrix size. As a numerical example, we use the typical billiard system with an integrability-breaking term and choose samples of random initial operators from given probability distributions (GOE, GUE and the uniform distribution). It agrees with the phenomenological analysis and further interesting behaviors are obtained, which indicates a consistent connection between RMT, Anderson localization and Krylov complexity.</description>

      <title>Optical gravitational waves as signals of Gravitationally-Decaying Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-lived heavy particles present during the big bang could have a decay channel opened by gravitons. Such decays can produce gravitational waves with large enough abundance to be detectable, and a peculiar narrow spectrum peaked today around optical frequencies. We identify which particles can decay in one or two gravitons. The maximal gravitational wave abundance arises from theories with extra hidden strong gauge dynamics, such as a confining pure-glue group. An interesting abundance also arises in theories with perturbative couplings. Future observation might shed light on early cosmology and allow some spectroscopy of sub-Planckian gravitationally-decaying particles, plausibly present in a variety of theories such as gauge unification, supersymmetry, extra dimensions, strings.</description>

      <title>Emergence of the polydeterminant in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A generalization of the determinant appears in particle physics in effective Lagrangian interaction terms that model the chiral anomaly in Quantum Chromodynamics (PRD 97 (2018) 9, 091901 PRD 109 (2024) 7, L071502), in particular in connection to mesons. This \textit{polydeterminant function}, known in the mathematical literature as a mixed discriminant, associates $N$ distinct $N\times N$ complex matrices into a complex number and reduces to the usual determinant when all matrices are taken as equal. Here, we explore the main properties of the polydeterminant applied to (quantum) fields by using a formalism and a language close to high-energy physics approaches. We discuss its use as a tool to write down novel Lagrangian terms and present an explicit illustrative model for mesons. Finally, the extension of the polydeterminant as a function of tensors is shown.</description>
