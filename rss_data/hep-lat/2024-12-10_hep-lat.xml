      <title>Update of kaon semileptonic form factor using $N_f=2+1$ PACS10 configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the form factors for the kaon semileptonic decay process using the PACS10 configurations, whose physical volume is more than (10 fm)$^4$ very close to the physical point. The configurations were generated with the Iwasaki gauge action and $N_f=2+1$ stout-smeared nonperturbatively $O(a)$-improved Wilson quark action at the three lattice spacings, 0.085, 0.063, and 0.041 fm. We present updated results for the form factors, and discuss their continuum extrapolations, momentum transfer interpolation, and short chiral extrapolation to tune the simulated pion and kaon masses to the physical ones. From the results with various analyses, the systematic error of the form factor at the zero momentum transfer is estimated. The value of $|V_{us}|$ is determined using our result, and is compared with those using the previous calculations and also those determined through the kaon leptonic decay process.</description>

      <title>The Roberge-Weiss endpoint in $(2+1)$-flavor QCD with background magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we discuss our preliminary results regarding the so-called Roberge-Weiss (RW) transition, which is found for imaginary values of the baryon chemical potential, in the presence of a background magnetic field. We perform lattice QCD simulations on $N_t = 6, 8$ lattices with $2+1$ flavors of stout-staggered fermions at physical quark masses and the tree-level Symanzik improved gauge action. We determine the location the RW endpoint at finite magnetic fields and we study the order of the transition.</description>

      <title>Multigrid low-mode averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a generalization of low-mode averaging in which the number of low quark modes of the Dirac operator required for a constant variance reduction can be kept independent of the volume by exploiting their local coherence. Typically in lattice QCD simulations, the benefit of translation averaging quark propagators over the space-time volume is spoiled by large fluctuations introduced by the approximations needed to estimate the average. For quark-line connected diagrams at large separations, most of this additional variance can be efficiently suppressed by the introduction of hierarchical subspaces, thanks to the reduced size of the coarse grid operators that act within the subspaces. In this work, we investigate the contributions to the variance of the isovector vector current correlator with $N_{\mathrm f}=2$ non-perturbatively $\mathrm O(a)$-improved Wilson fermions on lattices approximately of size $L=2,3$ and $4$ $\mathrm {fm}$. The numerical results obtained confirm that the variance decreases as the volume is increased when a multigrid decomposition is used with a fixed number of low modes. While the proposed decomposition can be applied to any quark propagator, it is expected to be especially effective for quark-line connected diagrams at large separations, for example, the isovector contribution to the hadronic vacuum polarization or baryonic correlators.</description>

      <title>Determination of the pseudoscalar decay constant from SU(2) with two fundamental flavors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SU(2) gauge group with two fundamental flavors is a candidate for a composite Higgs extension of the Standard Model. Central to Higgs phenomenology is a non-perturbative determination of observables of the theory, such as the decay constant of the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Bosons. We present preliminary results for the continuum limit of the pseudoscalar decay constant using a mixed-action setup, with non-perturbatively improved stabilized Wilson Fermions on the sea, and maximally twisted valence quarks. Pivotal to this study is the recent porting of our simulation suite HiRep to GPU architecture.</description>

      <title>Study of symmetries in finite temperature $N_f=2$ QCD with M\"obius Domain Wall Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the ongoing study of symmetry of $N_f=2$ QCD around the critical temperature. Our simulations of $N_f = 2$ QCD employ the M\"obius domain-wall fermion action with residual mass $\sim 1\mbox{MeV}$ or less, maintaining a good chiral symmetry. Using the screening masses from the two point spatial correlators we compare the mass difference between channels connected through various symmetry transformations. Our analysis focuses on restoration of the $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ as well as anomalously broken axial $U(1)_A$. We also present additional study of a potential $SU(2)_{CS}$ symmetry which may emerge at sufficiently high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Prediction of an $I(J^{P})=0(1^{-})$ $\bar{b}\bar{b}ud$ Tetraquark Resonance Close to the $B^\ast B^\ast$ Threshold Using Lattice QCD Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use antistatic-antistatic potentials computed with lattice QCD and a coupled-channel Born-Oppenheimer approach to explore the existence of a $\bar{b} \bar{b} u d$ tetraquark resonance with quantum numbers $I(J^P) = 0(1^-)$. A pole in the $\mbox{T}$ matrix signals a resonance with mass $m = 2 m_B + 94.0^{+1.3}_{-5.4} \, \text{MeV}$ and decay width $\Gamma = 140^{+86}_{-66} \, \text{MeV}$, i.e. very close to the $B^\ast B^\ast$ threshold. We also compute branching ratios, which clearly indicate that this resonance is mainly composed of a $B^\ast B^\ast$ meson pair with a significantly smaller $B B$ contribution. By varying the potential matrix responsible for the coupling of the $B B$ and the $B^\ast B^\ast$ channel as well as the $b$ quark mass, we provide additional insights and understanding concerning the formation and existence of the resonance. We also comment on the importance of our findings and the main takeaways for a possible future full lattice QCD investigation of this $I(J^P) = 0(1^-)$ $\bar{b} \bar{b} u d$ tetraquark resonance.</description>

      <title>Investigating the underlying structure of vector hidden-charm tetraquark states via their electromagnetic characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accessing a full picture of the internal structure of hadrons would be a key topic of hadron physics, with the main motivation to study the strong interaction binding the visible matter. Furthermore, the underlying structure of known exotic states remains an unresolved fundamental issue in hadron physics, which is currently being addressed by hadron physics community. It is well known that electromagnetic characteristics can serve as a distinguishing feature for states whose internal structures are complex and not yet fully understood. The aim of this study is to determine the magnetic moments of vector hidden-charm tetraquark states by making use of QCD light-cone sum rules. In order to achieve this objective, the states mentioned above are considered in terms of the diquark-antidiquark structure. Subsequently, a comprehensive examination is conducted, with four distinct interpolating currents being given particular consideration, as these have the potential to couple with the aforementioned states. It has been observed that there are considerable discrepancies between the magnetic moment results extracted employing different diquark-antidiquark structures. Such a prediction may be interpreted as the possibility of more than one tetraquark with the identical quantum numbers and similar quark constituents, but with different magnetic moments. The numerical predictions yielded have led to the conclusion that the magnetic moments of the vector hidden-charm tetraquark states are capable of projecting the inner structure of these states, which may then be used to determine their quark-gluon structure and quantum numbers. In order to provide a comprehensive analysis, the individual quark contributions to the magnetic moments are also examined.</description>

      <title>Truncation-Free Quantum Simulation of Pure-Gauge Compact QED Using Josephson Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum simulation is one of the methods that have been proposed and used in practice to bypass computational challenges in the investigation of lattice gauge theories. While most of the proposals rely on truncating the infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces that these models feature, we propose a truncation-free method based on the exact analogy between the local Hilbert space of lattice QED and that of a Josephson junction. We provide several proposals, mostly semi-analog, arranged according to experimental difficulty. Our method can simulate a quasi-2D system of up to $2\times N$ plaquettes, and we present an approximate method that can simulate the fully-2D theory, but is more demanding experimentally and not immediately feasible. This sets the ground for analog quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories with superconducting circuits, in a completely Hilbert space truncation-free procedure, for continuous gauge groups.</description>

      <title>Lattice calculation of the $\eta_c\eta_c$ and $J/\psi J/\psi$ s-wave scattering length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the s-wave scattering length in the $0^+$ sector of $\eta_c\eta_c$ and the $2^+$ sector of $J/\psi J/\psi$ using three $N_f=2$ twisted mass gauge ensembles with the lattice spacing $a=0.0667,0.085,0.098$ fm, respectively. The scattering lengths are extracted using the conventional L{\"u}scher finite size method. We observe sizable discretization effects and the results after a continuum extrapolation are $a^{0^+}_{\eta_c\eta_c}=-0.104(09)$ fm and $a^{2^+}_{J/\psi J/\psi}=-0.165(16)$ fm. Our results indicate that the interaction between the two respective charmonia are repulsive in nature in both cases.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD study of color correlations between static quarks with gluonic excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the color correlation between static quark and antiquark ($q\bar q$) that is accompanied by gluonic excitations in the confined phase at $T=0$ by constructing reduced density matrices $\rho$ in color space. We perform quenched lattice QCD calculations with the Coulomb gauge adopting the standard Wilson gauge action, and the spatial volume is $L^3 = 32^3$ at $\beta = 5.8$, which corresponds to the lattice spacing $a=0.14$ fm and the system volume $L^3=4.5^3$ fm$^3$. We evaluate the color density matrix $\rho$ of static $q\bar q$ pairs in 6 channels (${\Sigma_g^+}$, ${{\Sigma_g^+}'}$, ${\Pi_u}$, ${\Pi_u'}$, ${\Delta_g}$, ${\Delta_g'}$), and investigate the interquark-distance dependence of color correlations. We find that as the interquark distance increases, the color correlation quenches because of color leak into the gluon field and finally approaches the random color configuration in the $q\bar q$ systems with and without gluonic excitations. For this color screening effect, we evaluate the "screening mass" to discuss its dependence on channels, the quantum number of the gluonic excitations.</description>

      <title>Lattice gradient flows (de-)stabilizing topological sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of topological charge under gradient flow taking the admissibility condition into account. For the $SU(2)$ Wilson gauge theory with $\beta=2.45$ and $L^4=12^4$, we numerically show that the gradient flows with the Iwasaki and DBW2 gauge actions stabilize the topological sectors significantly, and they have qualitatively different behaviors compared with the Wilson and tree-level Symanzik flows. By considering the classical continuum limit of the flow actions, we discuss that the coefficient of dimension-$6$ operators has to be positive for stabilizing the one-instanton configuration, and the Iwasaki and DBW2 actions satisfy this criterion while the Wilson and Symanzik actions do not. Moreover, we observe that the DBW2 flow stabilizes the topological sectors at the very early stage of the flow ($\hat{t}\approx 0.5$--$1$), which suggests that the use of the DBW2 action for the gradient flow is computationally efficient to determine the gauge topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: HiRep allows flexible simulations of higher representations of Wilson Fermions with various actions and gauge groups and a range of inverters and integrators. This is particularly important for enabling evaluations of observables relevant to phenomenological inputs for Beyond-the-Standard-Model physics from lattice field theory. We present progress on the GPU porting of available features, especially in terms of scaling to large jobs on AMD GPUs.</description>
