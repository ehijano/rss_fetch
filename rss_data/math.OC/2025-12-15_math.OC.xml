      <title>Linear quadratic control for discrete-time systems with stochastic and bounded noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the linear quadratic control (LQC) design of systems corrupted by both stochastic noise and bounded noise simultaneously. When only of these noises are considered, the LQC strategy leads to stochastic or robust controllers, respectively. However, there is no LQC strategy that can simultaneously handle stochastic and bounded noises efficiently. This limits the scope where existing LQC strategies can be applied. In this work, we look into the LQC problem for discrete-time systems that have both stochastic and bounded noises in its dynamics. We develop a state estimation for such systems by efficiently combining a Kalman filter and an ellipsoid set-membership filter. The developed state estimation can recover the estimation optimality when the system is subject to both kinds of noise, the stochastic and the bounded. Upon the estimated state, we derive a robust state-feedback optimal control law for the LQC problem. The control law derivation takes into account both stochastic and bounded-state estimation errors, so as to avoid over-conservativeness while sustaining stability in the control. In this way, the developed LQC strategy extends the range of scenarios where LQC can be applied, especially those of real-world control systems with diverse sensing which are subject to different kinds of noise. We present numerical simulations, and the results demonstrate the enhanced control performance with the proposed strategy.</description>

      <title>Finite Convergence of the Moment-SOS Hierarchy on the Product of Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11119v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the polynomial optimization problem of minimizing a multihomogeneous polynomial over the product of spheres. This polynomial optimization problem models the tensor optimization problem of finding the best rank one approximation of an arbitrary tensor. We show that the moment-SOS hierarchy has finite convergence in this case, for a generic multihomogeneous objective function. To show finite convergence of the hierarchy, we use a result of Huang et al. [SIAM J. Optim. 34(4) (2024), pp 3399-3428], which relies on local optimality conditions. To prove that the local optimality conditions hold generically, we use techniques from differential geometry and Morse theory. This work generalizes the main result of Huang [Optim. Lett. 17(5) (2023), pp 1263-1270], which shows finite convergence for the case of a homogeneous polynomial over a single sphere.</description>

      <title>Feedback Synthesis for Nonlinear Systems Via Convex Control Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces computationally efficient methods for synthesizing explicit piecewise affine (PWA) feedback laws for nonlinear discrete-time systems, ensuring robustness and performance guarantees. The approach proceeds by optimizing a configuration-constrained PWA approximation of the value function of an infinite-horizon min-max Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Here, robustness and performance are maintained by enforcing the PWA approximation to be a generalized control Lyapunov function for the given nonlinear system. This enables the generation of feedback laws with configurable storage complexity and pre-determined evaluation times, based on a selected configuration template. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through a constrained Van der Pol oscillator case study, where an explicit PWA controller with certified ergodic performance and specified complexity is synthesized over a large operational domain.</description>

      <title>Descent-Net: Learning Descent Directions for Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11396v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning approaches, known for their ability to model complex relationships and fast execution, are increasingly being applied to solve large optimization problems. However, existing methods often face challenges in simultaneously ensuring feasibility and achieving an optimal objective value. To address this issue, we propose Descent-Net, a neural network designed to learn an effective descent direction from a feasible solution. By updating the solution along this learned direction, Descent-Net improves the objective value while preserving feasibility. Our method demonstrates strong performance on both synthetic optimization tasks and the real-world AC optimal power flow problem, while also exhibiting effective scalability to large problems, as shown by portfolio optimization experiments with thousands of assets.</description>

      <title>Convergence-Guaranteed Algorithms for l1/2-Regularized Quadratic Programs with Assignment Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses a quadratic problem with assignment constraints, an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem arisen from facility location, multiple-input multiple-output detection, and maximum mean discrepancy calculation et al. The discrete nature of the constraints precludes the use of continuous optimization algorithms. Therefore, we begin by relaxing the binary constraints into continuous box constraints and incorporate an l1/2 regularization term to drive the relaxed variables toward binary values. We prove that when the regularization parameter is larger than a threshold, the regularized problem is equivalent to the original problem: they share identical local and global minima, and all Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points of the regularized problem are feasible assignment matrices. To solve the regularized problem approximately and efficiently, we adopt the variable splitting technique, and solve it using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework, in which all subproblems admit closed-form solutions. Detailed theoretical analysis confirms the algorithm's convergence, and finite-step termination under certain conditions. Finally, the algorithm is validated on various numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Safe Bayesian optimization across noise models via scenario programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe Bayesian optimization (BO) with Gaussian processes is an effective tool for tuning control policies in safety-critical real-world systems, specifically due to its sample efficiency and safety guarantees. However, most safe BO algorithms assume homoscedastic sub-Gaussian measurement noise, an assumption that does not hold in many relevant applications. In this article, we propose a straightforward yet rigorous approach for safe BO across noise models, including homoscedastic sub-Gaussian and heteroscedastic heavy-tailed distributions. We provide a high-probability bound on the measurement noise via the scenario approach, integrate these bounds into high probability confidence intervals, and prove safety and optimality for our proposed safe BO algorithm. We deploy our algorithm in synthetic examples and in tuning a controller for the Franka Emika manipulator in simulation.</description>

      <title>What is the optimal way to lie? From microscopic to kinetic descriptions of consensus control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an approach for consensus control of opinion dynamics by introducing a liar to the classical system. The liar's aim is to steer the population towards consensus at their goal opinion by showing 'apparent opinions', or 'lies', to members of the population. We analyse this as an optimal control problem for how best to lie to a population in order to guarantee the consensus that the liar desires. We consider a range of regularisations, each motivated by some social convention, such as the liar wanting to present an opinion close to their true opinion. For each regularisation, we demonstrate the effect of instantaneous controls. Furthermore, we introduce a Boltzmann-type description for the corresponding kinetic system and present analysis and numerical results for the resulting Boltzmann and Fokker-Planck equations.</description>

      <title>On Intensity of Preference Rank Reversal in the AHP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is one of the most widely used multicriteria decision-making methods, with applications from agriculture to space engineering. Despite its popularity, AHP has been repeatedly criticised for rank reversal, a phenomenon in which the ranking of alternatives changes after the addition or removal of an irrelevant or duplicate alternative.
  This paper introduces a new type of rank reversal in AHP, arising when the intensity of preferences is uniformly increased. We show that even when all pairwise preferences preserve their direction and are intensified identically, the eigenvector method may produce a different ordering of alternatives. In contrast, the geometric mean (GM) method is robust to this intensity-of-preference (IOP) rank reversal.
  The applicability of this result is shown through a real decision-making problem taken from a NASA manual concerning capability prioritisation for the planned lunar Gateway orbital station.</description>

      <title>STARK denoises spatial transcriptomics images via adaptive regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an approach to denoising spatial transcriptomics images that is particularly effective for uncovering cell identities in the regime of ultra-low sequencing depths, and also allows for interpolation of gene expression. The method -- Spatial Transcriptomics via Adaptive Regularization and Kernels (STARK) -- augments kernel ridge regression with an incrementally adaptive graph Laplacian regularizer. In each iteration, we (1) perform kernel ridge regression with a fixed graph to update the image, and (2) update the graph based on the new image. The kernel ridge regression step involves reducing the infinite dimensional problem on a space of images to finite dimensions via a modified representer theorem. Starting with a purely spatial graph, and updating it as we improve our image makes the graph more robust to noise in low sequencing depth regimes. We show that the aforementioned approach optimizes a block-convex objective through an alternating minimization scheme wherein the sub-problems have closed form expressions that are easily computed. This perspective allows us to prove convergence of the iterates to a stationary point of this non-convex objective. Statistically, such stationary points converge to the ground truth with rate $\mathcal{O}(R^{-1/2})$ where $R$ is the number of reads. In numerical experiments on real spatial transcriptomics data, the denoising performance of STARK, evaluated in terms of label transfer accuracy, shows consistent improvement over the competing methods tested.</description>

      <title>Clip-and-Verify: Linear Constraint-Driven Domain Clipping for Accelerating Neural Network Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art neural network (NN) verifiers demonstrate that applying the branch-and-bound (BaB) procedure with fast bounding techniques plays a key role in tackling many challenging verification properties. In this work, we introduce the linear constraint-driven clipping framework, a class of scalable and efficient methods designed to enhance the efficacy of NN verifiers. Under this framework, we develop two novel algorithms that efficiently utilize linear constraints to 1) reduce portions of the input space that are either verified or irrelevant to a subproblem in the context of branch-and-bound, and 2) directly improve intermediate bounds throughout the network. The process novelly leverages linear constraints that often arise from bound propagation methods and is general enough to also incorporate constraints from other sources. It efficiently handles linear constraints using a specialized GPU procedure that can scale to large neural networks without the use of expensive external solvers. Our verification procedure, Clip-and-Verify, consistently tightens bounds across multiple benchmarks and can significantly reduce the number of subproblems handled during BaB. We show that our clipping algorithms can be integrated with BaB-based verifiers such as $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN, utilizing either the split constraints in activation-space BaB or the output constraints that denote the unverified input space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our procedure on a broad range of benchmarks where, in some instances, we witness a 96% reduction in the number of subproblems during branch-and-bound, and also achieve state-of-the-art verified accuracy across multiple benchmarks. Clip-and-Verify is part of the $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN verifier (http://abcrown.org), the VNN-COMP 2025 winner. Code available at https://github.com/Verified-Intelligence/Clip_and_Verify.</description>

      <title>Refining Graphical Neural Network Predictions Using Flow Matching for Optimal Power Flow with Constraint-Satisfaction Guarantee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) problem is fundamental to power system operations, requiring rapid solutions for real-time grid management. While traditional optimization solvers provide optimal solutions, their computational cost becomes prohibitive for large-scale systems requiring frequent recalculations. Machine learning approaches offer promise for acceleration but often struggle with constraint satisfaction and cost optimality. We present a novel two-stage learning framework that combines physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Continuous Flow Matching (CFM) for solving DC-OPF problems. Our approach embeds fundamental physical principles--including economic dispatch optimality conditions, Kirchhoff's laws, and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) complementarity conditions--directly into the training objectives. The first stage trains a GNN to produce feasible initial solutions by learning from physics-informed losses that encode power system constraints. The second stage employs CFM, a simulation-free continuous normalizing flow technique, to refine these solutions toward optimality through learned vector field regression. Evaluated on the IEEE 30-bus system across five load scenarios ranging from 70\% to 130\% nominal load, our method achieves near-optimal solutions with cost gaps below 0.1\% for nominal loads and below 3\% for extreme conditions, while maintaining 100\% feasibility. Our framework bridges the gap between fast but approximate neural network predictions and optimal but slow numerical solvers, offering a practical solution for modern power systems with high renewable penetration requiring frequent dispatch updates.</description>

      <title>CORL: Reinforcement Learning of MILP Policies Solved via Branch and Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial sequential decision making problems are typically modeled as mixed integer linear programs (MILPs) and solved via branch and bound (B&amp;B) algorithms. The inherent difficulty of modeling MILPs that accurately represent stochastic real world problems leads to suboptimal performance in the real world. Recently, machine learning methods have been applied to build MILP models for decision quality rather than how accurately they model the real world problem. However, these approaches typically rely on supervised learning, assume access to true optimal decisions, and use surrogates for the MILP gradients. In this work, we introduce a proof of concept CORL framework that end to end fine tunes an MILP scheme using reinforcement learning (RL) on real world data to maximize its operational performance. We enable this by casting an MILP solved by B&amp;B as a differentiable stochastic policy compatible with RL. We validate the CORL method in a simple illustrative combinatorial sequential decision making example.</description>

Abstract: This paper provides global attractivity results for the interior equilibrium point of a general Lotka-Volterra system with no restriction on the dimension of the system and with no special structure or properties of the interaction matrix. The main result contains as special cases all known general results, including the Volterra-Lyapunov theorem and the recently proposed eigenvector conditions. Moreover, global attractivity of the interior equilibrium point is shown for a three-dimensional example, where none of the existing general results can be applied.</description>

Abstract: Mitigation measures are essential for controlling the spread of infectious diseases during pandemics and epidemics, but they impose considerable societal, individual, and economic costs. We developed a general optimization framework to balance costs related to infection and to mitigation. Optimizing the trade-off between mitigation and infection cost, we identified three novel, surprising effects: First, assuming a constant reproduction number $R_0$, the optimal response to an infectious disease requires either strict mitigation or none at all, depending on disease severity, but never does one find an intermediate mitigation level to be optimal. Second, under seasonal variations, optimal mitigation is stricter during winter. Interestingly, a single wave of infections still arises in spring with 3 months delay to the seasonal peak of infectivity, replacing the autumn/winter waves known for classical influenza. Third, during steady vaccination campaigns, even optimal mitigation can result in transient infection waves. Finally, we quantify the cost of delayed mitigation onset and show that even short delays can substantially increase total costs -- if the disease is severe. Overall, our framework is easily applicable to general and complex settings and thereby presents a versatile tool to explore optimal mitigation strategies for endemic and pandemic infectious disease.</description>

      <title>Data-driven control-oriented modelling for MPC-based control of urban drainage systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a data-driven, control-oriented modelling methodology for urban drainage systems (UDS). The proposed framework requires three main key components: input-output data from the element to be modelled, expert knowledge to define the model structure, and data-fitting techniques to obtain optimal parameters. The methodology is evaluated using a realistic benchmark from an UDS in Madrid, Spain. The results show high model accuracy and improved performance within a MPC scheme, reducing discharge and increasing treatment facilities utilization.</description>

      <title>Gradient Descent as a Perceptron Algorithm: Understanding Dynamics and Implicit Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even for the gradient descent (GD) method applied to neural network training, understanding its optimization dynamics, including convergence rate, iterate trajectories, function value oscillations, and especially its implicit acceleration, remains a challenging problem. We analyze nonlinear models with the logistic loss and show that the steps of GD reduce to those of generalized perceptron algorithms (Rosenblatt, 1958), providing a new perspective on the dynamics. This reduction yields significantly simpler algorithmic steps, which we analyze using classical linear algebra tools. Using these tools, we demonstrate on a minimalistic example that the nonlinearity in a two-layer model can provably yield a faster iteration complexity $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d})$ compared to $\Omega(d)$ achieved by linear models, where $d$ is the number of features. This helps explain the optimization dynamics and the implicit acceleration phenomenon observed in neural networks. The theoretical results are supported by extensive numerical experiments. We believe that this alternative view will further advance research on the optimization of neural networks.</description>

      <title>Particle Image Velocimetry Refinement via Consensus ADMM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is an imaging technique in experimental fluid dynamics that quantifies flow fields around bluff bodies by analyzing the displacement of neutrally buoyant tracer particles immersed in the fluid. Traditional PIV approaches typically depend on tuning parameters specific to the imaging setup, making the performance sensitive to variations in illumination, flow conditions, and seeding density. On the other hand, even state-of-the-art machine learning methods for flow quantification are fragile outside their training set. In our experiments, we observed that flow quantification would improve if different tunings (or algorithms) were applied to different regions of the same image pair. In this work, we parallelize the instantaneous flow quantification with multiple algorithms and adopt a consensus framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, seamlessly incorporating priors such as smoothness and incompressibility. We perform several numerical experiments to demonstrate the benefits of this approach. For instance, we achieve a decrease in end-point-error of up to 20% of a dense-inverse-search estimator at an inference rate of 60Hz, and we show how this performance boost can be increased further with outlier rejection. Our method is implemented in JAX, effectively exploiting hardware acceleration, and integrated in Flow Gym, enabling (i) reproducible comparisons with the state-of-the-art, (ii) testing different base algorithms, (iii) straightforward deployment for active fluids control applications.</description>

      <title>On the stability properties of power networks with time-varying inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major transition in modern power systems is the replacement of conventional generation units with renewable sources of energy. The latter results in lower rotational inertia which compromises the stability of the power system, as testified by the growing number of frequency incidents. To resolve this problem, numerous studies have proposed the use of virtual inertia to improve the stability properties of the power grid. In this study, we consider how inertia variations, resulting from the application of control action associated with virtual inertia, may affect the stability properties of the power network within the primary frequency control timeframe. We consider the interaction between the frequency dynamics and a broad class of power supply dynamics in the presence of time-varying inertia and provide locally verifiable conditions, that enable scalable designs, such that stability is guaranteed. To complement the presented stability analysis and highlight the dangers arising from varying inertia, we provide analytic conditions that enable to deduce instability from single-bus inertia fluctuations. Our analytical results are validated with simulations on the Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC) 140-bus and the IEEE New York/New England 68-bus systems, where we demonstrate how inertia variations may induce large frequency oscillations and show that the application of the proposed conditions yields a stable response.</description>

      <title>On degenerate preconditioned proximal point methods under restricted monotonicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08431v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the fundamental properties of the degenerate preconditioned resolvent under restricted monotonicity. We extend key notions of non-expansiveness and demiclosedness to the degenerate case. By deriving an explicit characterization of the solution set of the resolvent, we establish several necessary and sufficient conditions for both the well-posedness of the degenerate resolvent and the weak convergence of the associated degenerate proximal point method -- considered within either the range space of the preconditioner or the entire Hilbert space. These results provide new insights into the behavior of various operator splitting algorithms, particularly within the range space of the preconditioner. Numerical examples extend the augmented Lagrangian method and Douglas--Rachford splitting algorithm to non-convex settings under restricted maximal monotonicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an entropic optimal transport problem in which the transport plan is penalized by a nonlinear convex functional acting on the coupling. We establish existence, uniqueness, and uniform a priori bounds for minimizers, and we show that each minimizer satisfies a fixed-point first-order optimality system associated with an exponentially tilted reference measure. Building on this variational structure, we introduce the Sinkhorn-Frank-Wolfe (SFW) flow, prove its global well-posedness, and derive an energy-dissipation inequality yielding exponential convergence toward the unique optimal transport plan. As an application, we implement the SFW algorithm to solve an optimal routing problem for unmanned aerial vehicles with congestion aversion.</description>

      <title>Balancing Intensity and Focality in Directional DBS Under Uncertainty: A Simulation Study of Electrode Optimization via a Metaheuristic L1L1 Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As DBS technology advances toward directional leads and optimization-based current steering, this study aims to improve the selection of electrode contact configurations using the recently developed L1-norm regularized L1-norm fitting (L1L1) method. The focus is in particular on L1L1's capability to incorporate a priori lead field uncertainty, offering a potential advantage over conventional approaches that do not account for such variability. Our optimization framework incorporates uncertainty by constraining the solution space based on lead field attenuation. This reflects physiological expectations about the VTA and serves to avoid overfitting. By applying this method to 8- and 40-contact electrode configurations, we optimize current distributions within a discretized finite element (FE) model, focusing on the lead field's characteristics. The model accounts for uncertainty through these explicit constraints, enhancing the feasibility, focality, and robustness of the resulting solutions. The L1L1 method was validated through a series of numerical experiments using both noiseless and noisy lead fields, where the noise level was selected to reflect attenuation within VTA. It successfully fits and regularizes the current distribution across target structures, with hyperparameter optimization extracting either bipolar or multipolar electrode configurations. These configurations aim to maximize focused current density or prioritize a high gain field ratio in a discretized FE model. Compared to traditional methods, the L1L1 approach showed competitive performance in concentrating stimulation within the target region while minimizing unintended current spread, particularly under noisy conditions. By incorporating uncertainty directly into the optimization process, we obtain a noise-robust framework for current steering, allowing for variations in lead field models and simulation parameters.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Rate of Stochastic Control Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a quantitative framework for analyzing the mean-square exponential stabilization of stochastic linear systems with multiplicative noise, focusing specifically on the optimal stabilizing rate, which characterizes the fastest exponential stabilization achievable under admissible control policies. Our contributions are twofold. First, we extend norm-based techniques from deterministic switched systems to the stochastic setting, deriving a verifiable necessary and sufficient condition for the exact attainability of the optimal stabilizing rate, together with computable upper and lower bounds. Second, by restricting attention to state-feedback policies, we reformulate the optimal stabilizing rate problem as an optimal control problem with a nonlinear cost function and derive a Bellman-type equation. Since this Bellman-type equation is not directly tractable, we recast it as a nonlinear matrix eigenvalue problem whose valid solutions require strictly positive-definite matrices. To ensure the existence of such solutions, we introduce a regularization scheme and develop a Regularized Normalized Value Iteration (RNVI) algorithm, which in turn generates strictly positive-definite fixed points for a perturbed version of original nonlinear matrix eigenvalue problem while producing feedback controllers. Evaluating these regularized solutions further yields certified lower and upper bounds for the optimal stabilizing rate, resulting in a constructive and verifiable framework for determining the fastest achievable mean-square stabilization under multiplicative noise.</description>

      <title>Linear Quadratic Regulators: A New Look</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear time-invariant control systems can be considered as finitely generated modules over the commutative principal ideal ring $\mathbb{R}[\frac{d}{dt}]$ of linear differential operators with respect to the time derivative. The Kalman controllability in this algebraic language is translated as the freeness of the system module. Linear quadratic regulators rely on quadratic Lagrangians, or cost functions. Any flat output, i.e., any basis of the corresponding free module leads to an open-loop control strategy via an Euler-Lagrange equation, which becomes here a linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. In this approach, the two-point boundary value problem, including the control variables, becomes tractable. It yields notions of optimal time horizon, optimal parameter design and optimal rest-to-rest trajectories. The loop is closed via an intelligent controller derived from model-free control, which is known to exhibit excellent performance concerning model mismatches and disturbances.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on the analysis of the Region of Attraction (RoA) for unknown autonomous dynamical systems. A data-driven approach based on the moment-Sum-of-Squares (SoS) hierarchy is proposed, enabling novel RoA outer approximations despite the reduced information on the dynamics. The main contribution consists of bypassing the system model and, hence, the recurring constraint on its polynomial structure. Numerical experiments showcase the influence of data on learned approximating sets, highlighting the potential of this method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work establishes dual and subdifferential characterizations of $\Gamma$-convergence for sequences of proper convex lower semicontinuous functions in weakly compactly generated Banach spaces, which include separable spaces and also reflexive ones, as well as $L^{1}(\mu)$ when $\mu$ is a $\sigma$-finite measure and $C(K)$ spaces when $K$ is an Eberlein compact topological space. It is shown that such a sequence $\Gamma$-converges in the strong topology to a limit function if and only if the sequence of Fenchel conjugates $\Gamma$-converges in the $w^\ast$-topology to the conjugate of the limit function. It is further proved that both conditions are equivalent to the graphical convergence of the associated subdifferentials with respect to the strong--$w^\ast$ product topology. Counterexamples demonstrate that these equivalences break down outside the weakly compactly generated setting. Furthermore, our approach develops a rich family in weakly compactly generated spaces similar to the one recently used to characterize Asplund spaces [C'uth and Fabian (2016)].</description>

      <title>Small-Gain Nash: Certified Contraction to Nash Equilibria in Differentiable Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical convergence guarantees for gradient-based learning in games require the pseudo-gradient to be (strongly) monotone in Euclidean geometry as shown by rosen(1965), a condition that often fails even in simple games with strong cross-player couplings. We introduce Small-Gain Nash (SGN), a block small-gain condition in a custom block-weighted geometry. SGN converts local curvature and cross-player Lipschitz coupling bounds into a tractable certificate of contraction. It constructs a weighted block metric in which the pseudo-gradient becomes strongly monotone on any region where these bounds hold, even when it is non-monotone in the Euclidean sense. The continuous flow is exponentially contracting in this designed geometry, and projected Euler and RK4 discretizations converge under explicit step-size bounds derived from the SGN margin and a local Lipschitz constant. Our analysis reveals a certified "timescale band", a non-asymptotic, metric-based certificate that plays a TTUR-like role: rather than forcing asymptotic timescale separation via vanishing, unequal step sizes, SGN identifies a finite band of relative metric weights for which a single-step-size dynamics is provably contractive. We validate the framework on quadratic games where Euclidean monotonicity analysis fails to predict convergence, but SGN successfully certifies it, and extend the construction to mirror/Fisher geometries for entropy-regularized policy gradient in Markov games. The result is an offline certification pipeline that estimates curvature, coupling, and Lipschitz parameters on compact regions, optimizes block weights to enlarge the SGN margin, and returns a structural, computable convergence certificate consisting of a metric, contraction rate, and safe step-sizes for non-monotone games.</description>

      <title>A Grover-compatible manifold optimization algorithm for quantum search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grover's algorithm is a fundamental quantum algorithm that offers a quadratic speedup for the unstructured search problem by alternately applying physically implementable oracle and diffusion operators. In this paper, we reformulate the unstructured search as a maximization problem on the unitary manifold and solve it via the Riemannian gradient ascent (RGA) method. To overcome the difficulty that generic RGA updates do not, in general, correspond to physically implementable quantum operators, we introduce Grover-compatible retractions to restrict RGA updates to valid oracle and diffusion operators. Theoretically, we establish a local Riemannian $\mu$-Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) inequality with $\mu = \tfrac{1}{2}$, which yields a linear convergence rate of $1 - \kappa^{-1}$ toward the global solution. Here, the condition number $\kappa = L_{\mathrm{Rie}} / \mu$, where $L_{\mathrm{Rie}}$ denotes the Riemannian Lipschitz constant of the gradient. Taking into account both the geometry of the unitary manifold and the special structure of the cost function, we show that $L_{\mathrm{Rie}} = O(\sqrt{N})$ for problem size $N = 2^n$. Consequently, the resulting iteration complexity is $O(\sqrt{N} \log(1/\varepsilon))$ for attaining an $\varepsilon$-accurate solution, which matches the quadratic speedup of $O(\sqrt{N})$ achieved by Grover's algorithm. These results demonstrate that an optimization-based viewpoint can offer fresh conceptual insights and lead to new advances in the design of quantum algorithms.</description>
