      <title>When Is Degree Enough? Bounds on Degree-Eigenvector Misalignment in Assortative Structured Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tight alignment between the degree vector and the leading eigenvector arises naturally in networks with neutral degree mixing and the absence of local structures. Many real-world networks, however, violate both conditions. We derive bounds on the divergence between the degree vector and the eigenvector in networks with degree assortativity and local mesoscopic structures such as communities, core-peripheries, and cycles. Our approach is constructive. We design sufficiently general degree-preserving rewiring algorithms that start from a neutral benchmark and monotonically increase assortativity and the strength of local structures, with each step inducing a perturbation of the adjacency matrix. Using the Stewart--Sun Perturbation Bound, together with explicit spectral-norm control of the rewiring steps, we derive upper bounds on the angle between the eigenvector and the degree vector for modest levels of assortativity and local structures. Our analytical bounds delineate regions of `spectral safety' in which a node's degree can be used as a reliable measure of its systemic importance in real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Measuring Social Media Polarization Using Large Language Models and Heuristic Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding affective polarization in online discourse is crucial for evaluating the societal impact of social media interactions. This study presents a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and domain-informed heuristics to systematically analyze and quantify affective polarization in discussions on divisive topics such as climate change and gun control. Unlike most prior approaches that relied on sentiment analysis or predefined classifiers, our method integrates LLMs to extract stance, affective tone, and agreement patterns from large-scale social media discussions. We then apply a rule-based scoring system capable of quantifying affective polarization even in small conversations consisting of single interactions, based on stance alignment, emotional content, and interaction dynamics. Our analysis reveals distinct polarization patterns that are event dependent: (i) anticipation-driven polarization, where extreme polarization escalates before well-publicized events, and (ii) reactive polarization, where intense affective polarization spikes immediately after sudden, high-impact events. By combining AI-driven content annotation with domain-informed scoring, our framework offers a scalable and interpretable approach to measuring affective polarization.

      <title>Gendered Pathways in AI Companionship: Cross-Community Behavior and Toxicity Patterns on Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-companionship platforms are rapidly reshaping how people form emotional, romantic, and parasocial bonds with non-human agents, raising new questions about how these relationships intersect with gendered online behavior and exposure to harmful content. Focusing on the MyBoyfriendIsAI (MBIA) subreddit, we reconstruct the Reddit activity histories of more than 3,000 highly engaged users over two years, yielding over 67,000 historical submissions. We then situate MBIA within a broader ecosystem by building a historical interaction network spanning more than 2,000 subreddits, which enables us to trace cross-community pathways and measure how toxicity and emotional expression vary across these trajectories. We find that MBIA users primarily traverse four surrounding community spheres (AI-companionship, porn-related, forum-like, and gaming) and that participation across the ecosystem exhibits a distinct gendered structure, with substantial engagement by female users. While toxicity is generally low across most pathways, we observe localized spikes concentrated in a small subset of AI-porn and gender-oriented communities. Nearly 16% of users engage with gender-focused subreddits, and their trajectories display systematically different patterns of emotional expression and elevated toxicity, suggesting that a minority of gendered pathways may act as toxicity amplifiers within the broader AI-companionship ecosystem. These results characterize the gendered structure of cross-community participation around AI companionship on Reddit and highlight where risks concentrate, informing measurement, moderation, and design practices for human-AI relationship platforms.</description>

      <title>Beyond Homophily: Community Search on Heterophilic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community search aims to identify a refined set of nodes that are most relevant to a given query, supporting tasks ranging from fraud detection to recommendation. Unlike homophilic graphs, many real-world networks are heterophilic, where edges predominantly connect dissimilar nodes. Therefore, structural signals that once reflected smooth, low-frequency similarity now appear as sharp, high-frequency contrasts. However, both classical algorithms (e.g., k-core, k-truss) and recent ML-based models struggle to achieve effective community search on heterophilic graphs, where edge signs or semantics are generally unknown. Algorithm-based methods often return communities with mixed class labels, while GNNs, built on homophily, smooth away meaningful signals and blur community boundaries. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Community Search (AdaptCS), a unified framework featuring three key designs: (i) an AdaptCS Encoder that disentangles multi-hop and multi-frequency signals, enabling the model to capture both smooth (homophilic) and contrastive (heterophilic) relations; (ii) a memory-efficient low-rank optimization that removes the main computational bottleneck and ensures model scalability; and (iii) an Adaptive Community Score (ACS) that guides online search by balancing embedding similarity and topological relations. Extensive experiments on both heterophilic and homophilic benchmarks demonstrate that AdaptCS outperforms the best-performing baseline by an average of 11% in F1-score, retains robustness across heterophily levels, and achieves up to 2 orders of magnitude speedup.</description>

      <title>Fixed-Size Dynamic Scale-Free Networks: Modeling, Stationarity, and Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world scale-free networks, such as neural networks and online communication networks, consist of a fixed number of nodes but exhibit dynamic edge fluctuations. However, traditional models frequently overlook scenarios where the node count remains constant, instead prioritizing node growth. In this work, we depart from the assumptions of node number variation and preferential attachment to present an innovative model that conceptualizes node degree fluctuations as a state-dependent random walk process with stasis and variable diffusion coefficient. We show that this model yields stochastic dynamic networks with stable scale-free properties. Through comprehensive theoretical and numerical analyses, we demonstrate that the degree distribution converges to a power-law distribution, provided that the lowest degree state within the network is not an absorbing state. Furthermore, we investigate the resilience of the fraction of the largest component and the average shortest path length following deliberate attacks on the network. By using three real-world networks, we confirm that the proposed model accurately replicates actual data. The proposed model thus elucidates mechanisms by which networks, devoid of growth and preferential attachment features, can still exhibit power-law distributions and be used to simulate and study the resilience of attacked fixed-size scale-free networks.</description>

Abstract: In this article we propose a generalization of two known invariants of real networks: degree and ksi-centrality. More precisely, we found a series of centralities based on Laplacian matrix, that have exponential distributions (power-law for the case $j = 0$) for real networks and different distributions for artificial ones.</description>

      <title>Inferring Network Evolutionary History via Structure-State Coupled Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring a network's evolutionary history from a single final snapshot with limited temporal annotations is fundamental yet challenging. Existing approaches predominantly rely on topology alone, which often provides insufficient and noisy cues. This paper leverages network steady-state dynamics -- converged node states under a given dynamical process -- as an additional and widely accessible observation for network evolution history inference. We propose CS$^2$, which explicitly models structure-state coupling to capture how topology modulates steady states and how the two signals jointly improve edge discrimination for formation-order recovery. Experiments on six real temporal networks, evaluated under multiple dynamical processes, show that CS$^2$ consistently outperforms strong baselines, improving pairwise edge precedence accuracy by 4.0% on average and global ordering consistency (Spearman-$\rho$) by 7.7% on average. CS$^2$ also more faithfully recovers macroscopic evolution trajectories such as clustering formation, degree heterogeneity, and hub growth. Moreover, a steady-state-only variant remains competitive when reliable topology is limited, highlighting steady states as an independent signal for evolution inference.</description>

      <title>Deep versus Broad Technology Search and the Timing of Innovation Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study offers a new perspective on the depth-versus-breadth debate in innovation strategy, by modeling inventive search within dynamic collective knowledge systems, and underscoring the importance of timing for technological impact. Using frontier machine learning to project patent citation networks in hyperbolic space, we analyze 4.9 million U.S. patents to examine how search strategies give rise to distinct temporal patterns in impact accumulation. We find that inventions based on deep search, which relies on a specialized understanding of complex recombination structures, drive higher short-term impact through early adoption within specialized communities, but face diminishing returns as innovations become "locked-in" with limited diffusion potential. Conversely, when inventions are grounded in broad search that spans disparate domains, they encounter initial resistance but achieve wider diffusion and greater long-term impact by reaching cognitively diverse audiences. Individual inventions require both depth and breadth for stable impact. Organizations can strategically balance approaches across multiple inventions: using depth to build reliable technological infrastructure while pursuing breadth to expand applications. We advance innovation theory by demonstrating how deep and broad search strategies distinctly shape the timing and trajectory of technological impact, and how individual inventors and organizations can leverage these mechanisms to balance exploitation and exploration.</description>

      <title>LOFA: Online Influence Maximization under Full-Bandit Feedback using Lazy Forward Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of influence maximization (IM) in an online setting, where the goal is to select a subset of nodes$\unicode{x2014}$called the seed set$\unicode{x2014}$at each time step over a fixed time horizon, subject to a cardinality budget constraint, to maximize the expected cumulative influence. We operate under a full-bandit feedback model, where only the influence of the chosen seed set at each time step is observed, with no additional structural information about the network or diffusion process. It is well-established that the influence function is submodular, and existing algorithms exploit this property to achieve low regret. In this work, we leverage this property further and propose the Lazy Online Forward Algorithm (LOFA), which achieves a lower empirical regret. We conduct experiments on a real-world social network to demonstrate that LOFA achieves superior performance compared to existing bandit algorithms in terms of cumulative regret and instantaneous reward.</description>

      <title>Strategic Expression, Popularity Traps, and Welfare in Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms systematically reward popularity but not authenticity, incentivizing users to strategically tailor their expression for attention. We develop a utilitarian framework addressing strategic expression in social media. Agents hold fixed heterogeneous authentic opinions and derive (i) utility gains from the popularity of their own posts--measured by likes received--, and (ii) utility gains (losses) from exposure to content that aligns with (diverges from) their authentic opinion. Social media interaction acts as a state-dependent welfare amplifier: light topics generate Pareto improvements, whereas intense topics make everyone worse off in a polarized society (e.g., political debates during elections). Moreover, strategic expression amplifies social media polarization during polarized events while dampening it during unified events (e.g., national celebrations). Consequently, strategic distortions magnify welfare outcomes, expanding aggregate gains in light topics while exacerbating losses in intense, polarized ones. Counterintuitively, strategic agents often face a popularity trap: posting a more popular opinion is individually optimal, yet collective action by similar agents eliminates their authentic opinion from the platform, leaving them worse off than under the authentic-expression benchmark. Preference-based algorithms--widely used by platforms--or homophilic exposures discipline popularity-driven behavior, narrowing the popularity trap region and limiting its welfare effects. Our framework fills a critical gap in the social media literature by providing a microfoundation for user welfare that maps to observable metrics, while also introducing popularity incentives as an unexplored channel in social networks distinct from the canonical mechanisms of conformity, learning, persuasion, and (mis)information transmission.</description>

      <title>Learning Resilient Elections with Adversarial GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the face of adverse motives, it is indispensable to achieve a consensus. Elections have been the canonical way by which modern democracy has operated since the 17th century. Nowadays, they regulate markets, provide an engine for modern recommender systems or peer-to-peer networks, and remain the main approach to represent democracy. However, a desirable universal voting rule that satisfies all hypothetical scenarios is still a challenging topic, and the design of these systems is at the forefront of mechanism design research. Automated mechanism design is a promising approach, and recent works have demonstrated that set-invariant architectures are uniquely suited to modelling electoral systems. However, various concerns prevent the direct application to real-world settings, such as robustness to strategic voting. In this paper, we generalise the expressive capability of learned voting rules, and combine improvements in neural network architecture with adversarial training to improve the resilience of voting rules while maximizing social welfare. We evaluate the effectiveness of our methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our method resolves critical limitations of prior work regarding learning voting rules by representing elections using bipartite graphs, and learning such voting rules using graph neural networks. We believe this opens new frontiers for applying machine learning to real-world elections.</description>

      <title>Tales of the 2025 Los Angeles Fire: Hotwash for Public Health Concerns in Reddit via LLM-Enhanced Topic Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wildfires have become increasingly frequent, irregular, and severe in recent years. Understanding how affected populations perceive and respond during wildfire crises is critical for timely and empathetic disaster response. Social media platforms offer a crowd-sourced channel to capture evolving public discourse, providing hyperlocal information and insight into public sentiment. This study analyzes Reddit discourse during the 2025 Los Angeles wildfires, spanning from the onset of the disaster to full containment. We collect 385 posts and 114,879 comments related to the Palisades and Eaton fires. We adopt topic modeling methods to identify the latent topics, enhanced by large language models (LLMs) and human-in-the-loop (HITL) refinement. Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical framework to categorize latent topics, consisting of two main categories, Situational Awareness (SA) and Crisis Narratives (CN). The volume of SA category closely aligns with real-world fire progressions, peaking within the first 2-5 days as the fires reach the maximum extent. The most frequent co-occurring category set of public health and safety, loss and damage, and emergency resources expands on a wide range of health-related latent topics, including environmental health, occupational health, and one health. Grief signals and mental health risks consistently accounted for 60 percentage and 40 percentage of CN instances, respectively, with the highest total volume occurring at night. This study contributes the first annotated social media dataset on the 2025 LA fires, and introduces a scalable multi-layer framework that leverages topic modeling for crisis discourse analysis. By identifying persistent public health concerns, our results can inform more empathetic and adaptive strategies for disaster response, public health communication, and future research in comparable climate-related disaster events.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Analysis of Instagram and TikTok as Islamic da'wahh Media in the Digital Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research aims to analyze and compare the effectiveness of Islamic da'wahh on two popular social me dia platforms, namely Instagram and TikTok. The analysis is conducted based on four main aspects: media characteristics, da'wahh communication strategies, audience engagement effec tiveness, and user behavioral responses. The research employs a a mixed-methods approach integrating qualitative content analysis and descriptive quantitative metrics through observations of the popular da'wahh account @hananattakistory during the period of October to November 2025. The findings indicate that TikTok excels in the effectiveness of disseminating da'wahh messages through high interaction rates, achieving an engagement rate of 1.42%. In contrast, Instagram records a higher total interac tion with an engagement rate of 5.47%, reflecting deeper and more reflective audience involvement. Qualitative analysis shows that TikTok is more effective in the initial stage of capturing audience attention (awareness), while Instagram is stronger in building loyalty and fostering a digital da'wahh community. Thus, combining the use of both platforms can serve as a complementary digital da'wahh strategy, expanding reach while deepening the understanding of Islamic values in the era of social media. The main contribution of this study lies in its comparative, empirically grounded approach that integrates both qualitative and quantitative analyses to map the effectiveness of da'wahh across platforms, providing a strategic foundation for developing adaptive and contextual digital da'wahh for young Muslim audiences.</description>

      <title>Effects of algorithmic flagging on fairness: quasi-experimental evidence from Wikipedia</title>

Abstract: Online community moderators often rely on social signals such as whether or not a user has an account or a profile page as clues that users may cause problems. Reliance on these clues can lead to "overprofiling'' bias when moderators focus on these signals but overlook the misbehavior of others. We propose that algorithmic flagging systems deployed to improve the efficiency of moderation work can also make moderation actions more fair to these users by reducing reliance on social signals and making norm violations by everyone else more visible. We analyze moderator behavior in Wikipedia as mediated by RCFilters, a system which displays social signals and algorithmic flags, and estimate the causal effect of being flagged on moderator actions. We show that algorithmically flagged edits are reverted more often, especially those by established editors with positive social signals, and that flagging decreases the likelihood that moderation actions will be undone. Our results suggest that algorithmic flagging systems can lead to increased fairness in some contexts but that the relationship is complex and contingent.</description>
