      <title>Single-channel and multi-channel electrospinning for the fabrication of PLA/PCL tissue engineering scaffolds: comparative study of the materials physicochemical and biological properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fabrication of tissue engineering scaffolds with tailored physicochemical and biological characteristics is a relevant task in biomedical engineering. The present work was focused at the evaluation of the effect of fabrication approach (single-channel or multi-channel electrospinning) on the properties of the fabricated poly(lactic acid)(PLA)/poly(epsilon-caprolactone)(PCL) scaffolds with various polymer mass ratios (1/0, 2/1, 1/1, 1/2, and 0/1). The scaffolds with same morphology (regardless of electrospinning variant) were fabricated and characterized using SEM, water contact angle measurement, FTIR, XRD, tensile testing and in vitro experiment with multipotent mesenchymal stem cells. It was demonstrated, that multi-channel electrospinning prevents intermolecular interactions between the polymer components of the scaffold, preserving their crystal structure, what affects the mechanical characteristics of the scaffold (particularly, leads to 2-fold difference in elongation). Better adhesion of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells on the surface of the scaffolds fabricated using multichannel electrospinning was demonstrated.</description>

      <title>NIR ICG-Enhanced Fluorescence: A Quantitative Evaluation of Bowel Microperfusion and Its Relation to Central Perfusion in Colorectal Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: To date, no standardized protocols nor a quantitative assessment of the near-infrared fluorescence angiography with indocyanine green (NIR-ICG) are available. The aim of this study was to evaluate the timing of fluorescence as a reproducible parameter and its efficacy in predicting anastomotic leakage (AL) in colorectal surgery. Methods: A consecutive cohort of 108 patients undergoing minimally invasive elective procedures for colorectal cancer was prospectively enrolled. The difference between macro and microperfusion DeltaT was obtained by calculating the timing of fluorescence at the level of iliac artery division and colonic wall, respectively. Results: Subjects with a DeltaT higher 15.5 s had a higher tendency to develop an AL (p lower 0.01). The DeltaT/heart rate interaction was found to predict AL with an odds ratio of 1.02 (p lower 0.01); a cut-off threshold of 832 was identified (sensitivity 0.86, specificity 0.77). Perfusion parameters were also associated with a faster bowel motility resumption and a reduced length of hospital stay. Conclusions: The analysis of the timing of fluorescence provides a quantitative, easy evaluation of tissue perfusion. A DeltaT/HR interaction higher 832 may be used as a real-time parameter to guide surgical decision making in colorectal surgery.</description>

      <title>Advancing Gene Selection in Oncology: A Fusion of Deep Learning and Sparsity for Precision Gene Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gene selection plays a pivotal role in oncology research for improving outcome prediction accuracy and facilitating cost-effective genomic profiling for cancer patients. This paper introduces two gene selection strategies for deep learning-based survival prediction models. The first strategy uses a sparsity-inducing method while the second one uses importance based gene selection for identifying relevant genes. Our overall approach leverages the power of deep learning to model complex biological data structures, while sparsity-inducing methods ensure the selection process focuses on the most informative genes, minimizing noise and redundancy. Through comprehensive experimentation on diverse genomic and survival datasets, we demonstrate that our strategy not only identifies gene signatures with high predictive power for survival outcomes but can also streamlines the process for low-cost genomic profiling. The implications of this research are profound as it offers a scalable and effective tool for advancing personalized medicine and targeted cancer therapies. By pushing the boundaries of gene selection methodologies, our work contributes significantly to the ongoing efforts in cancer genomics, promising improved diagnostic and prognostic capabilities in clinical settings.</description>
