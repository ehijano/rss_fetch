      <title>The NHIM development scenario in an asymmetric binary system of dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the development scenario of a three-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian system.We observe how the fundamental normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds (NHIMs) form a homoclinic/heteroclinic tangle. As the energy increases, the NHIMs begin to lose normal hyperbolicity and decay, creating tangential transient effects. We also observe a certain kind of coordination between the development scenarios of these NHIMs. We analyse this phenomenon using Poincar\'e maps and phase space indicator functions. As an example of demonstration, we use a relatively simple model of a test particle moving in the gravitational field of a pair of interacting dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Recurrence Patterns Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrence plots (RPs) are powerful tools for visualizing time series dynamics; however, traditional Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) often relies on global metrics, such as line counting, that can overlook system-specific, localized structures. To address this, we introduce Recurrence Pattern Correlation (RPC), a quantifier inspired by spatial statistics that bridges the gap between qualitative RP inspection and quantitative analysis. RPC is designed to measure the correlation degree of an RP to patterns of arbitrary shape and scale. By choosing patterns with specific time lags, we visualize the unstable manifolds of periodic orbits within the Logistic map bifurcation diagram, dissect the mixed phase space of the Standard map, and track the unstable periodic orbits of the Lorenz '63 system's 3-dimensional phase space. This framework reveals how long-range correlations in recurrence patterns encode the underlying properties of nonlinear dynamics and provides a more flexible tool to analyze pattern formation in RPs.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Coupling Knowledge into Echo State Networks for Learning Spatiotemporally Chaotic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning methods have shown promise in learning chaotic dynamical systems, enabling model-free short-term prediction and attractor reconstruction. However, when applied to large-scale, spatiotemporally chaotic systems, purely data-driven machine learning methods often suffer from inefficiencies, as they require a large learning model size and a massive amount of training data to achieve acceptable performance. To address this challenge, we incorporate the spatial coupling structure of the target system as an inductive bias in the network design. Specifically, we introduce physics-guided clustered echo state networks, leveraging the efficiency of the echo state networks as a base model. Experimental results on benchmark chaotic systems demonstrate that our physics-informed method outperforms existing echo state network models in learning the target chaotic systems. Additionally, we numerically demonstrate that leveraging coupling knowledge into ESN models can enhance their robustness to variations of training and target system conditions. We further show that our proposed model remains effective even when the coupling knowledge is imperfect or extracted directly from time series data. We believe this approach has the potential to enhance other machine-learning methods.</description>

      <title>Unifying Framework for Amplification Mechanisms: Criticality, Resonance and Non-Normality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We bring together three key amplification mechanisms in linear dynamical systems: spectral criticality, resonance, and non-normality. We present a unified linear framework that both distinguishes and quantitatively links these effects through two fundamental parameters: (i) the spectral distance to a conventional bifurcation or to a resonance and (ii) a non-normal index $K$ (or condition number $\kappa$) that measures the obliqueness of the eigenvectors. Closed-form expressions for the system's response in the form of the variance $v_\infty$ of the observable responding to both Gaussian noise and periodic forcing reveal a general amplification law $v_\infty = v_0 \left( 1 + \mathcal{G}(K) \right)$ with non-normal gain $\mathcal{G}(K) \propto K^2$ represented in universal phase diagrams. By reanalyzing a model of remote earthquake triggering based on breaking of Hamiltonian symmetry, we illustrate how our two-parameter framework significantly expands both the range of conditions under which amplification can occur and the magnitude of the resulting response, revealing a broad pseudo-critical regime associated with large $\kappa$ that previous single-parameter approaches overlooked. Similarly, in the Non-Hermitian extensions of quantum optics provided by Forward Four-Wave Mixing (FFWM) experiments, we show the presence of a counterintuitive gain-from-loss effect that directly manifests non-normal amplification in a propagating-wave setting. This predicts the possibility to engineer transient optical energy amplification without the need for true lasing or exact $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking. Our framework applies to many other physical, natural and social systems and offers new diagnostic tools to distinguish true critical behavior from transient amplification driven by non-normality.</description>
