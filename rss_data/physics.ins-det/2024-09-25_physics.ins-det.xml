      <title>An integrated evanescent-field biosensor in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized diagnostic testing that is accurate, portable, quantitative, and capable of making multiple simultaneous measurements of different biomarkers at the point-of-need remains an important unmet need in the post-pandemic world. Resonator-based biosensors using silicon photonic integrated circuits are a promising technology to meet this need, as they can leverage (1) semiconductor manufacturing economies of scale, (2) exquisite optical sensitivity, and (3) the ability to integrate tens to hundreds of sensors on a millimeter-scale photonic chip. However, their application to decentralized testing has historically been limited by the expensive, bulky tunable lasers and alignment optics required for their readout. In this work, we introduce a segmented sensor architecture that addresses this important challenge by facilitating resonance-tracking readout using a fixed-wavelength laser. The architecture incorporates an in-resonator phase shifter modulated by CMOS drivers to periodically sweep and acquire the resonance peak shifts as well as a distinct high-sensitivity sensing region, maintaining high performance at a fraction of the cost and size. We show, for the first time, that fixed-wavelength sensor readout can offer similar performance to traditional tunable laser readout, demonstrating a system limit of detection of 6.1 x 10-5 RIU as well as immunoassay-based detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We anticipate that this sensor architecture will open the door to a new data-rich class of portable, accurate, multiplexed diagnostics for decentralized testing.</description>

      <title>PSpice modeling of the pulsed electroacoustic method for dispersive polymer sample application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In space applications, space charge inside dielectric materials can lead to unwanted phenomena such as breakdown and electrostatic discharge. To prevent such incidents, the pulsed electroacoustic (PEA) device is employed to measure the space charge of dielectric samples. Unfortunately, most of the current PEA signal processing methods are inaccurate in studying the dielectric materials that attenuate and disperse the acoustic wave, as well as studying multi-layer or thin samples. A model under the PSpice software is developed in this work with the aim of improving the PEA signal processing. This model is an evolution of previous works, including the attenuation and dispersion of a polymer sample using the nearly local Kramers--Kronig relation. This model of the polymer sample is implemented into PSpice as a frequency dependent transmission line using Branin's method of characteristics model. A comparison of a model simulation and an experimental PEA signal obtained from a PTFE sample is presented.</description>

      <title>Phase noise measurement by zero-crossing analysis with a double recorder setup in the radiofrequency range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase noise of low-noise oscillators is conventionally measured by the cross-spectrum method (CSM), which has a complicated setup. We developed an alternative method called zero-crossing analysis with a double recorder setup (ZCA-DRS) that has much simpler configuration, which we previously demonstrated to measure phase noise in the audible frequency range. In this study we conducted experiments using ZCA-DRS to measure phase noise in the radiofrequency range. A temperature-compensated crystal oscillator was used to generate a periodic signal at 27 MHz. The results demonstrated that the obtained single-side band spectrum was almost the same as that obtained by CSM. The measurement sensitivity was limited by the jitter of the internal clock and noise of the analog-to-digital converter. Thus, ZCA-DRS can be used as an alternative to CSM for phase noise measurement in the radiofrequency range.</description>

      <title>In-flight pixel degradation of the Sentinel 5 Precursor TROPOMI-SWIR HgCdTe detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TROPOMI-SWIR HgCdTe detector on the Sentinel-5 Precursor mission has been performing in-orbit measurements of molecular absorption in Earth's atmosphere since its launch in October 2017. In its polar orbit the detector is continuously exposed to potentially harmful energetic particles. Calibration measurements taken during the eclipse are used to inspect the performance of this detector. This paper explores the in-orbit degradation of the HgCdTe detector. After five years, the detector is still performing within specifications, even though pixels are continuously hit by cosmic radiation. The bulk of the impacts have no lasting effects, and most of the damaged pixels (95%) appear to recover on the order of a few days to several months, attributed to a slow spontaneous recovery of defects in the HgCdTe detector material. This is observed at the operational temperature of 140 K. The distribution of the observed recovery times has a mean around nine days with a significant tail towards several months. Pixels that have degraded have a significant probability to degrade again. The location of faulty pixels follows a Poissonian distribution across the detector. No new clusters have appeared, revealing that impacts are dominated by relatively low energetic protons and electrons. Due to the observed spontaneous recovery of pixels, the fraction of pixels meeting all quality requirements in the nominal operations phase has always been over 98.7%. The observed performance of the TROPOMI-SWIR detector in-flight impacts selection criteria of HgCdTe detectors for future space instrumentation.</description>

      <title>COSINE-100U: Upgrading the COSINE-100 Experiment for Enhanced Sensitivity to Low-Mass Dark Matter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An upgrade of the COSINE-100 experiment, COSINE-100U, has been prepared for installation at Yemilab, a new underground laboratory in Korea, following 6.4 years of operation at the Yangyang Underground Laboratory. The COSINE-100 experiment aimed to investigate the annual modulation signals reported by the DAMA/LIBRA but observed a null result, revealing a more than 3$\sigma$ discrepancy. COSINE-100U seeks to explore new parameter spaces for dark matter detection using NaI(Tl) detectors. All eight NaI(Tl) crystals, with a total mass of 99.1 kg, have been upgraded to improve light collection efficiency, significantly enhancing dark matter detection sensitivity. This paper describes the detector upgrades, performance improvements, and the enhanced sensitivity to low-mass dark matter detection in the COSINE-100U experiment.</description>

      <title>Cascade switching current detectors based on arrays of Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cascade multiplication is a common technique to enhance the sensitivity of photon detectors. In this study, we demonstrate novel cascade-amplified superconducting detectors utilizing arrays of Josephson junctions. The mutual coupling between junctions induces avalanche-like switching of multiple junctions upon photon absorption, leading to cascade amplification of the readout voltage. We present two prototypes featuring either low-Tc linear Nb arrays, or high-Tc stacked intrinsic Josephson junctions. Both devices exhibit clear antenna effects indicating good impedance matching and absorption efficiency. The combination of high absorption efficiency and large cascade amplification has the potential to produce broadband THz sensors with sensitivity exceeding 1e13 V/W</description>

      <title>Simple, highly-stable transfer cavity for laser stabilization based on a carbon-fiber reinforced polymer spacer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the design and operation of a high-stability Fabry-Perot cavity, for laser stabilization in cavity quantum-electrodynamics experiments. Our design is based on an inexpensive and readily available uniaxial carbon-fiber reinforced polymer tube spacer, featuring an ultra-low thermal expansion coefficient. As a result, our $136\mathrm{mm}$-long cavity, which has a finesse of ${5160}$, shows a coefficient of thermal expansion of $1.6 \times 10^{-6}~\mathrm{K}^{-1}$. Enclosing it in a hermetic chamber at room-pressure and using a simple temperature stabilization, we observe absolute frequency excursions over a full day below $50~\mathrm{MHz}$ for a laser operating at $446.785\mathrm{THz}$. The frequency stability is limited by the imperfect thermal isolation from the environment and can be corrected using a built-in piezo-electric actuator. In addition, we discuss a different variant of this design and identify future improvements. Our system provides a cost-effective and robust solution for transferring laser stability over different wavelengths, as well as for linewidth reduction or spectral filtering of CW laser sources for applications in quantum science.</description>

      <title>Microsecond-Latency Feedback at a Particle Accelerator by Online Reinforcement Learning on Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The commissioning and operation of future large-scale scientific experiments will challenge current tuning and control methods. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are a promising solution thanks to their capability of autonomously tackling a control problem based on a task parameterized by a reward function. The conventionally utilized machine learning (ML) libraries are not intended for microsecond latency applications, as they mostly optimize for throughput performance. On the other hand, most of the programmable logic implementations are meant for computation acceleration, not being intended to work in a real-time environment. To overcome these limitations of current implementations, RL needs to be deployed on-the-edge, i.e. on to the device gathering the training data. In this paper we present the design and deployment of an experience accumulator system in a particle accelerator. In this system deep-RL algorithms run using hardware acceleration and act within a few microseconds, enabling the use of RL for control of ultra-fast phenomena. The training is performed offline to reduce the number of operations carried out on the acceleration hardware. The proposed architecture was tested in real experimental conditions at the Karlsruhe research accelerator (KARA), serving also as a synchrotron light source, where the system was used to control induced horizontal betatron oscillations in real-time. The results showed a performance comparable to the commercial feedback system available at the accelerator, proving the viability and potential of this approach. Due to the self-learning and reconfiguration capability of this implementation, its seamless application to other control problems is possible. Applications range from particle accelerators to large-scale research and industrial facilities.</description>

      <title>An Accessible Instrument for Measuring Soft Material Mechanical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft material research has seen significant growth in recent years, with emerging applications in robotics, electronics, and healthcare diagnostics where understanding material mechanical response is crucial for precision design. Traditional methods for measuring nonlinear mechanical properties of soft materials require specially sized samples that are extracted from their natural environment to be mounted on the testing instrument. This has been shown to compromise data accuracy and precision in various soft and biological materials. To overcome this, the Volume Controlled Cavity Expansion (VCCE) method was developed. This technique tests soft materials by controlling the formation rate of a liquid cavity inside the materials at the tip of an injection needle, and simultaneously measuring the resisting pressure which describes the material response. Despite VCCE's early successes, expansion of its application beyond academia has been hindered by cost, size, and expertise. In response to this, the first portable, bench-top instrument utilizing VCCE is presented here. This device, built with affordable, readily available components and open-source software, streamlines VCCE experimentation without sacrificing performance or precision. It is especially suitable for space-limited settings and designed for use by non-experts, promoting widespread adoption. The instrument's efficacy was demonstrated through testing Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) samples of varying stiffness. This study not only validates instrument performance, but also sets the stage for further advancements and broader applications in soft material testing. All data, along with acquisition, control, and post-processing scripts, are made available on GitHub.</description>

Abstract: MADMAX, a future experiment to search for axion dark matter, is based on a novel detection concept called the dielectric haloscope. It consists of a booster composed of several dielectric disks positioned with $\mu$m precision. A prototype composed of one movable disk was built to demonstrate the mechanical feasibility of such a booster in the challenging environment of the experiment: high magnetic field to convert the axions into photons and cryogenic temperature to reduce the thermal noise. It was tested both inside a strong magnetic field up to 1.6 T and at cryogenic temperatures down to 35K. The measurements of the velocity and positioning accuracy of the disk are shown and are found to match the MADMAX requirements.</description>

Abstract: Nano-positioning plays a very important role in applications such as scanning probe microscopy and optics. We report the development of a compact inertial nanopositioner along with fully computer interfaced electronics operating down to 2 K, and its use in our fully automated needle-anvil type Point Contact Andreev Reflection (PCAR) apparatus. We also present the fully automated operational procedures using LabVIEW interface with our home-built electronics. The point contact spectroscopy probe has been successfully used to perform PCAR measurements on elemental superconductors at low temperatures. The small footprint of our nano-positioner makes it ideally suited for incorporation in low temperature scanning probe microscopes and makes this design versatile for various research and industrial purposes.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical dark matter instrument for direct detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the Optomechanical Dark-matter INstrument (ODIN), based on a new method for the direct detection of low-mass dark matter. We consider dark matter interacting with superfluid helium in an optomechanical cavity. Using an effective field theory, we calculate the rate at which dark matter scatters off phonons in a highly populated, driven acoustic mode of the cavity. This scattering process deposits a phonon into a second acoustic mode in its ground state. The deposited phonon ($\mu$eV range) is then converted to a photon (eV range) via an optomechanical interaction with a pump laser. This photon can be efficiently detected, providing a means to sensitively probe keV scale dark matter. We provide realistic estimates of the backgrounds and discuss the technical challenges associated with such an experiment. We calculate projected limits on dark matter-nucleon interactions for dark matter masses ranging from 0.5 to 300 keV and estimate that a future device could probe cross-sections as low as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-32})$ cm$^2$.</description>

Abstract: A central issue in the design of tokamaks or stellarators is the coils that produce the external magnetic fields. The freedom that remains unstudied in the design of coils is enormous. This freedom could be quickly studied computationally at low cost with high reliability. In particular, the space between toroidal field or modular coils that block access to the plasma chamber could be increased by a large factor. The concept of current-potential patches, which was developed in Todd Elder's thesis, provides a method for separating the study of the feasibility of coils with attractive physics properties from the engineering design of specific coils. In addition to enhanced accessibility, coils can be designed for increased plasma-coil separation, insensitivity to coil position errors, and plasma control.</description>
