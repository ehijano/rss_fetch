      <title>Finite-dimensional pseudofinite groups of small dimension, without CFSG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any simple pseudofinite group G is known to be isomorphic to a (twisted) Chevalley group over a pseudofinite field. This celebrated result mostly follows from the work of Wilson in 1995 and heavily relies on the classification of finite simple groups (CFSG). It easily follows that G is finite-dimensional with additive and fine dimension and, in particular, that if dim(G)=3 then G is isomorphic to PSL(2,F) for some pseudofinite field F. We describe pseudofinite finite-dimensional groups when the dimension is fine, additive and \&lt;4 and, in particular, show that the classification G isomorphic to PSL(2,F) is independent from CFSG.</description>

      <title>Boolean basis, formula size, and number of modal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Is it possible to write significantly smaller formulae when using Boolean operators other than those of the De Morgan basis (and, or, not, and the constants)? For propositional logic, a negative answer was given by Pratt: formulae over one set of operators can always be translated into an equivalent formula over any other complete set of operators with only polynomial increase in size. Surprisingly, for modal logic the picture is different: we show that elimination of bi-implication is only possible at the cost of an exponential number of occurrences of the modal operator $\lozenge$ and therefore of an exponential increase in formula size, i.e., the De Morgan basis and its extension by bi-implication differ in succinctness. Moreover, we prove that any complete set of Boolean operators agrees in succinctness with the De Morgan basis or with its extension by bi-implication. More precisely, these results are shown for the modal logic $\mathrm{T}$ (and therefore for $\mathrm{K}$). We complement them showing that the modal logic $\mathrm{S5}$ behaves as propositional logic: the choice of Boolean operators has no significant impact on the size of formulae.</description>

      <title>Terminal Coalgebras and Non-wellfounded Sets in Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.06696v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-wellfounded material sets have previously been modeled in Martin-L\"of type theory by Lindstr\"om using setoids. In this paper we construct models of non-wellfounded material sets in Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) where equality is interpreted as the identity type. The first model satisfies Scott's Anti-Foundation Axiom (SAFA) and dualises the construction of iterative sets. The second model satisfies Aczel's Anti-Foundation Axiom (AFA), and is constructed by adaption of Aczel--Mendler's terminal coalgebra theorem to type theory, which requires propositional resizing.
  In an bid to extend coalgebraic theory and anti-foundation axioms to higher type levels, we formulate generalisations of AFA and SAFA, and construct a hierarchy of models which satisfies the SAFA generalisations. These generalisations build on the framework of Univalent Material Set Theory, previously developed by two of the authors.
  Since the model constructions are based on M-types, the paper also includes a characterisation of the identity type of M-types as indexed M-types.
  Our results are formalised in the proof-assistant Agda.</description>

      <title>Arboles de Forzamiento Sem\'antico para la Logica de Predicados</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model semantics for first-order predicate logic is characterized by a visual inference tool called semantic forcing trees for predicate logic. Formulas that are valid (or invalid) by semantic forcing trees match valid (or invalid) formulas by the usual valuation semantics. In the event that the formula is invalid by a forcing tree, a model that refutes it is determined by the marks of the leaves of this tree.</description>

      <title>Geometric theories for real number algebra without sign test or dependent choice axiom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this memoir, we seek to construct a constructive theory that is as complete as possible to describe the algebraic properties of the real number field in constructive mathematics without a dependent choice axiom. To this purpose, we use a dynamical version of geometric theories. We obtain a nice description of the algebraic properties of the real number field, but also a first outline for a constructive theory of certain o-minimal structures. The memoir we present here is an unfinished development of the article by the authors https://inria.hal.science/hal-01426164. Compared to that paper, however, we have modified the definition of continuous semialgebraic functions, in the same spirit in which Bishop defines a continuous real function as a uniformly continuous function on any bounded interval. Despite its unfinished nature and the many questions that we do not currently know how to answer, we hope that this paper will arouse interest for its original approach to the subject. This paper is an English translation of a French version on arXiv:2406.15218</description>

      <title>Borel Vizing's Theorem for Graphs of Subexponential Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every Borel graph $G$ of subexponential growth has a Borel proper edge-coloring with $\Delta(G) + 1$ colors. We deduce this from a stronger result, namely that an $n$-vertex (finite) graph $G$ of subexponential growth can be properly edge-colored using $\Delta(G) + 1$ colors by an $O(\log^\ast n)$-round deterministic distributed algorithm in the $\mathsf{LOCAL}$ model, where the implied constants in the $O(\cdot)$ notation are determined by a bound on the growth rate of $G$.</description>
