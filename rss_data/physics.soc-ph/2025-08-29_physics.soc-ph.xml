      <title>Cognition in Superposition: Quantum Models in AI, Finance, Defence, Gaming and Collective Behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At first glance, quantum mechanics and behavioural science seem worlds apart -- one rooted in equations and particles, the other in thoughts and choices. Yet, emerging research reveals a profound and unexpected bridge between them. This chapter explores that bridge through quantum models of cognition and decision-making, showing how principles from quantum mechanics can help understand, and even predict, the complexities of human perception, behaviour and societal dynamics. We introduce a computationally accessible framework grounded in quantum theory, designed to model ambiguity, bias and choice in a way that classical logic cannot. Drawing on interdisciplinary sources, we demonstrate how this approach not only enriches our understanding of individual cognition but also extends to AI, video game design, financial behaviour and collective decision-making in society. Through vivid case studies -- from optical illusions in video games to decision biases in economic, defence and political contexts -- we show how quantum models offer new explanatory and predictive power. Thus, this chapter invites readers from all professional backgrounds to reimagine cognition and decision-making, opening new avenues for science, technology and human understanding.</description>

      <title>Should one (be allowed to) replace the Cippolini's?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One examines and discusses proposals on whether riders could be replaced in a team during multi-stage races, and how much a team final time at the end of the race would change (be "adjusted") if only the riders having completed the race are taken into account for ranking teams.
  A few results of the two main multi-stage races, the men Tour de France and the Giro d'Italia, are used as case studies. The impact of disqualification later on, due to doping, much after the end of such a race, is also examined in the case of two Tour de France.
  The statistical discussion is based on the Kendall-$\tau$ coefficients for comparing team ranks at the end of these multi-stages races cases. One observes that there are significant differences in the results of the discussed measures. It is shown that there is much variety in results significance, whence demonstrating many interests of the "adjusted indicators". Moreover, it is argued that the "adjusted" rank indicator would promote more competitive and more attractive daily stages and lead to more valuable race management.</description>

      <title>New inequality indicators for team ranking in multi-stage female professional cyclist races</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cycling competition is highly interesting since the team ranking is based on the best performance of some subset of team members. The paper develops new inequality indicators, a methodology to construct them, and numerical illustrations allowing to provide operative arguments in their favor. The numerical illustrations subsequently deal with hierarchical ranking indicators of (female) cyclist teams, competing in multi-stage races. For the illustration, the 2023 editions of the most famous long races for females are considered: 34th Giro d'Italia Donne, 2nd Tour de France Femmes, 9th Vuelta Femenina.
  Several classical ranking indicators are recalled and adapted to the study cases. The most usual indicator, $T_L$, is based on the riders arriving time for the various stages, i.e., according to Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) standard rules. One also uses another indicator, $A_L$, which requires that the riders finish the race, whence each stage, in order to define the race best team.
  Another contribution of the paper derives from specific developments of these indicators, thereby leading to new measures: the ''leadership gap" based on $A_L-T_L$, and the ''competition temperature", based on entropy. It is argued that the numerical values point to differences in team strategy based on rider skill levels. The ranking of contributions to indicators allow to observe the "crucial core" made of the most competitive teams.</description>

      <title>The third dimension of cities - relating building height, urban area, and population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For decades, urban development was studied on two-dimensional maps, largely ignoring the third dimension. However, building height is crucial because it dramatically potentiates the interior space of cities. Here, using a newly released global building height dataset of 2903 cities across 42 countries in 2015, we develop a Cobb-Douglas model to simultaneously examine the relationship between urban population size and both horizontal and vertical urban extents. We find that, contrary to expectations, the residents of most urban systems do not significantly benefit from vertical dimension, with population accommodation being primarily driven by horizontal extent. The associations with country-level external indicators demonstrate that the benefits of horizontal extent are more pronounced in urban systems with more extreme size distribution (most population concentrated in few cities). Moreover, building classification tests confirm the robustness of our findings across all building types. Our findings challenge the intuition that building height and high-rise development significantly contributes to urban population accommodation, calling for targeted policies to improve its efficiency.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Relationship among Cryptocurrencies using Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our analysis focuses on the stock cryptocurrency market, by studying a group of nineteen cryptocurrencies where their capitalisation is about 99% of the total market. Specifically, it is examined this group of cryptocurrencies for the period from 2017 up to 2024, taking into account the effect of COVID-19 pandemic. As far as we know, this is the first time that this kind of study has been published, where it takes place by creating various networks based on stock cryptocurrency correlation, in order to be possible to visualise and access these relationships using methods from Complex Networks. The evaluation results show that, there are three different communities within the crypto market and although COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing geopolitical changes, there is a notable trend towards an increase in the number of cryptocurrencies. Additionally, it is applied discriminant analysis to identify the differences among various cryptocurrencies based on their features.</description>

      <title>Is the Solar System a Wilderness or a Construction Site? Conservationist and Constructivist Paradigms in Planetary Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outer space exploration is one of the most prominent domains of earth-space governance. In this context, multiple policy documents by the UN, NASA, or Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) pledge to protect extraterrestrial environments from harmful human influence under the framework of planetary protection or planetary stewardship, understood primarily as the isolation of other celestial bodies from possible biological contamination. This paper analyses justifications of this framework that rely on analogies with the protection of terrestrial wilderness and nature's intrinsic value, portraying them as representative of a conservationist paradigm of earth-space governance. After presenting this paradigm, the paper builds an alternative constructivist paradigm, grounded in recent findings about the evolution of the solar system, planets, and life. Ultimately, the paper argues that conservation is not the opposite of construction but one of its modalities: a conclusion that encourages the development of pragmatic protocols for space exploration instead of absolute imperatives.</description>

      <title>Collective communication in a transparent world: Phase transitions in a many-body Potts model and social-quantum duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Schelling-like social competition reflected in "dynamics of opinions" among groups of agents ("communities") in a highly transparent world. Specifically, we investigate a $q$-state Potts spin system with competing two- and three-body interactions on a complete graph. Agents interact through pairwise repulsion (opposing opinions) between different communities and three-body attraction (shared opinions) within the same community. In the thermodynamic limit, we identify variants of three key phases: (a) a symmetric "mixed" phase of $q$ states, in which no single opinion dominates in the society (interpreted as a "democracy"), (b) a symmetric "mixed" phase but of $q-1$ states, and (c) a "consensus" phase, characterized by the emergence of a dominant opinion (or "ideology"), coexisting with symmetrically distributed minority views. Monte-Carlo simulations reveal finite-size effects and metastable switching between configurations. Furthermore, we establish a correspondence between our social model on a complete graph and the mean-field $SU(N)$ quantum spin system with both quadratic and cubic interactions, revealing a "social-quantum" duality. This duality provides new perspectives on both stratification of social communication, and quantum many-body phenomena, offering a unified framework for understanding emergent collective behavior in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Universal vulnerability in strong modular networks with various degree distributions between inequality and equality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generally, networks are classified into two sides of inequality and equality with respect to the number of links at nodes by the types of degree distributions. One side includes many social, technological, and biological networks which consist of a few nodes with many links, and many nodes with a few links, whereas the other side consists of all nodes with an equal number of links. In comprehensive investigations between them, we have found that, as a more equal network, the tolerance of whole connectivity is stronger without fragmentation against the malfunction of nodes in a wide class of randomized networks. However, we newly find that all networks which include typical well-known network structures between them become extremely vulnerable, if a strong modular (or community) structure is added with commonalities of areas, interests, religions, purpose, and so on. These results will encourage avoiding too dense unions by connecting nodes and taking into account the balanced resource allocation between intra- and inter-links of weak communities. We must reconsider not only efficiency but also tolerance against attacks or disasters, unless no community that is really impossible.</description>

      <title>Renormalizable Graph Embeddings For Multi-Scale Network Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In machine learning, graph embedding algorithms seek low-dimensional representations of the input network data, thereby allowing for downstream tasks on compressed encodings. Recently, within the framework of network renormalization, multi-scale embeddings that remain consistent under an arbitrary aggregation of nodes onto block-nodes, and consequently under an arbitrary change of resolution of the input network data, have been proposed. Here we investigate such multi-scale graph embeddings in the modified context where the input network is not entirely observable, due to data limitations or privacy constraints. This situation is typical for financial and economic networks, where connections between individual banks or firms are hidden due to confidentiality, and one has to probabilistically reconstruct the underlying network from aggregate information. We first consider state-of-the-art network reconstruction techniques based on the maximum-entropy principle, which is designed to operate optimally at a fixed resolution level. We then discuss the limitations of these methods when they are used as graph embeddings to yield predictions across different resolution levels. Finally, we propose their natural 'renormalizable' counterparts derived from the distinct principle of scale invariance, yielding consistent graph embeddings for multi-scale network reconstruction. We illustrate these methods on national economic input-output networks and on international trade networks, which can be naturally represented at multiple levels of industrial and geographic resolution, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic, Signals-Based Reinterpretation of Microeconomic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Economics has long been a science of static equilibria, in which time is a second-order rather than first-order concern. Without time, economic modelers may neglect or obscure the role of time-dependent phenomena, e.g. path-dependency, and limit their ability to compare agnostically the model results with empirical observations. In this article, I outline a dynamic, signals-based recipe for building microeconomic models from traditional static models. I demonstrate this recipe using a classic "desert island" Robinson Crusoe (RC) model of consumption. Starting from a classic static derivation, I then move to a dynamic view, using the utility function as a generator of force on consumption. Finally, I show that the resulting dynamic model may be expressed in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian terms. I conclude by suggesting a recipe for scientific iteration using these alternate mechanical formulations, and the alternative explanations these dynamic models may suggest compared to employing a static approach to modeling.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Determinants of Vector-Borne Disease Outbreaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector-borne diseases arise from the coupled dynamics of human mobility and mosquito ecology, producing outbreaks shaped by both spatial distributions and temporal patterns of movement. Here we develop a coarse-grained hub--leaf reduction that isolates the universal principles governing epidemic vulnerability in interconnected populations. By deriving and analyzing the epidemic vulnerability equation, we show how human and vector population ratios, together with mobility parameters that regulate time spent in hub and leaf locations, jointly determine the conditions for outbreak persistence. The analysis reveals that balanced flows of individuals between patches consistently minimize vulnerability, whereas disproportionate concentrations of vectors can shift the dominant risk to specific locations. Across parameter regimes, compensatory mobility emerges as a stabilizing mechanism, while skewed host--vector ratios elevate epidemic risk. These results establish general principles for the spatiotemporal determinants of vector-borne disease spread and provide a theoretical foundation for extending minimal models to more complex epidemiological settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.06323v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the perspective of human mobility, the COVID-19 pandemic constituted a natural experiment of enormous reach in space and time. Here, we analyse the inherent multiple scales of human mobility using Facebook Movement Maps collected before and during the first UK lockdown. First, we obtain the pre-lockdown UK mobility graph, and employ multiscale community detection to extract, in an unsupervised manner, a set of robust partitions into flow communities at different levels of coarseness. The partitions so obtained capture intrinsic mobility scales with better coverage than NUTS regions, which suffer from mismatches between human mobility and administrative divisions. Furthermore, the flow communities in the fine scale partition match well the UK Travel to Work Areas (TTWAs) but also capture mobility patterns beyond commuting to work. We also examine the evolution of mobility under lockdown, and show that mobility first reverted towards fine scale flow communities already found in the pre-lockdown data, and then expanded back towards coarser flow communities as restrictions were lifted. The improved coverage induced by lockdown is well captured by a linear decay shock model, which allows us to quantify regional differences both in the strength of the effect and the recovery time from the lockdown shock.</description>

      <title>Closing the Loop: Integrating Material Needs of Energy Technologies into Energy System Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition to a climate-neutral energy system demands large-scale renewable generation expansion, which requires substantial amounts of bulk materials like steel, cement, and polymers. The production of these materials represents an additional energy demand for the system, creating an energy-material feedback loop. Current energy system models lack a complete representation of this feedback loop. Material requirements of energy system transformation have been studied in a retrospective approach, not allowing them as a consideration in system design. To address this gap, we integrate bulk material demand and production as endogenous factors into energy system optimization using PyPSA-Eur. Our approach links infrastructure expansion with industrial energy needs to achieve a minimum-cost equilibrium. Applying this model to Germany's transition to climate neutrality by 2045, we find that accounting for material needs increases annual bulk material demands by 3-9 %, shifts preferences from solar to wind and from local production of hydrogen to ship imports, and shows distinct industrial process route choices. These findings suggests that energy-material feedbacks should be considered in energy system design when moving to more domestic production of energy technologies.</description>

      <title>Measuring Scientific Group Performance: Integrating h-Group and Homogeneity into the $\alpha$-Index</title>

      <description>arXiv:1002.1060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ranking groups of researchers is important in several contexts and can serve many purposes such as the fair distribution of grants based on the scientist's publication output, concession of research projects, classification of journal editorial boards and many other applications in a social context. In this paper, we propose a method for measuring the performance of groups of researchers. The proposed method is called alpha-index and it is based on two parameters: (i) the homogeneity of the h-indexes of the researchers in the group; and (ii) the h-group, which is an extension of the h-index for groups. Our method integrates the concepts of homogeneity and absolute value of the h-index into a single measure which is appropriate for the evaluation of groups. We report on experiments that assess computer science conferences based on the h-indexes of their program committee members. Our results are similar to a manual classification scheme adopted by a research agency.</description>

Abstract: We present Local Graph-based Dictionary Expansion (LGDE), a method for data-driven discovery of the semantic neighbourhood of words using tools from manifold learning and network science. At the heart of LGDE lies the creation of a word similarity graph from the geometry of word embeddings followed by local community detection based on graph diffusion. The diffusion in the local graph manifold allows the exploration of the complex nonlinear geometry of word embeddings to capture word similarities based on paths of semantic association, over and above direct pairwise similarities. Exploiting such semantic neighbourhoods enables the expansion of dictionaries of pre-selected keywords, an important step for tasks in information retrieval, such as database queries and online data collection. We validate LGDE on two user-generated English-language corpora and show that LGDE enriches the list of keywords with improved performance relative to methods based on direct word similarities or co-occurrences. We further demonstrate our method through a real-world use case from communication science, where LGDE is evaluated quantitatively on the expansion of a conspiracy-related dictionary from online data collected and analysed by domain experts. Our empirical results and expert user assessment indicate that LGDE expands the seed dictionary with more useful keywords due to the manifold-learning-based similarity network.</description>
