Abstract: Arbovirus is a vital, life-threatening disease worldwide and continues to be a significant problem while the world is dealing with the major coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Vectors, mostly mosquitoes and ticks, transmit this disease. Dengue fever, chikungunya, and Zika viruses are the major threats because of their high incidence, public health burden, and clinically significant disease spectrum. These vector-borne disease causes one-fourth of annual deaths, leading to various infectious diseases. The arbovirus represents eight different families and 14 genera; most viruses belong to the family Bunyaviridae, and some also belong to Togaviridae, Reoviridae, and Flaviviridae. The arbovirus disease was isolated first in tropical and subtropical regions of South America and Africa and has high significance because of suitable environmental conditions for virus transmission and vector expansion. Its transmission cycle ranges from simple to highly complex. DENV is the most prevalent, results in febrile illness, and has transmission in 128 different countries. CHIKV causes infection in asymptomatic people, and the problems include nephritis, arthritis, myelitis, and acute encephalopathy. ZIKV-infected 80% of people are asymptomatic and may cause rashes, myalgia, fever, headache, and conjunctivitis. Vaccines for DENV are not clinically available; it is a primary arboviral infection in the world nowadays. The exposure of arbovirus diseases continues to be a global health problem regardless of continuing efforts. This review article will overview major arbovirus diseases and their diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies.</description>
