      <title>Efficient Interaction-Based Offline Runtime Verification of Distributed Systems with Lifeline Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Runtime Verification (RV) refers to a family of techniques in which system executions are observed and confronted to formal specifications, with the aim of identifying faults. In Offline RV, observation is done in a first step and verification in a second, on a static artifact collected during observation. In this paper, we define an approach to offline RV of Distributed Systems (DS) against interactions. Interactions are formal models describing communications within a DS. DS are composed of subsystems deployed on different machines and interacting via message passing. Therefore, observing executions of a DS entails logging a collection of local execution traces, one for each subsystem, that we call a multi-trace. A major challenge in analyzing multi-traces is that there are no practical means to synchronize the ends of observations of all local traces. We address this via an operation, called lifeline removal, which we apply on-the-fly on the specification during verification once a local trace has been entirely analyzed. This operation removes from the interaction the specification of actions occurring on the subsystem that is no-longer observed. This may allow further execution of the specification via removing deadlocks due to the partial orders of actions. We prove the correctness of the resulting RV algorithm and introduce two optimization techniques which we also prove correct. We implement a Partial Order Reduction (POR) technique via the selection of a one-unambiguous action (as a unique first step to a linearization) which existence is determined via another use of the lifeline removal operator. Additionally, Local Analyses (LOC) i.e., the verification of local traces, can be leveraged during the global multi-trace analysis to prove failure more quickly. Experiments illustrate the application of our RV approach and the benefits of our optimizations.</description>

      <title>Enumeration for MSO-Queries on Compressed Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a linear preprocessing and output-linear delay enumeration algorithm for MSO-queries over trees that are compressed in the well-established grammar-based framework. Time bounds are measured with respect to the size of the compressed representation of the tree. Our result extends previous work on the enumeration of MSO-queries over uncompressed trees and on the enumeration of document spanners over compressed text documents.</description>
