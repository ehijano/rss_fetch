      <title>Inflation Models with Correlation and Skew</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a forward inflation index model with multi-factor volatility structure featuring a parametric form that allows calibration to correlations between indices of different tenors observed in the market. Assuming the nominal interest rate follows a single factor Gaussian short rate model, we present analytical prices for zero-coupon and year-on-year swaps, caps, and floors. The same method applies to any interest rate model for which one can compute the zero-coupon bond prices and measure shifts. We extend the multi-factor model with leverage functions to capture the entire market volatility skew with a single process. The time-consuming calibration step of this model can be avoided in the simplified model that we further propose. We demonstrate the leveraged and the simplified models with market data.</description>

      <title>Full error analysis of the random deep splitting method for nonlinear parabolic PDEs and PIDEs with infinite activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a randomized extension of the deep splitting algorithm introduced in [Beck, Becker, Cheridito, Jentzen, and Neufeld (2021)] using random neural networks suitable to approximately solve both high-dimensional nonlinear parabolic PDEs and PIDEs with jumps having (possibly) infinite activity. We provide a full error analysis of our so-called random deep splitting method. In particular, we prove that our random deep splitting method converges to the (unique viscosity) solution of the nonlinear PDE or PIDE under consideration. Moreover, we empirically analyze our random deep splitting method by considering several numerical examples including both nonlinear PDEs and nonlinear PIDEs relevant in the context of pricing of financial derivatives under default risk. In particular, we empirically demonstrate in all examples that our random deep splitting method can approximately solve nonlinear PDEs and PIDEs in 10'000 dimensions within seconds.</description>

      <title>Minimum Cost Super-Hedging in a Discrete Time Incomplete Multi-Asset Binomial Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a multi-asset incomplete model of the financial market, where each of $m\geq 2$ risky assets follows the binomial dynamics, and no assumptions are made on the joint distribution of the risky asset price processes. We provide explicit formulas for the minimum cost super-hedging strategies for a wide class of European type multi-asset contingent claims. This class includes European basket call and put options, among others. Since a super-hedge is a non-self-financing arbitrage strategy, it produces non-negative local residuals, for which we also give explicit formulas. This paper completes the foundation started in previous work of the authors for the extension of our results to a more realistic market model.</description>
