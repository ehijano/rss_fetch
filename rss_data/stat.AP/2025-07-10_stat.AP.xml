      <title>Benchmarking Waitlist Mortality Prediction in Heart Transplantation Through Time-to-Event Modeling using New Longitudinal UNOS Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decisions about managing patients on the heart transplant waitlist are currently made by committees of doctors who consider multiple factors, but the process remains largely ad-hoc. With the growing volume of longitudinal patient, donor, and organ data collected by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) since 2018, there is increasing interest in analytical approaches to support clinical decision-making at the time of organ availability. In this study, we benchmark machine learning models that leverage longitudinal waitlist history data for time-dependent, time-to-event modeling of waitlist mortality. We train on 23,807 patient records with 77 variables and evaluate both survival prediction and discrimination at a 1-year horizon. Our best model achieves a C-Index of 0.94 and AUROC of 0.89, significantly outperforming previous models. Key predictors align with known risk factors while also revealing novel associations. Our findings can support urgency assessment and policy refinement in heart transplant decision making.</description>

      <title>Functional Time Series Forecasting of Distributions: A Koopman-Wasserstein Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for forecasting the temporal evolution of probability distributions observed at discrete time points. Extending the Dynamic Probability Density Decomposition (DPDD), we embed distributional dynamics into Wasserstein geometry via a Koopman operator framework. Our approach introduces an importance-weighted variant of Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD), enabling accurate, closed-form forecasts in 2-Wasserstein space. Theoretical guarantees are established: our estimator achieves spectral convergence and optimal finite-sample Wasserstein error. Simulation studies and a real-world application to U.S. housing price distributions show substantial improvements over existing methods such as Wasserstein Autoregression. By integrating optimal transport, functional time series modeling, and spectral operator theory, DPDD offers a scalable and interpretable solution for distributional forecasting. This work has broad implications for behavioral science, public health, finance, and neuroimaging--domains where evolving distributions arise naturally. Our framework contributes to functional data analysis on non-Euclidean spaces and provides a general tool for modeling and forecasting distributional time series.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores a novel approach to time series forecasting applied to the context of Chennai's climate data. Our methodology comprises two distinct established time series models, leveraging their strengths in handling seasonality and periods. Notably, a new algorithm is developed to compute the period of the time series using unsupervised machine learning and spline interpolation techniques. Through a meticulous ensembling process that combines these two models, we achieve optimized forecasts. This research contributes to advancing forecasting techniques and offers valuable insights into climate data analysis.</description>

      <title>Estimation of An Infinite Dimensional Transition Probability Matrix Using a Generalized Hierarchical Stick-Breaking Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov chains provide a foundational framework for modeling sequential stochastic processes, with the transition probability matrix characterizing the dynamics of state evolution. While classical estimation methods such as maximum likelihood and empirical Bayes approaches are effective in finite-state settings, they become inadequate in applications involving countably infinite or dynamically expanding state spaces, which frequently arise in domains such as natural language processing, population dynamics, and behavioral modeling. In this work, we introduce a novel Bayesian nonparametric framework for estimating infinite-dimensional transition probability matrices by employing a new class of priors, termed the Generalized Hierarchical Stick-Breaking prior. This prior extends traditional Dirichlet process and stick-breaking constructions, enabling highly flexible modelling of transition probability matrices. The proposed approach offers a principled methodology for inferring transition probabilities in settings characterized by sparsity, high dimensionality, and unobserved state spaces, thereby contributing to the advancement of statistical inference for infinite-dimensional transition probability matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel constraint-based algorithm for causal structure learning specifically designed for nonlinear autoregressive time series. Our algorithm significantly reduces computational complexity compared to existing methods, making it more efficient and scalable to larger problems. We rigorously evaluate its performance on synthetic datasets, demonstrating that our algorithm not only outperforms current techniques, but also excels in scenarios with limited data availability.

      <title>A new coefficient to measure agreement between continuous variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing agreement between two instruments is crucial in clinical studies to evaluate the similarity between two methods measuring the same subjects. This paper introduces a novel coefficient, termed rho1, to measure agreement between continuous variables, focusing on scenarios where two instruments measure experimental units in a study. Unlike existing coefficients, rho1 is based on L1 distances, making it robust to outliers and not relying on nuisance parameters. The coefficient is derived for bivariate normal and elliptically contoured distributions, showcasing its versatility. In the case of normal distributions, rho1 is linked to Lin's coefficient, providing a useful alternative. The paper includes theoretical properties, an inference framework, and numerical experiments to validate the performance of rho1. This novel coefficient presents a valuable tool for researchers assessing agreement between continuous variables in various fields, including clinical studies and spatial analysis.</description>

      <title>A Case Study on Quantifying Reliability under Extreme Risk Constraints in Space Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ a Bayesian approach to uncertainty quantification of computer simulations used to assess the probability of rare events. As a case study, we assess the reliability of an Earth reentry capsule for sample return missions that must be able to withstand the reentry loads in order to land intact. Our study uses Gaussian Process modeling under a Bayesian regime to analyze the reentry vehicle's resilience against operational stress. This Bayesian framework allows for a detailed probabilistic evaluation of the system's reliability, indicating our ability to verify stringent safety goals of rare events with a 0.999999 of probability of success. The findings underscore the effectiveness of Bayesian methods for complex uncertainty quantification analyses of computer simulations, providing valuable insights for computational reliability analysis in a risk-averse setting.</description>

      <title>Cryptogenic stroke and migraine: using probabilistic independence and machine learning to uncover latent sources of disease from the electronic health record</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Migraine is a common but complex neurological disorder that doubles the lifetime risk of cryptogenic stroke (CS). However, this relationship remains poorly characterized, and few clinical guidelines exist to reduce this associated risk. We therefore propose a data-driven approach to extract probabilistically-independent sources from electronic health record (EHR) data and create a 10-year risk-predictive model for CS in migraine patients. These sources represent external latent variables acting on the causal graph constructed from the EHR data and approximate root causes of CS in our population. A random forest model trained on patient expressions of these sources demonstrated good accuracy (ROC 0.771) and identified the top 10 most predictive sources of CS in migraine patients. These sources revealed that pharmacologic interventions were the most important factor in minimizing CS risk in our population and identified a factor related to allergic rhinitis as a potential causative source of CS in migraine patients.</description>

      <title>Spatial vertical regression for spatial panel data: Evaluating the effect of the Florentine tramway's first line on commercial vitality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic control methods are commonly used in panel data settings to evaluate the effect of an intervention. In many of these cases, the treated and control units correspond to spatial units such as regions or neighborhoods. Our approach addresses the challenge of understanding how an intervention applied at specific locations influences the surrounding area. Traditional synthetic control applications may struggle with defining the effective area of impact, the extent of treatment propagation across space, and the variation of effects with distance from the treatment sites. To address these challenges, we introduce Spatial Vertical Regression (SVR) within the Bayesian paradigm. This innovative approach allows us to accurately predict the outcomes in varying proximities to the treatment sites, while meticulously accounting for the spatial structure inherent in the data. Specifically, rooted on the vertical regression framework of the synthetic control method, SVR employs a Gaussian process to ensure that the imputation of missing potential outcomes for areas of different distance around the treatment sites is spatially coherent, reflecting the expectation that nearby areas experience similar outcomes and have similar relationships to control areas. This approach is particularly pertinent to our study on the Florentine tramway's first line construction. We study its influence on the local commercial landscape, focusing on how business prevalence varies at different distances from the tram stops.</description>
