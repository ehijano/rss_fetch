      <title>Carrying is Hard: Exploring the Gap between Hardness for NP and PSPACE for the Hanano and Jelly no Puzzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hanano Puzzle is a one-player game with irreversible gravity, where the goal is to make colored blocks make contact with flowers of the corresponding color. The game Jelly no Puzzle shares similar mechanics. In general, determining if a given level of each of the two games is solvable is PSPACE-complete. There are also known restrictions under which determining if a level of Jelly no Puzzle is solvable is NP-complete. We find that under the same restrictions, determining if a level of Hanano Puzzle is solvable remains PSPACE-complete. We thus study several restrictions on Hanano, contrast them with known results about Jelly no Puzzle, and posit that the mechanism at the heart of the PSPACE-hardness is the ability for blocks to carry each other.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo to Las Vegas for Recursively Composed Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a (possibly partial) Boolean function $f\colon\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ as well as a query complexity measure $M$ which maps Boolean functions to real numbers, define the composition limit of $M$ on $f$ by $M^*(f)=\lim_{k\to\infty} M(f^k)^{1/k}$.
  We study the composition limits of general measures in query complexity. We show this limit converges under reasonable assumptions about the measure. We then give a surprising result regarding the composition limit of randomized query complexity: we show $R_0^*(f)=\max\{R^*(f),C^*(f)\}$. Among other things, this implies that any bounded-error randomized algorithm for recursive 3-majority can be turned into a zero-error randomized algorithm for the same task. Our result extends also to quantum algorithms: on recursively composed functions, a bounded-error quantum algorithm can be converted into a quantum algorithm that finds a certificate with high probability.
  Along the way, we prove various combinatorial properties of measures and composition limits.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Functional Decomposition: A Reconfiguration Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional decomposition is the process of breaking down a function $f$ into a composition $f=g(f_1,\dots,f_k)$ of simpler functions $f_1,\dots,f_k$ belonging to some class $\mathcal{F}$. This fundamental notion can be used to model applications arising in a wide variety of contexts, ranging from machine learning to formal language theory. In this work, we study functional decomposition by leveraging on the notion of functional reconfiguration. In this setting, constraints are imposed not only on the factor functions $f_1,\dots,f_k$ but also on the intermediate functions arising during the composition process.
  We introduce a symbolic framework to address functional reconfiguration and decomposition problems. In our framework, functions arising during the reconfiguration process are represented symbolically, using ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs). The function $g$ used to specify the reconfiguration process is represented by a Boolean circuit $C$. Finally, the function class $\mathcal{F}$ is represented by a second-order finite automaton $\mathcal{A}$. Our main result states that functional reconfiguration, and hence functional decomposition, can be solved in fixed-parameter linear time when parameterized by the width of the input OBDD, by structural parameters associated with the reconfiguration circuit $C$, and by the size of the second-order finite automaton $\mathcal{A}$.</description>

      <title>Rational degree is polynomially related to degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that $\mathrm{deg}(f) \leq 2 \, \mathrm{rdeg}(f)^4$ for every Boolean function $f$, where $\mathrm{deg}(f)$ is the degree of $f$ and $\mathrm{rdeg}(f)$ is the rational degree of $f$. This resolves the second of the three open problems stated by Nisan and Szegedy, and attributed to Fortnow, in 1994.</description>

      <title>On the parameterized complexity of the Maker-Breaker domination game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since its introduction as a Maker-Breaker positional game by Duch\^ene et al. in 2020, the Maker-Breaker domination game has become one of the most studied positional games on vertices. In this game, two players, Dominator and Staller, alternately claim an unclaimed vertex of a given graph G. If at some point the set of vertices claimed by Dominator is a dominating set, she wins; otherwise, i.e. if Staller manages to isolate a vertex by claiming all its closed neighborhood, Staller wins.
  Given a graph G and a first player, Dominator or Staller must have a winning strategy. We are interested in the computational complexity of determining which player has such a strategy. This problem is known to be PSPACE-complete on bipartite graphs of bounded degree and split graphs; polynomial on cographs, outerplanar graphs, and block graphs; and in NP for interval graphs.
  In this paper, we consider the parameterized complexity of this game. We start by considering as a parameter the number of moves of both players. We prove that for the general framework of Maker-Breaker positional games in hypergraphs, determining whether Breaker can claim a transversal of the hypergraph in k moves is W[2]-complete, in contrast to the problem of determining whether Maker can claim all the vertices of a hyperedge in k moves, which is known to be W[1]-complete since 2017. These two hardness results are then applied to the Maker-Breaker domination game, proving that it is W[2]-complete to decide if Dominator can dominate the graph in k moves and W[1]-complete to decide if Staller can isolate a vertex in k moves. Next, we provide FPT algorithms for the Maker-Breaker domination game parameterized by the neighborhood diversity, the modular width, the P4-fewness, the distance to cluster, and the feedback edge number.</description>

      <title>Spectral Norm, Economical Sieve, and Linear Invariance Testing of Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given Boolean functions \( f, g : \mathbb{F}_2^n \to \{-1,+1\} \), we say they are {\em linearly isomorphic} if there exists \( A \in \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_2) \) such that \( f(x)=g(Ax) \) for all \( x \). We study this problem in the tolerant property testing framework under the known--unknown model, where \( g \) is given explicitly and \( f \) is accessible only via oracle queries, meaning the algorithm may adaptively request the value of \( f(x) \) for inputs \( x \in \mathbb{F}_2^n \) of its choice. Given parameters \( \epsilon \ge 0 \) and \( \omega&gt;0 \), the goal is to distinguish whether there exists \( A \in \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_{2})\) such that the normalized Hamming distance between \( f \) and \( g(Ax) \) is at most \( \epsilon \), or whether for every \( A \in \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_2) \) the distance is at least \( \epsilon+\omega \).
  Our main result is a tolerant tester making \( \widetilde{O} \left( \left( m/\omega \right)^4 \right) \) queries to \( f \), where \( m \) is an upper bound on the spectral norm of \( g \), improving the previous \( \widetilde{O} \left( \left( m/\omega \right)^{24} \right) \) bound of Wimmer and Yoshida. We complement this with a nearly matching lower bound of \( \Omega(m^2) \) for constant \( \omega \) (for example, \( \omega=1/4 \)), improving the prior \( \Omega(\log m) \) lower bound of Grigorescu, Wimmer and Xie. A key technical ingredient on the algorithmic side is a query-efficient local list corrector. For the lower bound, we give a reduction from communication complexity using a novel subclass of Maiorana--McFarland functions from symmetric-key cryptography.</description>
