      <title>p-adic Equiangular Lines and p-adic van Lint-Seidel Relative Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of p-adic equiangular lines and derive the first fundamental relation between common angle, dimension of the space and the number of lines. More precisely, we show that if $\{\tau_j\}_{j=1}^n$ is p-adic $\gamma$-equiangular lines in $\mathbb{Q}^d_p$, then \begin{align*} (1) \quad\quad \quad \quad |n|^2\leq |d|\max\{|n|, \gamma^2 \}. \end{align*} 
  We call Inequality (1) as the p-adic van Lint-Seidel relative bound. We believe that this complements fundamental van Lint-Seidel \textit{[Indag. Math., 1966]} relative bound for equiangular lines in the p-adic case.</description>

      <title>Brook's type upper bounds for coloring parameters of infinite graphs and Konig's Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that Brook's type theorems for several coloring parameters of infinite graphs, which are true in ZFC, are not provable in ZF (i.e., the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory without the Axiom of Choice (AC)). In ZF, we apply Konig's Lemma (a weak form of AC) and give a combinatorial argument to find a general upper bound of the total distinguishing number for any connected infinite graph with finite maximum degree. In ZF, we give new combinatorial arguments to formulate new conditions for the existence of distinguishing chromatic number, distinguishing chromatic index, total chromatic number, odd chromatic number, and neighbor-distinguishing index in infinite locally finite connected graphs, which are equivalent to Konig's Lemma (any infinite locally finite connected graph has a ray).</description>

      <title>On a Problem of Ramsey Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1955, Greenwood and Gleason showed that the Ramsey number R(3, 3, 3) = 17 by constructing an edge-chromatic graph on 16 vertices in three colors with no triangles. Their technique employed finite fields. This same result was obtained later by using another technique. In this article, we examine the complete graph on 17 vertices, K17, which can be represented as a regular polygon of 17 sides with all its diagonals. We color each edge of K17 with one of the three colors, blue, red or yellow. The graph thus obtained is called complete trichromatic graph K17^(3) (the superscript determines the number of colors). A triangle contained in graph K17^(3) with edges colored with one and only one color is called monochromatic. It has been shown that for any coloring of the K17^(3) edges, K17^(3) contains at least one monochromatic triangle. This article examines the problem of determining the minimum number of monochromatic triangles with the same color contained in K17^(3).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we establish a 1-to-1 correspondence between the class of generalized quadrangles with ovoids and the class of balanced incomplete block designs that posses a non-triangular local resolution system and have the appropriate parameters. We present a non-triangular local resolution system for a difference family BIBD construction of Sprott.</description>

      <title>Permutation Wordle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a guessing game, permutation Wordle, in which a guesser attempts to recover a hidden permutation in $S_n$. In each round, the guesser guesses a permutation (using information from previous rounds) and is told which entries of that permutation are correct. We describe a natural guessing strategy, which we believe to be optimal. We show that the number of permutations this strategy solves in $k+1$ rounds is the Eulerian number $A(n,k)$.
  We also describe an extension to suited permutations: the setter chooses a permutation in $S_n$ and also a coloring of $[n]$ using $s$ colors. We generalize our strategy, give a recurrence for the number of suited permutations solved in $k+1$ rounds, and relate these numbers to the Eulerian numbers. In the case of two suits, or signed permutations, we also relate these numbers to the Eulerian numbers of type B.</description>

      <title>Quasi-tree-partitions of graphs with an excluded subgraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the structure of graphs with given tree-width and excluding a fixed complete bipartite subgraph, which generalises the bounded degree setting. We give a new structural description of such graphs in terms of so-called quasi-tree-partitions. We demonstrate the utility of this result through applications to (fractional) clustered colouring. Further generalisations of these structural and colouring results are presented.</description>

      <title>Integral representations of Catalan numbers using Touchard-like identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we use the Touchard identity in order to obtain new integral representations for Catalan numbers. The main idea consists in combining the identity with a known integral representation and resorting to the binomial theorem. The same procedure is applied to a variant of the Touchard identity proposed by Callan a few years ago. The method presented here can be generalized to derive additional integral representations from known ones, provided that the latter have a well-suited form and lend themselves to an analytical summation under the integral sign.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we prove explicit formulas for the expected numbers of descents and inversions in the $k$-th powers of permutations in $\mathcal{S}_n$ for all $k\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ and $n\geq2k+1$. The $k=2$ and $3$ cases for descents confirm a recent conjecture of Archer and Geary.</description>

      <title>Positive $e$-expansions of the chromatic symmetric functions of KPKPs, twinned lollipops, and kayak paddles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find a positive $e_I$-expansion for the chromatic symmetric function of KPKP graphs, which are graphs obtained by connecting a vertex in a complete graph with a vertex in the maximal clique of a lollipop graph by a path. This generalizes the positive $e_I$-expansion for the chromatic symmetric function of lollipops obtained by Tom, for that of KPK graphs obtained by Wang and Zhou, and as well for those of KKP graphs and PKP graphs obtained by Qi, Tang and Wang. As an application, we confirm the $e$-positivity of twinned lollipops, which belong to the graph family that is concerned by Stanley and Stembridge's $e$-positivity conjecture. We also discover the first positive $e_I$-expansion for the chromatic symmetric function of kayak paddle graphs which are formed by connecting a vertex on a cycle and a vertex on another cycle with a path. This refines the $e$-positivity of kayak paddle graphs which was obtained by Aliniaeifard, Wang, and van Willigenburg using an expanded version of Gebhard and Sagan's appendable $(e)$-positivity technique.</description>

      <title>Proof of a $K$-theoretic polynomial conjecture of Monical, Pechenik, and Searles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of a program to develop $K$-theoretic analogues of combinatorially important polynomials, Monical, Pechenik, and Searles (2021) proved two expansion formulas $\overline{\mathfrak{A}}_a = \sum_b Q_b^a(\beta)\overline{\mathfrak{P}}_b$ and $\overline{\mathfrak{Q}}_a = \sum_b M_b^a(\beta)\overline{\mathfrak{F}}_b,$ where each of $\overline{\mathfrak{A}}_a$, $\overline{\mathfrak{P}}_a$, $\overline{\mathfrak{Q}}_a$ and $\overline{\mathfrak{F}}_a$ is a family of polynomials that forms a basis for $\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\dots,x_n][\beta]$ indexed by weak compositions $a,$ and $Q_b^a(\beta)$ and $M_b^a(\beta)$ are monomials in $\beta$ for each pair $(a,b)$ of weak compositions. The polynomials $\overline{\mathfrak{A}}_a$ are the Lascoux atoms, $\overline{\mathfrak{P}}_a$ are the kaons, $\overline{\mathfrak{Q}}_a$ are the quasiLascoux polynomials, and $\overline{\mathfrak{F}}_a$ are the glide polynomials; these are respectively the $K$-analogues of the Demazure atoms $\mathfrak{A}_a$, the fundamental particles $\mathfrak{P}_a$, the quasikey polynomials $\mathfrak{Q}_a$, and the fundamental slide polynomials $\mathfrak{F}_a$. Monical, Pechenik, and Searles conjectured that for any fixed $a,$ $\sum_b Q_b^a(-1), \sum_b M_b^a(-1) \in \{0,1\},$ where $b$ ranges over all weak compositions. We prove this conjecture using a sign-reversing involution.</description>

      <title>A power sum expansion for the Kromatic symmetric function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chromatic symmetric $X_G$ function is a symmetric function generalization of the chromatic polynomial of a graph, introduced by Stanley (1995). $X_G$ is defined by assigning a variable to each color and taking the sum over all proper vertex colorings of $G$ of the product of all variables corresponding to colors used, counted with multiplicity. Stanley (1995) gave an expansion formula for $X_G$ in terms of the power sum symmetric functions $p_\lambda$ using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Crew, Pechenik, and Spirkl (2023) defined the Kromatic symmetric function $\overline{X}_G$ as a $K$-theoretic analogue of $X_G$, constructed in the same way except that each vertex is assigned a nonempty set of colors such that adjacent vertices have nonoverlapping color sets. They defined a $K$-analogue $\overline{p}_\lambda$ of the power sum basis and computed the first few coefficients of the $\overline{p}$-expansion of $\overline{X}_G$ for some small graphs $G$. They conjectured that the $\overline{p}$-expansion always has integer coefficients and asked whether there is an explicit formula for these coefficients. We give a formula for the $\overline{p}$-expansion of $\overline{X}_G$, and prove that the coefficients are indeed always integers.</description>

      <title>On the chromatic symmetric homology for star graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chromatic symmetric function $X_G$ is a power series that encodes the proper colorings of a graph $G$ by assigning a variable to each color and a monomial to each coloring such that the power of a variable in a monomial is the number of times the corresponding color is used in the corresponding coloring. The chromatic symmetric homology $H_*(G)$ is a doubly graded family of $\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{S}_n]$-modules that was defined by Sazdanovi\'c and Yip (2018) as a categorification of $X_G$. Chandler, Sazdanovi\'c, Stella, and Yip (2023) proved that $H_*(G)$ is a strictly stronger graph invariant than $X_G$, and they also computed or conjectured formulas for it in a number of special cases. We prove and extend some of their conjectured formulas for the case of star graphs, where one central vertex is connected to all other vertices and no other pairs of vertices are connected.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Bad Science Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bad science matrix problem consists in finding, among all matrices $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ with rows having unit $\ell^2$ norm, one that maximizes $\beta(A) = \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{x \in \{-1, 1\}^n} \|Ax\|_\infty$. Our main contribution is an explicit construction of an $n \times n$ matrix $A$ showing that $\beta(A) \geq \sqrt{\log_2(n+1)}$, which is only 18% smaller than the asymptotic rate. We prove that every entry of any optimal matrix is a square root of a rational number, and we find provably optimal matrices for $n \leq 4$.</description>

      <title>Sandwiching Random Geometric Graphs and Erdos-Renyi with Applications: Sharp Thresholds, Robust Testing, and Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution $\mathsf{RGG}(n,\mathbb{S}^{d-1},p)$ is formed by sampling independent vectors $\{V_i\}_{i = 1}^n$ uniformly on $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ and placing an edge between pairs of vertices $i$ and $j$ for which $\langle V_i,V_j\rangle \ge \tau^p_d,$ where $\tau^p_d$ is such that the expected density is $p.$ Our main result is a poly-time implementable coupling between Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and $\mathsf{RGG}$ such that $\mathsf{G}(n,p(1 - \tilde{O}(\sqrt{np/d})))\subseteq \mathsf{RGG}(n,\mathbb{S}^{d-1},p)\subseteq \mathsf{G}(n,p(1 + \tilde{O}(\sqrt{np/d})))$ edgewise with high probability when $d\gg np.$ We apply the result to: 1) Sharp Thresholds: We show that for any monotone property having a sharp threshold with respect to the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi distribution and critical probability $p^c_n,$ random geometric graphs also exhibit a sharp threshold when $d\gg np^c_n,$ thus partially answering a question of Perkins. 2) Robust Testing: The coupling shows that testing between $\mathsf{G}(n,p)$ and $\mathsf{RGG}(n,\mathbb{S}^{d-1},p)$ with $\epsilon n^2p$ adversarially corrupted edges for any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$ is information-theoretically impossible when $d\gg np.$ We match this lower bound with an efficient (constant degree SoS) spectral refutation algorithm when $d\ll np.$ 3) Enumeration: We show that the number of geometric graphs in dimension $d$ is at least $\exp(dn\log^{-7}n)$, recovering (up to the log factors) the sharp result of Sauermann.</description>

      <title>Rumour Spreading Depends on the Latent Geometry and Degree Distribution in Social Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study push-pull rumour spreading in small-world models for social networks where the degrees follow a power-law. In a non-geometric setting Fountoulakis, Panagiotou and Sauerwald have shown that rumours always spread fast (SODA 2012). On the other hand, Janssen and Mehrabian have found that rumours spread slowly in a spatial preferential attachment model (SIDMA 2017). We study the question systematically for the model of geometric inhomogeneous random graphs (GIRGs), which has been found to be a good theoretical and empirical fit for social networks. Our result is two-fold: with classical Euclidean geometry both slow and fast rumour spreading may occur, depending on the exponent of the power law and the prevalence of weak ties in the networks, and we fully characterise the phase boundaries between those two regimes. Depending on the parameters, fast spreading may either mean polylogarithmic time or even doubly logarithmic time. Secondly, we show that rumour spreading is always fast in a non-metric geometry. The considered non-metric geometry allows to model social connections where resemblance of vertices in a single attribute, such as familial kinship, already strongly indicates the presence of an edge. Classical Euclidean Geometry fails to capture such ties.
  For some regimes in the Euclidean setting, the efficient pathways for spreading rumours differ from previously identified paths. A vertex of degree $d$ can transmit the rumour efficiently to a vertex of larger degree by a chain of length $3$, where one of the two intermediaries has constant degree, and the other has degree $d^{c}$ for some constant $c&lt;1$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Mixed Integer Linear Optimization Trained Multivariate Classification Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate decision trees are powerful machine learning tools for classification and regression that attract many researchers and industry professionals. An optimal binary tree has two types of vertices, (i) branching vertices which have exactly two children and where datapoints are assessed on a set of discrete features and (ii) leaf vertices at which datapoints are given a prediction, and can be obtained by solving a biobjective optimization problem that seeks to (i) maximize the number of correctly classified datapoints and (ii) minimize the number of branching vertices. Branching vertices are linear combinations of training features and therefore can be thought of as hyperplanes. In this paper, we propose two cut-based mixed integer linear optimization (MILO) formulations for designing optimal binary classification trees (leaf vertices assign discrete classes). Our models leverage on-the-fly identification of minimal infeasible subsystems (MISs) from which we derive cutting planes that hold the form of packing constraints. We show theoretical improvements on the strongest flow-based MILO formulation currently in the literature and conduct experiments on publicly available datasets to show our models' ability to scale, strength against traditional branch and bound approaches, and robustness in out-of-sample test performance. Our code and data are available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Coloring bridge-free antiprismatic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coloring problem is a well-research topic and its complexity is known for several classes of graphs. However, the question of its complexity remains open for the class of antiprismatic graphs, which are the complement of prismatic graphs and one of the four remaining cases highlighted by Lozin and Malishev. In this article we focus on the equivalent question of the complexity of the clique cover problem in prismatic graphs.
  A graph $G$ is prismatic if for every triangle $T$ of $G$, every vertex of $G$ not in $T$ has a unique neighbor in $T$. A graph is co-bridge-free if it has no $C_4+2K_1$ as induced subgraph. We give a polynomial time algorithm that solves the clique cover problem in co-bridge-free prismatic graphs. It relies on the structural description given by Chudnovsky and Seymour, and on later work of Preissmann, Robin and Trotignon.
  We show that co-bridge-free prismatic graphs have a bounded number of disjoint triangles and that implies that the algorithm presented by Preissmann et al. applies.</description>

      <title>On a Gallai-type problem and illumination of spiky balls and cap bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that any finite family of pairwise intersecting balls in $\mathbb{E}^n$ can be pierced by $(\sqrt{3/2}+o(1))^n$ points improving the previously known estimate of $(2+o(1))^n$. As a corollary, this implies that any $2$-illuminable spiky ball in $\mathbb{E}^n$ can be illuminated by $(\sqrt{3/2}+o(1))^n$ directions. For the illumination number of convex spiky balls, i.e., cap bodies, we show an upper bound in terms of the sizes of certain related spherical codes and coverings. For large dimensions, this results in an upper bound of $1.19851^n$, which can be compared with the previous $(\sqrt{2}+o(1))^n$ established only for the centrally symmetric cap bodies. We also prove the lower bounds of $(\tfrac{2}{\sqrt{3}}-o(1))^n$ for the three problems above.</description>

      <title>On the sub-adjacent Hopf algebra of the universal enveloping algebra of a post-Lie algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently the notion of post-Hopf algebra was introduced, with the universal enveloping algebra of a post-Lie algebra as the fundamental example. A novel property is that any cocommutative post-Hopf algebra gives rise to a sub-adjacent Hopf algebra with a generalized Grossman-Larson product. By twisting the post-Hopf product, we provide a combinatorial antipode formula for the sub-adjacent Hopf algebra of the universal enveloping algebra of a post-Lie algebra. Relating to such a sub-adjacent Hopf algebra, we also obtain a closed inverse formula for the Oudom-Guin isomorphism in the context of post-Lie algebras. Especially as a byproduct, we derive a cancellation-free antipode formula for the Grossman-Larson Hopf algebra of ordered trees through a concrete tree-grafting expression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed several combinatorial notions about these laminations some with clear implications for parameter space. We introduce a simplified class of laminations called finite dynamical laminations (FDL). In order to count FDL, we introduce sibling portraits, of which we provide a comprehensive counting theorem. We introduce the pullback tree, and show that all FDL have a child in it. This gives a characterization of which periodic polygons appear in invariant laminations. The base of the pullback tree is a set of laminations, and we show that those laminations have very nice properties. We define the generational FDL graph, and it provides a summary of the combinatorial information we provide about polynomial parameter space.</description>

      <title>Valuative invariants for large classes of matroids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.04893v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an operation in matroid theory that allows one to transition a given matroid into another with more bases via relaxing a \emph{stressed subset}. This framework provides a new combinatorial characterization of the class of split matroids. Moreover, it permits to describe an explicit matroid subdivision of a hypersimplex, which in turn can be used to write down concrete formulas for the evaluations of any valuative invariant on these matroids. This shows that evaluations on split matroids depend solely on the behavior of the invariant on tractable subclass of Schubert matroids. We address systematically the consequences of our approach for several invariants. They include the volume and Ehrhart polynomial of base polytopes, the Tutte polynomial, Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials, the Whitney numbers of the first and second kind, spectrum polynomials and a generalization of these by Denham, chain polynomials and Speyer's $g$-polynomials, as well as Chow rings of matroids and their Hilbert--Poincar\'e series. The flexibility of this setting allows us to give a unified explanation for several recent results regarding the listed invariants; furthermore, we emphasize it as a powerful computational tool to produce explicit data and concrete examples.</description>

      <title>On locating and neighbor-locating colorings of sparse graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13557v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A proper $k$-coloring of a graph $G$ is a \emph{neighbor-locating $k$-coloring} if for each pair of vertices in the same color class, the two sets of colors found in their respective neighborhoods are different. The \textit{neighbor-locating chromatic number} $\chi_{NL}(G)$ is the minimum $k$ for which $G$ admits a neighbor-locating $k$-coloring. A proper $k$-vertex-coloring of a graph $G$ is a \emph{locating $k$-coloring} if for each pair of vertices $x$ and $y$ in the same color-class, there exists a color class $S_i$ such that $d(x,S_i)\neq d(y,S_i)$. The locating chromatic number $\chi_{L}(G)$ is the minimum $k$ for which $G$ admits a locating $k$-coloring. Our main results concern the largest possible order of a sparse graph of given neighbor-locating chromatic number. More precisely, we prove that if $G$ has order $n$, neighbor-locating chromatic number $k$ and average degree at most $2a$, where $2a\le k-1$ is a positive integer, then $n$ is upper-bounded by $\mathcal{O}(a^2(k^{2a+1}))$. We also design a family of graphs of bounded maximum degree whose order is close to reaching this upper bound. Our upper bound generalizes two previous bounds from the literature, which were obtained for graphs of bounded maximum degree and graphs of bounded cycle rank, respectively. Also, we prove that determining whether $\chi_L(G)\le k$ and $\chi_{NL}(G)\le k$ are NP-complete for sparse graphs: more precisely, for graphs with average degree at most 7, maximum average degree at most 20 and that are $4$-partite. We also study the possible relation between the ordinary chromatic number, the locating chromatic number and the neighbor-locating chromatic number of a graph.</description>

      <title>Normal 5-edge-coloring of some snarks superpositioned by Flower snarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An edge e is normal in a proper edge-coloring of a cubic graph G if the number of distinct colors on four edges incident to e is 2 or 4: A normal edge-coloring of G is a proper edge-coloring in which every edge of G is normal. The Petersen Coloring Conjecture is equivalent to stating that every bridgeless cubic graph has a normal 5-edge-coloring. Since every 3-edge-coloring of a cubic graph is trivially normal, it is suficient to consider only snarks to establish the conjecture. In this paper, we consider a class of superpositioned snarks obtained by choosing a cycle C in a snark G and superpositioning vertices of C by one of two simple supervertices and edges of C by superedges Hx;y, where H is any snark and x; y any pair of nonadjacent vertices of H: For such superpositioned snarks, two suficient conditions are given for the existence of a normal 5-edge-coloring. The first condition yields a normal 5-edge-coloring for all hypohamiltonian snarks used as superedges, but only for some of the possible ways of connecting them. In particular, since the Flower snarks are hypohamiltonian, this consequently yields a normal 5-edge-coloring for many snarks superpositioned by the Flower snarks. The second sufficient condition is more demanding, but its application yields a normal 5-edge-colorings for all superpositions by the Flower snarks. The same class of snarks is considered in [S. Liu, R.-X. Hao, C.-Q. Zhang, Berge{Fulkerson coloring for some families of superposition snarks, Eur. J. Comb. 96 (2021) 103344] for the Berge-Fulkerson conjecture. Since we established that this class has a Petersen coloring, this immediately yields the result of the above mentioned paper.</description>

      <title>Cost Allocation for Set Covering: the Happy Nucleolus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider cost allocation for set covering problems. We allocate as much cost to the elements (players) as possible without violating the group rationality condition (no subset of players pays more than covering this subset would cost), and so that the excess vector is lexicographically maximized. This is identical to the well-known nucleolus if the core of the corresponding cooperative game is nonempty, i.e., if some optimum fractional cover is integral. In general, we call this the 'happy nucleolus'. Like for the nucleolus, the excess vector contains an entry for every subset of players, not only for the sets in the given set covering instance. Moreover, it is NP-hard to compute a single entry because this requires solving a set covering problem. Nevertheless, we give an explicit family of at most $mn$ subsets, each with a trivial cover (by a single set), such that the happy nucleolus is always completely determined by this proxy excess vector; here $m$ and $n$ denote the number of sets and the number of players in our set covering instance. We show that this is the unique minimal such family in a natural sense. While computing the nucleolus for set covering is NP-hard, our results imply that the happy nucleolus can be computed in polynomial time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a powerful tool for embedding any tree poset $P$ of height $k$ in the Boolean lattice which allows us to solve several open problems in the area. We show that:
  * If $\mathcal{F}$ is a family in $\mathcal{B}_n$ with $|\mathcal{F}|\ge (q-1+\varepsilon){n\choose \lfloor n/2\rfloor}$ for some $q\ge k$, then $\mathcal{F}$ contains on the order of as many induced copies of $P$ as is contained in the $q$ middle layers of the Boolean lattice. This generalizes results of Bukh and Boehnlein and Jiang which guaranteed a single such copy in non-induced and induced settings respectively.
  * The number of induced $P$-free families of $\mathcal{B}_n$ is $2^{(k-1+o(1)){n\choose \lfloor n/2\rfloor}}$, strengthening recent independent work of Balogh, Garcia, Wigal who obtained the same bounds in the non-induced setting.
  * The largest induced $P$-free subset of a $p$-random subset of $\mathcal{B}_n$ for $p\gg n^{-1}$ has size at most $(k-1+o(1))p{n\choose \lfloor n/2\rfloor}$, generalizing previous work of Balogh, Mycroft, and Treglown and of Collares and Morris for the case when $P$ is a chain.
  All three results are asymptotically tight and give affirmative answers to general conjectures of Gerbner, Nagy, Patk\'os, and Vizer in the case of tree posets.</description>
