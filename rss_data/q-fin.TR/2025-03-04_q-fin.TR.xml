      <title>Shifting Power: Leveraging LLMs to Simulate Human Aversion in ABMs of Bilateral Financial Exchanges, A bond market study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilateral markets, such as those for government bonds, involve decentralized and opaque transactions between market makers (MMs) and clients, posing significant challenges for traditional modeling approaches. To address these complexities, we introduce TRIBE an agent-based model augmented with a large language model (LLM) to simulate human-like decision-making in trading environments. TRIBE leverages publicly available data and stylized facts to capture realistic trading dynamics, integrating human biases like risk aversion and ambiguity sensitivity into the decision-making processes of agents. Our research yields three key contributions: first, we demonstrate that integrating LLMs into agent-based models to enhance client agency is feasible and enriches the simulation of agent behaviors in complex markets; second, we find that even slight trade aversion encoded within the LLM leads to a complete cessation of trading activity, highlighting the sensitivity of market dynamics to agents' risk profiles; third, we show that incorporating human-like variability shifts power dynamics towards clients and can disproportionately affect the entire system, often resulting in systemic agent collapse across simulations. These findings underscore the emergent properties that arise when introducing stochastic, human-like decision processes, revealing new system behaviors that enhance the realism and complexity of artificial societies.</description>

      <title>A New Traders' Game? -- Response Functions in a Historical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traders on financial markets generate non-Markovian effects in various ways, particularly through their competition with one another which can be interpreted as a game between different (types of) traders. To quantify the market mechanisms, we analyze self-response functions for pairs of different stocks and the corresponding trade sign correlators. While the non-Markovian dynamics in the self-responses is liquidity-driven, it is expectation-driven in the cross-responses which is related to the emergence of correlations. We study the non-stationarity of theses responses over time. In our previous analysis, we only investigated the crisis year 2008. We now considerably extend this by also analyzing the years 2007, 2014 and 2021. To improve statistics, we also work out averaged response functions for the different years. We find significant variations over time revealing changes in the traders' game.</description>

      <title>\textsc{Perseus}: Tracing the Masterminds Behind Cryptocurrency Pump-and-Dump Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Masterminds are entities organizing, coordinating, and orchestrating cryptocurrency pump-and-dump schemes, a form of trade-based manipulation undermining market integrity and causing financial losses for unwitting investors. Previous research detects pump-and-dump activities in the market, predicts the target cryptocurrency, and examines investors and \ac{osn} entities. However, these solutions do not address the root cause of the problem. There is a critical gap in identifying and tracing the masterminds involved in these schemes. In this research, we develop a detection system \textsc{Perseus}, which collects real-time data from the \acs{osn} and cryptocurrency markets. \textsc{Perseus} then constructs temporal attributed graphs that preserve the direction of information diffusion and the structure of the community while leveraging \ac{gnn} to identify the masterminds behind pump-and-dump activities. Our design of \textsc{Perseus} leads to higher F1 scores and precision than the \ac{sota} fraud detection method, achieving fast training and inferring speeds. Deployed in the real world from February 16 to October 9 2024, \textsc{Perseus} successfully detects $438$ masterminds who are efficient in the pump-and-dump information diffusion networks. \textsc{Perseus} provides regulators with an explanation of the risks of masterminds and oversight capabilities to mitigate the pump-and-dump schemes of cryptocurrency.</description>

      <title>TradingAgents: Multi-Agents LLM Financial Trading Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20138v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in automated problem-solving using societies of agents powered by large language models (LLMs). In finance, efforts have largely focused on single-agent systems handling specific tasks or multi-agent frameworks independently gathering data. However, multi-agent systems' potential to replicate real-world trading firms' collaborative dynamics remains underexplored. TradingAgents proposes a novel stock trading framework inspired by trading firms, featuring LLM-powered agents in specialized roles such as fundamental analysts, sentiment analysts, technical analysts, and traders with varied risk profiles. The framework includes Bull and Bear researcher agents assessing market conditions, a risk management team monitoring exposure, and traders synthesizing insights from debates and historical data to make informed decisions. By simulating a dynamic, collaborative trading environment, this framework aims to improve trading performance. Detailed architecture and extensive experiments reveal its superiority over baseline models, with notable improvements in cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown, highlighting the potential of multi-agent LLM frameworks in financial trading. TradingAgents is available at https://github.com/PioneerFintech.</description>

      <title>Can AI Detect Wash Trading? Evidence from NFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18717v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing studies on crypto wash trading often use indirect statistical methods or leaked private data, both with inherent limitations. This paper leverages public on-chain NFT data for a more direct and granular estimation. Analyzing three major exchanges, we find that ~38% (30-40%) of trades and ~60% (25-95%) of traded value likely involve manipulation, with significant variation across exchanges. This direct evidence enables a critical reassessment of existing indirect methods, identifying roundedness-based regressions \`a la Cong et al. (2023) as most promising, though still error-prone in the NFT setting. To address this, we develop an AI-based estimator that integrates these regressions in a machine learning framework, significantly reducing both exchange- and trade-level estimation errors in NFT markets (and beyond).</description>

      <title>Liquidity Jump, Liquidity Diffusion, and Crypto Wash Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that a portion of short-term price jumps in crypto assets results from liquidity fluctuations induced by wash trading. We develop a model decomposing liquidity into two components: liquidity jump (size of fluctuation) and liquidity diffusion (probability of fluctuation). High values for both liquidity measures indicate wash trading, while high liquidity jump with low liquidity diffusion suggests legitimate high-demand trading. Together, these liquidity measures enable detection of wash trades and help market participants understand liquidity dynamics, and make informed decisions in crypto trading.</description>
