      <title>Recent developments in relativistic hydrodynamic fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of thermal fluctuations in relativistic hydrodynamics has led to numerous important developments in the last decade. We present a bird's eye view of the recent advances on the theory of fluctuations on three fronts; stochastic hydrodynamics, hydro-kinetics where fluctuations are included as additional modes that satisfy deterministic evolution equations, and effective field theory formulation of relativistic hydrodynamics. We compare and contrast these different but complimentary frameworks and highlight various recent progresses in each of them.</description>

      <title>CMM formula as superintegrability property of unitary model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A typical example of superintegrability is provided by expression of the Hopf link hyperpolynomial in an arbitrary representation through a pair of the Macdonald polynomials at special points. In the simpler case of the Hopf link HOMFLY-PT polynomial and a pair of the Schur functions, it is a relation in the unitary matrix model. We explain that the Cherednik-Mehta-Macdonald (CMM) identity for bilinear Macdonald residues with an elliptic weight function is nothing but a reformulation of these same formulas. Their lifting to arbitrary knots and links, even torus ones remains obscure.</description>

      <title>Foundational Issues in Dynamical Casimir Effect and Analogue Features in Cosmological Particle Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moving mirrors as analogue sources of Hawking radiation from black holes have been explored extensively, less so with cosmological particle creation (CPC), even though the analogy between dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) and CPC based on the mechanism of parametric amplification of quantum field fluctuations has also been known for a long time. This `perspective' essay intends to convey some of the rigor and thoroughness of quantum field theory in curved spacetime, which serves as the theoretical foundation of CPC, to DCE, which enjoys a variety of active experimental explorations. We have selected out seven issues of relevance to address, starting from the naively simple ones, e.g., why should one be bothered with `curved' spacetime when performing a laboratory experiment in ostensibly flat space, to foundational theoretical ones, such as the frequent appearance of nonlocal dissipation in the system dynamics induced by colored noises in its field environment, the existence of quantum Lenz law and fluctuation-dissipation relations in the backreaction effects of DCE emission on the moving atom/mirror or the source, and the construction of a microphysics model to account for the dynamical responses of a mirror or medium. The strengthening of theoretical ground for DCE is useful not only for improving conceptual clarity but needed for the development of proof of concept type of future experimental designs for DCE. Results from DCE experiments in turn will enrich our understanding of quantum field effects in the early universe because they are, in the spirit of analogue gravity, our best hopes for the verification of these fundamental processes.</description>

      <title>From Operator Product Expansion to Anomalous Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new method for computing renormalization functions, which is based on the ideas of operator product expansion and large momentum expansion. In this method, the renormalization $Z$-factors are determined by the ultraviolet finiteness of Wilson coefficients in the dimensional regularization scheme. The ultraviolet divergence is extracted solely from two-point functions at the large momentum limit. We develop this method in scalar field theories and provide a general framework for computing anomalous dimensions of field, mass, couplings and composite operators. In particular, it is applied to 6-dimensional cubic scalar theory and 4-dimensional quartic scalar theory. We demonstrate this method by computing the anomalous dimension of the $\phi^Q$ operator in cubic theory up to four loops for arbitrary $Q$, which is in agreement with the known result in the large $N$ limit. The idea of computing anomalous dimensions from operator production expansion is general and can be extended beyond scalar theories.</description>

      <title>Matrix Theory Reloaded: A BPS Road to Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the decoupling limits that lead to matrix theories on D-branes. We highlight the BPS nature of these limits, in which the target space geometry becomes non-Lorentzian and wrapped D-branes experience instantaneous gravitational forces. Applied to curved D-brane geometries, we show that a single BPS decoupling limit induces the bulk near-horizon limit leading to AdS/CFT. By consecutively applying two such limits, we systematically generate further examples of holography, including novel versions with non-Lorentzian bulk geometry. Uplifted to M-theory, we are led to a unified framework where each BPS decoupling limit corresponds to a Discrete Light Cone Quantisation (DLCQ). We conjecture that a DLCQ${}^n$/DLCQ${}^{m}$ correspondence, with $m&gt;n$, captures the notion of holography in string theory. In particular, AdS${}_5$/CFT${}_4$ can be viewed as an example of DLCQ${}^0$/DLCQ${}^{1}$, with the extra DLCQ on the field theory side corresponding to the near-horizon limit in the bulk geometry. We further show that undoing these BPS decoupling limits can be viewed as deformations of matrix theories. We explain how these deformations are related to the $T\bar{T}$ deformation in two dimensions. In the context of holography, this allows us to view the ten-dimensional near-horizon brane geometry as an intrinsic deformation of the flat non-Lorentzian geometry that arises asymptotically. In field theoretic terms, these generalisations lead to $T\bar{T}$-like flow equations for the D$p$-brane DBI action.</description>

      <title>MQT Qudits: A Software Framework for Mixed-Dimensional Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds great promise for surpassing the limits of classical devices in many fields. Despite impressive developments, however, current research is primarily focused on qubits. At the same time, quantum hardware based on multi-level, qudit, systems offers a range of advantages, including expanded gate sets, higher information density, and improved computational efficiency, which might play a key role in overcoming not only the limitations of classical machines but also of current qubit-based quantum devices. However, working with qudits faces challenges not only in experimental control but particularly in algorithm development and quantum software. In this work, we introduce MQT Qudits, an open-source tool, which, as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT), is built to assist in designing and implementing applications for mixed-dimensional qudit devices. We specify a standardized language for mixed-dimension systems and discuss circuit specification, compilation to hardware gate sets, efficient circuit simulation, and open challenges. MQT Qudits is available at github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qudits and on pypi at pypi.org/project/mqt.qudits.</description>

      <title>Do causal sets have symmetries?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal sets are locally finite, partially ordered sets (posets), which are considered as discrete models of spacetimes. On the one hand, causal sets corresponding to a spacetime manifold are commonly generated with a random process called sprinkling. This process keeps only a discrete set of points of the manifold and their causal relations (loosing the spacetime symmetries in each sprinkle). On the other hand, the main conjecture of causal set theory is that given an ensemble of causal sets there is a corresponding spacetime manifold and the continuum symmetries of it are like all manifold properties "reconstructable" from the partial orders of all the causal sets in the ensemble. But most generic finite posets have very few layers ("instances of time") in contrast to sprinkles with many layers in a sufficiently large spacetime region.
  In a recent project, I investigated the automorphism groups of (finite) posets in order to identify and classify their symmetries systematically. The comparison of local symmetries of generic posets (including Kleitmann-Rothschild orders) with sprinkled causal sets may help us to find those posets that can serve as discrete spacetime models in causal set theory.</description>

      <title>Chaotic motion of particles in the spacetime of a Kerr black hole immersed in swirling universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the motion of particles in the spacetime of a Kerr black hole immersed in swirling universes. Using the Poincar\'{e} section, fast Lyapunov exponent indicator, bifurcation diagram and basins of attraction, we present the effects of the swirling parameter and the spin parameter on the dynamical behaviors of the motion of particles, and confirm the presence of chaos in the motion of particles in this background spacetime. We find that the swirling parameter can change the range of the spin parameter where the chaos occurs, and vice versa. Moreover, we observe clearly that, regardless of the spin parameter, there exist some self-similar fractal fine structures in the basins boundaries of attractors for the spacetime of a black hole immersed in swirling universes. The combination the swirling parameter and the spin parameter provides richer physics in the motion of particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present superconducting vortex solutions in the two-Higgs doublet model which has a gauged $U(1)$ Higgs-family symmetry. We write down an ansatz for the solution and study its basic properties, for the case of both global and gauged symmetries. We demonstrate its prima-facie stability using 3D numerical simulations of a global version of the theory, observing the flow of current along the string. We discuss how generic such a phenomena might be and the possible consequences if such a model is found in nature.</description>

      <title>Confinement and false vacuum decay on the Potts quantum spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider non-equilibrium dynamics after quantum quenches in the mixed-field three-state Potts quantum chain in the ferromagnetic regime. Compared to the analogous setting for the Ising spin chain, the Potts model has a much richer phenomenology, which originates partly from baryonic excitations in the spectrum and partly from the various possible relative alignments of the initial magnetisation and the longitudinal field. We obtain the excitation spectrum by combining semi-classical approximation and exact diagonalisation, and we use the results to explain the various dynamical behaviours we observe. Besides recovering dynamical confinement, as well as Wannier-Stark localisation due to Bloch oscillations similar to the Ising chain, a novel feature is the presence of baryonic excitations in the quench spectroscopy. In addition, when the initial magnetisation and the longitudinal field are misaligned, both confinement and Bloch oscillations only result in partial localisation, with some correlations retaining an unsuppressed light-cone behaviour together with a corresponding growth of entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in dual unitary quantum circuits with impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bipartite entanglement entropy is one of the most useful characterizations of universal properties in a many-body quantum system. Far from equilibrium, there exist two highly effective theories describing its dynamics -- the quasiparticle and membrane pictures. In this work we investigate entanglement dynamics, and these two complementary approaches, in a quantum circuit model perturbed by an impurity. In particular, we consider a dual unitary quantum circuit containing a spatially fixed, non-dual-unitary impurity gate, allowing for differing local Hilbert space dimensions to either side. We compute the entanglement entropy for both a semi-infinite and a finite subsystem within a finite distance of the impurity, comparing exact results to predictions of the effective theories. We find that in the former case, both theories agree with each other and the exact calculation. In the latter case, however, both theories qualitatively differ, with the quasiparticle picture predicting a non-monotonic growth in contrast to the membrane picture. We show that such non-monotonic behavior can arise even in random chaotic circuits, pointing to a hitherto unknown shortcoming of the membrane picture in describing such systems.</description>

      <title>Non-spherical effects on the mass function of Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the impact of non-spherical effects on the Primordial Black Hole mass function, based on the ellipticity-dependent threshold calculated by performing $3+1$ relativistic numerical simulations. We consider an equation of state of radiation $w:=P/\rho=1/3$ and a softer one $w=1/10$ with $P$ and $\rho$ begin the pressure and energy density, respectively. We suppose that the curvature perturbations obey Gaussian statistics with a monochromatic power spectrum and examine the most probable ellipsoidal configurations utilizing peak theory. We also suppose the critical scaling law of the PBH mass near the threshold following the known results. The simulations show that the non-sphericity can easily prevent the system from black hole formation when the initial fluctuation amplitude is near the threshold (critical scaling regime). Nevertheless, we show that the non-spherical effects make the mass function just a few times smaller and are insignificant on the mass function distribution, including the power-law scaling in the small mass region.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Ellipsoidal Primordial Black Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform $3+1$ relativistic numerical simulations to study primordial black hole (PBH) formation from the collapse of adiabatic super-horizon non-spherical perturbations generated from curvature fluctuations obeying random Gaussian statistics with a monochromatic power spectrum. The matter field is assumed to be a perfect fluid of an equation of state $w:=P/\rho={\rm const.}$ with $P$ and $\rho$ being the pressure and the energy density, respectively. The initial spatial profile of the curvature perturbation is modeled with the amplitude $\mu$ and non-spherical parameters $e$ (ellipticity) and $p$ (prolateness) according to peak theory. We focus on the dynamics and the threshold for PBH formation in terms of the non-spherical parameters $e$ and $p$. We find that the critical values ($e_c, p_c$) with a fixed value of $\mu$ closely follow a superellipse curve. With $p=0$, for the range of amplitudes considered, we find that the critical ellipticity for non-spherical collapse follows a decaying power law as a function of $(\mu-\mu_{\rm c,sp})$ with $\mu_{\rm c,sp}$ being the threshold for the spherical case. Our results also indicate that, for both cases of $w = 1/3$ and $w = 1/10$, small deviations from sphericity can avoid collapsing to a black hole when the amplitude is near its critical threshold. Finally we discuss the significance of the ellipticity on the rate of the PBH production.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of Quadratic Love Numbers of Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The induced conservative tidal response of self-gravitating objects in general relativity is parametrized in terms of a set of coefficients, which are commonly referred to as Love numbers. For asymptotically-flat black holes in four spacetime dimensions, the Love numbers are notoriously zero in the static regime. In this work, we show that this result continues to hold upon inclusion of nonlinearities in the theory for Schwarzschild black holes. We first solve the quadratic Einstein equations in the static limit to all orders in the multipolar expansion, including both even and odd perturbations. We show that the second-order solutions take simple analytic expressions, generically expressible in the form of finite polynomials. We then define the quadratic Love numbers at the level of the point-particle effective field theory. By performing the matching with the full solution in general relativity, we show that quadratic Love number coefficients are zero to all orders in the derivative expansion, like the linear ones.</description>

      <title>Crystallography, Group Cohomology, and Lieb-Schultz-Mattis Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the mod-2 cohomology rings for three-dimensional (3D) space groups and establish a connection between them and the lattice structure of crystals with space group symmetry. This connection allows us to obtain a complete set of Lieb-Schultz-Mattis constraints, specifying the conditions under which a unique, symmetric, gapped ground state cannot exist in 3D lattice magnets. We associate each of these constraints with an element in the third mod-2 cohomology of the space group, when the internal symmetry acts on-site and its projective representations are classified by powers of $\mathbb{Z}_2$. We demonstrate the relevance of our results to the study of $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum spin liquids on the 3D pyrochlore lattice. We determine, through anomaly matching, the symmetry fractionalization patterns of both electric and magnetic charges, extending previous results from projective symmetry group classifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study scattering equations of hyperplane arrangements from the perspective of combinatorial commutative algebra and numerical algebraic geometry. We formulate the problem as linear equations on a reciprocal linear space and develop a degeneration-based homotopy algorithm for solving them. We investigate the Hilbert regularity of the corresponding homogeneous ideal and apply our methods to CHY scattering equations.</description>

      <title>Temperatures of AdS$_2$ black holes and holography revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04427v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a dilaton gravity model, we revisit the calculation of the temperature of an evaporating black hole that is initially formed by a shock wave, taking into account the quantum backreaction. Based on the holographic principle, along with the assumption of a boundary equation of motion, we show that the black hole energy is maintained for a while during the early stage of evaporation. Gradually, it decreases as time goes on and eventually vanishes. Thus, the Stefan-Boltzmann law tells us that the black hole temperature, defined by the emission rate of the black hole energy, starts from zero temperature and reaches a maximum value at a critical time, and finally vanishes. It is also shown that the maximum temperature of the evaporating black hole never exceeds the Hawking temperature of the eternal AdS$_{2}$ black hole. We discuss physical implications of the initial zero temperature of the evaporating black hole.</description>

Abstract: We consider gas of massless fermions at certain temperature T and acceleration a. We find a second order phase transition at temperature T approaching the Unruh temperature TU. The implications for hadronization of the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions (HIC) and for black-hole physics are discussed. In particular, this novel phase transition may be associated with thermalization in HIC, indicating its analogy with falling into a black hole.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic bound on slow-roll parameter in stringy quintessence model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the late time behavior of the scalar part of the volume modulus and the dilaton in stringy quintessence model, focusing on their contributions to the Hubble slow-roll parameter $\epsilon$ which directly measures the deviation of the spacetime geometry from de Sitter space. When only one of the moduli is allowed to move, $\epsilon$ converges to the stable fixed point at late time. The fixed point value is larger than $1$, thus the slow-roll cannot be realized. Moreover, if the decay rate of the quintessence potential is larger than some critical value, the positivity of the potential imposes that the stable fixed point value is just given by $3$, independent of the details of the moduli dynamics. Otherwise, the fixed point value coincides with the potential slow-roll parameter. When both the volume modulus and the dilaton roll down the potential simultaneously, we can find the relation between the contributions of two moduli to $\epsilon$ satisfied at the fixed point. In this case, the fixed point value is not in general the simple sum of fixed point values in the single field case and cannot be larger than $3$.</description>

      <title>On the Symmetry TFT of Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory has the peculiar property that its one-form symmetry defects have non-trivial braiding, namely they are charged under the same symmetry they generate, which is then anomalous. This poses a few puzzles in describing the corresponding Symmetry TFT in a four-dimensional bulk. First, the braiding between lines at the boundary seems to be ill-defined when such lines are pulled into the bulk. Second, the Symmetry TFT appears to be too trivial to allow for topological boundary conditions encoding all the different global variants. We show that both of these puzzles can be solved by including endable (tubular) surfaces in the class of bulk topological operators one has to consider. In this way, we are able to reproduce all global variants of the theory, with their symmetries and their anomalies. We check the validity of our proposal also against a top-down holographic realization of the same class of theories.</description>

      <title>Ramp from Replica Trick</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the spectral form factor of the modular Hamiltonian $K=-\ln\rho_A$ associated to the reduced density matrix of a Haar random state. A ramp is demonstrated and we find an analytic expression for its slope. Our method involves an application of the replica trick, where we first calculate the correlator $&lt;\text{tr}\rho_A^n\;\text{tr}\rho_A^m&gt;$ at large bond dimension and then analytically continue the indices $n,m$ from integers to arbitrary complex numbers. We use steepest descent methods at large modular times to extract the ramp. The large bond dimension limit of the replicated partition function is dominated by a sum over \emph{annular non-crossing permutations}. We explored the similarity between our results and calculations of the spectral form factor in low dimensional gravitational theories where the ramp is determined by the double trumpet geometry. We find there is an underlying resemblance in the two calculations, when we interpret the annular non-crossing permutations as representing a discretized version of the double trumpet. Similar results are found for an equilibrated pure state in place of the Haar random state.</description>

      <title>BRST Covariant Phase Space and Holographic Ward Identities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops an enlarged BRST framework to treat the large gauge transformations of a given quantum field theory. It determines the associated infinitely many Noether charges stemming from a gauge fixed and BRST invariant Lagrangian, a result that cannot be obtained from Noether's second theorem. The geometrical significance of this result is highlighted by the construction of a trigraded BRST covariant phase space, allowing a BRST invariant gauge fixing procedure. This provides an appropriate framework for determining the conserved BRST Noether current of the global BRST symmetry and the associated global Noether charges. The latter are found to be equivalent with the usual classical corner charges of large gauge transformations. It allows one to prove the gauge independence of their physical effects at the perturbative quantum level. In particular, the underlying BRST fundamental canonical relation provides the same graded symplectic brackets as in the classical covariant phase space. A unified Lagrangian Ward identity for small and large gauge transformations is built. It consistently decouples into a bulk part for small gauge transformations, which is the standard BRST--BV quantum master equation, and a boundary part for large gauge transformations. The boundary part provides a perturbation theory origin for the invariance of the Hamiltonian physical $\mathcal{S}$-matrix under asymptotic symmetries. Holographic anomalies for the boundary Ward identity are studied and found to be solutions of a codimension one Wess--Zumino consistency condition. Such solutions are studied in the context of extended BMS symmetry. Their existence clarifies the status of the $1$-loop correction to the subleading soft graviton theorem.</description>

Abstract: Any four-dimensional Supersymmetric Quantum Field Theory with eight supercharges can be associated to a monoidal category of BPS line defects. Any Coulomb vacuum of such a theory can be conjecturally associated to an ``algebra of BPS particles'', exemplified by certain Cohomological Hall Algebras. We conjecture the existence of a monoidal functor from the category of line defects to a certain category of bimodules for the BPS Algebra in any Coulomb vacuum. We describe images of simple objects under the conjectural functor and study their monoidal structure in examples. We conjecture that the functor may be an equivalence of dg-categories and test the conjecture at the level of the equivariant Witten indices of the spaces of morphisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first nonperturbative large-$N$ calculation of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric (SUSY) $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang$-$Mills gluino condensate obtained by means of numerical simulations of the lattice-discretized theory, exploiting large-$N$ twisted volume reduction. We present two different determinations based, respectively, on the Banks$-$Casher formula and on the Gell-Mann$-$Oakes$-$Renner relation, both giving perfectly consistent results. By expressing the lattice results in the Novikov$-$Shifman$-$Vainshtein$-$Zakharov (NSVZ) scheme, we are able for the first time to compare numerical and analytic computations. Our most accurate determination of the Renormalization Group Invariant (RGI) gluino condensate gives $\Sigma_{\rm RGI} /\Lambda_{\rm NSVZ}^3 = [1.18\, (08)_{\rm stat}\, (12)_{\rm syst}]^3 = 1.64(33)_{\rm stat} \, (50)_{\rm syst} = 1.64(60)$, in agreement with the $N$-dependence and the value predicted by the weak coupling instanton-based approach $\Sigma_{\rm RGI} /\Lambda_{\rm NSVZ}^3 = 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend our consideration of commutative subalgebras (rays) in different representations of the $W_{1+\infty}$ algebra to the elliptic Hall algebra (or, equivalently, to the Ding-Iohara-Miki (DIM) algebra $U_{q,t}(\widehat{\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}}_1)$). Its advantage is that it possesses the Miki automorphism, which makes all commutative rays equivalent. Integrable systems associated with these rays become finite-difference and, apart from the trigonometric Ruijsenaars system not too much familiar. We concentrate on the simplest many-body and Fock representations, and derive explicit formulas for all generators of the elliptic Hall algebra $e_{n,m}$. In the one-body representation, they differ just by normalization from $z^nq^{m\hat D}$ of the $W_{1+\infty}$ Lie algebra, and, in the $N$-body case, they are non-trivially generalized to monomials of the Cherednik operators with action restricted to symmetric polynomials. In the Fock representation, the resulting operators are expressed through auxiliary polynomials of $n$ variables, which define weights in the residues formulas. We also discuss $q,t$-deformation of matrix models associated with constructed commutative subalgebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a measure of symmetry breaking in quantum subsystems, inspired by quantum information theory, particularly suited to study out-of-equilibrium states. We study the entanglement asymmetry of a class of excited "coherent states" in conformal quantum field theories with a U(1) symmetry, employing Euclidean path-integral methods with topological symmetry defects and the replica formalism. We compute, at leading order in perturbation theory, the asymmetry for a variety of subsystems, including finite spherical subregions in flat space, in finite volume, and at positive temperature. We also study its Lorentzian time evolution, showcasing the dynamical restoration of the symmetry due to thermalization, as well as the presence of a quantum Mpemba effect. Our results are universal, and apply in any number of dimensions. We also show that the perturbative entanglement asymmetry is related to the Fisher information metric, which has a known holographic dual called Hollands-Wald canonical energy, and that it is captured by the AdS bulk charge contained in the entanglement wedge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of the Kauffman bracket, which describes the Jones polynomial as a sum over closed circles formed by the planar resolution of vertices in a knot diagram, can be straightforwardly lifted from sl(2) to sl(N) at arbitrary N -- but for a special class of bipartite diagrams made entirely from the anitparallel lock tangle. Many amusing and important knots and links can be described in this way, from twist and double braid knots to the celebrated Kanenobu knots for even parameters -- and for all of them the entire HOMFLY polynomials possess planar decomposition. This provides an approach to evaluation of HOMFLY polynomials, which is complementary to the arborescent calculus, and this opens a new direction to homological techniques, parallel to Khovanov-Rozansky generalisations of the Kauffman calculus. Moreover, this planar calculus is also applicable to other symmetric representations beyond the fundamental one, and to links which are not fully bipartite what is illustrated by examples of Kanenobu-like links.</description>

Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of type II orientifold flux vacua in three dimensions including gauge and metric fluxes, O-planes and D-branes. We derive simple flux models (we dub them RSTU-models) that admit a description in terms of gauged supergravities with half-maximal $\,\mathcal{N}=8\,$ supersymmetry in three dimensions. As a landscape appetizer, we present various multi-parametric families of supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric AdS$_{3}$ and Mkw$_{3}$ vacua. Remarkably, negative masses turn out to be always absent in the spectrum of scalar fluctuations, thus making all the vacua perturbatively stable within half-maximal supergravity. We provide examples of non-supersymmetric type IIB AdS$_{3}$ flux vacua which feature parametrically-controlled scale separation and come along with integer-valued conformal dimensions of the would-be dual CFT$_{2}$ operators. We also comment on the implications of our results in light of the Swampland Program.</description>

      <title>The chiral torsional anomaly and the Nieh-Yan invariant with and without boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There exists a long-standing debate regarding the torsion contribution to the 4d chiral anomaly of a Dirac fermion. Central to this debate is the Nieh-Yan anomaly, which has been considered ill-defined and a regularization artifact. Using a heat-kernel approach, we examine the relationship between the Dirac operator index, the Nieh-Yan invariant and the torsional anomaly. We show the Nieh-Yan invariant vanishes on spacetimes without boundaries, if the Dirac index is well-defined. In the known examples of non-vanishing Nieh--Yan invariant on manifolds without boundaries, the heat kernel expansion breaks down, making the index ill-defined. Finally, for finite boundaries we identify several finite bulk and boundary anomaly terms, alongside bulk and boundary Nieh-Yan terms. We construct explicit counterterms that cancel the Nieh-Yan terms and argue that the boundary terms give rise to a torsional anomalous Hall effect. Our results emphasize the importance of renormalization conditions, as these can affect the non-thermal Nieh-Yan anomaly coefficients. In addition, we demonstrate that anomalous torsional transport may arise even without relying on the Nieh-Yan invariant.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Extremal Couplings in AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an effective theory of massive scalar fields on a fixed AdS$_{d+1}$ background with a cubic extremal interaction among them. A bulk coupling is called extremal whenever the corresponding conformal dimension of any of the dual CFT$_d$ operators matches the sum of all the others. For cubic bulk couplings, this is $\Delta_i+\Delta_j=\Delta_k$. These bulk interactions are often disregarded in the literature since they do not appear in traditional models of AdS/CFT. Turning them on yields a divergent vertex in the dual CFT, and here we show that these divergences can be regulated. Once renormalized, we demonstrate that this coupling introduces non-trivial mixing between single- and double-trace operators, and we compute the anomalous dimensions of the corrected operators to leading order in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>The Sommerfeld enhancement at NLO and the dark matter unitarity bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reexamine the consequences of perturbative unitarity on dark matter freeze-out when both Sommerfeld enhancement and bound state formation affect dark matter annihilations. At leading order (LO) the annihilation cross-section is infrared dominated and the connection between the unitarity bound and the upper bound on the dark matter mass depends only on how the different partial waves are populated. We compute how this picture is modified at next-to-leading order (NLO) with the goal of assigning a reliable theory uncertainty to the freeze-out predictions. We explicitly compute NLO corrections in a simple model with abelian gauge interactions and provide an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty for the thermal masses of heavy electroweak $n$-plets. Along the way, we clarify the regularization and matching procedure necessary to deal with singular potentials in quantum mechanics with a calculable, relativistic UV completion.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Everpresent $\Lambda$ (II): Cosmological Tests of Current Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates Everpresent $\Lambda$, a stochastic dark energy model motivated by causal set theory and unimodular gravity, and confronts it with two key observational data sets, Supernova Ia (SN Ia) and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. A key feature of this model is that $\Lambda$ fluctuates over time and on average the magnitude of its fluctuations is of the order of the dominant energy density (be it radiation or matter) for the given epoch. In particular, we focus on a phenomenological implementation of Everpresent $\Lambda$ known as Model 1. The random fluctuations in Everpresent $\Lambda$ realizations are generated using seed numbers, and we find that for a small fraction of seeds Model 1 is capable of producing realizations that fit SN Ia data better than $\Lambda$CDM. We further investigate what features distinguish these realizations from the more general behaviour, and find that the "good'' realizations have relatively small fluctuations at low redshifts ($z&lt;1.5$), which do not closely track the matter density. We find that Model 1 struggles to improve on $\Lambda$CDM at describing the CMB data. However, by suppressing the values of $\Lambda$ near the last scattering surface, as suggested in arXiv:1703.06265, we find a large improvement in the best fit of the model, though still with a $\chi^2$ value much larger than that of $\Lambda$CDM. We also study the allowed variation of the dark energy density by the CMB constraints in a more model-independent manner, and find that some variation (especially prior to recombination) is possible and in fact can lead to improvement over $\Lambda$CDM and reduce the Hubble tension, in line with some early dark energy proposals. However, for the kinds of variations considered, the favoured fluctuations are smaller in magnitude than is typical in current Everpresent $\Lambda$ models.</description>

      <title>A unified-description of curvature, torsion, and non-metricity of the metric-affine geometry with the M\"{o}bius representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the mathematical fundamentals for a unified description of curvature, torsion, and non-metricity 2-forms in the way extending the so-called M\"{o}bius representation of the affine group, which is the method to convert the semi-direct product into the ordinary matrix product, to revive the fertility of gauge theories of gravity. First of all, we illustrate the basic concepts for constructing the metric-affine geometry. Then the curvature and torsion 2-forms are described in a unified manner by using the Cartan connection of the M\"{o}bius representation of the affine group. In this unified-description, the curvature and torsion are derived by Cartan's structure equation with respect to a common connection 1-form. After that, extending the M\"{o}bius representation, the dilation and shear 2-forms, or equivalently, the non-metricity 2-form, are introduced in the same unified manner. Based on the unified-description established in this paper, introducing a new group parametrization and applying the In\"{o}n\"{u}-Wigner group contraction to the full theory, the relationships among symmetries, geometric quantities, and geometries are investigated with respect to the three gauge groups: the metric-affine group and its extension, and an extension of the (anti)-de Sitter group in which the non-metricity exists. Finally, possible applications to theories of gravity are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Bound-state confinement after trap-expansion dynamics in integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrable systems possess stable families of quasiparticles, which are composite objects (bound states) of elementary excitations. Motivated by recent quantum computer experiments, we investigate bound-state transport in the spin-$1/2$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain ($XXZ$ chain). Specifically, we consider the sudden vacuum expansion of a finite region $A$ prepared in a non-equilibrium state. In the hydrodynamic regime, if interactions are strong enough, bound states remain confined in the initial region. Bound-state confinement persists until the density of unbound excitations remains finite in the bulk of $A$. Since region $A$ is finite, at asymptotically long times bound states are "liberated" after the "evaporation" of all the unbound excitations. Fingerprints of confinement are visible in the space-time profiles of local spin-projection operators. To be specific, here we focus on the expansion of the $p$-N\'eel states, which are obtained by repetition of a unit cell with $p$ up spins followed by $p$ down spins. Upon increasing $p$, the bound-state content is enhanced. In the limit $p\to\infty$ one obtains the domain-wall initial state. We show that for $p&lt;4$, only bound states with $n&gt;p$ are confined at large chain anisotropy. For $p\gtrsim 4$, also bound states with $n=p$ are confined, consistent with the absence of transport in the limit $p\to\infty$. The scenario of bound-state confinement leads to a hierarchy of timescales at which bound states of different sizes are liberated, which is also reflected in the dynamics of the von Neumann entropy.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical bounce with strong minimal assumptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of avoiding cosmological singularity with a bounce solution in the early Universe. The main finding is that simple and well-known semiclassical correction, which describes the mixing of radiation and gravity in the effective action, may provide an analytic solution with a bounce. The solution requires a positive beta function for the total radiation term and the contraction of the Universe at the initial instant. The numerical estimate shows that the bounce may occur in an acceptable range of energies, but only under strong assumptions about the particle physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Projective path to points at infinity in spherically symmetric spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proves that, in a four-dimensional spherically symmetric spacetime manifold, one can consider coordinate transformations expressed by fractional linear maps which give rise to isometries and make it possible to bring infinity down to a finite distance. The projective boundary of spherically symmetric spacetimes here studied is the disjoint union of three points: future timelike infinity, past timelike infinity, spacelike infinity, and the three-dimensional products of half-lines with a 2-sphere. Geodesics are then studied in the projectively transformed (t',r',theta',phi') coordinates for Schwarzschild spacetime, with special interest in their way of approaching our points at infinity. Next, Nariai, de Sitter and Godel spacetimes are studied with our projective method. Since the kinds of infinity here defined depend only on the symmetry of interest in a spacetime manifold, they have a broad range of applications, which motivate the innovative analysis of Schwarzschild, Nariai, de Sitter and Godel spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Natural Metric-Affine Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider here natural inflation in the low energy (two-derivative) metric-affine theory containing only the minimal degrees of freedom in the inflationary sector, i.e. the massless graviton and the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (PNGB). This theory contains the Ricci-like and parity-odd Holst invariants together with non-minimal couplings between the PNGB and the above-mentioned invariants. The Palatini and Einstein-Cartan realizations of natural inflation are particular cases of our construction. Explicit models of this type featuring non-minimal couplings are shown to emerge from the microscopic dynamics of a QCD-like theory with an either sub-Planckian or trans-Planckian confining scale and that is renormalizable on Minkowski spacetime. Moreover, for these models, we find regions of the parameter space where the inflationary predictions agree with the most recent observations at the $2\sigma$ level. We find that in order to enter the $1\sigma$ region it is necessary (and sufficient) to have a finite value of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter and a sizable non-minimal coupling between the inflaton and the Holst invariant (with sign opposite to the Barbero-Immirzi parameter). Indeed, in this case the potential of the canonically normalized inflaton develops a plateau as shown analytically.</description>

      <title>Using non-DESI data to confirm and strengthen the DESI 2024 spatially-flat $w_0w_a$CDM cosmological parameterization result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a combination of Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data and non-CMB data that include Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SNIa), Hubble parameter [$H(z)$], growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) measurements, and a collection of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, but not recent DESI 2024 BAO measurements, to confirm the DESI 2024 (DESI+CMB+PantheonPlus) data compilation support for dynamical dark energy with an evolving equation of state parameter $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$. From our joint compilation of CMB and non-CMB data, in a spatially-flat cosmological model, we obtain $w_0 = -0.850 \pm 0.059$ and $w_a = -0.59^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$ and find that this dynamical dark energy is favored over a cosmological constant by $\sim 2\sigma$. Our data constraints on the flat $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization are slightly more restrictive than the DESI 2024 constraints, with the DESI 2024 and our values of $w_0$ and $w_a$ differing by $-0.27\sigma$ and $0.44\sigma$, respectively. Our data compilation slightly more strongly favors the flat $w_0w_a$CDM model over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model than does the DESI 2024 data compilation. We note that our CMB and non-CMB data $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization cosmological constraints are discrepant at 2.7$\sigma$, a little larger than the 1.9$\sigma$ discrepancy between DESI DR1 BAO and CMB data flat $\Lambda$CDM model cosmological constraints. We also show that if we remove the Pantheon+ SNIa contribution from the non-CMB data, for the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization we still find tension between P18 and non-CMB data (2.5$\sigma$) and P18+lensing and non-CMB data (2.4$\sigma$). Even after the exclusion of Pantheon+ SNIa data the $\Lambda$CDM model is still disfavoured at $\sim 2\sigma$ c.l.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02077v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article assesses Landauer's principle from information theory in the context of area quantization of the Schwarzschild black hole. Within a quantum-mechanical perspective where Hawking evaporation can be interpreted in terms of transitions between the discrete states of the area (or mass) spectrum, we justify that Landauer's principle holds consistently in the saturated form when the number of microstates of the black hole goes as $2^n$, where $n$ is a large positive integer labeling the levels of the area/mass spectrum in the semiclassical regime. This is equivalent to the area spacing $\Delta A = \alpha l_P^2$ (in natural units), where $\alpha = 4 \ln 2$ for which the entropy spacing between consecutive levels in Boltzmann units coincides exactly with one bit of information. We also comment on the situation for other values of $\alpha$ prevalent in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional spacetime using a three-dimensional contact manifold equipped with a degenerate metric. The degenerate metric is set to be compatible with the contact structure. The compatibility condition is defined in this paper. Our construction yields a Ricci tensor of a particularly simple form, which leads to a solution of the Einstein equation with a null dust and cosmic strings. The solution includes two arbitrary functions: the energy density of the null dust and the number density of the cosmic strings. When there exist the cosmic strings, the spacetime is of Petrov type D. Otherwise, the spacetime is conformally flat. For some simple matter densities, we examine the Einstein equation in detail.</description>

      <title>Light rings and shadows of static black holes in effective quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, two types of static black hole models that retain general covariance have been proposed within the Hamiltonian constraint approach to effective quantum gravity (EQG). We have studied the light rings and shadows of these black holes using the topological method and the backward ray-tracing method, respectively. We demonstrate that these light rings in both types of static black holes are standard and unstable according to the classification of light rings. Subsequently, we checked the position of the light rings using the photon trajectory equation. We found that although the quantum parameters do not affect the light rings of these two types of black holes, they do reduce the size of the first type of static black hole in EQG, making it smaller. However, for the second type of static black hole in EQG, we cannot distinguish it from a Schwarzschild black hole based on the shadow alone. Fortunately, the quantum parameters shrink the lensing rings of both types of black holes in EQG, causing the black hole shadow to occupy a larger proportion within the ring. This can serve as a basis for distinguishing whether the black hole is in EQG or general relativity (GR).</description>

      <title>Curvature perturbations from kinetic preheating after $\alpha$-attractor inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preheating at the end of inflation is a violent nonlinear process that efficiently transfers the energy of the inflaton to a second field, the preheat field. When the preheat field is light during inflation and its background value modulates the preheating process, the superhorizon isocurvature perturbations of the preheat field may be converted to curvature perturbations that leave an imprint on the cosmic microwave background and the large-scale structure of the universe. We use high-precision lattice simulations to study kinetic preheating after $\alpha$-attractor inflation, a case where the effective mass of the preheat field is naturally suppressed during inflation. By comparing the expansion e-folds between different Hubble patches, we find that the conversion from isocurvature perturbations to curvature perturbations is very inefficient and can hardly be detected by cosmological observations.</description>
