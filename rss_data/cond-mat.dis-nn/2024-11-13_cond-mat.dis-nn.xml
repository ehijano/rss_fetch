      <title>Efficiency of energy-consuming random walkers: Variability in energy helps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy considerations can significantly affect the behavior of a population of energy-consuming agents with limited energy budgets, for instance, in the movement process of people in a city. We consider a population of interacting agents with an initial energy budget walking on a graph according to an exploration and return (to home) strategy that is based on the current energy of the person. Each move reduces the available energy depending on the flow of movements and the strength of interactions, and the movement ends when an agent returns home with a negative energy. We observe that a uniform distribution of initial energy budgets results in a larger number of visited sites per consumed energy (efficiency) compared to case that all agents have the same initial energy if return to home is relevant from the beginning of the process. The uniform energy distribution also reduces the amount of uncertainties in the total travel times (entropy production) which is more pronounced when the strength of interactions and exploration play the relevant role in the movement process. That is variability in the energies can help to increase the efficiency and reduce the entropy production specially in presence of strong interactions.</description>

      <title>Two-stage relaxation of operators through domain wall and magnon dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The out-of-time ordered correlator (OTOC) has become a popular probe for quantum information spreading and thermalization. In systems with local interactions, the OTOC defines a characteristic butterfly lightcone that separates a regime not yet disturbed by chaos from one where time-evolved operators and the OTOC approach their equilibrium value. This relaxation has been shown to proceed in two stages, with the first stage exhibiting an extensive timescale and a decay rate slower than the gap of the transfer matrix -- known as the ``phantom eigenvalue". In this work, we investigate the two-stage relaxation of the OTOC towards its equilibrium value in various local quantum circuits. We apply a systematic framework based on an emergent statistical model, where the dynamics of two single-particle modes -- a domain wall and a magnon -- govern the decay rates. Specifically, a configuration with coexisting domain wall and magnon modes generates the phantom rate in the first stage, and competition between these modes determines the second stage. We also examine this relaxation within the operator cluster picture. The magnon modes translates into a bound state of clusters and domain wall into a random operator, giving consistent rates. Finally, we extend our findings from random in time circuits to a broad class of Floquet models.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Machine Learning Phase Classification for Falicov-Kimball Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply various unsupervised machine learning methods for phase classification to investigate the finite-temperature phase diagram of the spinless Falicov-Kimball model in two dimensions. Using only particle occupation snapshots from Monte Carlo simulations as input, each technique, including a straightforward classification based on principal component analysis (PCA), successfully identifies the phase boundary between ordered and disordered phases, independent of the type of phase transition. Remarkably, these techniques also distinguish between the weakly localized and Anderson-localized regimes within the disordered phase, accurately identifying their crossover, which is a challenging task for standard methods. Among the machine learning approaches used, PCA based analysis outperforms more complex methods, such as neural network predictors and autoencoders. These results underscore the effectiveness of simple unsupervised techniques in examining phase transitions and electron localization in complex correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Firing Rate Models as Associative Memory: Excitatory-Inhibitory Balance for Robust Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Firing rate models are dynamical systems widely used in applied and theoretical neuroscience to describe local cortical dynamics in neuronal populations. By providing a macroscopic perspective of neuronal activity, these models are essential for investigating oscillatory phenomena, chaotic behavior, and associative memory processes. Despite their widespread use, the application of firing rate models to associative memory networks has received limited mathematical exploration, and most existing studies are focused on specific models. Conversely, well-established associative memory designs, such as Hopfield networks, lack key biologically-relevant features intrinsic to firing rate models, including positivity and interpretable synaptic matrices that reflect excitatory and inhibitory interactions. To address this gap, we propose a general framework that ensures the emergence of re-scaled memory patterns as stable equilibria in the firing rate dynamics. Furthermore, we analyze the conditions under which the memories are locally and globally asymptotically stable, providing insights into constructing biologically-plausible and robust systems for associative memory retrieval.</description>

      <title>Quantum combinatorial optimization beyond the variational paradigm: simple schedules for hard problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in quantum algorithms suggest a tentative scaling advantage on certain combinatorial optimization problems. Recent work, however, has also reinforced the idea that barren plateaus render variational algorithms ineffective on large Hilbert spaces. Hence, finding annealing protocols by variation ultimately appears to be difficult. Similarly, the adiabatic theorem fails on hard problem instances with first-order quantum phase transitions. Here, we show how to use the spin coherent-state path integral to shape the geometry of quantum adiabatic evolution, leading to annealing protocols at polynomial overhead that provide orders-of-magnitude improvements in the probability to measure optimal solutions, relative to linear protocols. These improvements are not obtained on a controllable toy problem but on randomly generated hard instances (Sherrington-Kirkpatrick and Maximum 2-Satisfiability), making them generic and robust. Our method works for large systems and may thus be used to improve the performance of state-of-the-art quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Relaxation dynamics of poly(ethylene oxide)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poly(ethylene oxide) is an important polymer with many applications, e.g., as solid-state electrolyte in batteries. Its relaxation dynamics, characterizing its molecular and submolecular motions, which is relevant for many of these applications, was investigated numerous times, mostly employing dielectric spectroscopy. However, the various dynamic processes revealed by these studies were interpreted in conflicting ways and even their nomenclature in literature is highly inconsistent. Here we present the results of a detailed investigation of this polymer employing dielectric spectroscopy covering a relatively broad frequency and temperature range. We clearly detect four intrinsic relaxation processes. The slowest one most likely represents a so-called normal mode, reflecting global motions of the polymer chains, an interpretation that was not considered in previous works. The second process can be unequivocally identified with the segmental alpha relaxation, which governs glassy freezing and the glass transition. The third, only rarely detected process corresponds to the Johari-Goldstein relaxation of poly(ethylene oxide), widely overlooked in previous studies. The fourth and fastest process is unrelated to the supercooled and glassy state of this polymer and probably due to local, intramolecular motions.</description>

      <title>$NVU$ view on energy polydisperse Lennard-Jones systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lennard-Jones (LJ) systems exhibit strikingly invariant structure and dynamics when energy polydispersity is introduced [Ingebrigtsen and Dyre, J. Phys. Chem. B 127, 2837 (2023)]. For instance, at a given state point the radial distribution function and the mean-square displacement as a function of time are virtually unaffected by energy polydispersity, which is in contrast to what happens when size polydispersity is introduced. We here argue - and validate by simulations of up to 30% polydispersity - that this invariance reflects an approximate invariance of the constant-potential-energy surface. $NVU$ dynamics is defined as geodesic motion at constant potential energy; because this dynamics is equivalent to Newtonian dynamics in the thermodynamic limit, the approximate invariance of the constant-potential-energy surface implies virtually the same structure and dynamics of energy polydisperse LJ systems as for the single-component version. In contrast, the constant-potential-energy surface is shown to be significantly affected by the introduction of size polydispersity.</description>

      <title>Fast and Functional Structured Data Generators Rooted in Out-of-Equilibrium Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we address the challenge of using energy-based models to produce high-quality, label-specific data in complex structured datasets, such as population genetics, RNA or protein sequences data. Traditional training methods encounter difficulties due to inefficient Markov chain Monte Carlo mixing, which affects the diversity of synthetic data and increases generation times. To address these issues, we use a novel training algorithm that exploits non-equilibrium effects. This approach, applied on the Restricted Boltzmann Machine, improves the model's ability to correctly classify samples and generate high-quality synthetic data in only a few sampling steps. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by its successful application to four different types of data: handwritten digits, mutations of human genomes classified by continental origin, functionally characterized sequences of an enzyme protein family, and homologous RNA sequences from specific taxonomies.</description>

      <title>Selecting Relevant Structural Features for Glassy Dynamics by Information Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate numerically the identification of relevant structural features that contribute to the dynamical heterogeneity in a model glass-forming liquid. By employing the recently proposed information imbalance technique, we select these features from a range of physically motivated descriptors. This selection process is performed in a supervised manner (using both dynamical and structural data) and an unsupervised manner (using only structural data). We then apply the selected features to predict future dynamics using a machine learning technique. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of this approach in identifying the dominant mechanisms governing the glassy slow dynamics.</description>
