      <title>Bose-Einstein Condensation and the Lambda Transition for Interacting Lennard-Jones Helium-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An introduction to Bose-Einstein condensation and the $\lambda$-transition is given. Results of quantum loop Monte Carlo simulations are presented for interacting Lennard-Jones helium-4. The optimum condensation fraction is found by minimizing the constrained free energy. The results show that approaching the transition the growth of pure position permutation loops and the consequent divergence of the heat capacity are enabled by the suppression of condensation and consequently of superfluidity. Condensation and superfluidity emerge at the peak of the heat capacity due to mixed position permutation chains.</description>

      <title>Advanced measurement techniques in quantum Monte Carlo: The permutation matrix representation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a typical finite temperature quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation, estimators for simple static observables such as specific heat and magnetization are known. With a great deal of system-specific manual labor, one can sometimes also derive more complicated non-local or even dynamic observable estimators. Within the permutation matrix representation (PMR) flavor of QMC, however, we show that one can derive formal estimators for arbitrary static observables. We also derive exact, explicit estimators for general imaginary-time correlation functions and non-trivial integrated susceptibilities thereof. We demonstrate the practical versatility of our method by estimating various non-local, random observables for the transverse-field Ising model on a square lattice.</description>

      <title>Capturing the Demon in Szilard's Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Szilard's engine, a demon measures a one-particle gas and applies feedback to extract work from thermal fluctuations, embodying Maxwell's notion that information reduces thermodynamic entropy - an apparent second-law violation. The Landauer-Bennett Thesis resolves this paradox by requiring the demon to record the measurement, which results in an entropy increase in the demon's memory. Eventually, the demon's memory needs to be erased. The erasure costs the same work as extracted previously, hence there is no violation of the second law. Though widely accepted, the fictitious memory invoked in the thesis has drawn multiple criticisms, with debates persisting over the demon's necessity. We show that the demon is the piston that partitions the space and drives the expansion. The final position of the piston after expansion records the particle's position pre-expansion: it is an ``information-bearing degree of freedom''. In this Piston-Demon Thesis, memory register and feedback (expansion) happen simultaneously. Our exposition identifies the mischievous demon as a physical degree of freedom, and greatly simplifies Szilard's engine. It also offers educators a tangible illustration of information-thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Statistics of power and efficiency for collisional Brownian engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisional Brownian engines have attracted significant attention due to their simplicity, experimental accessibility, and amenability to exact analytical solutions. While previous research has predominantly focused on optimizing mean values of power and efficiency, the joint statistical properties of these performance metrics remain largely unexplored. Using stochastic thermodynamics, we investigate the joint probability distributions of power and efficiency for collisional Brownian engines, revealing how thermodynamic fluctuations influence the probability of observing values exceeding their respective mean maxima. Our conditional probability analysis demonstrates that when power fluctuates above its maximum mean value, the probability of achieving high efficiency increases substantially, suggesting fluctuation regimes where the classical power-efficiency trade-off can be probabilistically overcome. Notably, our framework extends to a broader class of engines, as the essential features of the statistics of the system are fully determined by the Onsager coefficients. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of fluctuations in Brownian engines, highlighting how stochastic behavior can enable performance beyond traditional thermodynamic bounds.</description>

      <title>Spectral delineation of Markov Generators: Classical vs Quantum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated theorem of Perron and Frobenius implies that spectra of classical Markov operators, represented by stochastic matrices, are restricted to the unit disk. This property holds also for spectra of quantum stochastic maps (quantum channels), which describe quantum Markovian evolution in discrete time. Moreover, the spectra of stochastic $N \times N$ matrices are additionally restricted to a subset of the unit disk, called Karpelevi\u{c} region, the shape of which depends on $N$. We address the question of whether the spectra of generators, which induce Markovian evolution in continuous time, can be bound in a similar way. We propose a rescaling that allows us to answer this question affirmatively. The eigenvalues of the rescaled classical generators are confined to the modified Karpelevi\u{c} regions, whereas the eigenvalues of the rescaled quantum generators fill the entire unit disk.</description>

      <title>Periodic Motzkin chain: Ground states and symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00835v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motzkin chain is a model of nearest-neighbor interacting quantum $s=1$ spins with open boundary conditions. It is known that it has a unique ground state which can be viewed as a sum of Motzkin paths. We consider the case of periodic boundary conditions and provide several conjectures about structure of the ground state space and symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We conjecture that the ground state is degenerate and independent states distinguished by eigenvalues of the third component of total spin operator. Each of these states can be described as a sum of paths, similar to the Motzkin paths. Moreover, there exist two operators commuting with the Hamiltonian, which play the roles of lowering and raising operators when acting at these states. We conjecture also that these operators generate the Lie algebra of $C$-type of the rank equal to the number of sites. The symmetry algebra of the Hamiltonian is actually wider, and extended, besides the cyclic shift operator, by a central element contained in the third component of total spin operator.</description>

      <title>Efficient mutual magic and magic capacity with matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stabilizer R\'enyi entropies (SREs) probe the non-stabilizerness (or magic) of many-body systems and quantum computers. Here, we introduce the mutual von-Neumann SRE and magic capacity, which can be efficiently computed in time $O(N\chi^3)$ for matrix product states (MPSs) of bond dimension $\chi$. We find that mutual SRE characterizes the critical point of ground states of the transverse-field Ising model, independently of the chosen local basis. Then, we relate the magic capacity to the anti-flatness of the Pauli spectrum, which quantifies the complexity of computing SREs. The magic capacity characterizes transitions in the ground state of the Heisenberg and Ising model, randomness of Clifford+T circuits, and distinguishes typical and atypical states. Finally, we make progress on numerical techniques: we design two improved Monte-Carlo algorithms to compute the mutual $2$-SRE, overcoming limitations of previous approaches based on local update. We also give improved statevector simulation methods for Bell sampling and SREs with $O(8^{N/2})$ time and $O(2^N)$ memory, which we demonstrate for $24$ qubits. Our work uncovers improved approaches to study the complexity of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Learning to erase quantum states: thermodynamic implications of quantum learning theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy cost of erasing quantum states depends on our knowledge of the states. We show that learning algorithms can acquire such knowledge to erase many copies of an unknown state at the optimal energy cost. This is proved by showing that learning can be made fully reversible and has no fundamental energy cost itself. With simple counting arguments, we relate the energy cost of erasing quantum states to their complexity, entanglement, and magic. We further show that the constructed erasure protocol is computationally efficient when learning is efficient. Conversely, under standard cryptographic assumptions, we prove that the optimal energy cost cannot be achieved efficiently in general. These results also enable efficient work extraction based on learning. Together, our results establish a concrete connection between quantum learning theory and thermodynamics, highlighting the physical significance of learning processes and enabling efficient learning-based protocols for thermodynamic tasks.</description>

      <title>Dynamical quantum phase transition, metastable state, and dimensionality reduction: Krylov analysis of fully-connected spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quenched dynamics of fully-connected spin models. The system is prepared in a ground state of the initial Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian is suddenly changed to a different form. We apply the Krylov subspace method to map the system onto an effective tridiagonal Hamiltonian. The state is confined in a potential well and is time-evolved by nonuniform hoppings. The dynamical singularities for the survival probability can occur when the state is reflected from a potential barrier. Although we do not observe any singularity in the spread complexity, we find that the entropy exhibits small dips at the singular times. We find that the presence of metastable state affects long-time behavior of the spread complexity, and physical observables. We also observe a reduction of the state-space dimension when the Hamiltonian reduces to a classical form.</description>

      <title>Operator growth in many-body systems of higher spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study operator growth in many-body systems with on-site spins larger than $1/2$, considering both non-integrable and integrable regimes. Specifically, we compute Lanczos coefficients in the one- and two-dimensional Ising models for spin values $S=1/2$, $1$, and $3/2$, and observe asymptotically linear growth $b_n \sim n$. On the integrable side, we investigate the Potts model and find square-root growth $b_n \sim \sqrt{n}$. Both results are consistent with the predictions of the Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis. To analyze operator dynamics in this setting, we employ a generalized operator basis constructed from tensor products of shift and clock operators, extending the concept of Pauli strings to higher local dimensions. We further report that the recently introduced formalism of equivalence classes of Pauli strings can be naturally extended to this setting. This formalism enables the study of simulable Heisenberg dynamics by identifying dynamically isolated operator subspaces of moderate dimensionality. As an example, we introduce the Kitaev-Potts model with spin-$1$, where the identification of such a subspace allows for exact time evolution at a computational cost lower than that of exact diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Quantum error correction via multi-particle discrete-time quantum walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme of quantum error correction that employs a multi-particle quantum walk defined on nested squares, each hosting a single particle. In this model, each particle moves within its own distinct square through iterations of three discrete-time steps. First, a particle updates its two-level internal {\it coin} state. Next, it either moves to an adjacent vertex or stays put, depending on the outcome. Finally, it interacts with another particle if these particles arrive at the nearest-neighbor vertices of the two adjacent squares, acquiring a phase factor of $-1$. Because a single particle represents a three-qubit state through its position and coin state, Shor's nine-qubit code is implemented using only three particles, with two additional particles for syndrome measurement. Furthermore, by exploiting gauge symmetry, our scheme achieves redundant encoding, error correction, and arbitrary operations on the encoded information using only nearest-neighbor interactions.</description>

      <title>Universal distributions of overlaps from generic dynamics in quantum many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the distribution of overlaps with the computational basis of a quantum state generated under generic quantum many-body chaotic dynamics, without conserved quantities, for a finite time $t$. We argue that, scaling time logarithmically with the system size $t \propto \log L$, the overlap distribution converges to a universal form in the thermodynamic limit, forming a one-parameter family that generalizes the celebrated Porter-Thomas distribution. The form of the overlap distribution only depends on the spatial dimensionality and, remarkably, on the boundary conditions. This picture is justified in general by a mapping to Ginibre ensemble of random matrices and corroborated by the exact solution of a random quantum circuit. Our results derive from an analysis of arbitrary overlap moments, enabling the reconstruction of the distribution. Our predictions also apply to Floquet circuits, i.e., in the presence of mild quenched disorder. Finally, numerical simulations of two distinct random circuits show excellent agreement, thereby demonstrating universality.</description>

      <title>Translation symmetry restoration under random unitary dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The finite parts of a large, locally interacting many-body system prepared out-of-equilibrium eventually equilibrate. Characterising the underlying mechanisms of this process and its timescales, however, is particularly hard as it requires to decouple universal features from observable-specific ones. Recently, new insight came by studying how certain symmetries of the dynamics that are broken by the initial state are restored at the level of the reduced state of a given subsystem. This provides a high level, observable-independent probe. Until now this idea has been applied to the restoration of internal symmetries, e.g. U(1) symmetries related to charge conservation. Here we show that that the same logic can be applied to the restoration of space-time symmetries, and hence can be used to characterise the relaxation of fully generic systems. We illustrate this idea by considering the paradigmatic example of "generic" many-body dynamics, i.e. a local random unitary circuit, where our method leads to exact results. We show that the restoration of translation symmetry in these systems only happens on time-scales proportional to the subsystem's volume. In fact, for large enough subsystems the time of symmetry restoration becomes initial-state independent (as long as the latter breaks the symmetry at time zero) and coincides with the thermalisation time. For intermediate subsystems, however, one can observe the so-called "quantum Mpemba effect", where the state of the system restores a symmetry faster if it is initially more asymmetric. We provide the first exact characterisation of this effect in a non-integrable system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time crystals are many-body systems that spontaneously break time-translation symmetry, and thus exhibit long-range spatiotemporal order and robust periodic motion. Recent results have demonstrated how to build time-crystal phases in driven diffusive fluids using an external packing field coupled to density fluctuations. Here we exploit this mechanism to engineer and control on-demand custom continuous time crystals characterized by an arbitrary number of rotating condensates, which can be further enhanced with higher-order modes. We elucidate the underlying critical point, as well as general properties of the condensates density profiles and velocities, demonstrating a scaling property of higher-order traveling condensates in terms of first-order ones. We illustrate our findings by solving the hydrodynamic equations for various paradigmatic driven diffusive systems, obtaining along the way a number of remarkable results, e.g. the possibility of explosive time crystal phases characterized by an abrupt, first-order-type transition. Overall, these results demonstrate the versatility and broad possibilities of this promising route to time crystals.</description>

      <title>Effective Affinity for Generic Currents in Markov Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08926v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In nonequilibrium systems with uncoupled currents, the thermodynamic affinity determines the direction of currents, quantifies dissipation, and constrains current fluctuations. However, these properties of the thermodynamic affinity do not hold in complex systems with multiple coupled currents. For this reason, there has been an ongoing search in nonequilibrium thermodynamics for an affinity-like quantity, known as the effective affinity, which applies to a single current in a system with multiple coupled currents. Here, we introduce an effective affinity that applies to generic currents in time-homogeneous Markov processes. We show that the effective affinity is a single number encapsulating several dissipative and fluctuation properties of fluctuating currents: the effective affinity determines the direction of flow of the current; the effective affinity multiplied by the current is a lower bound for the rate of dissipation; for systems with uncoupled currents the effective affinity equals the standard thermodynamic affinity; and the effective affinity constrains negative fluctuations of currents, namely, it is the exponential decay constant of the distribution of current infima. We derive the above properties with large deviation theory and martingale theory, and one particular interesting finding is a class of martingales associated with generic currents. Furthermore, we make a study of the relation between effective affinities and stalling forces in a biomechanical model of motor proteins, and we find that both quantities are approximately equal when this particular model is thermodynamically consistent. This brings interesting perspectives on the use of stalling forces for the estimation of dissipation.</description>

      <title>Quantum and Classical Dynamics with Random Permutation Circuits</title>

Abstract: Understanding thermalisation in quantum many-body systems is among the most enduring problems in modern physics. A particularly interesting question concerns the role played by quantum mechanics in this process, i.e. whether thermalisation in quantum many-body systems is fundamentally different from that in classical many-body systems and, if so, which of its features are genuinely quantum. Here we study this question in minimally structured many-body systems which are only constrained to have local interactions, i.e. local random circuits. We introduce a class of random permutation circuits (RPCs), where the gates locally permute basis states modelling generic microscopic classical dynamics, and compare them to random unitary circuits (RUCs), a standard toy model for generic quantum dynamics. We show that, like RUCs, RPCs permit the analytical computation of several key quantities such as out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs), or entanglement entropies. RPCs can be interpreted both as quantum or classical dynamics, which we use to find similarities and differences between the two. Performing the average over all random circuits, we discover a series of exact relations, connecting quantities in RUC and (quantum) RPCs. In the classical setting, we obtain similar exact results relating (quantum) purity to (classical) growth of mutual information and (quantum) OTOCs to (classical) decorrelators. Our results indicate that despite of the fundamental differences between quantum and classical systems, their dynamics exhibits qualitatively similar behaviours.</description>

      <title>Small-Coupling Dynamic Cavity: a Bayesian mean-field framework for epidemic inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03829v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Small-Coupling Dynamic Cavity (SCDC) method, a novel generalized mean-field approximation for epidemic inference and risk assessment within a fully Bayesian framework. SCDC accounts for non-causal effects of observations and uses a graphical model representation of epidemic processes to derive self-consistent equations for edge probability marginals. A small-coupling expansion yields time-dependent cavity messages capturing individual infection probabilities and observational conditioning. With linear computational cost per iteration in the epidemic duration, SCDC is particularly efficient and valid even for recurrent epidemic processes, where standard methods are exponentially complex. Tested on synthetic networks, it matches Belief Propagation in accuracy and outperforms individual-based mean-field methods. Notably, despite being derived as a small-infectiousness expansion, SCDC maintains good accuracy even for relatively large infection probabilities. While convergence issues may arise on graphs with long-range correlations, SCDC reliably estimates risk. Future extensions include non-Markovian models and higher-order terms in the dynamic cavity framework.</description>

      <title>Universal Scaling Laws of Absorbing Phase Transitions in Artificial Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02284v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that conventional artificial deep neural networks operating near the phase boundary of the signal propagation dynamics, also known as the edge of chaos, exhibit universal scaling laws of absorbing phase transitions in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. We exploit the fully deterministic nature of the propagation dynamics to elucidate an analogy between a signal collapse in the neural networks and an absorbing state (a state that the system can enter but cannot escape from). Our numerical results indicate that the multilayer perceptrons and the convolutional neural networks belong to the mean-field and the directed percolation universality classes, respectively. Also, the finite-size scaling is successfully applied, suggesting a potential connection to the depth-width trade-off in deep learning. Furthermore, our analysis of the training dynamics under the gradient descent reveals that hyperparameter tuning to the phase boundary is necessary but insufficient for achieving optimal generalization in deep networks. Remarkably, nonuniversal metric factors associated with the scaling laws are shown to play a significant role in concretizing the above observations. These findings highlight the usefulness of the notion of criticality for analyzing the behavior of artificial deep neural networks and offer new insights toward a unified understanding of the essential relationship between criticality and intelligence.</description>

      <title>Intertwining the Busemann process of the directed polymer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10531v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Busemann process and competition interfaces of the planar directed polymer model with i.i.d.\ weights on the vertices of the planar square lattice, in both the general case and the solvable inverse-gamma case. We prove new regularity properties of the Busemann process without reliance on unproved assumptions on the shape function. For example, each nearest-neighbor Busemann function is strictly monotone and has the same random set of discontinuities in the direction variable. When all Busemann functions on a horizontal line are viewed together, the Busemann process intertwines with an evolution that obeys a version of the geometric Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence. When specialized to the inverse-gamma case, this relationship enables an explicit distributional description: the Busemann function on a nearest-neighbor edge has independent increments in the direction variable, and its distribution comes from an inhomogeneous planar Poisson process. The distribution of the asymptotic competition interface direction of the inverse-gamma polymer is discrete and supported on the Busemann discontinuities which -- unlike in zero-temperature last-passage percolation -- are dense. Further implications follow for the eternal solutions and the failure of the one force -- one solution principle of the discrete stochastic heat equation solved by the polymer partition function.</description>

      <title>Three-component Bose-Einstein condensates and wetting without walls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous work within Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) theory for ultracold gases wetting phase transitions were predicted for a phase-segregated two-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) adsorbed at an optical wall. The wetting phase diagram was found to depend on intrinsic atomic parameters, being the masses and the scattering lengths, and on the extrinsic wall boundary condition. Here we study wetting transitions in GP theory without an optical wall in a setting with three phase-segregated BEC components instead of two. The boundary condition is removed by replacing the wall with the third component and treating the three phases on an equal footing. This leads to an unequivocal wetting phase diagram that depends only on intrinsic atomic parameters. It features first-order and critical wetting transitions, and prewetting phenomena. The phase boundaries are computed by numerical solution of the GP equations. In addition, useful analytic results are obtained by extending the established double-parabola approximation to three components.</description>

      <title>Physical networks become what they learn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical networks can develop diverse responses, or functions, by design, evolution or learning. We focus on electrical networks of nodes connected by resistive edges. Such networks can learn by adapting edge conductances to lower a cost function that penalizes deviations from a desired response. The network must also satisfy Kirchhoff's law, balancing currents at nodes, or, equivalently, minimizing total power dissipation by adjusting node voltages. The adaptation is thus a double optimization process, in which a cost function is minimized with respect to conductances, while dissipated power is minimized with respect to node voltages. Here we study how this physical adaptation couples the cost landscape, the landscape of the cost function in the high-dimensional space of edge conductances, to the physical landscape, the dissipated power in the high-dimensional space of node voltages. We show how adaptation links the physical and cost Hessian matrices, suggesting that the physical response of networks to perturbations holds significant information about the functions to which they are adapted.</description>

      <title>Manifolds of exceptional points and effective Zeno limit of an open two-qubit system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analytically investigate the Liouvillian exceptional point manifolds (LEPMs) of a two-qubit open system, where one qubit is coupled to a dissipative polarization bath. Exploiting a Z_2 symmetry, we block-diagonalize the Liouvillian and show that one symmetry block yields two planar LEPMs while the other one exhibits a more intricate, multi-sheet topology. The intersection curves of these manifolds provide a phase diagram for effective Zeno transitions at small dissipation. These results are consistent with a perturbative extrapolation from the strong Zeno regime. Interestingly, we find that the fastest relaxation to the non-equilibrium steady state occurs on LEPMs associated with the transition to the effective Zeno regime.</description>

      <title>Instability of the ferromagnetic phase under random fields in an Ising spin glass with correlated disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well established that the ferromagnetic phase remains stable under random magnetic fields in three and higher dimensions for the ferromagnetic Ising model and the Edwards-Anderson model of spin glasses without correlation in the disorder variables. In this study, we investigate an Ising spin glass with correlated disorder and demonstrate that the ferromagnetic phase becomes unstable under random fields in any dimension, provided that magnetic field chaos exists in the Edwards-Anderson model on the same lattice. Additionally, we show that this instability can also be attributed to disorder (bond) chaos. We further argue that the model with correlated disorder remains in the ferromagnetic phase even in the presence of symmetry-breaking fields, as long as the Edwards-Anderson model on the same lattice exhibits a spin glass phase under a magnetic field. These results underscore the profound impact of spatial correlations in the disorder.</description>

Abstract: We consider $L$-directional associative memories, composed of $L$ Hopfield networks, displaying imitative Hebbian intra-network interactions and anti-imitative Hebbian inter-network interactions, where couplings are built over a set of hidden binary patterns. We evaluate the model's performance in reconstructing the whole set of hidden binary patterns when provided with mixtures of noisy versions of these patterns. Our numerical results demonstrate the model's high effectiveness in the reconstruction task for structureless and structured datasets.</description>

      <title>A first principles approach to electromechanics in liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electromechanics in fluids describes the response of the number density to electric fields, and thus provides a powerful means by which to control the behavior of liquids. While continuum approaches have proven successful in describing electromechanical phenomena in macroscopic bodies, their use is questionable when relevant length scales become comparable to a system's natural correlation lengths, as commonly occurs in, e.g., biological systems, nanopores, and microfluidics. Here, we present a first principles theory for electromechanical phenomena in fluids. Our approach is based on the recently proposed hyperdensity functional theory [Samm\"uller et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 098201 (2024)] in which we treat the charge density as an observable of the system, with the intrinsic Helmholtz free energy functional dependent upon both density and electrostatic potential. Expressions for the coupling between number and charge densities emerge naturally in this formalism, avoiding the need to construct density-dependent and spatially-varying material parameters such as the dielectric constant. Furthermore, we make our theory practical by deriving a connection between hyperdensity functional theory and local molecular field theory, which facilitates machine learning explicit representations for the free energy functionals of systems with short-ranged electrostatic interactions, with long-ranged effects accounted for in a well-controlled mean field fashion.</description>
