      <title>Analogical models to introduce high school students to modern physics: an inquiry-based activity on Rutherford's gold foil experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a didactic proposal on Rutherford's gold foil experiment, tailored for high schools. Grounded in constructivist pedagogy, the activity introduces key concepts of modern physics-often absent from standard curricula-through a hands on, inquiry-based approach. By employing analogical reasoning and black box modeling, students engage in experimental investigation and collaborative problem-solving to explore atomic structure. The activity was implemented as a case study with a class of first-year students (aged 14-15) from a applied science-focused secondary school in Italy. Data collection combined qualitative observations, structured discussions, and digital feedback tools to assess conceptual learning and student engagement. Findings indicate that well-designed, student-centered interventions can meaningfully support the development of abstract scientific understanding, while fostering critical thinking and collaborative skills.</description>

      <title>Compatibilidad del Argumento Cosmol\'ogico Kalam con la Ciencia Contempor\'anea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kalam cosmological argument, of a metaphysical nature, asserts that the universe had a first cause. This study examines the compatibility of its premises through a bibliographic review of advancements in contemporary physics. Quantum theory demonstrates that quantum phenomena are indeterministic and non-causal. Even in deterministic theories, causality lacks a clear definition. Moreover, cosmological models, such as cosmic inflation, suggest that the early stages of the universe do not require a first cause. In conclusion, the premises of the Kalam argument are not compatible with contemporary physics.</description>

      <title>Re(l)ality: The View From Nowhere vs. The View From Everywhere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20520v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the fibre bundle framework, this work investigates the conceptual and mathematical foundations of reference frames in General Relativity by contrasting two paradigms: the View from Nowhere and the View from Everywhere. The View from Nowhere interprets frame representations as perspectives on an invariant equivalence class, while the View from Everywhere posits each frame representation as constituting a complete reality itself. What emerges is a conception of reality that I term "Relality". The paper critically examines the philosophical and practical implications of these views, with a focus on reconciling theory with experimental practice. Central to the discussion is the challenge of providing a perspicuous characterisation of ontology. The View from Nowhere aligns with the so-called sophisticated approach on symmetries and it complicates the empirical grounding of theoretical constructs. In contrast, the View from Everywhere offers a perspicuous relational ontology that avoids the abstraction of equivalence classes.</description>
