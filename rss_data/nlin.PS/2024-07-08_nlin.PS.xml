      <title>An amplitude equation for the conserved-Hopf bifurcation -- derivation, analysis and assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ weakly nonlinear theory to derive an amplitude equation for the conserved-Hopf instability, i.e., a generic large-scale oscillatory instability for systems with two conservation laws. The resulting equation represents the equivalent in the conserved case of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation obtained in the nonconserved case as amplitude equation for the standard Hopf bifurcation.
  Considering first the case of a relatively simple symmetric Cahn-Hilliard model with purely nonreciprocal coupling, we derive the nonlinear nonlocal amplitude equation and show that its bifurcation diagram and time evolution well agree with results for the full model. The solutions of the amplitude equation and their stability are obtained analytically thereby showing that in oscillatory phase separation the suppression of coarsening is universal. Second, we lift the restrictions and obtain the amplitude equation in a more generic case, that also shows very good agreement with the full model as exemplified for some transient dynamics that converges to traveling wave states.</description>

      <title>Approximation of rogue waves using Malmquist-Takenaka functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rogue waves are fascinating large amplitude coherent structures that abruptly appear and then disappear soon after. In certain partial differential equations these waves are modeled by rational solutions. In this work we discuss approximating rogue wave solutions in a basis of orthogonal functions known as the Malmquist-Takenaka (MT) functions. This family of rational functions can be directly mapped to a modified Fourier series, allowing the fast Fourier transform computation of the spectral MT coefficients. Spectral differentiation matrices are derived. The approximation of the various rogue wave solutions in the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation is explored. The unstable nature of the NLS equation on a constant background and its effect on destabilizing and generating rogue waves is studied. Perturbing the constant solution with certain localized functions is found to generate rogue wave-like structures.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Model Reduction to Random Spectral Submanifolds in Random Vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems in engineering and physics are often subject to irregular excitations that are best modeled as random. Monte Carlo simulations are routinely performed on such random models to obtain statistics on their long-term response. Such simulations, however, are prohibitively expensive and time consuming for high-dimensional nonlinear systems. Here we propose to decrease this numerical burden significantly by reducing the full system to very low-dimensional, attracting, random invariant manifolds in its phase space and performing the Monte Carlo simulations on that reduced dynamical system. The random spectral submanifolds (SSMs) we construct for this purpose generalize the concept of SSMs from deterministic systems under uniformly bounded random forcing. We illustrate the accuracy and speed of random SSM reduction by computing the SSM-reduced power spectral density of the randomly forced mechanical systems that range from simple oscillator chains to finite-element models of beams and plates.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic integrability of nonlinear wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of asymptotic integrability into the theory of nonlinear wave equations. It means that the Hamiltonian structure of equations describing propagation of high-frequency wave packets is preserved by hydrodynamic evolution of the large-scale background wave, so that these equations have an additional integral of motion. This condition is expressed mathematically as a system of equations for the carrier wave number as a function of the background variables. We show that a solution of this system for a given dispersion relation of linear waves is related with the quasiclassical limit of the Lax pair for the completely integrable equation having the corresponding dispersionless and linear dispersive behavior. We illustrate the theory by several examples.</description>

      <title>Emergence of power-law distributions in self-segregation reaction-diffusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many natural or human-made systems encompassing local reactions and diffusion processes exhibit spatially distributed patterns of some relevant dynamical variable. These interactions, through self-organization and critical phenomena, give rise to power-law distributions, where emergent patterns and structures become visible across vastly different scales. Recent observations reveal power-law distributions in the spatial organization of, e.g., tree clusters and forest patch sizes. Crucially, these patterns do not follow a spatially periodic order but rather a statistical one. Unlike the spatially periodic patterns elucidated by the Turing mechanism, the statistical order of these particular vegetation patterns suggests an incomplete understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Here, we present a novel self-segregation mechanism, driving the emergence of power-law scalings in pattern-forming systems. The model incorporates an Allee-logistic reaction term, responsible for the local growth, and a nonlinear diffusion process accounting for positive interactions and limited resources. According to a self-organized criticality (SOC) principle, after an initial decrease, the system mass reaches an analytically predictable threshold, beyond which it self-segregates into distinct clusters, due to local positive interactions that promote cooperation. Numerical investigations show that the distribution of cluster sizes obeys a power-law with an exponential cutoff.</description>

      <title>Experimentally Tractable Generation of High-Order Rogue Waves in Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study a prototypical, experimentally accessible scenario that enables the systematic generation of so-called high-order rogue waves in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. These waveforms lead to significantly and controllably more extreme focusing events than the famous Peregrine soliton. In one spatial dimension, we showcase conclusive numerical evidence that our scheme generates the focusing behavior associated with the first four rogue waves from the relevant hierarchy. We then extend considerations to anisotropic two-dimensional and even three-dimensional settings, establishing that the scheme can generate second order rogue waves despite the well-known limitation of finite-time blow up of focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations.</description>

      <title>Progresses on some open problems related to infinitely many symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quest to reveal the physical essence of the infinitely many symmetries and conservation laws that are intrinsic to integrable systems has historically posed a significant challenge at the confluence of physics and mathematics. This scholarly investigation delves into five open problems related to these boundless symmetries within integrable systems by scrutinizing their multi-wave solutions, employing a fresh analytical methodology. For a specified integrable system, there exist various categories of $n$-wave solutions. Each sub-wave comprising the $n$-wave solution may possess free parameters, including center, width, and periodic parameters. It is evident that these solutions are translation invariant with respect to all these free parameters. We postulate that the entirety of the recognized infinite symmetries merely constitute linear combinations of these finite wave parameter translation symmetries. The conjecture intimates that the currently known infinitely many symmetries are not exhaustive, and an indeterminate number of symmetries remain to be discovered. This conjecture further indicates that by imposing an infinite array of symmetry constraints, it becomes feasible to derive exact multi-wave solutions. By considering the renowned KdV equation and the Burgers equation as simple examples, the conjecture is substantiated for the $n$-soliton solutions. It is unequivocal that any linear combination of the wave parameter translation symmetries retains its status as a symmetry associated with the particular solution. This observation suggests that by introducing a ren-variable and a ren-symmetric derivative which serve as generalizations of the Grassmann variable and the super derivative, it may be feasible to unify classical integrable systems, supersymmetric integrable systems, and ren-symmetric integrable systems within a cohesive hierarchical framework.</description>
