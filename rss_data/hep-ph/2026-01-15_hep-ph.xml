      <description>arXiv:2601.08898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the role of quantum reference frames in providing a viable definition of rest frame for mixed particles. We then analyze the related concept of frame-dependent entanglement and its impact on the phenomenology of neutral mesons and neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Lorentz and CPT Tests in Neutron and Storage-Ring EDM Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Lorentz- and CPT-violating effects in neutron and storage-ring electric dipole moment (EDM) experiments within the framework of the Standard-Model Extension (SME). For neutron EDM experiments, perturbation theory is applied to derive leading-order contributions to the spin precession frequency arising from Lorentz and CPT violation. For storage-ring experiments, a generalized Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation is used to determine the corresponding spin-precession modifications. The analysis establishes explicit correspondences between measured EDMs and specific SME coefficients, providing a basis for setting the first limits on several previously unconstrained coefficients for Lorentz violation in future studies.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter emission at Belle II and NA62 in Minimal Flavor Violation framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimal Flavor Violation (MFV) provides a compelling framework for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model, in which new QCD-singlet fields transforming under the global $\mathrm{SU}(3)^3$ quark flavor symmetry can naturally be stable and act as dark matter (DM) candidates. We show that the DM-MFV framework naturally accommodates the excess in either $K^+ \to \pi^+ \nu \bar{\nu}$ or $B^+ \to K^+ \nu \bar{\nu}$, while a unified explanation of both channels simultaneously cannot be achieved within a minimal setup containing only a single dark matter multiplet with nearly degenerate masses. Overall, our findings underscore the intricate interplay between MFV-based model building, flavored dark matter scenarios, and precision flavor experiments, highlighting flavored dark matter as a framework that is both theoretically robust and experimentally testable.</description>

      <title>Searching for Quirks at LHCb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quirks are heavy particles connected by a flux tube from a hidden confining force that remain weakly constrained in large regions of their parameter space. This flux tube acts as a string that, at short enough distance, stretches as the quirk pair separates, then pulls the pair back together leading to interesting dynamics. We propose a novel search using the LHCb Vertex Locator (VELO), whose forward geometry and software-based trigger are uniquely suited to detecting the characteristic back-to-back, planar hit patterns produced by quirk pairs with little transverse recoil. Using detailed simulations of the VELO geometry, together with simple geometric selections, we present different sensitivity projections, demonstrating that LHCb can probe parameter regions inaccessible to existing ATLAS and CMS searches and offering a powerful, complementary path toward discovering quirks.</description>

      <title>Heavy Neutrinos across the Electroweak-to-Multi-TeV Frontier via Novel ML-Enhanced Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new strategy to probe heavy neutrinos with non-universal fermion couplings at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) using a novel production mechanism and machine-learning algorithms. Focusing on proton--proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13.6~\mathrm{TeV}$, we investigate final states containing a charged lepton, missing transverse energy, and two jets. For heavy neutrino masses below $\mathcal{O}(1~\mathrm{TeV})$, production is dominated by the $s$ channel process. At higher masses, vector boson fusion becomes the dominant production mechanism, with cross sections that decrease slowly as the heavy neutrino mass increases. We simulate both signal and Standard Model background events and employ gradient-boosted decision trees to optimize event classification. Assuming an integrated luminosity of $3000~\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$, expected for the high-luminosity, and considering realistic statistical and systematic uncertainties, we find that heavy neutrinos in the mass range $50~\mathrm{GeV}$--$10~\mathrm{TeV}$ can be probed with sensitivity to the mixing parameter $|V_{\ell N}|^2$ spanning from $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$ to 1. This approach enhances the discovery potential for heavy neutrinos and provides a complementary pathway to existing search strategies.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Cogensis by QCD axion in Type I Seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generic axion--driven cogenesis scenario in which both the baryon asymmetry and dark matter abundance originate from the kinetic misalignment. The framework unifies the Peccei--Quinn (PQ) mechanism with a Type--I seesaw sector, where Hubble--induced masses and higher-dimensional PQ--violating operators drive early--time axion rotation. Working within the DFSZ axion model augmented by heavy neutrinos, we identify the parametric window of right-handed neutrino masses, determined by its decay rate, and the range of Hubble scales compatible with successful cogenesis, while maintaining the axion solution to the strong CP problem and satisfying current limits on axion isocurvature perturbations. Our results establish kinetic axion misalignment as a robust and predictive mechanism for axion cogenesis, independent of the inflationary microphysics.</description>

      <title>Light neutrinophilic WIMP in the $U(1)_{\rm B-L+xY}$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-GeV dark matter is an appealing thermal target because it can still be produced via the standard freeze-out mechanism; at such low masses, achieving freeze-out naturally points to the presence of a light mediator, which shifts the most promising discovery avenues from the energy frontier to the intensity frontier. Realizing this picture is nonetheless challenging, since CMB observations tightly constrain energy injection from dark-matter annihilation at recombination and therefore strongly disfavor simple $s$-wave annihilation into visible Standard-Model final states. In this work, we propose a concrete neutrinophilic framework for sub-GeV thermal dark matter (''light WIMPs'') based on an additional gauge symmetry $\mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{B}-\mathrm{L}+x\mathrm{Y}}$; for an appropriate choice of $x$, the new gauge boson couples predominantly to dark matter and neutrinos while its couplings to charged leptons are suppressed, so that sub-GeV dark matter annihilates almost exclusively into neutrinos, with hadronic modes kinematically closed. We map the parameter space in which the observed relic abundance is reproduced via standard thermal freeze-out in a conventional cosmological history, and show that sizable regions remain viable after imposing current cosmological, indirect-detection, and terrestrial constraints; in part of the allowed parameter space, the dark matter also exhibits sufficiently large self-interactions to potentially alleviate small-scale structure tensions.</description>

      <title>Near-threshold photon-proton production of $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the near-threshold exclusive photoproduction of heavy vector mesons (quarkonia $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$) off the proton within the framework of generalized parton distribution (GPD) factorization. The gluon GPDs are computed using a spectator model in which the proton emits a gluon and the remaining constituents are treated as a single spectator particle. Model parameters are determined by fitting the gluon unpolarized and helicity collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs) from global analyses. We compare our results with the latest near-threshold $J/\psi$ production data from the GlueX and $J/\psi$-007 experiments at Jefferson Laboratory, finding good agreement for both differential and total cross sections. Predictions are also provided for $\Upsilon$ photoproduction, which can be tested at future Electron-Ion Colliders.</description>

      <title>Explicit rephasing to Kobayashi-Maskawa representation and fundamental phase structure of CP violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we construct an explicit rephasing transformation that converts an arbitrary unitary matrix into the Kobayashi--Maskawa (KM) parameterization and identify all independent CP phases in the mixing matrix as the arguments of its matrix elements. Furthermore, by applying this rephasing transformation to the fermion diagonalization matrices $U^{f}$, we show that the Majorana phases are represented by fermion-specific phases $\delta^{\nu, e}_{\rm KM}$ and their relative phases. In particular, by neglecting the 3-1 elements $U_{31}^{\nu ,e}$ of the diagonalization matrices for the two fermions, the KM phase $\delta_{\rm KM}$ is concisely expressed by fermion-specific rephasing invariants involving two relative phases $\delta_{\rm KM} = \arg \left [1 + ({U^{e * }_{21} U^{\nu}_{21} / U^{e * }_{11} U^{\nu}_{11} }) \right ] + \arg \left [ - { U_{32}^{e *} U_{32}^{\nu} / U^{e * }_{22} U^{\nu}_{22} } \right] $.</description>

      <title>Stationary perturbation theory without sums over intermediate states: Supersymmetric Expansion Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we show that results of Rayleigh-Schr\"{o}dinger perturbation theory can be easily obtained using the recently proposed supersymmetric expansion algorithm. Our formalism avoids the sums over intermediate states and yield directly corrections to the energy and eigenstates in terms of integrals weighted by the probability densities for the edge states of the involved supersymmetric Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>SMEFT effects on spin correlations and entanglement at NLO QCD in di-boson production at hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform for the first time a full study of spin correlations in inclusive WZ production at the LHC with leptonic decays in the presence of NLO QCD corrections and of effects from a dimension-six operator in the SMEFT modifying the electroweak triple-gauge coupling. We carry out the complete quantum-state tomography of the di-boson system and relate its results to common purity and spin-entanglement markers, highlighting the sizeable impact of both QCD corrections and SMEFT insertions. Additionally, we show how a naive truncation at dimension-six in the SMEFT expansion of the spin-density matrix can lead to a cumbersome spin interpretation of the quantum-tomography results.</description>

      <title>Modulus stabilization of modular flavor models in Jordan frame supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to discuss the modular flavor model and the stabilization of single modulus field in the Jordan frame supergravity with non-minimal scalar-curvature coupling of the form $\Phi(\tau,\bar{\tau})R$. Modular invariance and positivity of the scale factor constrain stringently the form of the frame function, consequently the Kahler potential by the relation $\Phi(\tau,\bar{\tau})=-3\exp[-K(\tau,\bar{\tau})/3]$. We discuss some general properties of scalar potentials after the scale transformation from the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame. We find that the shape of the resulting scalar potential in the Einstein frame is quite different from that of ordinary single modulus stabilization mechanism. The scalar potential could be stationary at the $i\infty$ fixed point, leading to a runaway type vacuum. We also discuss numerically the modulus stabilization for some simplified scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quantum properties of heavy-fermion pairs at a lepton collider with polarised beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum properties of heavy-fermion pairs, such as $t\bar t$ or $\tau^+\tau^-$, produced in lepton-lepton collisions with polarised beams. Focusing on spin correlations, entanglement, Bell-inequality violation, and quantum-information--theoretic measures such as purity and magic, we analyse how beam polarisation shapes the structure of the spin-density matrix. We derive analytic expressions for a wide range of helicity configurations, including both Standard Model contributions and generic new-physics effects parametrised by scalar, vector, and tensor four-fermion operators within an effective field theory framework. We show that beam polarisation unlocks a substantially richer set of spin configurations and significantly enhances sensitivity to non-standard interactions. As a phenomenological application, we study $t\bar t$ production at a future linear collider and demonstrate that quantum observables provide a comprehensive and complementary probe of top-quark interactions and stronger constraints on the scale of new physics.</description>

      <title>New modular fixed point models and their phenomenological implications for JUNO, T2HK and DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a general analysis of minimal modular fixed point models based on two right-handed neutrinos (2RHNs) and three modular fixed points, and find that the only viable possibilities are based on modular $S_4'$ and $A_5$ symmetry. Such models are highly predictive, with neutrino masses and the lepton mixing mixing matrix being fixed by three real parameters, as in the Littlest Seesaw Models. We perform an exhaustive scan over all possible models in this class and find many viable fixed points and modular form alignments, after confronting them with the latest neutrino oscillation global fits. The resulting models have the new feature that the two Dirac columns take more general forms than traditional Littlest Seesaw models, resulting in new sum rule relations between the solar and reactor angles, beyond those associated with TM1 (where the first column of the tri-bimaximal mixing matrix is preserved), which are compared to present and future projected JUNO results. We also compare the predictions of these models for the atmospheric angle and CP violating phase to current global fits and future T2HK and DUNE sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Higgs Decays at NLO in the SMEFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calculation of precise predictions for Higgs decays is a necessary ingredient for determining Higgs properties at the LHC and future colliders. We compute all two- and three-body Higgs decays at next-to-leading order (NLO) in both QCD and electroweak interactions using the dimension-6 Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Results for four-body Higgs decays that are accurate to NLO QCD/electroweak order in the SMEFT are obtained using the narrow width approximation. Our results are contained in a flexible Monte Carlo program, NEWiSH, that is publicly available and we illustrate the impact of the NLO electroweak corrections for HL-LHC, Tera-Z, and Higgstrahlung projections.</description>

      <title>Classifying fusion rules of anyons or SymTFTs: A general algebraic formula for domain wall problems and quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21687v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a formula for the transformation law of anyons in topologically ordered phases or topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) through a gapped or symmetry-preserving domain wall. Our formalism is based on the ring homomorphism between the $\mathbb{C}$-linear commutative fusion rings, also known as symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs). The fundamental assumption in our formalism is the validity of the Verlinde formula, applicable to commutative fusion rings. By combining it with more specific data of the settings, our formula provides classifications of anyons compatible with developing categorical formulations. It also provides the massless renormalization group (RG) flows between conformal field theories (CFTs), or a series of measurement-induced quantum phase transitions, in the language of SymTFT, through the established correspondence between CFTs and TQFTs. Moreover, by studying the correspondence between the ideal structure in the massless RG and the module in the related massive RG, one can make the Nambu-Goldstone-type arguments for generalized symmetry. By combining our formula with orbifolding, extension, and similarity transformation, one can get a series of classifications for the corresponding extended models, or symmetry-enriched topological orders and quantum criticalities.</description>

      <title>Heavy hadron spectrum from 2+1+1 flavor MILC lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07360v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mass spectra and various mass differences of heavy hadrons containing one or more bottom quarks using MILC's $N_f = 2+1+1$ HISQ gauge ensembles at three lattice spacings. For the valence quarks, we employ a combination of lattice actions: the NRQCD action is used for bottom quarks, the anisotropic Clover action for charm quarks, and the $O(a)$-improved Wilson--Clover action for strange and lighter (up/down) quarks. Heavy hadron operators with at least one bottom quark are constructed by considering all possible combinations with charm, strange, and light quarks corresponding to various quantum numbers.</description>

      <title>Note on pulsar timing array correlation functions induced by peculiar velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several papers have recently calculated the contribution to pulsar timing array overlap reduction functions (ORFs) induced by our peculiar velocity with respect to the rest frame of the stochastic gravitational-wave background. Here we show that a harmonic-space calculation confirms the most recent result. We note that, with the harmonic-space calculation, the ORFs for spin-1 GWs and the correlations with astrometry measurements are also easily obtained.</description>

      <title>Bogomol'nyi Equations in Two-Species Born--Infeld Theories Governing Vortices and Antivortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09091v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive several new Bogomol'nyi (self-dual) equations in two-species $U(1)\times U(1)$ gauge theories governed by the Born--Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics. By identifying appropriate Born--Infeld type Higgs potentials, we show that the highly nonlinear energy functionals admit exact topological lower bounds saturated by coupled first-order equations. The resulting models accommodate both vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex configurations and generalize previously known single-species Born--Infeld systems to interacting multi-component settings.
  Beyond the derivation of the Bogomol'nyi equations, we develop an exact thermodynamic theory for pinned multivortex configurations in both the full plane and compact doubly periodic domains. Owing to the linear dependence of the Bogomol'nyi energy spectrum on topological charges, we obtain closed-form expressions for the canonical partition function, internal energy, heat capacity, and magnetization. In compact domains, the Bradlow type geometric bounds constrain admissible vortex numbers and lead to qualitatively new high-temperature behavior. In particular, vortex-only systems exhibit spontaneous magnetization, while vortex-antivortex systems do not, reflecting the underlying symmetry between opposite topological charges. These results provide a rare analytically solvable framework for studying thermodynamics in nonlinear multi-component gauge theories regulated by the Born--Infeld electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Ascertaining higher-order quantum correlations in high energy physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlocality is a peculiar nature of quanta and it stands as an important quantum resource in application. Yet mere linear property of it, viz. the first order in moment, has been explored through various inequalities. Noticing the vast higher-order regime unexplored, in this study we investigate the higher-order quantum correlations in entangled hyperon-antihyperon system, which may be generated massively in charmonium decays. A new type of Clauser-Horne inequality for statistical cumulants and central moments is formulated. We find that a significant violation of the third-order constraint, indicating the existence of higher-order correlation, exists in hyperon-antihyperon system and can be observed in high energy physics experiments, like BESIII and Belle II. Notably, the violation manifests more in higher energy systems of the $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ pair against the kinematic contamination of timelike events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss in rather general terms the properties of space-like baryon transition form factors. In particular, we argue why these are necessarily complex-valued, what can be deduced from the respective phase motion and why dealing with real valued transition form factors in general leads to misleading results. For illustration the transition form factors for the Roper resonance as derived in the J\"ulich-Bonn-Washington framework are discussed.</description>

      <title>Collapse versus Disruption: The Fate of Compact Stellar Systems in Ultralight Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interference of the ultralight dark matter (ULDM) field generates time-varying gravitational potential fluctuations, which stochastically heat stellar systems embedded in ULDM halos. Small-sized stellar systems are therefore often used to set stringent constraints on ULDM. However, the evolution of systems with sizes well below the ULDM de Broglie wavelength remains poorly explored. Using numerical simulations, we show that the evolution of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos is governed by the interplay between internal stellar relaxation and ULDM-induced heating. We find the following main results. First, in sufficiently compact systems, relaxation-driven core collapse dominates, allowing the system to remain bound and dense, while ULDM-induced stripping of outer stars further accelerates the collapse. Second, in more extended systems, ULDM heating dominates and ultimately disrupts the system. Near the disruption threshold, we identify systems resembling ultra-faint dwarfs like Segue 1. Third, we further introduce a dimensionless parameter to quantify the relative importance of heating and relaxation and finally lead to an evolutionary phase diagram. Our results reveal the rich and nontrivial dynamics of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos, indicating that precise system modeling is essential for robust ULDM constraints.</description>

      <title>Inclusive and exclusive semileptonic decays of heavy mesons on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the recent progress from our group in extracting observables of both inclusive and exclusive semileptonic heavy-meson decays directly from lattice QCD four-point correlators. On the inclusive side, we illustrate how to estimate the systematic uncertainties from omitted higher-order terms and non-zero smearing of the kernel approximation, building on two important features of the Chebyshev expansion. On the exclusive side, we perform BCL parameterizations of the pseudoscalar to pseudoscalar form factors and compare the fitted coefficients with those from earlier results by HPQCD. We also perform a HQET-based parameterization of the P-wave form factors to shed new light on the 1/2-vs-3/2 puzzle. This work constitutes a step toward a unified lattice treatment of inclusive and exclusive semileptonic decays, relevant for the Vcb puzzle. In this study, we use lattice ensembles from the RBC/UKQCD collaboration for numerical investigations. Future developments from our group will focus on the control of other systematic effects for inclusive decays and investigations of other techniques with reduced statistical errors to extract exclusive contributions from lattice four-point correlators.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Piecewise Power-Law Reconstruction of the Gravitational-Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The NANOGrav 15-year (NG15) data set provides evidence for a gravitational-wave background (GWB) signal at nanohertz frequencies, which is expected to originate either from a cosmic population of inspiraling supermassive black-hole binaries or new particle physics in the early Universe. A firm identification of the source of the NG15 signal requires an accurate reconstruction of its frequency spectrum. In this paper, we provide such a spectral characterization of the NG15 signal based on a piecewise power-law (PPL) ansatz that strikes a balance between existing alternatives in the literature. Our PPL reconstruction is more flexible than the standard constant-power-law model, which describes the GWB spectrum in terms of only two parameters: an amplitude A and a spectral index gamma. Concurrently, it better approximates physically realistic GWB spectra -- especially those of cosmological origin -- than the free spectral model, since the latter allows for arbitrary variations in the GWB amplitude from one frequency bin to the next. Our PPL reconstruction of the NG15 signal relies on individual PPL models with a fixed number of internal nodes (i.e., constant power law, broken power law, doubly broken power law, etc.) that are ultimately combined in a Bayesian model average. The data products resulting from our analysis provide the basis for fast refits of spectral GWB models.</description>

      <title>Resolving Hubble tension and locating missing baryons: Synergies between fast radio bursts and emerging cosmological probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two of the most pressing challenges in cosmology are the persistent discrepancy in measurements of the Hubble constant, referred to as the Hubble tension, and the deficit of baryons in the local Universe, known as the missing baryon problem. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) encode the integrated electron column density along their lines of sight, offering a unique probe of both the cosmic expansion rate ($H_0$) and the baryon density ($\Omega_{\rm b}$). However, constraints from FRBs alone suffer from a severe $H_0$-$\Omega_{\rm b}$ degeneracy that prevents them from resolving either problem independently. We show that this degeneracy can be broken by combining FRBs with other emerging probes whose degeneracy directions differ in the $H_0$-$\Omega_{\rm b}$ plane. Specifically, we quantify three multi-messenger approaches: FRBs paired with gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens, strong gravitational lensing (SGL) time delays, and 21 cm intensity mapping (IM). The combinations FRB+GW, FRB+SGL, and FRB+21 cm IM each deliver simultaneous constraints on $H_0$ and $\Omega_{\rm b}$ better than ($1\%$, $1\%$) in the $\Lambda$CDM model, ($1.5\%$, $2\%$) in the $w$CDM model, and ($2\%$, $3.5\%$) in the CPL model. Moreover, in a model-independent framework, both FRB+GW and FRB+SGL constrain $H_0$ and $\Omega_{\rm b}$ to better than ($1\%$, $2\%$) precision. These results demonstrate that the synergy between FRBs and other emerging probes holds great promise for resolving the Hubble tension and locating the missing baryons.</description>

      <title>Spatial Wilson Loops and Energy Loss for Heavy Quarks in Magnetized HQCD Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effective potential and the string tension for the spatial Wilson loop (SWL) in hot dense QGP with two types of anisotropy, i.e. external magnetic field and spatial anisotropy, employing a holographic approach for the heavy quark model. In this approach, the string is extended in the 5th, holographic direction and has a turning point either on a dynamical wall (DW) configuration or on the horizon configuration in the 5th direction. We obtain the magnetic catalysis behavior for a phase transition between DW and horizon configuration of the string. The structure of the phase diagram does not depend on the boundary conditions choice for the dilaton field. Inclusion of the external magnetic field and spatial anisotropy enhance the string tension in the horizon configuration, namely drag force. For the spatially isotropic case $\nu = 1$ at different magnetic field values the string tension is proportional to $T^2$ and is qualitatively consistent with lattice results. However, for the anisotropic case, $\nu = 4.5$, it deviates from the quadratic term.</description>

      <title>Constraining axion-like dark matter with a radio-frequency atomic magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09638v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a broadband search for axion-like-particle (ALP) interactions using a radio-frequency-operated $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atomic magnetometer. The instrument provides wide spectral coverage and sensitivity to an oscillating pseudomagnetic field that may be generated by the gradient coupling of the ALP field to the constituent fermions of atoms. We search for an ALP-gradient signature in the mass range $2.40\times10^{-10}\,\mathrm{eV}/c^{2}$--$2.11\times10^{-9}\,\mathrm{eV}/c^{2}$. No statistically significant signatures of an oscillating magnetic field are observed, and we derive upper limits on the corresponding ALP-proton, -neutron and -electron couplings, $g_{\alpha pp}$, $g_{\alpha nn}$ and $g_{\alpha ee}$, respectively. The result on $g_{\alpha pp}$ improves over previous laboratory searches, while the limits on $g_{\alpha nn}$ and $g_{\alpha ee}$ complement earlier laboratory searches and astrophysical bounds. The work extends searches for ALP-fermion interactions into a mass region largely unexplored in a dark-matter context, demonstrating the potential of our method for broadband axion-like particle searches targeting the Galactic dark-matter halo.</description>

      <title>Constant-roll $\beta$-exponential inflation: Palatini formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the inflationary dynamics of the $\beta$-exponential potential model, where a scalar field couples to quadratic $(R + R^2)$ gravity. In this model, the inflaton is the field that determines the size of the extra dimension. We employ the Palatini formalism to derive the resulting Einstein-frame generalized $k$-inflation effective theory, which we analyze under the assumption that the constant-roll condition is satisfied.
  We scan the parameter space for inflationary predictions, specifically the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, ensuring consistency with the results from ACT DR6. The compliant regions are depicted accordingly. For a suitable range of the model parameters, the values obtained for the inflationary observables align with the most recent observations by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration and/or the Planck mission.</description>

      <title>A Spin One Bottomonium Study in the Functional Formalism in the Feynman Gauge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bethe-Salpeter equation for spin-one bottomonium coupled to quark and gluon propagators is solved in a class of non-trivial linear gauges.
  The interaction kernel is based on a known gluon propagator extrapolated from the lattice and contains only small amount of additional phenomenology. The first numerical results are obtained in the Feynman gauge where the associated problem with infrared divergences is circumvented by by introducing a symmetry breaking regulator mass $m_L$. The presence of this mass renders the bound state vertices of vector states finite but
  it is also necessary to prevent inconsistent solutions of the bound state equation. For $m_L\simeq \Lambda_{QCD}$ it gives us good agreement
  with the experimental data for vector and axial vector bottomonia below the $BB$ threshold. While the primary concern pertains to the physical ramifications of the proposed concept,
  a potential origin for the proposed interaction is also presented.</description>

      <title>Small-$x$ Asymptotics of the Leading-Twist Flavor Singlet Quark TMDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the small-$x$ behavior of the flavor-singlet, leading-twist quark Transverse Momentum Dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs) using the Light-Cone Operator Treatment. This formalism allows us to express TMD operators at small $x$ in terms of polarized dipole amplitudes, enabling a systematic approach to their small-$x$ evolution. We derive the evolution equations for these TMDs and solve them within the large-$N_c$ approximation under the linearized, Double-Logarithmic Approximation (DLA), where $N_c$ represents the number of quark colors. Expanding on previous work on unpolarized and helicity TMDs, we present the small-$x$ asymptotics for a comprehensive set of TMDs, including the Sivers function, helicity worm-gear, transversity, pretzelosity, Boer-Mulders, and transversity worm-gear distributions. Our results provide a complete picture of the small-$x$ asymptotic behavior for all leading-twist flavor-singlet quark TMDs. We also discuss the implications of our findings for phenomenological applications and outline potential avenues for further research, particularly in understanding non-linear effects and extending beyond the DLA and large-$N_c$ approximations.</description>

      <title>Quark flavor equilibration of the quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The early stage of a heavy-ion collision is marked by rapid entropy production and the transition from a gluon saturated initial condition to a plasma of quarks and gluons that evolves hydrodynamically. However, during the early times of the hydrodynamic evolution, the chemical composition of the QCD medium is still largely unknown. We present a study of quark chemical equilibration in the (Q)GP using a novel model of viscous hydrodynamic evolution in partial chemical equilibrium. Motivated by the success of gluon saturated initial condition models, we initialize the QCD medium as a completely gluon dominated state. Local quark production during the hydrodynamic phase is then simulated through the evolution of time-dependent fugacities for each independent quark flavor, with the timescales set as free parameters to compare different rates of equilibration. We present the results of complete heavy-ion collision simulations using this partial chemical equilibrium model, and show the effects on hadronic and electromagnetic observables. In particular, we show that the development of flow is sensitive to the equilibration timescale, providing an empirical way to probe the chemical equilibration of the QCD medium.</description>

      <title>Deeply virtual $\phi$-meson production near threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss exclusive $\phi$-meson electroproduction off the proton near threshold within the GPD factorization framework. We propose the `threshold approximation' in which only the leading term of the conformal partial wave expansion of the meson production amplitudes is kept in both the quark and gluon exchange channels. We test the validity of this approximation to next-to-leading order in QCD and demonstrate the strong sensitivity of the cross section to the gluon and strangeness gravitational form factors. We also perform realistic event generator simulations both for Jefferson Lab and EIC kinematics and demonstrate the capabilities of future facilities for measuring near-threshold $\phi$ electroproduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose searching for physics beyond the Standard Model in the low-transverse-momentum tracks accompanying hard-scatter events at the LHC. TeV-scale resonances connected to a dark QCD sector could be enhanced by selecting events with anomalies in the track distributions. As a benchmark, a quirk model with microscopic string lengths is developed, including a setup for event simulation. For this model, strategies are presented to enhance the sensitivity compared to inclusive resonance searches: a simple cut-based selection, a supervised search, and a model-agnostic weakly supervised anomaly search with the CATHODE method. Expected discovery potentials and exclusion limits are shown for 140 fb$^{-1}$ of 13 TeV proton-proton collisions at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Doubly charged Higgs boson at same-sign lepton colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the search for doubly charged Higgs bosons in the Georgi-Machacek (GM) model at same-sign lepton colliders. The dominant production mode is vector boson fusion, through which the particle is singly produced and decays into a pair of same-sign $W$ bosons if the triplet vacuum expectation value is sufficiently large, as allowed in the GM model. Considering the leptonic decays of the $W$ bosons, we discuss the discovery reach of the signal and a method to extract the mass of the doubly charged Higgs boson. It is impossible to construct the transverse mass of the decay product to obtain the mass because of the neutrinos radiated from the initial-state leptons. Alternatively, we propose to make use of the invariant mass of the same-sign leptons. We perform $\chi^2$ fitting using the analytical formula for the invariant mass distribution and demonstrate that this approach is effective in extracting the information on the mass. We also compare the process with pair production processes at the opposite-sign lepton colliders.</description>

      <title>Charged Loops at the Cosmological Collider with Chemical Potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological collider physics allows the detection of heavy particles at inflationary scales through their imprints on primordial non-Gaussianities. We study the chemical potential mechanism applied to a pair of charged scalars. We analytically evaluate the resulting one-loop contribution to the bispectrum, using the spectral decomposition. In this way we are able to determine the parametric dependences for both the signal and the background. We show that a signal strength $f_{\mathrm{NL}}\sim O(0.01)$ can be obtained within theoretical control, potentially reachable by 21cm tomography. As an application we consider the colored Higgs bosons in $\mathrm{SU}(5)$ supersymmetric orbifold grand unification with masses $M\lesssim10^{15}\:\mathrm{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Columbia plot based on symmetry-improved CJT formalism in linear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Columbia plot for the chiral phase transition in the framework of a three-flavor linear sigma model based on the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) formalism. The conventional CJT approach with the Hartree truncation suffers from artificial chiral breaking, leading to the violation of the Nambu-Goldstone theorem and the (anomalous) chiral Ward-Takahashi identities. We apply the symmetry-improved CJT formalism to resolve this issue. We observe a first-order phase transition and a tricritical point in the light-quark mass regime, which is fairly insensitive to the size of the sigma meson, in contrast to the conventional CJT approach. The tricritical point, found on the $m_s$ axis, is at $m_s^{\rm tri}/m_s^{\rm phys.} = 0.175$ with $m_s^{\rm phys.}$ being the physical strange quark mass in real-life QCD. The critical pion mass in the three-flavor symmetric limit, on the second-order boundary, is measured at $m_\pi \sim 52.4$ MeV, with the critical temperature $T_c \sim 51.7$ MeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dark Abelian gauge bosons on the electroweak precision measurements at the one-loop level. The dark gauge boson couples to the standard model fermions generally via two kinds of mixing with the electroweak gauge bosons: the kinetic mixing and the mass mixing. We solve the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the gauge boson propagators and derive a renormalization scheme-independent representation of the scattering amplitudes for four-fermion processes, including the full oblique corrections. We define the running parameters at the one-loop level and show that the leading new physics effects, including the mixing, in the electroweak precision observables can be described by the oblique parameters $S$, $T$, and $U$ as in the standard electroweak gauge theory when the new physics scale is sufficiently high and the dark gauge boson mass lies away from the $Z$ pole. We consider the dark doublet scalar boson as an example and numerically show that a novel one-loop effect can drastically change the parameter region allowed by the electroweak precision tests.</description>

      <title>The N$^3$LO Twist-2 Matching of TMD Quark Transversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17568v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) calculation of the twist-2 matching coefficients for transverse momentum dependent (TMD) quark transversity parton distribution and fragmentation functions in QCD. This matching relates the TMD quark transversity functions to their collinear counterparts in the large-transverse-momentum regime, and provides essential ingredients for precision TMD phenomenology involving transversely polarized beams. As part of our analysis, we derive the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) DGLAP splitting functions for collinear transversity, confirming agreement with known space-like results for parton distribution functions and providing the new time-like splitting functions relevant for fragmentation functions. These results extend the perturbative toolkit for spin-dependent observables and establish the transversity sector on the same theoretical footing as unpolarized and helicity distributions. Our findings enable high-precision extractions of transversity PDFs and facilitate improved theoretical predictions for azimuthal asymmetries in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS), especially in light of forthcoming data from the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).</description>

      <title>Dipion transitions from $X(3872)$ to $\chi_{cJ}\ (J=0,1,2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the dipion transition processes $X(3872)\to \pi \pi \chi_{cJ} (J=0,1,2)$ within the framework of heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory, treating $X(3872)$ as a molecular state composed of $D\bar{D}^*$+ H.c. components. By analyzing the box and triangle loop diagrams with the nonrelativistic effective field theory power-counting rule, we demonstrate that box diagrams dominate these dipion transition processes. Branching ratios are calculated as functions of the mixing angle $\theta$, which parametrizes the neutral and charged meson compositions of the $X(3872)$. Our results indicate that the branching fractions for $X(3872)\to\pi\pi\chi_{c0}$, $X(3872)\to \pi\pi\chi_{c1}$, and $X(3872)\to \pi\pi\chi_{c2}$ are of the orders of $10^{-4}$, $10^{-3}$, and $10^{-5}$, respectively. We also predict the ratios ${\mathcal{B}[X(3872)\rightarrow \pi\pi\chi_{c0/2}]}/{\mathcal{B}[X(3872)\rightarrow \pi\pi\chi_{c1}]}$ and ${\mathcal{B}[X(3872)\rightarrow \pi^+\pi^-\chi_{cJ}]}/{\mathcal{B}[X(3872)\rightarrow \pi^0\pi^0\chi_{cJ}]}$. The latter deviates from isospin-symmetry expectations, revealing various degrees of isospin violation. By studying the $\pi^+\pi^-$ and $\pi^+\chi_{cJ}$ invariant mass spectra, we find a double-bump structure in the $\pi^ + \pi^-$ invariant mass distributions of the process $X(3872)\to \pi^+\pi^-\chi_{c1}$ and $\pi^+\chi_{c0}$ invariant mass distribution of the process $X(3872)\to \pi^+\pi^-\chi_{c0}$, which could be tested by future experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Physical implications of a double right-handed gauge symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Guided by the flipping principle, we propose a novel extension of the Standard Model based on a double right-handed $U(1)$ gauge symmetry. In this framework, all left-handed fermions are neutral, while right-handed fermions of the third generation carry charges distinct from those of the first two generations. This structure naturally explains the observed Standard Model fermion mass hierarchy: the heavy masses of the third generation are generated at tree level, while the lighter masses of the first and second generations arise radiatively at the one-loop level. For the active neutrino sector, the tiny masses are generated through a combination of tree-level and two-loop seesaw mechanisms. Crucially, this approach successfully reproduces the observed neutrino mass hierarchy, with the atmospheric mass-squared difference generated at tree level and the solar neutrino mass squared difference emerging at the two-loop level. These hierarchical patterns stem from the interplay between gauge invariance and a residual parity symmetry that survives the spontaneous breaking of the extended gauge group. The same residual symmetry stabilizes a viable scalar singlet dark matter candidate, which we show can reproduce the observed relic abundance while remaining consistent with current direct detection bounds. After addressing constraints from electroweak precision tests and flavor-changing neutral currents, we explore the discovery prospects for the new neutral bosons at existing and future colliders, including the LEP, LHC, and a future ILC.</description>

      <title>Insights into Meson and Baryon Structure using Continuum Schwinger Function Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bulk of visible mass is supposed to emerge from nonperturbative dynamics within quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Following years of development and refinement, continuum and lattice Schwinger function methods have recently joined in revealing the three pillars that support this emergent hadron mass (EHM); namely, a nonzero gluon mass-scale, a process-independent effective charge, and dressed-quarks with running masses that take constituent-like values at infrared momenta. One may argue that EHM and confinement are inextricably linked; and theory is now working to expose their manifold expressions in hadron observables and highlight the types of measurements that can be made in order to validate the paradigm. This contribution sketches these ideas via the unified explanation of pion and proton electromagnetic and gravitational form factors.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Amplitude Pair with Distinct CPV Phases in Charmed Baryon Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Letter, we propose a strategy to extract information on the hierarchical amplitude pair in singly Cabibbo-suppressed (SCS) charmed baryon two-body decays, with a dominant amplitude proportional to $\lambda_s = V_{cs}^* V_{us}$ from tree operators and sub-leading one proportional to $\lambda_b = V_{cb}^* V_{ub}$ from both penguin and tree contributions. The coexistence of these two amplitudes is essential for generating nonzero CP violation (CPV) effects. Since the $\lambda_b$ amplitude is strongly suppressed, its experimental determination is highly challenging. However, by exploiting SU(3) flavor symmetry, which relates the well-measured Cabibbo-favored (CF) amplitudes to the SCS tree amplitudes, information on the $\lambda_b$ amplitude can be extracted. Using current experimental data, a conservative analysis yields $\lambda_b$ amplitudes can be as large as about $10\%$ of the corresponding tree amplitudes with a significance of $2.1\sigma$. In addition, the Lee-Yang parameters of these decays provide an independent probe of this elusive term. We further identify two golden decay channels, $\Xi_c^0 \to p K^-$ and $\Xi_c^0 \to \Sigma^+ \pi^-$, which are particularly well suited for experimental studies of CPV.</description>

Abstract: We present numerical simulations of dark matter and stellar dynamics in ultra light dark matter halos tailored to mimic dwarf galaxies. An important effect we observe is the dynamical evolution of the stellar half-light radius and velocity dispersion, which makes previous equilibrium models significantly incomplete. Based on half-light radius dynamical evolution, as well as velocity peaks due to soliton core condensation, we show that data from the Fornax, Carina, and Leo II dwarf galaxies disfavores particle masses in the range $ 5\times 10^{-22} \text{ eV} \lesssim m \lesssim 5\times10^{-21}$ eV. Smaller boson masses, around $m\approx1\times10^{-22}$ eV, could cause strong dynamical heating, but we caution that tidal stripping by the Milky Way could moderate the effect. A caveat in our analysis is the omission of stellar self-gravity, which could affect extrapolation back in time if the stellar body was much more compact in the past.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Constraints on Non-Thermal Light Massive Relics from Future CMB Experiments (CMB-S4/Simons Observatory)</title>

Abstract: In this work we present Fisher forecasts on \textit{non-thermal LiMR} models for a CMB Stage IV-like experiment and the Simons Observatory -- particularly focusing on a model of inflaton/moduli decay giving rise to non-thermally distributed dark sector particles, and also comparing our results with those for sterile particles following the Dodelson-Widrow distribution. Two independent parameters, $\Delta N_\mathrm{eff}$ and $M_\mathrm{sp}^\mathrm{eff}$, influence linear cosmological observables. We find $\Delta N_\mathrm{eff}$ to be more tightly constrained (by a factor of $10$) for a less abundant, heavier LiMR which becomes fully non-relativistic around matter-radiation equality than a more abundant, lighter LiMR which becomes fully non-relativistic just after recombination. The uncertainties on $M_\mathrm{sp}^\mathrm{eff}$ differ by a factor of $\sim3$ between the two cases. Our analysis also reveals distinct parameter correlations: the phenomenological parameters $\{\Delta N_\mathrm{eff},M_\mathrm{sp}^\mathrm{eff}\}$ are found to be negatively correlated for the former case and positively correlated for the latter. We obtain similar projected uncertainties on the cosmological parameters (in either case) for both the inflaton/moduli decay and the Dodelson-Widrow models when the first two moments of the LiMR distribution function, related to the phenomenological parameters, are matched. Finally, by constructing a modified distribution that matches the first two moments of the Dodelson-Widrow but deviates maximally in the third moment, we demonstrate that CMB Stage IV data is not expected to be sensitive to higher moments of the distribution.</description>

      <title>Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 1. $\Lambda$CDM Constraints from the Power Spectrum and Bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first independent re-analysis of the galaxy clustering data from DESI Data Release 1, utilizing an effective field theory full-shape model. We analyze the power spectra and bispectra of the public catalogs using a custom-built pipeline based on window-deconvolved quasi-optimal estimators, accounting for a number of systematic effects. Compared to the official collaboration analysis, we add the galaxy power spectrum hexadecapole and the bispectrum monopole, and also introduce a novel stochastic estimator for fiber collisions, which facilitates robust bispectrum analyses. As a first application, we perform a full-shape analysis of the DESI power spectra and bispectra in the context of the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Using external priors on the physical baryon density and the primordial power spectrum tilt, we constrain the matter density fraction to $\Omega_m=0.284\pm 0.011$, the Hubble constant to $H_0=70.7\pm 1.1$ km/s/Mpc, and the mass fluctuation amplitude to $\sigma_8=0.811\pm 0.030$. The bispectrum sharpens constraints on $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$ by $\approx 10\%$ and shifts $\Omega_m$ by $\approx 1\sigma$ towards the \textit{Planck} $\Lambda$CDM value. Combining our full-shape likelihood with the official DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmological parameters shift further towards the \textit{Planck} values, with $\Omega_m=0.296\pm 0.007$, $H_0=68.8\pm 0.6$ km/s/Mpc, $\sigma_8=0.818\pm 0.029$ (with tighter constraints obtained in joint analyses). Similar results are obtained in a joint analysis with DR1 BAO, accounting for the cross-covariance. Finally, the bispectrum data improves measurements of quadratic bias parameters, which are consistent with predictions from halo occupation distribution models. Our work highlights the importance of higher-order statistics and sets the stage for upcoming full-shape analyses of non-minimal cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Signatures of Axion Dark Matter via Parity-Violating Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate axion-like particles coupled to gravity through a parity-violating Chern-Simons (CS) interaction. In this framework, axion dark matter (DM) can decay into pairs of circularly polarized gravitons, producing a persistent, nearly monochromatic GW signal. We compute the expected signal at Earth assuming a Navarro-Frenk-White Galactic halo model with the corresponding velocity distribution, and compare it with the narrowband sensitivities of the LIGO O4 run and the projected reach of the Einstein Telescope. The resulting bounds on the axion-graviton coupling $\alpha$ improve upon the cosmological stability requirement for axion masses $m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-11}$ eV, excluding values up to four orders of magnitude below the stability limit. This constitutes a robust direct terrestrial constraint on the axion-gravity CS coupling. We also discuss distinctive observational signatures, such as circular polarization asymmetries, annual modulation, and potential enhancements from DM substructures, which could serve as smoking-gun evidence for parity-violating gravitational interactions.</description>

      <title>Probing the Parameter Space of Axion-Like Particles Using Simulation-Based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs), hypothetical pseudoscalar particles that couple to photons, are among the most actively investigated candidates for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Their interaction with gamma rays in the presence of astrophysical magnetic fields can leave characteristic, energy-dependent modulations in observed spectra. Capturing such subtle features requires precise statistical inference, but standard likelihood-based methods often fall short when faced with complex models, large number of nuisance parameters and limited analytical tractability. In this work, we investigate the application of simulation-based inference (SBI), specifically Truncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (TMNRE), to constrain ALP parameters using simulated observations from the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). We model the gamma-ray emission from the active galactic nucleus NGC 1275, accounting for photon-ALP mixing, extragalactic background light (EBL) absorption, and the full CTAO instrument response. Leveraging the Swyft framework, we infer posteriors for the ALP mass and coupling strength and demonstrate its potential to extract meaningful constraints on ALPs from future real gamma-ray data with CTAO.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves from Scalar Backreaction in Axion-SU(2) Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we perform the first numerical study of strong scalar backreaction in spectator chromo-natural inflation (SCNI) in the case where the spectator sector decays during inflation. The tachyonic instability in scalar fluctuations, activated as the system crosses the $m_Q = \sqrt{2}$ threshold, amplifies perturbations and may significantly alter the background dynamics. The strong scalar backreaction regime introduces an effective quartic term in the potential for the gauge field background that rapidly drives it to zero, accelerating the axion-gauge system decay. We describe the dynamics of such decay and derive the gravitational wave spectrum for a set of benchmark parameters. Interestingly, the signal may peak at interferometer scales and lie within LISA's projected sensitivity.</description>
