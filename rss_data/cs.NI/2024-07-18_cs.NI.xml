      <title>A comprehensive overview of the protocols associated with Intelligent Transportation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This white paper offers a comprehensive overview of the protocols utilized in the field of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). The paper presents a comprehensive overview of protocols from all layers of the Open System Interconnection (OSI) model. The protocols encompass a range of communication technologies, including ad-hoc, mobile broadband, and fiber-optic cable. All of these protocols are utilized in the field of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and must exchange information at some point. The current development leads to a much tighter connection between ecosystems that were previously isolated or not connected. This situation necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the protocols at all layers to ensure the establishment of safe and secure applications within the field of intelligent transportation systems (ITS).</description>

      <title>Advanced Mathematical Modelling for Energy-Efficient Data Transmission and Fusion in Wireless Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are indispensable for data-intensive applications, necessitating efficient energy management and robust data fusion techniques. This paper proposes an integrated framework leveraging fuzzy logic and backpropagation neural networks (BPNN) to enhance energy efficiency and data accuracy in WSNs. The model focuses on optimizing Cluster Head (CH) selection using fuzzy logic, considering parameters such as energy levels, proximity to the base station, and local density centrality. A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm is employed for energy-efficient data transmission from sensor nodes to CHs, minimizing energy consumption during data routing. BPNN-based data fusion at CHs reduces redundant data transmissions to the base station, thereby optimizing energy utilization and enhancing overall network performance. Simulation results demonstrate substantial improvements over conventional methods, including a 30% increase in network longevity, 25% improvement in data accuracy, and a 40% reduction in energy consumption. These gains are attributed to the intelligent CH selection strategy enabled by fuzzy logic, which ensures efficient resource allocation and minimizes energy wastage. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through comprehensive simulations, showcasing its ability to prolong network lifetime, maintain data integrity, and improve energy efficiency. The integration of fuzzy logic and BPNN not only addresses the challenges of energy management and data fusion in WSNs but also provides a scalable and adaptable framework for future applications requiring reliable and sustainable sensor network operations.

      <title>A Study on the Situation of Connected Car Patent Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the countries of the world have drafted the specifications of connected cars; for instance, the Security Credential Management System (SCMS) has been proposed by United States Department of Transportation (USDOT), and the Cooperative Intelligent Transportation System (C-ITS) Credential Management System (CCMS) has been proposed by European Union (EU). Therefore, several companies have developed the technology and productions of connected cars based on specifications, and connected car patent portfolios have been proactively performed. Therefore, this study uses Patent Search System (PSS) to find and analyze the contents of patents for obtaining the innovation reports of connected cars according to patents. This study considers the single-factor and two-factors to analyze the relationships of annuals, major technology leaders, major market leaders, and major technology and applications for exploring the patent portfolios of technology leaders and market leaders in connected cars.</description>

      <title>TwinRAN: Twinning the 5G RAN in Azure Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of 5G technology necessitates advanced network management strategies to ensure optimal performance and reliability. Digital Twins (DTs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for modeling and simulating complex systems like the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN). In this paper, we present TwinRAN, a DT of the 5G RAN built leveraging the Azure DT platform. TwinRAN is built on top of the Open RAN (O-RAN) architecture and is agnostic to the vendor of the underlying equipment. We demonstrate three applications using TwinRAN and evaluate the required resources and their performance for a network with 800 users and 8 gNBs.
  We first evaluate the performance and limitations of the Azure DT platform, measuring the latency under different conditions. The results from this evaluation allow us to optimize TwinRAN to the DT platform it uses. Then, we present the system's architectural design, emphasizing its components and interactions. We propose that two types of twin graphs be simultaneously maintained on the cloud. The first one is for intercell operations, keeping a broad overview of all the cells in the network. The second twin graph is where each cell is spawned in a separate Azure DT instance for more granular operation and monitoring of intracell tasks. We evaluate the performance and operating costs of TwinRAN for each of the three applications. The TwinRAN DT in the cloud can keep track of its physical twin within a few hundred milliseconds, extending its utility to many 5G network management tasks - some of which are shown in this paper. The novel framework for building and maintaining a DT of the 5G RAN presented in this paper offers network operators enhanced capabilities, empowering efficient deployments and management.</description>

      <title>A Look Into Training Large Language Models on Next Generation Datacenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Is it still worth doing computer networking research? What are relevant problems in this space given the supremacy of hyperscalers in deployed large networks? We take an unconventional approach to finding relevant research directions, by starting from Microsoft's plans to build a $100 billion datacenter for ML. Our goal is to understand what models could be trained in such a datacenter, as well as the high-level challenges one may encounter in doing so.
  We first examine the constraints imposed by cooling and power requirements for our target datacenter and find that it is infeasible to build in a single location. We use LLM scaling laws to determine that we could train models of 50T or 100T. Finally, we examine how distributed training might work for these models, and what the networking requirements are. We conclude that building the datacenter and training such models is technically possible, but this requires a novel NIC-based multipath transport along with a redesign of the entire training stack, outlining a research agenda for our community in the near future.</description>

      <title>A Framework for testing Federated Learning algorithms using an edge-like environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm in which many clients cooperatively train a single centralized model while keeping their data private and decentralized. FL is commonly used in edge computing, which involves placing computer workloads (both hardware and software) as close as possible to the edge, where the data is being created and where actions are occurring, enabling faster response times, greater data privacy, and reduced data transfer costs. However, due to the heterogeneous data distributions/contents of clients, it is non-trivial to accurately evaluate the contributions of local models in global centralized model aggregation. This is an example of a major challenge in FL, commonly known as data imbalance or class imbalance. In general, testing and assessing FL algorithms can be a very difficult and complex task due to the distributed nature of the systems. In this work, a framework is proposed and implemented to assess FL algorithms in a more easy and scalable way. This framework is evaluated over a distributed edge-like environment managed by a container orchestration platform (i.e. Kubernetes).</description>

      <title>Matching-Driven Deep Reinforcement Learning for Energy-Efficient Transmission Parameter Allocation in Multi-Gateway LoRa Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range (LoRa) communication technology, distinguished by its low power consumption and long communication range, is widely used in the Internet of Things. Nevertheless, the LoRa MAC layer adopts pure ALOHA for medium access control, which may suffer from severe packet collisions as the network scale expands, consequently reducing the system energy efficiency (EE). To address this issue, it is critical to carefully allocate transmission parameters such as the channel (CH), transmission power (TP) and spreading factor (SF) to each end device (ED). Owing to the low duty cycle and sporadic traffic of LoRa networks, evaluating the system EE under various parameter settings proves to be time-consuming. Consequently, we propose an analytical model aimed at calculating the system EE while fully considering the impact of multiple gateways, duty cycling, quasi-orthogonal SFs and capture effects. On this basis, we investigate a joint CH, SF and TP allocation problem, with the objective of optimizing the system EE for uplink transmissions. Due to the NP-hard complexity of the problem, the optimization problem is decomposed into two subproblems: CH assignment and SF/TP assignment. First, a matching-based algorithm is introduced to address the CH assignment subproblem. Then, an attention-based multiagent reinforcement learning technique is employed to address the SF/TP assignment subproblem for EDs allocated to the same CH, which reduces the number of learning agents to achieve fast convergence. The simulation outcomes indicate that the proposed approach converges quickly under various parameter settings and obtains significantly better system EE than baseline algorithms.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Vehicular Edge Computing: Joint Phase-shift Optimization and Multi-User Power Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is an emerging technology with significant potential in the field of internet of vehicles (IoV), enabling vehicles to perform intensive computational tasks locally or offload them to nearby edge devices. However, the quality of communication links may be severely deteriorated due to obstacles such as buildings, impeding the offloading process. To address this challenge, we introduce the use of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), which provide alternative communication pathways to assist vehicular communication. By dynamically adjusting the phase-shift of the RIS, the performance of VEC systems can be substantially improved. In this work, we consider a RIS-assisted VEC system, and design an optimal scheme for local execution power, offloading power, and RIS phase-shift, where random task arrivals and channel variations are taken into account. To address the scheme, we propose an innovative deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm for optimizing RIS phase-shift coefficients and the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm for optimizing the power allocation of vehicle user (VU). Simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the traditional centralized DDPG, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) and some typical stochastic schemes.</description>

      <title>Streaming Technologies and Serialization Protocols: Empirical Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficiently streaming high-volume data is essential for real-time data analytics, visualization, and AI and machine learning model training. Various streaming technologies and serialization protocols have been developed to meet different streaming needs. Together, they perform differently across various tasks and datasets. Therefore, when developing a streaming system, it can be challenging to make an informed decision on the suitable combination, as we encountered when implementing streaming for the UKAEA's MAST data or SKA's radio astronomy data. This study addresses this gap by proposing an empirical study of widely used data streaming technologies and serialization protocols. We introduce an extensible and open-source software framework to benchmark their efficiency across various performance metrics. Our findings reveal significant performance differences and trade-offs between these technologies. These insights can help in choosing suitable streaming and serialization solutions for contemporary data challenges. We aim to provide the scientific community and industry professionals with the knowledge to optimize data streaming for better data utilization and real-time analysis.</description>

      <title>Differentiated Federated Reinforcement Learning Based Traffic Offloading on Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02075v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN) plays a pivotal role as a comprehensive foundational network communication infrastructure, presenting opportunities for highly efficient global data transmission. Nonetheless, given SAGIN's unique characteristics as a dynamically heterogeneous network, conventional network optimization methodologies encounter challenges in satisfying the stringent requirements for network latency and stability inherent to data transmission within this network environment. Therefore, this paper proposes the use of differentiated federated reinforcement learning (DFRL) to solve the traffic offloading problem in SAGIN, i.e., using multiple agents to generate differentiated traffic offloading policies. Considering the differentiated characteristics of each region of SAGIN, DFRL models the traffic offloading policy optimization process as the process of solving the Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (DEC-POMDP) problem. The paper proposes a novel Differentiated Federated Soft Actor-Critic (DFSAC) algorithm to solve the problem. The DFSAC algorithm takes the network packet delay as the joint reward value and introduces the global trend model as the joint target action-value function of each agent to guide the update of each agent's policy. The simulation results demonstrate that the traffic offloading policy based on the DFSAC algorithm achieves better performance in terms of network throughput, packet loss rate, and packet delay compared to the traditional federated reinforcement learning approach and other baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Communications for Remote Inference under Two-Way Delay with Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11143v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the design of a goal-oriented sampling and scheduling strategy through a channel with highly variable two-way random delay, which can exhibit memory (e.g., Delay and Disruption Tolerant Networks). The objective of the communication is to optimize the performance of remote inference, where an inference algorithm (e.g., a trained neural network) on the receiver side predicts a time-varying target signal using the data samples transmitted by a sensor. Previous formulations to this problem either assumed a channel with IID transmission delay, neglecting feedback delay, or considered the monotonic relation that the performance only gets worse as the input information ages. We show how, with delayed feedback, one can effectively exploit the knowledge about delay memory through an index-based threshold policy. This policy minimizes the expected time-average inference error that can be monotone or non-monotone in age. The index function is expressed in terms of the Age of Information (AoI) on the receiver side and a parameter regarding the distribution of subsequent transmission delay, both of which can readily be tracked.</description>

      <title>Charting Censorship Resilience and Global Internet Reachability: A Quantitative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Internet censorship and global Internet reachability are prevalent topics of today's Internet. Nonetheless, the impact of network topology and Internet architecture to these aspects of the Internet is under-explored. With the goal of informing policy discussions with an objective basis, we present an approach for evaluating both censorship resilience and global Internet reachability using quantitative network metrics, which are applicable to current BGP/IP networks and also to alternative Internet network architectures. We devise and instantiate the metric on the network topology of multiple countries, comparing the BGP/IP network, an overlay network using a waypoint mechanism for circumventing undesired nodes, and the path-aware Internet architecture SCION. The novelty of the approach resides in providing a metric enabling the analysis of these aspects of the Internet at the routing level, taking into account the innate properties of the routing protocol and architecture. We demonstrate that the Internet topology matters, and strongly influences both censorship resilience and reachability to the global Internet. Finally, we argue that access to multiple paths accompanied with path-awareness could enable a higher level of censorship resilience compared to the current Internet, and reduce the centralization of Internet routing.</description>

      <title>User Connection and Resource Allocation Optimization in Blockchain Empowered Metaverse over 6G Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The convergence of blockchain, Metaverse, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) brings transformative digital opportunities alongside challenges like privacy and resource management. Addressing these, we focus on optimizing user connectivity and resource allocation in an NFT-centric and blockchain-enabled Metaverse in this paper. Through user work-offloading, we optimize data tasks, user connection parameters, and server computing frequency division. In the resource allocation phase, we optimize communication-computation resource distributions, including bandwidth, transmit power, and computing frequency. We introduce the trust-cost ratio (TCR), a pivotal measure combining trust scores from users' resources and server history with delay and energy costs. This balance ensures sustained user engagement and trust. The DASHF algorithm, central to our approach, encapsulates the Dinkelbach algorithm, alternating optimization, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), the Hungarian method, and a novel fractional programming technique from a recent IEEE JSAC paper [2]. The most challenging part of DASHF is to rewrite an optimization problem as Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming (QCQP) via carefully designed transformations, in order to be solved by SDR and the Hungarian algorithm. Extensive simulations validate the DASHF algorithm's efficacy, revealing critical insights for enhancing blockchain-Metaverse applications, especially with NFTs.</description>
