      <title>Optimizing Mirror-Image Peptide Sequence Design for Data Storage via Peptide Bond Cleavage Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional non-biological storage media, such as hard drives, face limitations in both storage density and lifespan due to the rapid growth of data in the big data era. Mirror-image peptides composed of D-amino acids have emerged as a promising biological storage medium due to their high storage density, structural stability, and long lifespan. The sequencing of mirror-image peptides relies on \textit{de-novo} technology. However, its accuracy is limited by the scarcity of tandem mass spectrometry datasets and the challenges that current algorithms encounter when processing these peptides directly. This study is the first to propose improving sequencing accuracy indirectly by optimizing the design of mirror-image peptide sequences. In this work, we introduce DBond, a deep neural network based model that integrates sequence features, precursor ion properties, and mass spectrometry environmental factors for the prediction of mirror-image peptide bond cleavage. In this process, sequences with a high peptide bond cleavage ratio, which are easy to sequence, are selected. The main contributions of this study are as follows. First, we constructed MiPD513, a tandem mass spectrometry dataset containing 513 mirror-image peptides. Second, we developed the peptide bond cleavage labeling algorithm (PBCLA), which generated approximately 12.5 million labeled data based on MiPD513. Third, we proposed a dual prediction strategy that combines multi-label and single-label classification. On an independent test set, the single-label classification strategy outperformed other methods in both single and multiple peptide bond cleavage prediction tasks, offering a strong foundation for sequence optimization.</description>

      <title>A Proposed Framework for Quantifying AI-to-Clinical Translation: The Algorithm-to-Outcome Concordance (AOC) Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: The rapid evolution of personalized neoantigen vaccines has been accelerated by artificial intelligence (AI)-based prediction models. Yet, a consistent framework to evaluate the translational fidelity between computational predictions and clinical outcomes remains lacking. Methods: This systematic synthesis analyzed six melanoma vaccine trials conducted between 2017 and 2025 across mRNA, peptide, and dendritic cell platforms. We introduced the Algorithm-to-Outcome Concordance (AOC) metric - a quantitative measure linking model performance (AUC) with clinical efficacy (HR/ORR) - and integrated mechanistic, economic, and regulatory perspectives. Results: Simulated AOC values across studies ranged from 0.42-0.79, suggesting heterogeneous concordance between algorithmic prediction and observed outcomes. High tumor mutational burden and clonal neoantigen dominance correlated with improved translational fidelity. Economic modeling suggested that achieving AOC &gt;0.7 could reduce ICER below $100,000/QALY. Conclusions: This framework quantitatively bridges AI-driven neoantigen prediction with clinical translation, offering a reproducible metric for future personalized vaccine validation and regulatory standardization. This study presents AOC as a hypothesis-generating tool, with all computations based on simulated or aggregated trial data for demonstration purposes only.</description>

      <title>InputDSA: Demixing then Comparing Recurrent and Externally Driven Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In control problems and basic scientific modeling, it is important to compare observations with dynamical simulations. For example, comparing two neural systems can shed light on the nature of emergent computations in the brain and deep neural networks. Recently, Ostrow et al. (2023) introduced Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA), a method to measure the similarity of two systems based on their recurrent dynamics rather than geometry or topology. However, DSA does not consider how inputs affect the dynamics, meaning that two similar systems, if driven differently, may be classified as different. Because real-world dynamical systems are rarely autonomous, it is important to account for the effects of input drive. To this end, we introduce a novel metric for comparing both intrinsic (recurrent) and input-driven dynamics, called InputDSA (iDSA). InputDSA extends the DSA framework by estimating and comparing both input and intrinsic dynamic operators using a variant of Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (DMDc) based on subspace identification. We demonstrate that InputDSA can successfully compare partially observed, input-driven systems from noisy data. We show that when the true inputs are unknown, surrogate inputs can be substituted without a major deterioration in similarity estimates. We apply InputDSA on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning, identifying that high-performing networks are dynamically similar to one another, while low-performing networks are more diverse. Lastly, we apply InputDSA to neural data recorded from rats performing a cognitive task, demonstrating that it identifies a transition from input-driven evidence accumulation to intrinsically-driven decision-making. Our work demonstrates that InputDSA is a robust and efficient method for comparing intrinsic dynamics and the effect of external input on dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Comorbid anxiety predicts lower odds of MDD improvement in a trial of smartphone-delivered interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11183v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Comorbid anxiety disorders are common among patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), but their impact on outcomes of digital and smartphone-delivered interventions is not well understood. This study is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled effectiveness trial (n=638) that assessed three smartphone-delivered interventions: Project EVO (a cognitive training app), iPST (a problem-solving therapy app), and Health Tips (an active control). We applied classical machine learning models (logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and k-nearest-neighbors) to identify baseline predictors of MDD improvement at 4 weeks after trial enrollment. Our analysis produced a decision tree model indicating that a baseline GAD-7 questionnaire score of 11 or higher, a threshold consistent with at least moderate anxiety, strongly predicts lower odds of MDD improvement in this trial. Our exploratory findings suggest that depressed individuals with comorbid anxiety have reduced odds of substantial improvement in the context of smartphone-delivered interventions, as the association was observed across all three intervention groups. Our work highlights a methodology that can identify interpretable clinical thresholds, which, if validated, could predict symptom trajectories and inform treatment selection and intensity.</description>

      <title>UniSite: The First Cross-Structure Dataset and Learning Framework for End-to-End Ligand Binding Site Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of ligand binding sites for proteins is a fundamental step in Structure-Based Drug Design. Despite notable advances in recent years, existing methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics are confronted with several key challenges: (1) current datasets and methods are centered on individual protein-ligand complexes and neglect that diverse binding sites may exist across multiple complexes of the same protein, introducing significant statistical bias; (2) ligand binding site detection is typically modeled as a discontinuous workflow, employing binary segmentation and subsequent clustering algorithms; (3) traditional evaluation metrics do not adequately reflect the actual performance of different binding site prediction methods. To address these issues, we first introduce UniSite-DS, the first UniProt (Unique Protein)-centric ligand binding site dataset, which contains 4.81 times more multi-site data and 2.08 times more overall data compared to the previously most widely used datasets. We then propose UniSite, the first end-to-end ligand binding site detection framework supervised by set prediction loss with bijective matching. In addition, we introduce Average Precision based on Intersection over Union (IoU) as a more accurate evaluation metric for ligand binding site prediction. Extensive experiments on UniSite-DS and several representative benchmark datasets demonstrate that IoU-based Average Precision provides a more accurate reflection of prediction quality, and that UniSite outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in ligand binding site detection. The dataset and codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/quanlin-wu/unisite.</description>

      <title>A Continuous and Interpretable Morphometric for Robust Quantification of Dynamic Biological Shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Push-Forward Signed Distance Morphometric (PF-SDM) for shape quantification in biomedical imaging. The PF-SDM compactly encodes geometric and topological properties of closed shapes, including their skeleton and symmetries. This provides robust and interpretable features for shape comparison and machine learning. The PF-SDM is mathematically smooth, providing access to gradients and differential-geometric quantities. It also extends to temporal dynamics and allows fusing spatial intensity distributions, such as genetic markers, with shape dynamics. We present the PF-SDM theory, benchmark it on synthetic data, and apply it to predicting body-axis formation in mouse gastruloids, outperforming a CNN baseline in both accuracy and speed.</description>

      <title>Linearized Optimal Transport for Analysis of High-Dimensional Point-Cloud and Single-Cell Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-cell technologies generate high-dimensional point clouds of cells, enabling detailed characterization of complex patient states and treatment responses. Yet each patient is represented by an irregular point cloud rather than a simple vector, making it difficult to directly quantify and compare biological differences between individuals. Nonlinear methods such as kernels and neural networks achieve predictive accuracy but act as black boxes, offering little biological interpretability.
  To address these limitations, we adapt the Linear Optimal Transport (LOT) framework to this setting, embedding irregular point clouds into a fixed-dimensional Euclidean space while preserving distributional structure. This embedding provides a principled linear representation that preserves optimal transport geometry while enabling downstream analysis. It also forms a registration between any two patients, enabling direct comparison of their cellular distributions. Within this space, LOT enables: (i) \textbf{accurate and interpretable classification} of COVID-19 patient states, where classifier weights map back to specific markers and spatial regions driving predictions; and (ii) \textbf{synthetic data generation} for patient-derived organoids, exploiting the linearity of the LOT embedding. LOT barycenters yield averaged cellular profiles representing combined conditions or samples, supporting drug interaction testing.
  Together, these results establish LOT as a unified framework that bridges predictive performance, interpretability, and generative modeling. By transforming heterogeneous point clouds into structured embeddings directly traceable to the original data, LOT opens new opportunities for understanding immune variation and treatment effects in high-dimensional biological systems.</description>

      <title>Integrating Genomics into Multimodal EHR Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative Electronic Health Record (EHR) foundation model that integrates Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) as a foundational data modality, moving beyond traditional EHR-only approaches to build more holistic health profiles. Leveraging the extensive and diverse data from the All of Us (AoU) Research Program, this multimodal framework aims to learn complex relationships between clinical data and genetic predispositions. The methodology extends advancements in generative AI to the EHR foundation model space, enhancing predictive capabilities and interpretability. Evaluation on AoU data demonstrates the model's predictive value for the onset of various conditions, particularly Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), and illustrates the interplay between PRS and EHR data. The work also explores transfer learning for custom classification tasks, showcasing the architecture's versatility and efficiency. This approach is pivotal for unlocking new insights into disease prediction, proactive health management, risk stratification, and personalized treatment strategies, laying the groundwork for more personalized, equitable, and actionable real-world evidence generation in healthcare.</description>
