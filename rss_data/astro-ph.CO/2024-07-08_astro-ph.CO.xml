      <title>No evidence for parity violation in BOSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have found evidence for parity violation in the BOSS spectroscopic galaxy survey, with statistical significance as high as $7\sigma$. These analyses assess the significance of the parity-odd four-point correlation function (4PCF) with a statistic called $\chi^2$. This statistic is biased if the parity-even eight-point correlation function (8PCF) of the data differs from the mock catalogs. We construct new statistics $\chi^2_\times$, $\chi^2_{\mathrm{null}}$ that separate the parity violation signal from the 8PCF bias term, allowing them to be jointly constrained. Applying these statistics to BOSS, we find that the parity violation signal ranges from $0$ to $2.5\sigma$ depending on analysis choices, whereas the 8PCF bias term is $\sim 6\sigma$. We conclude that there is no compelling evidence for parity violation in BOSS. Our new statistics can be used to search for parity violation in future surveys, such as DESI, without 8PCF biases.</description>

      <title>Inferring IGM parameters from the redshifted 21-cm Power Spectrum using Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high redshift 21-cm signal promises to be a crucial probe of the state of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Understanding the connection between the observed 21-cm power spectrum and the physical quantities intricately associated with the IGM is crucial to fully understand the evolution of our Universe. In this study, we develop an emulator using artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the 21-cm power spectrum from a given set of IGM properties, namely, the bubble size distribution and the volume averaged ionization fraction. This emulator is implemented within a standard Bayesian framework to constrain the IGM parameters from a given 21-cm power spectrum. We compare the performance of the Bayesian method to an alternate method using ANN to predict the IGM parameters from a given input power spectrum, and find that both methods yield similar levels of accuracy, while the ANN is significantly faster. We also use this ANN method of parameter estimation to predict the IGM parameters from a test set contaminated with noise levels expected from the SKA-LOW instrument after 1000 hours of observation. Finally, we train a separate ANN to predict the source parameters from the IGM parameters directly, at a redshift of $z=9.1$, demonstrating the possibility of a non-analytic inference of the source parameters from the IGM parameters for the first time. We achieve high accuracies, with R2-scores ranging between $0.898-0.978$ for the ANN emulator and between $0.966-0.986$ and $0.817-0.981$ for the predictions of IGM parameters from 21-cm power spectrum and source parameters from IGM parameters, respectively. The predictions of the IGM parameters from the Bayesian method incorporating the ANN emulator leads to tight constraints with error bars around $\pm{0.14}$ on the IGM parameters.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts and Artificial Neural Networks: a cosmological-model-independent estimation of the Hubble Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as powerful cosmological probes in recent years offering valuable insights into cosmic expansion. These predominantly extragalactic transients encode information on the expansion of the Universe through their dispersion measure, reflecting interactions with the intervening medium along the line of sight. In this study, we introduce a novel method for reconstructing the late-time cosmic expansion rate and estimating the Hubble constant, solely derived from FRBs measurements coupled with their redshift information while employing Artificial Neural Networks. Our approach yields a Hubble constant estimate of $H_0 = 67.3\pm6.6\rm \ km \ s^{-1} \ Mpc^{-1}$. With a dataset comprising 23 localised data points, we demonstrate a precision of $\sim10\%$. However, our forecasts using simulated datasets indicate that in the future it could be possible to achieve precision comparable to the SH0ES collaboration or the Planck satellite. Our findings underscore the potential of FRBs as alternative, independent tools for probing cosmic dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inflation as the leading paradigm depicting the very early universe physics could leave imprints on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Using currently available CMB observations, we give the first direct evidence of inflation. We discuss the theoretical implications of our results including the energy scale of inflation, inflaton field excursion, Hubble expansion rate during inflation, equation of state of inflation, primordial tensor non-Gaussianity, primordial tensor power spectrum, B-mode anisotropy and inflationary gravitational wave background.</description>

      <title>Projections of the uncertainty on the compact binary population background using popstock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has announced the detection of almost 100 binary black holes so far, which have been used in several studies to infer the features of the underlying binary black hole population. From these, it is possible to predict the overall gravitational-wave (GW) fractional energy density contributed by black holes throughout the Universe, and thus estimate the gravitational-wave background (GWB) spectrum emitted in the current GW detector band. These predictions are fundamental in our forecasts for background detection and characterization, with both present and future instruments. The uncertainties in the inferred population strongly impact the predicted energy spectrum, and in this paper we present a new, flexible method to quickly calculate the energy spectrum for varying black hole population features such as the mass spectrum and redshift distribution. We implement this method in an open-access package, popstock, and extensively test its capabilities. Using popstock, we investigate how uncertainties in these distributions impact our detection capabilities and present several caveats for background estimation. In particular, we find that the standard assumption that the background signal follows a 2/3 power-law at low frequencies is both waveform and mass-model dependent, and that the signal power-law is likely shallower than previously modelled, given the current waveform and population knowledge.</description>

      <title>Growth of matter perturbations in the Interacting Dark Energy/Dark Matter Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate two widely recognized Interacting Dark Energy(IDE) models and assess their compatibility with observational data, focusing on the growth rate of matter perturbations. We explore IDE models with different equations of state(EoS) parameters for Dark Energy (DE), including the CPL parameterization and a constant value for $w_{\mathrm{de}}$. To constrain the parameters of the IDE models using background data, we employ a Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) analysis. Our results show that both IDE-I and IDE-II models are Compatible with observational data, although with slight variations influenced by the homogeneity or clustering of DE. Following that, we investigate the growth of matter perturbations and perform a comprehensive statistical analysis utilizing both the background and growth rate data. The growth rate in IDE models exhibits deviations compared to the $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ model due to the impact of homogeneity or clustering of DE, as well as the selection of the EoS parameter. However, we find that the IDE models show good compatibility with the growth rate data. Furthermore, we explore how the clustering or homogeneity of DE and the selection of the EoS parameter affect the evolution of the relative difference in the growth rate of IDE models, $\Delta f$, in comparison to the $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ model. Lastly, we employ the AIC and BIC criteria to evaluate and identify the best model that is compatible with the observational data. The selection of the model depends on the homogeneity or clustering of DE, the EoS parameter, and the dataset used. Overall, the IDE-I and IDE-II models exhibit agreement with the data, with slight deviations depending on specific scenarios and parameters.</description>

      <title>NuSTAR as an Axion Helioscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter in the Universe is still an open question in astrophysics and cosmology. Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) offer a compelling solution, and traditionally ground-based experiments have eagerly, but to date unsuccessfully, searched for these hypothetical low-mass particles that are expected to be produced in large quantities in the strong electromagnetic fields in the interior of stars. This work offers a fresh look at axions and ALPs by leveraging their conversion into X-rays in the magnetic field of the Sun's atmosphere rather than a laboratory magnetic field. Unique data acquired with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) during the solar minimum in 2020 allows us to set stringent limits on the coupling of axions to photons using state-of-the-art magnetic field models of the solar atmosphere. We report pioneering limits on the axion-photon coupling strength of $6.9\times 10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at 95\% confidence level for axion masses $m_a \lesssim 2\times 10^{-7}$ eV, surpassing current ground-based searches and further probing unexplored regions of the axion-photon coupling parameter space up to axion masses of $m_a \lesssim 5\times 10^{-4}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voids are dominant features of the cosmic web. We revisit the cosmological information content of voids and connect void properties with the parameters of the background universe. We combine analytical results with a suite of large n-body realizations of large-scale structure in the quasilinear regime to measure the central density and radial outflow of voids. These properties, estimated from multiple voids that span a range of redshifts, provide estimates of the Hubble parameter, $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$. The analysis assumes access to the full phase-space distribution of mass within voids, a dataset that is not currently observable. The observable properties of the largest void in the universe may also test models. The suite of large n-body realizations enables construction of lightcones reaching $\sim$3,000 $h^{-1}$Mpc. Based on these lightcones, we show that large voids similar to those observed are expected in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model</description>

      <title>The negative BAO shift in the Ly$\alpha$ forest from cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first measurement of the Ly$\alpha$ forest BAO shift parameter from cosmological simulations. In particular, we generate a suite of $1000$ accurate effective field-level bias based Ly$\alpha$ forest simulations of volume $V=(1 \, h^{-1} \, {\rm Gpc})^3$ at $z=2$, both in real and redshift space, calibrated upon two fixed-and-paired cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. To measure the BAO, we stack the three-dimensional power spectra of the $1000$ different realizations, compute the average, and use a model accounting for a proper smooth-peak component decomposition of the power spectrum, to fit it via an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme estimating the covariance matrices directly from the simulations. We report the BAO shift parameters to be $\alpha=0.997^{+0.001}_{-0.001}$ and $\alpha=0.990^{+0.003}_{-0.003}$ in real and redshift space, respectively. We also measure the bias $b_{\rm lya}$ and the BAO broadening parameter $\Sigma_{\rm nl}$, finding $b_{\rm lya}=-0.1786^{+0.0001}_{-0.0001}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm nl}=3.87^{+0.20}_{-0.20}$ in real space, and $b_{\rm lya}=-0.073^{+0.005}_{-0.004}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm nl}=6.55^{+0.23}_{-0.22}$ in redshift space. Moreover, we measure the linear Kaiser factor $\beta_{\rm lya}=0.68^{+0.12}_{-0.09}$ from the isotropic redshift space fit. Overall, we find evidence for a negative shift of the BAO peak at the $\sim 3\sigma$ and $\sim 3.3\sigma$ level in real and redshift space, respectively. This result is qualitatively in agreement with measurements from other cosmological tracers in underdense regions, such as the cosmic void distribution. This work sets new important theoretical constraints, in the light of ongoing and upcoming Ly$\alpha$ forest spectroscopic surveys, such as DESI, PFS, and WEAVE-QSO.</description>

      <title>Constraints on self-interaction cross-sections of dark matter in universal bound states from direct detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lambda- Cold Dark Matter (LambdaCDM) has been successful at explaining the large-scale structures in the universe but faces severe issues on smaller scales when compared to observations. Introducing self-interactions between dark matter particles claims to provide a solution to the small-scale issues in the LambdaCDM simulations while being consistent with the observations at large scales. The existence of the energy region in which these self-interactions between dark matter particles come close to saturating the S-wave unitarity bound can result in the formation of dark matter bound states called darkonium. In this scenario, all the low energy scattering properties are determined by a single parameter, the inverse scattering length gamma. In this work, we set bounds on gamma by studying the impact of darkonium on the observations at direct detection experiments using data from CRESST-III and XENON1T. The exclusion limits on gamma are then subsequently converted to exclusion limits on the self-interaction cross-section and compared with the constraints from astrophysics and N-body simulations.</description>

      <title>Find the haystacks, then look for needles: The rate of strongly lensed transients in galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time delay between appearances of multiple images of a gravitationally lensed supernova (glSN) is sensitive to the Hubble constant, $H_0$. As well as time delays, a lensed host galaxy is needed to enable precise inference of $H_0$. In this work we investigate the connection between discoverable lensed transients and their host galaxies. We find that LSST will discover 88 glSNe per year, of which $54\%$ will also have a strongly lensed host. The rates can change by approximately 30 percent uncertainty depending primarily on the choice of unlensed SN population and uncertainties in the redshift evolution of the deflector population, but the fraction of glSNe with a lensed host is consistently around a half. LSST will discover 20 glSNe per year in systems that could plausibly have been identified by Euclid as galaxy-galaxy lenses before the discovery of the glSN. Such systems have preferentially longer time delays and therefore are well suited for cosmography. We define a golden sample of glSNe Ia with time delays over 10 days, image separations greater than 0.8 arcseconds, and a multiply imaged host. For this golden sample, we find $91\%$ occur in systems that should already be discoverable as galaxy-galaxy lenses in Euclid. For cosmology with glSNe, monitoring Euclid lenses is a plausible alternative to searching the entire LSST alert stream.</description>

      <title>Constraints on blue and red tilted primordial power spectra using dwarf galaxy properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the standard $\Lambda$+Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model is well tested on large scales, the primordial power spectrum may deviate from the $\Lambda$CDM spectrum on small scales due to specific dark matter properties or alternative inflationary models. These deviations affect the formation of dark matter structure, which subsequently leads to different observable properties of galaxies. In this work, we study the impact of a blue and red tilted power spectrum on the central density of dwarf galaxies. To do this, we model densities of dwarf galaxies using a combination of high-resolution numerical simulations and galaxy formation model. The model galaxies in $\Lambda$CDM are consistent with observations of 41 faint dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. The deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM power spectrum are constrained by the central matter densities of dwarf galaxies, which set stringent constraints on the possible small-scale tilt of the primordial power spectrum, improving on the current limits. Moreover, similar analysis can be applied to test any feature in the power spectrum at small scales between $k\sim 10-100$~Mpc$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Detecting the dark sector through scalar-induced gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of cosmological scalar perturbations in the case that the background radiation is weakly coupled to a light scalar field $\phi$. The light scalar $\phi$ is a homogeneous background field with a large initial value. In the radiation-dominated Universe, the coupling term introduces an effective mass to $\phi$ and the background ultra-relativistic particles. The oscillations of $\phi$ result in the periodic change of the equation of state parameter and the sound speed, which provides a novel mechanism to amplify subhorizon scalar perturbations through parametric resonance. The amplification of scalar perturbations leads to a stochastic gravitational-waves background~(SGWB) expected to be observed by multiband gravitational wave observers. The observation of the SGWB helps to determine the initial value of $\phi$ and the coupling strength of the interaction. This mechanism is generally applicable to the interactions that introduce an effective mass, and we take the interaction between $\phi$ and electrons as a concrete example to illustrate the result. We find that under the condition that the coupling coefficient $\lambda=10^{-16}$ and the initial value $\phi_i=10^{18}$ GeV, the resulting SGWB spectrum is expected to be observed by the future observers including LISA, $Taiji$, DECIGO and BBO.</description>

      <title>Exploring new physics in the late Universe's expansion through non-parametric inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate deviations from the Planck-$\Lambda$CDM model in the late universe ($z \lesssim 2.5$) using the Gaussian Processes method, with minimal assumptions. Our goal is to understand where exploring new physics in the late universe is most relevant. We analyze recent Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Type Ia Supernovae (SN), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data. By examining reconstructions of the dimensionless parameter $\delta(z)$, which measures deviations of the Hubble parameter from the Planck-$\Lambda$CDM predictions, we identify intriguing features at low ($z \lesssim 0.5$) and high ($z \gtrsim 2$) redshifts. Deviations from the Planck-$\Lambda$CDM model were not significant between $0.5\lesssim z \lesssim2$. Using the combined CC+SN+BAO dataset, we gain insights into dark energy (DE) dynamics, resembling characteristics of omnipotent DE, extending beyond quintessence and phantom models. DE exhibits n-quintessence traits for $z\gtrsim2$, transitioning with a singularity around $z\sim2$ to usual phantom traits in $1\lesssim z\lesssim2$. DE characteristics differ between scenarios ($H_0$-SH0ES and $H_0$-$\Lambda$\&amp;CMB), with $H_0$-SH0ES leaning towards phantom traits and $H_0$-$\Lambda$\&amp;CMB towards quintessence. We suggest exploring new physics at $z\lesssim0.5$ and $1.5\lesssim z\lesssim2.5$, particularly around $z = 2$, to understand cosmological tensions such as $H_0$ and $S_8$.</description>

      <title>2D BAO vs 3D BAO: solving the Hubble tension with alternative cosmological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordinary 3D Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data are model-dependent, requiring the assumption of a cosmological model to calculate comoving distances during data reduction. Throughout the present-day literature, the assumed model is $\Lambda$CDM. However, this assumption can be inadequate when analyzing alternative cosmologies, potentially biasing the Hubble constant ($H_0$) low, thus contributing to the Hubble tension. To address this issue, we use model-independent 2D BAO data and compare the results to those obtained using 3D BAO data. As a concrete example, we investigate the cosmological models provided by bimetric gravity, a modified theory of gravity that transitions from a negative cosmological constant in the early universe to a positive one in the late universe. By combining 2D BAO data with cosmic microwave background and type Ia supernovae data, we find that the inverse distance ladder in this theory yields a Hubble constant of $H_0 = (71.0 \pm 0.9) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, consistent with the SH0ES local distance ladder measurement of $H_0 = (73.0 \pm 1.0) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$. Replacing 2D BAO with 3D BAO results in $H_0 = (68.6 \pm 0.5) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ from the inverse distance ladder. We conclude that the choice of BAO data significantly impacts the Hubble tension, with ordinary 3D BAO data exacerbating the tension, while 2D BAO data provides results consistent with the local distance ladder.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from inflation in LISA: reconstruction pipeline and physics interpretation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various scenarios of cosmic inflation enhance the amplitude of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at frequencies detectable by the LISA detector. We develop tools for a template-based analysis of the SGWB and introduce a template databank to describe well-motivated signals from inflation, prototype their template-based searches, and forecast their reconstruction with LISA. Specifically, we classify seven templates based on their signal frequency shape, and we identify representative fundamental physics models leading to them. By running a template-based analysis, we forecast the accuracy with which LISA can reconstruct the template parameters of representative benchmark signals, with and without galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. We identify the parameter regions that can be probed by LISA within each template. Finally, we investigate how our signal reconstructions shed light on fundamental physics models of inflation: we discuss their impact for measurements of \emph{e.g.,} ~the couplings of inflationary axions to gauge fields; the graviton mass during inflation; the fluctuation seeds of primordial black holes; the consequences of excited states during inflation, and the presence of small-scale spectral features.</description>

      <title>Impact of LRG1 and LRG2 in DESI 2024 BAO data on dark energy evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) suggest a preference for a dynamic dark energy model over a cosmological constant. This conclusion emerges from the combination of DESI's BAO data with observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and various type Ia supernova (SN Ia) catalogues. The deviation observed in the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$) reflects a departure from the standard cosmological model. Testing this deviation involves examining the consistency between cosmological parameters derived from early and late-time observations. Specifically, we focus on the matter density parameter $\omega_m = \Omega_mh^2$ and introduce ${\rm ratio}(\omega_m)$ to assess consistency, which is defined as the ratio of $\omega_m$ values constrained by high and low-redshift measurements. This ratio serves as a metric for quantifying deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model. In this paper, we find that the DESI BAO+CMB yields ${\rm ratio}(\omega_m)=1.0171\pm0.0066$. Upon excluding the LRG1 and LRG2 data in DESI BAO, this ratio adjusts to ${\rm ratio}(\omega_m)=1.0100\pm0.0082$. This shift, corresponding to a change from $2.6\sigma$ to $1.2\sigma$, indicates that the deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model is predominantly driven by these two samples from the DESI BAO measurements. To substantiate this conclusion, we utilized two cosmological model-independent methods to reconstruct the cosmic expansion history. Both reconstructions of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ indicate that the evolving features of dark energy are determined by the combined LRG1 and LRG2 data. Therefore, different methods have reached the same conclusion, namely the importance of accurately measuring the BAO feature in LRG1 and LRG2 data.</description>

      <title>The ACCEL$^2$ project: simulating Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in large-volume hydrodynamical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological information is usually extracted from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest correlations using only either large-scale information interpreted through linear theory or using small-scale information interpreted by means of expensive hydrodynamical simulations. A complete cosmological interpretation of the 3D correlations at all measurable scales is challenged by the need of more realistic models including the complex growth of non-linear small scales that can only be studied within large hydrodynamical simulations. Past work were often limited by the trade off between the simulated cosmological volume and the resolution of the low-density intergalactic medium from which the Lyman-$\alpha$ signal originates. We conduct a suite of hydrodynamical simulations of the intergalactic medium, including one of the largest Lyman-$\alpha$ simulations ever performed in terms of volume (640 $h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$), alongside simulations in smaller volumes with resolutions up to 25 $h^{-1}\mathrm{kpc}$. We compare the 3D Lyman-$\alpha$ power spectra predicted by those simulations to different non-linear models. The inferred Lyman-$\alpha$ bias and RSD parameters, $b_\alpha$ and $\beta_\alpha$ are in remarkable agreement with those measured in SDSS and DESI data. We find that, contrary to intuition, the convergence of large-scale modes of the 3D Lyman-$\alpha$ power spectra, which determines $\beta_\alpha$, is primarily influenced by the resolution of the simulation box through mode coupling, rather than the box size itself. Finally, we study the BAO signal encoded in the 3D Lyman-$\alpha$ power spectra. For the first time with a hydrodynamical simulation, we clearly detect the BAO signal, however we only marginally detect its damping, associated with the non-linear growth of the structures.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope DR6 and DESI: Structure formation over cosmic time with a measurement of the cross-correlation of CMB Lensing and Luminous Red Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-significance cross-correlation of CMB lensing maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6) with spectroscopically calibrated luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We detect this cross-correlation at a significance of 38$\sigma$; combining our measurement with the Planck Public Release 4 (PR4) lensing map, we detect the cross-correlation at 50$\sigma$. Fitting this jointly with the galaxy auto-correlation power spectrum to break the galaxy bias degeneracy with $\sigma_8$, we perform a tomographic analysis in four LRG redshift bins spanning $0.4 \le z \le 1.0$ to constrain the amplitude of matter density fluctuations through the parameter combination $S_8^\times = \sigma_8 \left(\Omega_m / 0.3\right)^{0.4}$. Prior to unblinding, we confirm with extragalactic simulations that foreground biases are negligible and carry out a comprehensive suite of null and consistency tests. Using a hybrid effective field theory (HEFT) model that allows scales as small as $k_{\rm max}=0.6$ $h/{\rm Mpc}$, we obtain a 3.3% constraint on $S_8^\times = \sigma_8 \left(\Omega_m / 0.3\right)^{0.4} = 0.792^{+0.024}_{-0.028}$ from ACT data, as well as constraints on $S_8^\times(z)$ that probe structure formation over cosmic time. Our result is consistent with the early-universe extrapolation from primary CMB anisotropies measured by Planck PR4 within 1.2$\sigma$. Jointly fitting ACT and Planck lensing cross-correlations we obtain a 2.7% constraint of $S_8^\times = 0.776^{+0.019}_{-0.021}$, which is consistent with the Planck early-universe extrapolation within 2.1$\sigma$, with the lowest redshift bin showing the largest difference in mean. The latter may motivate further CMB lensing tomography analyses at $z&lt;0.6$ to assess the impact of potential systematics or the consistency of the $\Lambda$CDM model over cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints from the cross-correlation of DESI Luminous Red Galaxies with CMB lensing from Planck PR4 and ACT DR6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We infer the growth of large scale structure over the redshift range $0.4\lesssim z \lesssim 1$ from the cross-correlation of spectroscopically calibrated Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) selected from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) legacy imaging survey with CMB lensing maps reconstructed from the latest Planck and ACT data. We adopt a hybrid effective field theory (HEFT) model that robustly regulates the cosmological information obtainable from smaller scales, such that our cosmological constraints are reliably derived from the (predominantly) linear regime. We perform an extensive set of bandpower- and parameter-level systematics checks to ensure the robustness of our results and to characterize the uniformity of the LRG sample. We demonstrate that our results are stable to a wide range of modeling assumptions, finding excellent agreement with a linear theory analysis performed on a restricted range of scales. From a tomographic analysis of the four LRG photometric redshift bins we find that the rate of structure growth is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM with an overall amplitude that is $\simeq5-7\%$ lower than predicted by primary CMB measurements with modest $(\sim2\sigma)$ statistical significance. From the combined analysis of all four bins and their cross-correlations with Planck we obtain $S_8 = 0.765\pm0.023$, which is less discrepant with primary CMB measurements than previous DESI LRG cross Planck CMB lensing results. From the cross-correlation with ACT we obtain $S_8 = 0.790^{+0.024}_{-0.027}$, while when jointly analyzing Planck and ACT we find $S_8 = 0.775^{+0.019}_{-0.022}$ from our data alone and $\sigma_8 = 0.772^{+0.020}_{-0.023}$ with the addition of BAO data. These constraints are consistent with the latest Planck primary CMB analyses at the $\simeq 1.6-2.2\sigma$ level, and are in excellent agreement with galaxy lensing surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the consequences of the breaking of diffeomorphism (Diff) invariance in the electromagnetic sector. We consider the breaking of Diff symmetry down to the subgroup of transverse diffeomorphisms (TDiff) and analyse its impact on the generation and evolution of cosmic magnetic fields. We show that Diff breaking induces a breaking of conformal invariance that modifies the way in which magnetic fields evolve on super-Hubble scales. The effects of the highly conductive plasma in the evolution are also analysed. We obtain the magnetic power spectrum today and discuss the parameter regions that yield intergalactic magnetic fields compatible with current observations.</description>

      <title>COBRA: Optimal Factorization of Cosmological Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce COBRA (Cosmology with Optimally factorized Bases of Radial Approximants), a novel framework for rapid computation of large-scale structure observables. COBRA separates scale dependence from cosmological parameters in the linear matter power spectrum while also minimising the number of necessary basis terms $N_b$, thus enabling direct and efficient computation of derived and nonlinear observables. Moreover, the dependence on cosmological parameters is efficiently approximated using radial basis function interpolation. We apply our framework to decompose the linear matter power spectrum in the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario, as well as by adding curvature, dynamical dark energy and massive neutrinos, covering all redshifts relevant for Stage IV surveys. With only a dozen basis terms $N_b$, COBRA reproduces exact Boltzmann solver calculations to $\sim 0.1\%$ precision, which improves further to $0.02\%$ in the pure $\Lambda$CDM scenario. Using our decomposition, we recast the one-loop redshift space galaxy power spectrum in a separable minimal-basis form, enabling $\sim 4000$ model evaluations per second at $0.02\%$ precision on a single thread. This constitutes a considerable improvement over previously existing methods (e.g., FFTLog) opening a window for efficient computations of higher loop and higher order correlators involving multiple powers of the linear matter power spectra. The resulting factorisation can also be utilised in clustering, weak lensing and CMB analyses. Our implementation will be made public upon publication.</description>

      <title>Eigen-decomposition of Covariance matrices: An application to the BAO Linear Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature in the two-point correlation function (TPCF) of discrete tracers such as galaxies is an accurate standard ruler. The covariance matrix of the TPCF plays an important role in determining how the precision of this ruler depends on the number density and clustering strength of the tracers, as well as the survey volume. An eigen-decomposition of this matrix provides an objective way to separate the contributions of cosmic variance from those of shot-noise to the statistical uncertainties. For the signal-to-noise levels that are expected in ongoing and next-generation surveys, the cosmic variance eigen-modes dominate. These modes are smooth functions of scale, meaning that: they are insensitive to the modest changes in binning that are allowed if one wishes to resolve the BAO feature in the TPCF; they provide a good description of the correlated residuals which result from fitting smooth functional forms to the measured TPCF; they motivate a simple but accurate approximation for the uncertainty on the Linear Point (LP) estimate of the BAO distance scale. This approximation allows one to quantify the precision of the BAO distance scale estimate without having to generate a large ensemble of mock catalogs and explains why: the uncertainty on the LP does not depend on the functional form fitted to the TPCF or the binning used; the LP is more constraining than the peak or dip scales in the TPCF; the evolved TPCF is less constraining than the initial one, so that reconstruction schemes can yield significant gains in precision.</description>

      <title>A spectroscopic analysis of the ionizing photon production efficiency in JADES and CEERS: implications for the ionizing photon budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have used a combined sample of JADES and CEERS objects in order to constrain ionizing photon production efficiency ($\xi_{\rm ion}$) from JWST/NIRSpec and JWST/NIRCam data. We examine 163 objects at 1.06 &lt; z &lt; 6.71 with significant (3$\sigma$) spectroscopic detections of H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ in order to constrain intrinsic H$\alpha$ luminosities corrected from nebular dust attenuation via Balmer decrements. We constrain dust-corrected UV luminosities from best-fit spectral-energy distribution modeling. We find a sample median log$_{10}$($\xi{\rm ion,0}$/erg Hz$^{-1}$) = $25.29^{+0.29}_{-0.37}$, assuming f$_{\rm esc}$=0 for the escape fraction of Lyman continuum emission. We find significant correlation between $\xi_{\rm ion,0}$ and z, with 17 objects at z &gt; 4.64 having median log$_{10}$($\xi_{\rm ion,0}$/erg Hz$^{-1}$) = $25.38^{+0.38}){-0.38}$, with those below having log$_{10}$($\xi_{\rm ion,0}$/erg Hz$^{-1}$) = $25.24^{+0.30}_{-0.33}$. We also find significant, positive correlations between $\xi_{\rm ion,0}$ and LUV; W{\lambda}([O iii]); [O iii]{\lambda}5007/[O ii]{\lambda}{\lambda}3726, 3729; and inverse correlations with metallicity. In contrast with some previous results, we find no trends between $\xi_{\rm ion,0}$ and stellar mass, stellar dust attenuation, or UV slope. Applying a multivariate fit to $\xi_{\rm ion,0}$, z, and MUV to an empirically-motivated model of reionization, and folding in f$_{\rm esc}$ estimates from direct observations of the Lyman continuum at z ~ 3 from the Keck Lyman Continuum Spectroscopic survey, we find that the number of ionizing photons entering the IGM causes reionization to end at z ~ 5 - 7.</description>

      <title>From Inflation to Quintessence: a History of the Universe in String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a type IIB 4D string model with stabilised moduli which is able to describe the history of the universe from inflation to quintessence. The underlying Calabi-Yau volume is controlled by two moduli which are stabilised by perturbative effects. The lighter of them drives Fibre Inflation at a large energy scale. The two associated axions are ultra-light since they are lifted only at the non-perturbative level. The lighter of them can drive quintessence if its decay constant is large enough to prevent quantum diffusion during inflation from ruining the initial conditions. The right dark energy scale can be obtained via a large suppression from poly-instanton effects. The heavier axion gives a negligible contribution to dark matter since it starts oscillating after matter-radiation equality. If instead none of the two axions has a large decay constant, a mild alignment allows the lighter axion to drive quintessence, while the heavier can be at most a few percent of dark matter due to isocurvature and UV bounds. In both cases dark matter can also come from either primordial black holes or the QCD axion.</description>

      <title>An Update on the External Calibrator for Hydrogen Observatories (ECHO)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision measurements of the beam pattern response are needed to predict the response of a radio telescope. Mapping the beam of a low frequency radio array presents a unique challenge and science cases such as the observation of the 21\,cm line at high redshift have demanding requirements. Drone-based systems offer the unique potential for a measurement which is entirely under experimenter control, but progress has been paced by practical implementation challenges. Previously, a prototype drone system, called the External Calibrator for Hydrogen Observatories (ECHO), demonstrated good performance in making a complete hemispherical beam measurement. This paper reports updates to the system focusing on performance of a new drone platform, minimizing interference from the drone, and a new transmitter.</description>

      <title>Dark energy evolution from quantum gravity</title>

Abstract: If an ultraviolet fixed point renders quantum gravity renormalizable, the effective potential for a singlet scalar field -- the cosmon -- can be computed according to the corresponding scaling solution of the renormalization group equations. We associate the largest intrinsic mass scale generated by the flow away from the fixed point with the scale of present dark energy density. This results in a highly predictive scenario for the evolution of dynamical dark energy. It solves the cosmological constant problem dynamically, and may be called "quantum gravity quintessence". A first setting without quantum scale symmetry violation in the neutrino sector could explain the present amount of dark energy, but fails for the constraints on its time evolution. In contrast, a logarithmic scale symmetry violation in the beyond standard model sector responsible for the neutrino masses induces a non-vanishing cosmon-neutrino coupling in the Einstein frame. This yields a cosmology similar to growing neutrino quintessence, which could be compatible with present observation. The small number of unknown parameters turns the scaling solution for quantum gravity into a fundamental explanation of dynamical dark energy which can be falsified.</description>

      <title>Early Dark Energy During Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of an early dark energy component (EDE) present during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) on the elemental abundances of deuterium D/H, and helium $Y_p$, as well as the effective relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$. We consider a simple model of EDE that is constant up to a critical time. After this critical time, the EDE transitions into either a radiation component that interacts with the electromagnetic plasma, a dark radiation component that is uncoupled from the plasma, or kination that is also uncoupled. We use measured values of the abundances and $N_{\rm eff}$ as determined by CMB observations to establish limits on the input parameters of this EDE model. In addition, we explore how those parameters are correlated with BBN inputs; the baryon to photon ratio $\eta_b$, neutron lifetime $\tau_n$, and number of neutrinos $N_\nu$. Finally, we study whether this setup can alleviate the tension introduced by recent measurements of the primordial helium abundance.</description>

      <title>A universal scaling relation incorporating the cusp-to-core transition of dark matter haloes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark matter haloes associated with galaxies have hitherto established strong correlations within a range of observed parameters, known as scaling relations of dark matter haloes. The origin of these scaling relations still contains significant ambiguities and requires comprehensive exploration for complete understanding. Utilising the correlation between the concentration and mass of dark matter haloes inferred from cosmological $N$-body simulations based on the cold dark matter paradigm ($c$-$M$ relation), we derive theoretical scaling relations among other physical quantities such as the surface mass density, the maximum circular velocity, and the scale radius of the dark matter halo. By comparing theoretical and observed scaling relations at various mass scales, it is found that the scaling relations observed in dwarf galaxies and galaxies originate in the $c$-$M$ relation of the dark matter halo. We predict that this theoretical scaling relation is also established in galaxy clusters. Moreover, we propose a novel theoretical scaling relation that incorporates the effects of the cusp-to-core transition, which is supposed to occur in cold dark matter haloes. Our discussion concludes with the exploration of potential observational verification of the cusp-to-core transition process in dark matter haloes.</description>

      <title>A quantitative analysis of Gravitational Wave spectrum sourced from First-Order Chiral Phase Transition of QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological first-order chiral phase transition of QCD, and for the first time calculate its parameters which can fully determine the gravitational wave spectrum. With the state-of-the-art calculation from the functional QCD method, we found that the large chemical potential of QCD phase transition results in very weak and fast first-order phase transitions at the temperature lower than $\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ MeV. These results further suggest that the GW signals of NANOGrav are very unlikely sourced from the chiral phase transition of QCD.</description>

      <title>Signatures of dark and baryonic structures on weakly lensed gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing offers a powerful tool for exploring the matter distribution in the Universe. Thanks to their low frequencies and phase coherence, gravitational waves (GWs) allow for the observation of novel wave-optics features (WOFs) in lensing, inaccessible to electromagnetic signals. Combined with the existing accurate source models, lensed GWs can be used to infer the properties of gravitational lenses. The prospect is particularly compelling for space-borne detectors, where the high signal-to-noise ratio expected from massive black hole binary mergers allows WOFs to be distinguished deep into the weak lensing regime, drastically increasing the detection probability. Here, we investigate in detail the capacity of the LISA mission to detect WOFs caused by dark matter halos, galaxies and the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within them. We estimate the total optical depth to be $\lambda_{\rm tot} \sim 6 \times 10 ^{-3}$ for the loudest binaries of total mass $M_{\rm BBH} \sim 10^6 M_{\odot}$, with the dominant contribution coming from SMBHs. We also find that WOFs in low-mass binaries $M_{\rm BBH} \sim 10^4 M_{\odot}$ are more likely due to the central galaxies. Within our model of gravitational lenses, we predict $\mathcal{O}(0.1)-\mathcal{O}(1)$ weakly-lensed events to be detectable during the 5 years of LISA mission, depending on the source population models. We show that WOFs signatures are very sensitive to the properties of dark-matter halos with $M_{\rm vir}\in (10^6-10^8)M_\odot$: increasing the compactness parameter by $\sim 3$ in that range raises the detection rate by $\sim 26$. Additionally, we show that collective effects from the complex inner halo structure can further enhance detectability. This suggests that lensed GWs in LISA will be an excellent probe of dark-matter theories, baryonic and halo sub-structures.</description>

      <title>Precision cosmology with exact inhomogeneous solutions of General Relativity: the Szekeres models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exact Friedman solution to the field equations of General Relativity (GR) describing an homogeneous and isotropic universe together with its linear and higher-order perturbations are the theoretical roots of the current standard model of cosmology. However, despite its global successes, this standard model currently faces a number of tensions and anomalies, which occur mostly from a mismatch between early and late cosmic time region depictions. Actually, in the era of precision cosmology, the late inhomogeneities in the densities of the Universe components can no more be neglected. Moreover, since GR is fundamentally nonlinear, any linear perturbation theory is doomed to fail at reproducing precisely its features, while higher-order perturbed FLRW models cannot either claim the status of exact solution to Einstein's field equations. Fortunately, other GR solutions exist which are best suited for this purpose, e. g., exact inhomogeneous solutions able to represent a matter-cosmological constant dominated universe region. Among these, the Szekeres solution, which is devoid of any symmetry, appears as a proper tool for our purpose. Moreover, since these solutions possess the FLRW model as a homogeneous limit, they can be very smoothly matched to the standard representation at the inhomogeneity-homogeneity transition. In this paper, the Szekeres solution and its main interesting properties, as well as the equations needed to use this solution in a cosmological context are presented. Then the prospects for a broader use of its abilities are sketched out. In particular, the use of neural networks is proposed to allow, in the future, the fitting of the huge amount of data becoming available to constrain the arbitrary functions and the constant parameters characterizing the Szekeres model, running for representing our late Universe with an increased precision.</description>

      <title>On the overlap reduction function of pulsar timing array searches for gravitational waves in modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) searches for gravitational waves (GWs) aim to detect a characteristic correlation pattern in the timing residuals of galactic millisecond pulsars. This pattern is described by the PTA overlap reduction function (ORF) \Gamma_ab(\xi_ab), which is known as the Hellings--Downs (HD) curve in general relativity (GR). In theories of modified gravity, the HD curve often receives corrections. Assuming, e.g., a subluminal GW phase velocity, one finds a drastically enhanced ORF in the limit of small angular separations between pulsar a and pulsar b in the sky, \xi_ab --&gt; 0. In particular, working in harmonic space and performing an approximate resummation of all multipole contributions, the auto correlation coefficient \Gamma_aa seems to diverge. In this paper, we confirm that this divergence is unphysical and provide an exact and analytical expression for \Gamma_aa in dependence of the pulsar distance L_a and the GW phase velocity v_ph. In the GR limit and assuming a large pulsar distance, our expression reduces to \Gamma_aa = 1. In the case of subluminal phase velocity, we show that the regularization of the naive divergent result is a finite-distance effect, meaning that \Gamma_aa scales linearly with fL_a, where f is the GW frequency. For superluminal phase velocity (subluminal group velocity), which is relevant in the case of massive gravity, we correct an earlier analytical result for \Gamma_ab. Our results pave the way for fitting modified-gravity theories with nonstandard phase velocity to PTA data, which requires a proper understanding of the auto correlation coefficient \Gamma_aa.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current and future experiments observing the cosmic microwave background require a detailed understanding of optical performance at cryogenic temperatures. Pre-deployment analysis of optics can be performed in custom-engineered cryogenic test beds, such as Mod-Cam, a first light camera for the CCAT project. This work presents studies of the mechanical and thermal performance of CryoSim, a model of a generic cylindrical 4-K cryostat cooled with a commercial pulse tube cryocooler that can be used to characterise optical components and full reimaging optical systems. CryoSim is extensively parametrised, allowing the joint analysis and optimisation of mechanical and thermal performance via finite element methods. Results from this model are validated against measured cooldown data of the Mod-Cam cryostat. Due to the extensive parametrisation of the model, significant modifications of the cryostat geometry may be implemented to be representative of any system the scientific community may desire, and validation of thermal and mechanical performance can be carried out rapidly.</description>

      <title>On Direct Estimation of Density Parameters and Hubble Constant for $\Lambda$CDM Universe using Hubble Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.07099v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The set of cosmological density parameters ($\Omega_{0m}h_{0}^{2}$, $\Omega_{0k}h_{0}^{2}$, $\Omega_{0\Lambda}h_{0}^{2}$) and Hubble constant ($\hat{h}_{0}$) are useful for fundamental understanding of the universe from many perspectives. In this article, we propose a new procedure to estimate these parameters for $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) universe in the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) background. We generalize the two-point statistics first proposed by Sahni et al. (2008) to the three point case and estimate the parameters using currently available Hubble parameter ($H(z)$) values in the redshift range $0.07 \leq z \leq 2.36$ measured by differential age (DA) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) techniques. All the parameters are estimated assuming the general case of non-flat universe. Using both DA and BAO data we obtain $\Omega_{0m}h_{0}^{2}=0.1485 \pm 0.0065$, $\Omega_{0k}h_{0}^{2}=-0.0137 \pm 0.017$, $\Omega_{0\Lambda}h_{0}^{2}=0.3126 \pm 0.0145$ and $\hat{h}_{0}=0.6689 \pm 0.0021$. These results are in satisfactory agreement with the Planck results. An important advantage of our method is that to estimate the value of any one of the independent cosmological parameters one does not need to use the values for the rest of them. Each parameter is obtained solely from the measured values of Hubble parameters at different redshifts without any need to use values of other parameters. Such a method is expected to be less susceptible to the undesired effects of degeneracy issues between cosmological parameters during their estimations. Moreover, there is no requirement of assuming spatial flatness in our method.</description>

Abstract: Next generation surveys will provide us with an unprecedented number of detections of supernovae Type Ia and gravitational wave merger events. Cross-correlations of such objects offer novel and powerful insights into the large-scale distribution of matter in the universe. Both of these sources carry information on their luminosity distance, but remain uninformative about their redshifts; hence their clustering analyses and cross-correlations need to be carried out in luminosity distance space, as opposed to redshift space. In this paper, we calculate the full expression for the number count fluctuation in terms of a perturbation to the observed luminosity distance. We find the expression to differ significantly from the one commonly used in redshift space. Furthermore, we present a comparison of the number count angular power spectra between luminosity distance and redshift spaces. We see a wide divergence between the two at large scales, and we note that lensing is the main contribution to such differences. On such scales and at higher redshifts the difference between the angular power spectra in luminosity distance and redshift spaces can be roughly 50$\%$. We also investigate cross-correlating different redshift bins using different tracers, i.e. one in luminosity distance space and one in redshift, simulating the cross-correlation angular power spectrum between background gravitational waves/supernovae and foreground galaxies. Finally, we show that in a cosmic variance limited survey, the relativistic corrections to the density-only term ought to be included.</description>

Abstract: Third-generation gravitational wave (GW) observatories such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, together with the LSST survey at the Vera Rubin Observatory, will yield an abundance of extra-galactic transient objects. This opens the exciting possibility of using GW sources and Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa) as luminosity distance tracers of large-scale structure for the first time. The large volumes accessible to these surveys imply that we may need to include relativistic corrections, such as lensing and Doppler magnification. However, the amplitude of these effects depends on the magnification and evolution biases of the transient sources, which are not yet understood. In this paper we develop comprehensive frameworks to address and model these biases for both populations of transient objects; in particular, we define how to compute these biases for GW sources. We then analyse the impact of magnification and evolution biases on the relativistic corrections and on the angular power spectrum of these sources. We show that correct modelling and implementation of these biases is crucial for measuring the cross-correlations of transient sources at higher redshifts.</description>

Abstract: We employ Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) as a powerful statistical framework to address key cosmological questions about the universe's fundamental properties. We explore extensions beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, considering a varying curvature density parameter $\Omega_{\rm k}$, a spectral index $\mathrm{n}_{\rm s}=1$ and a varying $n_{\rm run}$, a constant dark energy equation of state (EOS) $w_0$CDM and a time-dependent one $w_0w_a$CDM. We also test cosmological data against a varying effective number of neutrino species $N_{\rm eff}$. Data from different combinations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the last Planck PR4 analysis, CMB lensing from Planck 2018, baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the Bicep-KECK 2018 results, are used. We find that the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is favoured when combining CMB data with CMB lensing, BAO and Bicep-KECK 2018 data against $K-\Lambda$CDM model $N_{\rm eff}-\Lambda$CDM with a probability $&gt; 80\%$. When investigating the dark energy EOS, we find that this dataset is not able to express a strong preference between the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and the constant dark energy EOS model $w_0$CDM, with an approximately split model posterior probability of $\approx 60\%:40\%$ in favour of $\Lambda$CDM, whereas the time-varying dark energy EOS model is ruled out. Finally, we find that the CMB data alone show a strong preference for a model that includes the running of the spectral index $n_{\rm run}$, with a probability $\approx 90\%$, when compared to the $n_{\rm s}=1$ model and the standard $\Lambda$CDM. Overall, we find that including the model uncertainty in the considered cases does not significantly impact the Hubble tension.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational capture of a stellar-mass object by a supermassive black hole represents a unique probe of warped spacetime. The small object, typically a stellar-mass black hole, describes a very large number of cycles before crossing the event horizon. Because of the mass difference, we call these captures extreme-mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Their merger event rate at the Galactic Centre is negligible, but the amount of time spent in the early inspiral is not. Early EMRIs (E-EMRIs) spend hundreds of thousands of years in band during this phase. At very early stages, the peak of the frequency will not change during an observational time. At later stages, it will change a bit and finally the EMRI explores a wide range of them when it is close to merger. We distinguish between "monocromatic" E-EMRIs, which do not change their (peak) frequency, oligochromatic E-EMRIs, which explore a short range and polychromatic ones, the EMRIs which have been discussed so far in the literature. We derive the number of E-EMRIs at the Galactic Centre, and their signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and perform a study of parameter extraction. We show that parameters such as the spin and the mass can be extracted with an error which can be as small as $10^{-11}$ and $10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}$. There are between hundreds and thousands of E-EMRIs in their monochromatic stage at the GC, and tens in their oligochromatic phase. The SNR ranges from a minimum of $10$ (larger likelihood) to a maximum of $10^6$ (smaller likelihood). Moreover, we derive the contribution signal corresponding to the incoherent sum of continuous with two representatives masses; $10\,M_{\odot}$ and $40\,M_{\odot}$ and show that their curves will cover a significant part of LISA's sensitivity curve. Depending on their level of circularisation, they might be detected as individual sources or form a foreground population.</description>

      <title>Improving SDSS cosmological constraints through $\beta$-skeleton weighted correlation functions</title>

Abstract: The $\beta$-skeleton approach can be conveniently utilized to construct the cosmic web based on the spatial geometry distribution of galaxies, particularly in sparse samples. This method plays a key role in establishing the three-dimensional structure of the Universe and serves as a tool for quantitatively characterizing the nature of the cosmic web. This study is the first application of $\beta$-skeleton information as weights in mark weighted correlation functions (MCFs), presenting a novel statistical measure. We have applied the $\beta$-skeleton approach to the CMASS NGC galaxy samples from SDSS BOSS DR12 in the redshift interval $0.45 \leq z \leq 0.55$. Additionally, we applied this approach to three COLA cosmological simulations with different settings ($\Omega_m=0.25, \Omega_m=0.31, \Omega_m=0.4$) for comparison. We measured three MCFs, each weighted by i) the number of neighboring galaxies around each galaxy, ii) the average distance of each galaxy from its surrounding neighbors, and iii) the reciprocal of the average distance of each galaxy from its surrounding neighbors. By comparing measurements and calculating corresponding $\chi^2$ statistics, we observe high sensitivity to the cosmological parameter $\Omega_m$ through a joint analysis of the two-point correlation and three MCFs.</description>

      <title>Testing the $\mathbf{\Lambda}$CDM Cosmological Model with Forthcoming Measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background with SPT-3G</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We forecast constraints on cosmological parameters enabled by three surveys conducted with SPT-3G, the third-generation camera on the South Pole Telescope. The surveys cover separate regions of 1500, 2650, and 6000 ${\rm deg}^{2}$ to different depths, in total observing 25% of the sky. These regions will be measured to white noise levels of roughly 2.5, 9, and 12 $\mu{\rm K-arcmin}$, respectively, in CMB temperature units at 150 GHz by the end of 2024. The survey also includes measurements at 95 and 220 GHz, which have noise levels a factor of ~1.2 and 3.5 times higher than 150 GHz, respectively, with each band having a polarization noise level ~$\sqrt{\text{2}}$ times higher than the temperature noise. We use a novel approach to obtain the covariance matrices for jointly and optimally estimated gravitational lensing potential bandpowers and unlensed CMB temperature and polarization bandpowers. We demonstrate the ability to test the $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ model via the consistency of cosmological parameters constrained independently from SPT-3G and Planck data, and consider the improvement in constraints on $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ extension parameters from a joint analysis of SPT-3G and Planck data. The $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ cosmological parameters are typically constrained with uncertainties up to ~2 times smaller with SPT-3G data, compared to Planck, with the two data sets measuring significantly different angular scales and polarization levels, providing additional tests of the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Scalar Field Dark Matter Around Charged Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the behavior of a massive scalar field dark matter scenarios in the large mass limit around a central Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole. This study is motivated by observations from the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration, which does not exclude the possibility of the existence of such black holes. Through these inquiries, we uncover that the electric charge may significantly impact the scalar field profile and the density profile in the vecinty of the black hole. For the maximum electric charge allowed by the constraints of the Event Horizon Telescope, the maximum accretion rate decreases by $\thicksim$ 50 \% compared to the Schwarszchild case for marginally bound orbits. The maximum accretion rate of the massive scalar field is approximately $\dot M_{\text{SFDM}} \thicksim 10^{-8} M_{\odot} \;\text{yr}^{-1}$, which is significantly lower than the typical baryonic accretion rate commonly found in the literature. This implies that the scalar cloud located at the center of galaxies may have survived untill present times.</description>

      <title>One-loop power spectrum in ultra slow-roll inflation and implications for primordial black hole dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the in-in formalism to address the question of whether the size of the one-loop spectrum of curvature fluctuations in ultra-slow-roll inflation models designed for producing a large population of primordial black holes implies a breakdown of perturbation theory. We consider a simplified piece-wise description of inflation, in which the ultra-slow-roll phase is preceded and followed by slow-roll phases linked by transitional periods. We work in the $\delta\phi$-gauge, including all relevant cubic and quartic interactions and the necessary counterterms to renormalize the ultraviolet divergences, regularized by a cutoff. The ratio of the one-loop to the tree-level contributions to the spectrum of curvature perturbations is controlled by the duration of the ultra-slow-roll phase and of the transitions. Our results indicate that perturbation theory does not necessarily break in well-known models proposed to account for all the dark matter in the form of primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Testing common approximations to predict the 21cm signal at the Epoch of Reionization and Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the 21cm signal from the epoch of reionization and cosmic dawn is a complex and challenging task. Various simplifying assumptions have been applied over the last decades to make the modeling more affordable. In this paper, we investigate the validity of several such assumptions, using a simulation suite consisting of three different astrophysical source models that agree with the current constraints on the reionization history and the UV luminosity function. We first show that the common assumption of a saturated spin temperature may lead to significant errors in the 21cm clustering signal over the full reionization period. The same is true for the assumption of a neutral universe during the cosmic dawn which may lead to significant deviation from the correct signal during the heating and the Lyman-$\alpha$ coupling period. Another popular simplifying assumption consists of predicting the global differential brightness temperature ($dT_b$) based on the average quantities of the reionization fraction, gas temperature, and Lyman-$\alpha$ coupling. We show that such an approach leads to a 10 percent deeper absorption signal compared to the results obtained by averaging the final $dT_b$-map. Finally, we investigate the simplifying method of breaking the 21cm clustering signal into different auto and cross components that are then solved assuming linearity. We show that even though the individual fields have a variance well below unity, they often cannot be treated perturbatively as the perturbations are strongly non-Gaussian. As a consequence, predictions based on the perturbative solution of individual auto and cross power spectra may lead to strongly biased results, even if higher-order terms are taken into account.</description>

      <title>TDCOSMO. XVI. Measurement of the Hubble Constant from the Lensed Quasar WGD$\,$2038$-$4008</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-delay cosmography is a powerful technique to constrain cosmological parameters, particularly the Hubble constant ($H_{0}$). The TDCOSMO collaboration is performing an ongoing analysis of lensed quasars to constrain cosmology using this method. In this work, we obtain constraints from the lensed quasar WGD 2038-4008 using new time-delay measurements and previous mass models by TDCOSMO. This is the first TDCOSMO lens to incorporate multiple lens modeling codes and the full time-delay covariance matrix into the cosmological inference. The models are fixed before the time delay is measured, and the analysis is performed blinded with respect to the cosmological parameters to prevent unconscious experimenter bias. We obtain $D_{\Delta t} = 1.68^{+0.40}_{-0.38}$ Gpc using two families of mass models, a power-law describing the total mass distribution, and a composite model of baryons and dark matter, although the composite model is disfavored due to kinematics constraints. In a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we constrain the Hubble constant to be $H_{0} = 65^{+23}_{-14}\, \rm km\ s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$. The dominant source of uncertainty comes from the time delays, due to the low variability of the quasar. Future long-term monitoring, especially in the era of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, could catch stronger quasar variability and further reduce the uncertainties. This system will be incorporated into an upcoming hierarchical analysis of the entire TDCOSMO sample, and improved time delays and spatially-resolved stellar kinematics could strengthen the constraints from this system in the future.</description>

Abstract: Halo core tracking is a novel concept designed to efficiently follow halo substructure in large simulations. We have recently developed this concept in gravity-only simulations to investigate the galaxy-halo connection in the context of empirical and semi-analytic models. Here, we incorporate information from hydrodynamics simulations, with an emphasis on establishing a connection between cores and galaxies. We compare cores across gravity-only, adiabatic hydrodynamics, and subgrid hydrodynamics simulations with the same initial phases. We demonstrate that cores are stable entities whose halo-centric radial profiles match across the simulations. We further develop a methodology that uses merging and infall mass cuts to group cores in the hydrodynamics simulation, creating on average, a one-to-one match to corresponding galaxies. We apply this methodology to cores from the gravity-only simulation, thus creating a proxy for galaxies which approximate the populations from the hydrodynamics simulation. Our results pave the way to incorporate inputs from smaller-scale hydrodynamics simulations directly into large-scale gravity-only runs in a principled manner.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference methodology to characterize the dust emissivity at far-infrared and submillimeter frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01062v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian inference method to characterise the dust emission properties using the well-known dust-HI correlation in the diffuse interstellar medium at Planck frequencies $\nu \ge 217$ GHz. We use the Galactic HI map from the Galactic All-Sky Survey (GASS) as a template to trace the Galactic dust emission. We jointly infer the pixel-dependent dust emissivity and the zero level present in the Planck intensity maps. We use the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo technique to sample the high dimensional parameter space ($D \sim 10^3$). We demonstrate that the methodology leads to unbiased recovery of dust emissivity per pixel and the zero level when applied to realistic Planck sky simulations over a 6300 deg$^2$ area around the Southern Galactic pole. As an application on data, we analyse the Planck intensity map at 353 GHz to jointly infer the pixel-dependent dust emissivity at Nside=32 resolution (1.8\deg\ pixel size) and the global offset. We find that the spatially varying dust emissivity has a mean of 0.031 MJysr$^{-1} (10^{20} \mathrm{cm^{-2}})^{-1}$ and $1\sigma$ standard deviation of 0.007 MJysr$^{-1} (10^{20} \mathrm{cm^{-2}})^{-1}$. The mean dust emissivity increases monotonically with increasing mean HI column density. We find that the inferred global offset is consistent with the expected level of Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) monopole added to the Planck data at 353 GHz. This method is useful in studying the line-of-sight variations of dust spectral energy distribution in the multi-phase interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Mass Measurement with Cosmic Gravitational Focusing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We thoroughly explore the cosmic gravitational focusing of cosmic neutrino fluid (C$\nu$F) by dark matter (DM) halo using both general relativity for a point source of gravitational potential and Boltzmann equations for continuous overdensities. Derived in the general way for both relativistic and non-relativistic neutrinos, our results show that the effect has fourth power dependence on the neutrino mass and temperature. With nonlinear mass dependence which is different from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large scale structure (LSS) observations, the cosmic gravitational focusing can provide an independent cosmological way of measuring the neutrino mass and ordering. We take DESI as an example to illustrate that the projected sensitivity as well as its synergy with existing terrestrial neutrino oscillation experiments and other cosmological observations can significantly improve the neutrino mass measurement.</description>
