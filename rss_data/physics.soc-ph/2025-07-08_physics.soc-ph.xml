      <title>Multi-polarization during the 9th European Parliament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brexit, a global pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and record inflation - few legislative bodies have faced such a cascade of shocks as the European Parliament did during its 9th term (2019-2024). Using the Bipartite Configuration Model and a set of network statistics, this research explores how multi-polarization was characterized during this term by constructing and analyzing co-voting networks across all legislative subjects and within specific legislative subjects. The results contest binary polarization narratives inherited from US/UK scholarship by uncovering a multi-polar landscape. In many legislative subjects, including "Community policies", "Internal market, single market", and "External relations of the Union", coalitions realign fluidly, forming several voting communities rather than a single left-right divide. Ideological affinity and group memberships, not nationality, emerge as the primary forces that bind or separate Members of the European Parliament, reaffirming the chamber's transnational character. Two quantitative patterns stand out. First, the Greens/EFA and The Left display the highest intragroup cohesion, while governing groups - EPP, S&amp;D, and Renew - often fracture into multiple, issue-driven alliances, suggesting declining centrist disciplines. Second, a distinct Eurosceptic versus Euroenthusiastic cleavage crystallizes in matters concerning the "State and evolution of the Union" subject, cutting across economic and social ideologies and hinting at a budding second dimension of parliamentary conflict. This research highlights how legislative consensus in the European Parliament will hinge on navigating a fluid, multi-polar, issue-driven alliance landscape rather than building stable grand coalitions.</description>

      <title>When Does Diversity Matter? A Unified Framework for Binary-Choice Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a modeling framework for binary-choice dynamics in which agents update their states using two mechanisms selected based on individual preference drawn from an arbitrary distribution. We compare annealed dynamics, where preferences change over time, and quenched dynamics, where they remain fixed. Our framework bridges gaps between existing models and provides a systematic approach to assess when individual-level diversity affects collective dynamics and when it can be effectively ignored. We identify a constraint on transition probabilities that makes annealed and quenched dynamics equivalent. We show that when this condition is satisfied, the quenched dynamics reduces to a one-dimensional system, ruling out oscillatory behavior that may otherwise emerge.</description>

      <title>Nested economies of scale in city mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A longstanding puzzle in urban science is whether there's an intrinsic match between human populations and the mass of their built environments. Previous findings have revealed various urban properties scaling nonlinearly with population, yet existing models of city built mass are still dominated by per-capita linear thinking. Our analysis of &gt;3,000 cities globally reveals universal sublinear scaling of city mass with population at both the city (\{beta}=0.90) and neighborhood levels ({\delta}=0.75). This means that larger cities and denser neighborhoods achieve economies of scale with less per-capita city mass. Our theoretical framework further shows that city-level scaling emerges naturally from within-city disparities. This multi-scale understanding redefines "over-built" and "under-built" conditions as deviations from expected scaling patterns, implying either excessive environmental impacts or inadequate living standards. Effective urban policy thus requires moving beyond simple per-capita assumptions, adopting scale-adjusted metrics and managing cities as nested, complex systems.</description>

      <title>Cost Functions in Economic Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Economic complexity algorithms, including the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) and Non-Homogeneous Economic Fitness and Complexity (NHEFC), have proven effective at capturing the intricate dynamics of economic systems. Here, we present a fundamental reinterpretation of these algorithms by reformulating them as optimization problems that minimize specific cost functions. We show that ECI computation is equivalent to finding eigenvectors of the network's transition matrix by minimizing the quadratic form associated with the network's Laplacian. For NHEFC, we derive a novel cost function that exploits the algorithm's intrinsic logarithmic structure and clarifies the role of its regularization parameter. Additionally, we establish the uniqueness of the NHEFC solution, providing theoretical foundations for its application. This optimization-based reformulation bridges economic complexity and established frameworks in spectral theory, network science, and optimization. The theoretical insights translate into practical computational advantages: we introduce a conservative, gradient-based update rule that substantially accelerates algorithmic convergence. Beyond advancing our theoretical understanding of economic complexity indicators, this work opens new pathways for algorithmic improvements and extends applicability to general network structures beyond traditional bipartite economic networks.</description>

      <title>Street design and driving behavior: evidence from a large-scale study in Milan, Amsterdam, and Dubai</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, cities have increasingly reduced speed limits from 50 km/h to 30 km/h to enhance road safety, reduce noise pollution, and promote sustainable modes of transportation. However, achieving compliance with these new limits remains a key challenge for urban planners. This study investigates drivers' compliance with the 30 km/h speed limit in Milan and examines how street characteristics influence driving behavior. Our findings suggest that the mere introduction of lower speed limits is not sufficient to reduce driving speeds effectively, highlighting the need to understand how street design can improve speed limit adherence. To comprehend this relationship, we apply computer vision-based semantic segmentation models to Google Street View images. A large-scale analysis reveals that narrower streets and densely built environments are associated with lower speeds, whereas roads with greater visibility and larger sky views encourage faster driving. To evaluate the influence of the local context on speeding behaviour, we apply the developed methodological framework to two additional cities: Amsterdam, which, similar to Milan, is a historic European city not originally developed for cars, and Dubai, which instead has developed in recent decades with a more car-centric design. The results of the analyses largely confirm the findings obtained in Milan, which demonstrates the broad applicability of the road design guidelines for driver speed compliance identified in this paper. Finally, we develop a machine learning model to predict driving speeds based on street characteristics. We showcase the model's predictive power by estimating the compliance with speed limits in Milan if the city were to adopt a 30 km/h speed limit city-wide. The tool provides actionable insights for urban planners, supporting the design of interventions to improve speed limit compliance.</description>

      <title>Context-sensitive norm enforcement reduces sanctioning costs in spatial public goods games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uniform punishment policies can sustain cooperation in social dilemmas but impose severe costs on enforcers, creating a second-order free-rider problem that undermines the very mechanism designed to prevent exploitation. We show that the remedy is not a harsher stick but a smarter one. In a four-strategy spatial public-goods game we pit conventional punishers, who levy a fixed fine, against norm-responsive punishers that double both fine and cost only when at least half of their current group already cooperates. Extensive large scale Monte Carlo simulations on lattices demonstrate that context-sensitive punishment achieves complete defector elimination at fine levels 15\% lower than uniform enforcement, despite identical marginal costs per sanctioning event. The efficiency gain emerges because norm-responsive punishers conserve resources in defector-dominated regions while concentrating intensified sanctions at cooperative-defector boundaries, creating self-reinforcing fronts that amplify the spread of prosocial behavior. These findings reveal that enforcement efficiency can be dramatically improved by targeting punishment at cooperative-defector interfaces rather than applying uniform sanctions, offering quantitative guidelines for designing adaptive regulatory mechanisms that maximize compliance while minimizing institutional costs.</description>

      <title>Causal Impacts of Protected Bike Lanes on Cycling Behavior with Demographic Disparities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cities around the world face significant barriers to grow urban cycling, including competing budgetary priorities and car-centric streets. Thus, when making decisions regarding the installation of bicycle infrastructure, it is crucial to understand if and to what extent different bicycle-lane types increase bicycle ridership. However, associations between bicycle infrastructure and bicycle ridership have primarily been studied in the context of individual lanes and corridors, or when analyzed at the scale of entire cities, generalized across different bike-lane types. Drawing upon 72 million bikeshare trips from Citi Bike in New York, we demonstrate that there is an approximately 18% increase in bikeshare trips at adjacent stations in the 12 months following the installation of protected bike lanes (those with a physical barrier between cyclists and automobile traffic) and a 14% increase associated with painted bike lanes (where a line of pavement marking is present) and `sharrows' (where a normal traffic lane is marked with a bike stencil). However, using a difference-in-differences analysis, we detect a causal effect on bikeshare ridership only following the installation of protected bike lanes, with an average monthly increase of 379 rides per station (p&lt;0.001). Despite this causal effect being pronounced among census block groups with higher percentages of older adults (688 rides per month per station, p&lt;0.001), the causal effect of protected bike lanes on bikeshare ridership is absent in census block groups where the percentage of Black residents is medium to high. Taken together, these findings indicate that planners must emphasize protected bike lanes to spur ridership, and simultaneously target policies and programming to communities of color, to ensure that such infrastructure makes urban cycling a viable option for all residents.</description>

      <title>What is emergence, after all?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The term emergence is increasingly used across scientific disciplines to describe phenomena that arise from interactions among a system's components but cannot be readily inferred by examining those components in isolation. While often invoked to explain higher-level behaviors, such as flocking, synchronization, or collective intelligence, the term is frequently used without precision, sometimes giving rise to ambiguity or even mystique. In this perspective paper, we clarify the scientific meaning of emergence as a measurable, physically grounded phenomenon. Through concrete examples, such as temperature, magnetism, and herd immunity in social networks, we review how collective behavior can arise from local interactions that are constrained by global boundaries. By disentangling emergence from vague overuse, we emphasize its role as a rigorous tool for understanding complex systems. Our goal is to show that emergence, when properly framed, offers not mysticism but insight.</description>

      <title>Structure and dynamics jointly stabilize the international trade hypergraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how fluctuations arise and spread in the international trade system can help assess the current state and guide future developments. We analyze the world trade data to investigate strong adverse fluctuations, characterized here as `collapsed trades' -- individual trades that experience significant declines in annual trade volume compared to the previous year. Adopting a hypergraph framework for a fine-scale trade-centric representation of international trade, we find that collapsed trades are clustered similar to infectious disease outbreaks in societies. Moreover, the portion of collapsed trades is found to be negatively correlated with trade volume. We develop a collapse propagation model, an epidemic-like model with a weight-dependent infection rate, that reproduces all the essential empirical features. Through both analytical and numerical analysis, we identify two key factors that synergistically suppress the onset of global collective collapse and serve as a joint stabilizing mechanism for the international economy: i) a positive correlation between a trade's degree (the number of adjacent trades) and its volume and ii) an algebraically decaying infection rate with trade volume. In particular, the second factor weakened during the 2008--2009 global economic recession, possibly explaining the broader spread of collapse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global landscape for quantum technologies (QTs) is rapidly changing, and proper understanding of their impact and subsequent regulations need to match this pace. A Responsible Innovation (RI) approach and guiding principles have been proposed to accompany this development. We examine practical efforts globally and in Canada, from industry to research to governments, and analyze the current status of quantum technological advances under the RI framework. We analyze and compare what is being done internationally, identify gaps in the Canadian strategy, propose initiatives to fill those gaps, and highlight areas where Canada is leading or where more work is needed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion over networks has recently been used to define spatiotemporal scales and extend Kadanoff block spins of Euclidean space to supernodes of networks in the Laplacian renormalization group (LRG). Yet, its ad hoc coarse-graining procedure remains underdeveloped and unvalidated, limiting its broader applicability. Here we rigorously formulate an LRG preserving the equilibrium state, offering a principled coarse-graining procedure. We construct the renormalized Laplacian matrix preserving dominant spectral properties using a proper, quasi-complete basis transformation and the renormalized adjacency matrix preserving mean connectivity from equilibrium-state flows among supernodes. Applying recursively this equilibrium-preserving LRG to various hypergraphs, we find that in hypertrees with low spectral dimensions vertex degree and hyperedge cardinality distributions flow toward Poissonian forms, while in hypergraphs lacking a finite spectral dimension they broaden toward power-law forms when starting from Poissonian ones, revealing how informational, structural, and dynamical scale-invariances are interrelated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous networked systems feature a structure of nontrivial communities, which often correspond to their functional modules. Such communities have been detected in real-world biological, social and technological systems, as well as in synthetic models thereof. While much effort has been devoted to developing methods for community detection in traditional networks, the study of community structure in networks with higher-order interactions is still not as extensively explored. In this article, we introduce a formalism for the hypermodularity of higher-order networks that allows us to use spectral methods to detect community structures in hypergraphs. We apply this approach to synthetic random networks as well as to real-world data, showing that it produces results that reflect the nature and the dynamics of the interactions modelled, thereby constituting a valuable tool for the extraction of hidden information from complex higher-order data sets.</description>

      <title>Optimal location of reinforced inertia to stabilize power grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of renewable energy sources has significantly reduced the inertia in the modernized power grid, making the system more vulnerable. One way to stabilize the grid is to add extra inertia from unused turbines, called the fast frequency response (FFR), to the existing grid. However, reinforcing inertia can cause unintended consequences, such as more significant avalanche failures. This phenomenon is known as the Braess paradox. Here, we propose a method to find the optimal position of FFR. This method is applied to the second-order Kuramoto model to find an effective position to mitigate cascading failures. To address this, we propose a method to evaluate a ratio between the positive effects of mitigation and the negative consequences. Through this analysis, we find that the peripheral area of the network is a seemingly effective location for inertia reinforcement across various reinforcement scales. This strategy provides essential insights for enhancing the stability of power grids in a time of widespread renewable energy usage.</description>

      <title>Walking Through Complex Spatial Patterns of Climate and Conflict-Induced Displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme weather events are projected to intensify global migration, increase resource competition, and amplify socio-spatial phenomena, including intergroup conflicts, socioeconomic inequalities, and unplanned displacements, among others. Addressing these challenges requires consolidating heterogeneous data to identify, estimate, and predict the dynamical process behind climate-induced movements. We propose a novel hybrid approach to reconstruct hazard-induced displacements by analysing the statistical properties of a diffusion process (walks) that explores the spatial network constructed from real displacements. The likely trajectories produced by the walks inform the typical journey of individuals, identifying potential hazards that may be encountered when fleeing high-risk areas. As a proof of concept, we apply this method to Somalia's detailed displacement tracking matrix, containing 20,220 movements dating from February 8 to June 18, 2025. We reconstruct the likely routes that displaced persons could have taken when fleeing areas affected by conflict or climate hazards. We find that individuals using the most likely paths based on current flows would experience mainly droughts and conflicts, while the latter becomes less prominent at every subsequent step. We also find that the probability of conflict and drought across all trajectories is widely dispersed, meaning that there is no typical exposure. This work provides an understanding of the mechanisms underlying displacement patterns and a framework for estimating future movements in areas expected to face increasing hazards.</description>

Abstract: How would admissions look like in a university program for influencers? In the realm of social network analysis, influence maximization and link prediction stand out as pivotal challenges. Influence maximization focuses on identifying a set of key nodes to maximize information dissemination, while link prediction aims to foresee potential connections within the network. These strategies, primarily deep learning link prediction methods and greedy algorithms, have been previously used in tandem to identify future influencers. However, given the complexity of these tasks, especially in large-scale networks, we propose an algorithm, The Social Sphere Model, which uniquely utilizes expected value in its future graph prediction and combines specifically path-based link prediction metrics and heuristic influence maximization strategies to effectively identify future vital nodes in weighted networks. Our approach is tested on two distinct contagion models, offering a promising solution with lower computational demands. This advancement not only enhances our understanding of network dynamics but also opens new avenues for efficient network management and influence strategy development.</description>

      <title>Competitive balance in the UEFA Champions League group stage: novel measures show no evidence of decline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19222</link>

Abstract: Competitive balance, which refers to the level of control teams have over a sports competition, is a crucial indicator for tournament organisers. According to previous studies, competitive balance has significantly declined in the UEFA Champions League group stage over the recent decades. Our paper introduces alternative indices to investigate this issue. Two ex ante measures are based on Elo ratings, and four dynamic concentration indicators compare the final group ranking to reasonable benchmarks. Using these indices, we find no evidence of any long-run trend in the competitive balance of the UEFA Champions League group stage between the 2003/04 and 2023/24 seasons.</description>

      <title>Investigating the diversity and stylization of contemporary user generated visual arts in the complexity entropy plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10356</link>

Abstract: The advent of computational and numerical methods in recent times has provided new avenues for analyzing art historiographical narratives and tracing the evolution of art styles therein. Here, we investigate an evolutionary process underpinning the emergence and stylization of contemporary user-generated visual art styles using the complexity-entropy (C-H) plane, which quantifies local structures in paintings. Informatizing 149,780 images curated in DeviantArt and Behance platforms from 2010 to 2020, we analyze the relationship between local information of the C-H space and multi-level image features generated by a deep neural network and a feature extraction algorithm. The results reveal significant statistical relationships between the C-H information of visual artistic styles and the dissimilarities of the multi-level image features over time within groups of artworks. By disclosing a particular C-H region where the diversity of image representations is noticeably manifested, our analyses reveal an empirical condition of emerging styles that are both novel in the C-H plane and characterized by greater stylistic diversity. Our research shows that visual art analyses combined with physics-inspired methodologies and machine learning, can provide macroscopic insights into quantitatively mapping relevant characteristics of an evolutionary process underpinning the creative stylization of uncharted visual arts of given groups and time.</description>

      <title>Cost of institutional incentives for promoting cooperation in $2\times2$ games and collective risk games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prosocial behaviours have been extensively studied across multiple disciplines. Cooperation, requiring a personal cost for collective benefits, is widespread in nature and human society, having been explained through mechanisms such as kin selection, direct and indirect reciprocity, and network reciprocity. Institutional incentives, which reward cooperation and punish anti-social behaviour, offer a promising approach to fostering cooperation in groups of self-interested individuals. Focusing on general $2\times2$ games and the collective risk game (which is a fundamental model for climate action), we analyse the associated cost of providing incentives under evolutionary dynamics governed by Fermi's rule, exploring the asymptotic behaviour of the incentive cost functons in the limits of neutral drift and strong selection. We also implement numerical simulations to study how parameters such as the intensity of selection affect the behaviour of the aforementioned cost functions.</description>
