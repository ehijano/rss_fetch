      <description>arXiv:2406.15645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When p is greater than 1, any left invariant Pfaffian forms on the simple Lie group SL(2p) are not contact forms. In this paper, we give a contact form on this Lie group which is invariant by the subgroup SO(2p).</description>

      <title>On the minimal number of closed geodesics on positively curved Finsler spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we proved that for every Finsler metric on $S^n$ $(n\ge 4)$ with reversibility $\lambda$ and flag curvature $K$ satisfying $(\frac{2n-3}{n-1})^2 (\frac{\lambda}{\lambda+1})^2&lt;K\le 1$ and $ \lambda&lt;\frac{n-1}{n-2} $, there exist at least $n$ prime closed geodesics on $(S^n,F)$, which solved a conjecture of Katok and Anosov for such positivley curved spheres when $n$ is even. Furthermore, if the number of closed geodesics on such positively curved Finsler $S^n$ is finite, then there exist at least $2\left[\frac{n}{2}\right]-1$ non-hyperbolic closed geodesics.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of convex hypersurfaces, Rigidity of convex hypersurfaces in multidimensional spaces of constant curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1972, E. P. Senkin generalized the celebrated theorem of A. V. Pogorelov on unique determination of compact convex surfaces by their intrinsic metrics in the Euclidean 3-space $E^3$ to higher dimensional Euclidean spaces $E^{n+1}$ under a mild assumption on the smoothness of the hypersurface. In this paper, we remove this assumption and thus establish this rigidity result for arbitrary compact, convex hypersurfaces in $E^{n+1}$, $n \ge 3$. We also prove the corresponding results in other model spaces of constant curvature.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the projection of the left-invariant sub-Riemannian structure on the 3D Heisenberg group $G$ to the Heisenberg 3D nil-manifold~$M$ -- the compact homogeneous space of $G$ by the discrete Heisenberg group.
  First we describe dynamical properties of the geodesic flow for $M$: periodic and dense orbits, and a dynamical characterization of the normal Hamiltonian flow of Pontryagin maximum principle. Then we obtain sharp twoside bounds of sub-Riemannian balls and distance in~$G$, and on this basis we estimate the cut time for sub-Riemannian geodesics in $M$.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of a Lorentzian Manifold with a semi-symmetric metric connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we characterize a Lorentzian manifold $\mathcal{M}$ with a semi-symmetric metric connection. At first, we consider a semi-symmetric metric connection whose curvature tensor vanishes and establish that if the associated vector field is a unit time-like torse-forming vector field, then $\mathcal{M}$ becomes a perfect fluid spacetime. Moreover, we prove that if $\mathcal{M}$ admits a semi-symmetric metric connection whose Ricci tensor is symmetric and torsion tensor is recurrent, then $\mathcal{M}$ represents a generalized Robertson-Walker spacetime. Also, we show that if the associated vector field of a semi-symmetric metric connection whose curvature tensor vanishes is a $f-$ Ric vector field, then the manifold is Einstein and if the associated vector field is a torqued vector field, then the manifold becomes a perfect fluid spacetime. Finally, we apply this connection to investigate Ricci solitons.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology of Triple Periodic Minimal Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triple periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) have garnered significant interest due to their structural efficiency and controllable geometry, making them suitable for a wide range of applications. This paper investigates the relationships between porosity and persistence entropy with the shape factor of TPMS. We propose conjectures suggesting that these relationships are polynomial in nature, derived through the application of machine learning techniques. This study exemplifies the integration of machine learning methodologies in pure mathematical research. Besides the conjectures, we provide the mathematical models that might have the potential implications for the design and modeling of TPMS structures in various practical applications.</description>

      <title>Foliation of area minimizing hypersurfaces in asymptotically flat manifolds and Schoen's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that any asymptotically flat manifold $(M^n, g)$ with $4\leq n\leq 7$ can be foliated by a family of area-minimizing hypersurfaces, each of which is asymptotic to Cartesian coordinate hyperplanes defined at an end of $(M^n, g)$. As an application of this foliation, we show that for any asymptotically flat manifold $(M^n, g)$ with $4\leq n\leq 7$, nonnegative scalar curvature and positive mass, the solution of free boundary problem for area-minimizing hypersurface in coordinate cylinder $C_{R_i}$ in $(M^n, g)$ either does not exist or drifts to infinity of $(M^n, g)$ as $R_i$ tends to infinity. Additionally, we introduce a concept of globally minimizing hypersurface in $(M^n, g)$, and verify a version of the Schoen Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Prescribed mean curvature problems on homogeneous vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a detailed and systematic study of weak (singular) Hermite-Einstein structures on homogeneous holomorphic vector bundles over rational homogeneous varieties. We use standard tools from spectral geometry, Harmonic analysis, and Cartan's highest weight theory to provide a sufficient condition in terms of Fourier series and intersection numbers under which an $L^{2}$-function can be realized as mean curvature of a singular Hermitian structure on an irreducible homogeneous holomorphic vector bundle. We prove that the condition provided is necessary and sufficient for functions that belong to certain interpolation spaces. In the particular case of line bundles over irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type, we describe explicitly in terms of representation theory the solutions of the underlying geometric PDE. Also, we establish a sufficient condition in terms of Fourier coefficients and intersection numbers for solvability and convergence of the weak Hermite-Einstein flow on irreducible homogeneous holomorphic vector bundles. As an application of our methods, we describe the first explicit examples in the literature of solutions to several geometric flows, including Donaldson's heat flow, Yang-Mills heat flow, and the gradient flow of Donaldson's Lagrangian, on line bundles over irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type. Additionally, we show that every polynomial central charge function gives rise to a weak Donaldson's Lagrangian $\mathcal{M}$. In the particular case of irreducible homogeneous holomorphic vector bundles, we prove that the gradient flow of $\mathcal{M}$ converges to a Hermitian structure which is, up to a gauge transformation, a $Z$-critical Hermitian structure in the large volume limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive decay estimates near isolated singularities of 3-dimensional (3d) Yang-Mills-Higgs fields defined on a fiber bundle, where the fiber space is a compact Riemannian manifold and the structure group is a connected compact Lie group. As an application, we obtain removable singularity theorems for 3d Yang-Mills-Higgs fields under different types of energy conditions, which generalizes classical removable singularity theorems for 3d Yang-Mills fields~\cite{S84,SS84} and 3d harmonic maps~\cite{L85}.</description>

      <title>Construction of gravitational instantons with non-maximal volume growth via codimension-1 collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct families of gravitational instantons of type ALG, ALG*, ALH and ALH* using a gluing construction. Away from a finite set of exceptional points, the metric collapses with bounded curvature to a quotient of $\mathbb{R}^3$ by $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and a lattice of rank one or two. Depending on whether the gravitational instantons are of type ALG/ALG* or ALH/ALH*, there are either two or four exceptional points respectively that are modelled on the Atiyah-Hitchin manifold. The other exceptional points are modelled on the Taub-NUT metric. There are at most four, respectively eight, of these points in each case.</description>

      <title>On the existence of conic Sasaki-Einstein metrics on log Fano Sasakian manifolds of dimension five</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the uniform L^{4}-bound of the transverse conic Ricci curvature along the conic Sasaki-Ricci flow on a compact transverse log Fano Sasakian manifold M of dimension five and the space of leaves of the characteristic foliation is not well-formed. Then we first show that any solution of the conic Sasaki-Ricci flow converges in the Cheeger-Gromov sense to the unique singular orbifold conic Sasaki-Ricci soliton on M_{infinite} which is a S^{1}-orbibundle over the unique singular conic Keahler-Ricci soliton on a log del Pezzo orbifold surface. As a consequence, there exists a Keahler-Ricci soliton orbifold metric on its leave space which is a log del Pezzo orbifold surface. Second, we show that the conic Sasaki-Ricci soliton is the conic Sasaki-Einstein if M is transverse log K-polystable. In summary, we have the existence theorems of orbifold Sasaki-Ricci solitons and Sasaki-Einstein metrics on a compact quasi-regular Sasakian manifold of dimension five.</description>

      <title>Structure of geodesics for Finsler metrics arising from Riemannian g.o. metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homogeneous geodesics of homogeneous Finsler metrics derived from two or more Riemannian geodesic orbit metrics are investigated. For a broad newly defined family of positively related Riemannian geodesic orbit metrics, geodesic lemma is proved and it is shown that the derived Finsler metrics have also geodesic orbit property. These Finsler metrics belong to the newly defined class of the $\alpha_i$-type metrics which includes in particular the $(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)$ metrics. Geodesic graph for the sphere ${\mathrm{S}}^7={\mathrm{Sp(2)}}{\mathrm{U}}(1)/{\mathrm{Sp(1)}{\mathrm{diag}}{\mathrm{U}}(1)}$ with geodesic orbit Finsler metrics of the new type $(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3)$, arising from two or more Riemannian geodesic orbit metrics, is analyzed in detail. This type of metrics on $S^7$ is one of the missing cases in a previously published classification of geodesic orbit metrics on spheres.</description>

      <title>Adjusted Connections I: Differential Cocycles for Principal Groupoid Bundles with Connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new perspective on principal bundles with connection as morphisms from the tangent bundle of the underlying manifold to a classifying dg-Lie groupoid. This groupoid can be identified with a lift of the inner homomorphisms groupoid arising in \v{S}evera's differentiation procedure of Lie quasi-groupoids. Our new perspective readily extends to principal groupoid bundles, but requires an adjustment, an additional datum familiar from higher gauge theory. The resulting adjusted connections naturally provide a global formulation of the kinematical data of curved Yang-Mills-Higgs theories as described by Kotov-Strobl (arXiv:1510.07654) and Fischer (arXiv:2104.02175).</description>

      <title>On Spectral Data for $(2,2)$ Berry Connections, Difference Equations &amp; Equivariant Quantum Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study supersymmetric Berry connections of 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs) quantized on a circle, which are periodic monopoles, with the aim to provide a fruitful physical arena for recent mathematical constructions related to the latter. These are difference modules encoding monopole solutions via a Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence established by Mochizuki. We demonstrate how the difference modules arise naturally by studying the ground states as the cohomology of a one-parameter family of supercharges. In particular, we show how they are related to one kind of monopole spectral data, a quantization of the Cherkis-Kapustin spectral curve, and relate them to the physics of the GLSM. By considering states generated by D-branes and leveraging the difference modules, we derive novel difference equations for brane amplitudes. We then show that in the conformal limit, these degenerate into novel difference equations for hemisphere partition functions, which are exactly calculable. When the GLSM flows to a nonlinear sigma model with K\"ahler target $X$, we show that the difference modules are related to the equivariant quantum cohomology of $X$.</description>

Abstract: Given a holomorphic Lie algebroid on an m-pointed Riemann surface, we define parabolic Lie algebroid connections on any parabolic vector bundle equipped with parabolic structure over the marked points. An analogue of the Atiyah exact sequence for parabolic Lie algebroids is constructed. For any Lie algebroid whose underlying holomorphic vector bundle is stable, we give a complete characterization of all the parabolic vector bundles that admit a parabolic Lie algebroid connection.</description>

      <title>Sharp local Bernstein estimates for Laplace eigenfunctions on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we focus on local growth properties of Laplace eigenfunctions on a compact Riemannian manifold. The principal theme is that a Laplace eigenfunction behaves locally as a polynomial function of degree proportional to the square root of the eigenvalue. In this direction, we notably prove sharp local Bernstein estimates, conjectured by Donnelly and Fefferman in 1990.</description>

      <title>Pseudo generalized Ricci-recurrent spacetimes with certain applications to modified gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we introduce and characterize a pseudo generalized Ricci-recurrent spacetimes. At first, we produce an example to justify the existence of such a spacetime. Then, it is provided that a pseudo generalized Ricci-recurrent generalized Robertson-Walker spacetime represents a perfect fluid spacetime and a pseudo generalized Ricci-recurrent perfect fluid spacetime represents either a dark energy epoch of the Universe or, the velocity vector field is parallel, conservative, acceleration-free, vorticity-free, and shear-free and becomes a static spacetime. Lastly, we study the impact of this spacetime under $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity scenario and deduce several energy conditions.</description>

      <title>Tumbling Downhill along a Given Curve</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cylinder will roll down an inclined plane in a straight line. A cone will roll around a circle on that plane and then will stop rolling. We ask the inverse question: For which curves drawn on the inclined plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ can one carve a shape that will roll downhill following precisely this prescribed curve and its translationally repeated copies? This simple question has a solution essentially always, but it turns out that for most curves, the shape will return to its initial orientation only after crossing a few copies of the curve - most often two copies will suffice, but some curves require an arbitrarily large number of copies.</description>

Abstract: This paper is the second in a series of works dedicated to studying non-linear partial differential equations via derived geometric methods. We study a natural derived enhancement of the de Rham complex of a non-linear PDE via algebro-geometric techniques and examine its consequences for the functional differential calculus on the space of solutions. Applications to the BV-formalism with and without boundary conditions are discussed.</description>

      <title>The Surface Signature and Rough Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallel transport, or path development, provides a rich characterization of paths which preserves the underlying algebraic structure of concatenation. The path signature is universal among such maps: any (translation-invariant) parallel transport factors uniquely through the path signature. Furthermore, the path signature is a central object in the theory of rough paths, which provides an integration theory for highly irregular paths. A fundamental result is Lyons' extension theorem, which allows us to compute the signature of rough paths, and in turn provides a way to compute parallel transport of arbitrarily irregular paths. In this article, we consider the notion of surface holonomy, a generalization of parallel transport to the higher dimensional setting of surfaces parametrized by rectangular domains, which preserves the higher algebraic structures of horizontal and vertical concatenation. Building on work of Kapranov, we introduce the surface signature, which is universal among surface holonomy maps with respect to continuous 2-connections. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of a rough surface and prove a surface extension theorem, which allows us to compute the signature of rough surfaces. By exploiting the universal property of the surface signature, this provides a method to compute the surface holonomy of arbitrarily irregular surfaces.</description>

      <title>Exploring a Modification of $d_p$ Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13450v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the work by M. C. Lee, A. Naber, and R. Neumayer a beautiful $\varepsilon$-regularity theorem is proved under small negative scalar curvature and entropy bounds. In that paper, the $d_p$ distance for Riemannian manifolds is introduced and the quantitative stability results are given in terms of this notion of distance, with important examples showing why other existing notions of convergence are not adequate in their setting. Due to the presence of an entropy bound, the possibility of long, thin splines forming along a sequence of Riemannian manifolds whose scalar curvature is becoming almost positive is ruled out. It is important to rule out such examples since the $d_p$ distance is not well behaved in the presences of splines that persist in the limit. Since there are many geometric stability conjectures where we want to allow for the presence of splines that persist in the limit, it is crucial to be able to modify the $d_p$ distance to retain its positive qualities and prevent it from being sensitive to splines. In this paper we explore one such modification of the $d_p$ distance and give a theorem which allows one to estimate the modified $d_p$ distance, which we expect to be useful in practice.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this article is to explore the Clairaut anti-invariant Riemannian maps from/to K\"ahler manifolds admitting Ricci solitons. We find the curvature relations and calculate the Ricci tensor under different conditions. We discuss the condition under which range space becomes $\alpha$-Ricci soliton. We obtain conditions for the range and kernel spaces of these maps to be Einstein. Next, we find the scalar curvature for range space. Further, we give the relation between Ricci curvature and Lie derivative under these maps. Moreover, we find the condition for a vertical potential vector field on target manifold to be conformal vector field on range space of these maps. Finally, we give non-trivial examples of such maps.</description>

Abstract: We investigate vertices for plane curves with singular points. As plane curves with singular points, we consider Legendre curves (respectively, Legendre immersions) in the unit tangent bundle over the Euclidean plane and frontals (respectively, fronts) in the Euclidean plane. We define a vertex using evolutes of frontals. After that we define a vertex of a frontal in the general case. It is also known that the four vertex theorem does not hold for simple closed fronts. We give conditions under which a frontal has a vertex and the four vertex theorem holds for closed frontals. We also give examples and counter examples of the four vertex theorem.</description>

      <title>Bertrand types of regular curves and Bertrand framed curves in the Euclidean 3-space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Bertrand (respectively, Mannheim) curve is a space curve whose principal normal line is the same as the principal normal (respectively, bi-normal) line of another curve. By definition, another curve is a parallel curve with respect to the direction of the principal normal vector. In this paper, we consider the other cases, that is, a space curve whose tangent (or, principal normal, bi-normal) line is the same as the tangent (or, principal normal, bi-normal) line of another curve, respectively. We say that a Bertrand type curve if there exists such another curve. We clarify that the existence conditions of Bertrand type curves in all cases. There are times when the Bertrand type curve does not exist. On the other hand, since the another curve may have singular points, we also consider curves with singular points. As smooth curves with singular points, it is useful to use the framed curves in the Euclidean space. Then we define and investigate Bertrand framed curves. We also clarify that the existence conditions of the Bertrand framed curves in all cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that for any asymptotically conical self-shrinker, there exists an embedded closed hypersurface such that the mean curvature flow starting from it develops a singularity modeled on the given shrinker. The main technique is the Wa\.zewski box argument, used by Stolarski in the proof of the corresponding theorem in the Ricci flow case. As a corollary, our construction, combined with the works of Angenent-Ilmanen-Vel\'azquez and Chodosh-Daniels-Holgate-Schulze, implies the existence of fattening level set flows starting from smooth embedded closed hypersurfaces. This addresses a question posed by Evans-Spruck and De Giorgi.</description>

Abstract: In [5], Connes and Chamseddine defined a Hochschild cocycle in the general framework of noncommutative geometry. They computed this Hochschild cocycle for the Dirac operator on 4-dimensioanl manifolds. We propose a way to study the Connes-Chamseddine Hochschild cocycle from the viewpoint of the noncommutative integral on 6-dimensional manifolds in this paper. We compute several interesting noncommutative integral defined in [8] by the normal coodinated way on n-dimensional manifolds. As a corollary, the Connes-Chamseddine Hochschild cocycle on 6-dimensional manifolds is obtained.</description>

Abstract: We study the evolution of curves with fixed length and clamped boundary conditions moving by the negative $L^2$-gradient flow of the elastic energy. For any initial curve lying merely in the energy space we show existence and parabolic smoothing of the solution. Applying previous results on long time existence and proving a constrained Lojasiewicz-Simon gradient inequality we furthermore show convergence to a critical point as time tends to infinity.</description>

Abstract: In arXiv:2404.19088, we initiated a program linking birational invariants with smooth ones and offering new interpretations of classical invariants, such as the Kervaire-Milnor invariants. Here, we rely on the profound geometric reasoning provided by Lupercio and Uribe in the early 00s to establish a connection between Chen-Ruan cohomology and several $G$-birational invariants introduced in the pioneering works Kontsevich, Kresch, Pestun, Tschinkel, along with presenting applications. Combined with the theory of atoms by Katzarkov, Kontsevich, Pantev, and Yu, the proposal in this paper program will lead to a theory of equivariant atoms.</description>
