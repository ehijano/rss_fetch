      <title>A verified implementation of the Misra and Gries edge coloring algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vizing's theorem states that every simple undirected graph can be edge-colored using fewer than $\Delta + 1$ colors, where $\Delta$ is the graph's maximum degree. The original proof was given through a polynomial-time algorithmic procedure that iteratively extends a partial coloring until it becomes complete. In this work, I used the Lean theorem prover to produce a verified implementation of the Misra and Gries edge-coloring algorithm, a modified version of Vizing's original method. The focus is on building libraries for relevant mathematical objects and rigorously maintaining required invariants.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Service Subscription and Adaptive Offloading Control in Vehicular Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the computational efficiency and service quality in intelligent transportation systems by enabling vehicles to wirelessly offload computation-intensive tasks to nearby Roadside Units. However, efficient task offloading and resource allocation for time-critical applications in VEC remain challenging due to constrained network bandwidth and computational resources, stringent task deadlines, and rapidly changing network conditions. To address these challenges, we formulate a Deadline-Constrained Task Offloading and Resource Allocation Problem (DOAP), denoted as $\mathbf{P}$, in VEC with both bandwidth and computational resource constraints, aiming to maximize the total vehicle utility. To solve $\mathbf{P}$, we propose $\mathtt{SARound}$, an approximation algorithm based on Linear Program rounding and local-ratio techniques, that improves the best-known approximation ratio for DOAP from $\frac{1}{6}$ to $\frac{1}{4}$. Additionally, we design an online service subscription and offloading control framework to address the challenges of short task deadlines and rapidly changing wireless network conditions. To validate our approach, we develop a comprehensive VEC simulator, VecSim, using the open-source simulation libraries OMNeT++ and Simu5G. VecSim integrates our designed framework to manage the full life-cycle of real-time vehicular tasks. Experimental results, based on profiled object detection applications and real-world taxi trace data, show that $\mathtt{SARound}$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under varying network conditions while maintaining runtime efficiency.</description>

      <title>Efficient Local and Tabu Search Strategies for Large-Scale Quadratic Integer Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the area of general quadratic integer programming (QIP), encompassing both unconstrained (UQIP) and constrained (CQIP) variants. These NP-hard problems have far-reaching applications, yet the non-convex cases have received limited attention in the literature. To address this gap, we introduce a closed-form formula for single-variable changes, establishing novel necessary and sufficient conditions for 1-Opt local improvement in UQIP and CQIP. We develop a simple local and sophisticated tabu search with an oscillation strategy tailored for large-scale problems. Experimental results on instances with up to 8000 variables demonstrate the efficiency of these strategies, producing high-quality solutions within a short time. Our approaches significantly outperform the Gurobi 11.0.2 solver.</description>

      <title>Magic Gems: A Polyhedral Framework for Magic Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Magic Gems, a geometric representation of magic squares as three-dimensional polyhedra. By mapping an n times n magic square onto a centered coordinate grid with cell values as vertical displacements, we construct a point cloud whose convex hull defines the Magic Gem. Building on prior work connecting magic squares to physical properties such as moment of inertia, this construction reveals an explicit statistical structure: we show that magic squares have vanishing covariances between position and value. We develop a covariance energy functional (the sum of squared covariances with individual row, column, and diagonal indicator variables) and prove that for all orders of n greater than or equal to three, an arrangement is a magic square if and only if this complete energy vanishes. This characterization transforms the classical line-sum definition into a statistical orthogonality condition. We also study a simpler low-mode relaxation using only four aggregate position indicators; this coincides with the complete characterization for n equals three (verified exhaustively) but defines a strictly larger class for n greater than or equal to four (explicit counterexamples computed). Perturbation analysis demonstrates that magic squares are isolated local minima in the energy landscape. The representation is invariant under dihedral symmetry D4, yielding canonical geometric objects for equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>Vertex-edge domination on subclasses of bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a simple undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, the open neighbourhood of a vertex $v \in V$ is defined as $N_G(v) = \{u \in V \mid uv \in E\}$, and the closed neighbourhood as $N_G[v] = N_G(v) \cup \{v\}$. A subset $D \subseteq V$ is called a vertex-edge dominating set if, for every edge $uv \in E$, at least one vertex from $D$ appears in $N_G[u] \cup N_G[v]$; that is, $\vert (N_G[u] \cup N_G[v]) \cap D\vert \geq 1$. Intuitively, a vertex-edge dominating set ensures that every edge, as well as all edges incident to either of its endpoints, is dominated by at least one vertex from the set. The \textsc{Min-VEDS} problem asks for a vertex-edge dominating set of minimum size in a given graph. This problem is known to be NP-complete even for bipartite graphs. In this paper, we strengthen this hardness result by proving that the problem remains NP-complete for two specific subclasses of bipartite graphs: star-convex and comb-convex bipartite graphs. For a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, it is known that the \textsc{Min-VEDS} problem cannot be approximated within a factor of $(1 - \epsilon)\ln |V|$ for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, unless $\text{NP} \subseteq \text{DTIME}(|V|^{O(\log \log |V|)})$. We also prove that this inapproximability result holds even for star-convex and comb-convex bipartite graphs. On the positive side, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a minimum vertex-edge dominating set in convex bipartite graphs. A polynomial-time algorithm for this graph class was also proposed by B{\"u}y{\"u}k{\c{c}}olak et al.~\cite{buyukccolak2025linear}, but we show that their algorithm has certain flaws by providing instances where it fails to produce an optimal solution. We address this issue by presenting a modified algorithm that correctly computes an optimal solution.</description>
