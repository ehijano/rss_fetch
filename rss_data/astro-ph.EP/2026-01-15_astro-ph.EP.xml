      <title>Origin of asteroid (469219) Kamo`oalewa: the main asteroid belt or the Giordano Bruno crater on the Moon?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroid Kamo`oalewa is the target of the Tianwen-2 sample-return mission by CNSA. Because of its orbit and its spectral properties, it was proposed that Kamo`oalewa originated from the Moon as impact ejecta, possibly from the Giordano Bruno crater. We aim at estimating the relative contribution of Kamo`oalewa-like objects originating from the general near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population which originated in the main asteroid belt, and compare it with the relative contribution of Giordano Bruno ejecta. We first estimate the average fraction of quasi-satellite orbits at any given time. By using recently developed NEA population models, we extract the expected number of Earth co-orbitals of the same size of Kamo`oalewa, and then get an estimate of the average number of Kamo`oalewa-like objects using the fraction computed before. Similarly, we obtain an estimate for the number of Kamo`oalewa-like objects that may originate as ejecta from the Giordano Bruno impact. We also performed survey simulations to estimate their efficiency in the detection of Kamo`oalewa-like objects. We found that the main belt accounts for 1.23 \pm 0.13 Kamo`oalewa-like objects on average. The expected number of Kamo`oalewa-like objects originated as Giordano Bruno ejecta is 0.042, which is more than order of magnitude smaller. We found a discovery efficiency of Earth quasi-satellites between 95% and 70% for absolute magnitude between 22 and 25 for the Pan-STARRS survey, and population models show that this is in agreement with the known population. The Vera Rubin Observatory should reach an efficiency of 92% down to absolute magnitude 25. These estimates show that population models of NEAs are capable to account for Kamo`oalewa-like objects, thus supporting the hypothesis that that Kamo'oalewa originated from the main belt. This will be further investigated by the in-situ exploration of the Tianwen-2 mission.</description>

      <title>Can photoevaporation open gaps in protoplanetary discs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether photoevaporation alone can open and sustain gaps in protoplanetary discs by coupling the evolving disc structure with the photoevaporative flow in two dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations. Our results show that once a density depression forms, the local mass-loss rate decreases sharply, suppressing further gap deepening. Viscous inflow and radial mass transport along the disc surface act to partially refill the depleted region, preventing complete clearing. The resulting configuration is a persistent, partially depleted zone whose evolution is largely insensitive to the initial disc morphology. This behaviour challenges the standard paradigm that photoevaporation efficiently carves clean inner cavities and directly produces transition discs. However, the pressure maximum at the outer edge of the depression may still trap dust grains, giving rise to transition disc like observational signatures. We also present a first-order prescription to approximate this behaviour in one dimensional disc evolution models, suitable for use in planet formation and population synthesis studies. Although the prescription improves upon static mass-loss treatments, it remains approximate, underscoring the need for further multidimensional simulations and parameter-space exploration to derive robust recipes for global disc and planet population models.</description>

      <title>Formation and evolution of planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various problems of the formation and evolution of planetary systems are studied. Most of the studies are devoted to the Solar System. The collapse of the presolar cloud and the accumulation of planets are studied. The author considers the formation of the Earth-Moon system, binary trans-Neptunian objects, and the axial rotations of planets. He discusses the formation of asteroid and trans-Neptunian belts, including the evolution of resonant asteroid orbits and the formation of the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt. The book discusses the migration of bodies during the formation of the Solar System and at present, including a discussion of the delivery of icy bodies from beyond the ice line to the terrestrial planets and the formation of craters on the Moon. The Deep Impact mission is discussed; during this mission the impact module of the spacecraft collided with the comet Tempel 1. The book studies the migration of dust in the Solar System and the formation of the zodiacal belt, as well as the migration of bodies and dust particles ejected from the terrestrial planets and the Moon. The author considers the migration of bodies in some exoplanetary systems (Proxima Centauri, Trappist 1, and Gliese 581), the spectra of Earth-like exoplanets with different rotation periods, as well as the efficiency of exoplanet searches using microlensing observations with various telescopes.

      <title>Depletion of moderately volatile elements by pebble accretion in Earth-like planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanets growing by pebble accretion capture massive hydrogen-helium atmospheres from the surrounding nebula. Pebbles settling through such atmospheres continuously release gravitational potential energy, heating both the atmosphere and the pebbles. Under these conditions, atmosphere temperatures above large protoplanets are sufficiently high to melt silicate pebbles, support long-lived magma oceans, and drive evaporation of volatile species. Because these atmospheres are open to the nebula, some amount of volatile loss is inevitable. Here we analyze the depletion of moderately volatile elements from terrestrial protoplanets undergoing pebble accretion. We consider chondrule-size silicate pebbles enriched in Si, Na, K, and Zn relative to Earth, settling through a hydrogen-helium-rich atmosphere containing these same volatiles. We show that volatile depletion depends critically on protoplanet mass, the timescale of atmosphere exhaust, and the pebble composition. The protoplanetary mass effect is especially strong. For exhaust timescales of a few centuries, we find that substantial depletion of Zn begins around 0.4 Earth mass, and for Na and K around 0.6 Earth mass, with negligible depletion of these elements at smaller masses. Using a pebble composition that matches Earth's major element abundances, broad agreement with Earth's depletion trend for moderately volatile elements is found by merging a large (approximately 0.7 Earth mass) volatile-depleted target protoplanet with one or more smaller, less-depleted impactors.</description>

      <title>Ring-Gap Structures in the Class I Circumstellar Disk of CrA IRS 2 Associated with Magnetic Flux-Driven Bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent ALMA observations with 0''.1 resolution reveal characteristic substructures in circumstellar disks around young Class I sources, providing clues to the early stages of morphological disk evolution. In this paper, we applied PRIISM imaging to ALMA archival Band 6 continuum data of the circumstellar disk around the Class I protostar CrA IRS 2, located in the Corona Australis molecular cloud, which is associated with an extended gas ring attributed to magnetic flux advection driven by interchange instability. The dust continuum image with 1.5 times higher spatial resolution than conventional imaging revealed, for the first time, the early-phase circumstellar disk with both inner central hole and outer ring-gap structures, making CrA IRS 2 the youngest system exhibiting such features based on the bolometric temperature of $T_{\rm bol}$=235 K. To examine planet-disk interaction as one possible origin of the outer ring-gap structure, we found the measured depth and width to be consistent with planet-disk interaction models, suggesting the existence of a giant planet with a mass of 0.1-1.8 $M_{\rm Jup}$. The additional mechanism required for rapid planet formation could be the magnetic flux dissipation driven by the interchange instability, which suppresses MRI-driven turbulence and extends the dead zone, allowing efficient dust growth and the early formation of planets. This system thus provides new insight into how substructures and planet formation can emerge during the early, accreting phase of disk evolution.</description>

      <title>NIRPS tightens the mass estimate of GJ 3090 b and detects a planet near the stellar rotation period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an updated characterization of the planetary system orbiting the nearby M2 dwarf GJ 3090 (TOI-177; $d = 22$ pc), based on new high-precision radial velocity (RV) observations from NIRPS and HARPS. With an orbital period of 2.85 d, the transiting sub-Neptune GJ 3090 b has a mass we refine to $4.52 \pm 0.47 M_{\oplus}$, which, combined with our derived radius of $2.18 \pm 0.06 R_{\oplus}$, yields a density of $2.40^{+0.33}_{-0.30}$ g cm$^{-3}$. The combined interior structure and atmospheric constraints indicate that GJ 3090 b is a compelling water-world candidate, with a volatile-rich envelope in which water likely represents a significant fraction. We also confirm the presence of a second planet, GJ 3090 c, a sub-Neptune with a 15.9 d orbit and a minimum mass of $10.0 \pm 1.3 M_{\oplus}$, which does not transit. Despite its proximity to the star's 18 d rotation period, our joint analysis using a multidimensional Gaussian process (GP) model that incorporates TESS photometry and differential stellar temperature measurements distinguishes this planetary signal from activity-induced variability. In addition, we place new constraints on a non-transiting planet candidate with a period of 12.7 d, suggested in earlier RV analyses. This candidate remains a compelling target for future monitoring. These results highlight the crucial role of multidimensional GP modelling in disentangling planetary signals from stellar activity, enabling the detection of a planet near the stellar rotation period that could have remained undetected with traditional approaches.</description>

      <title>True Masses using RV data with Hipparcos and Gaia Astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-period companions are detected and characterized thanks to long-baseline radial velocity surveys. Combining Doppler time-series with astrometry, and in particular with proper motion anomalies technique, it is possible to put strong constraints on their orbital inclination and true mass. This work aims to present a model that combines Hipparcos and Gaia astrometric data with radial velocity measurements to constrain the orbital inclinations and true masses of long-period companions. Additionally, we re-analyse a small sample of targets that have not yet been studied using this combined approach. This research leverages the simultaneous modelling of proper motion anomalies and radial velocities, in conjunction with an analysis of the sensitivity curve. This approach serves not only as a verification of the parameters but also as a means to acquire valuable insights into planetary systems. The new analyses reveal that some of the targets classified as brown dwarfs or small-mass stars have a planetary nature. HD 5388 b and HD 6718 b are likely planets. HD 141937 b is likely a planet, but the current dataset does not allow us to firmly constrain its true mass. HD 16760 b belongs to the brown dwarf regime and it has a probable second companion. 30 Ari B b falls within the stellar regime, but the presence of an additional stellar companion could compromise the reliability of the final results. For HD 148427 b, HD 96127 b and HIP 65891 b we determined a range for the orbital inclinations.</description>

      <title>Mass estimates of the young TOI-451 transiting planets: Multidimensional Gaussian Process on stellar spectroscopic and photometric signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The young TOI-451 planetary system, aged 125 Myr, provides a unique opportunity to test theories of planetary internal structures and atmospheric mass loss through examination of its three transiting planets. We present an exhaustive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up to determine the orbital and physical properties of the system. We perform multidimensional Gaussian Process regression with the code pyaneti on spectroscopic time-series and NGTS/LCO light curves to disentangle the stellar and planetary signal in ESPRESSO radial velocities. We show how contemporaneous photometry serves as an activity indicator to inform RV modelling within a multidimensional Gaussian Processes framework. We argue that this can be exploited when spectroscopic observations are adversely affected by low signal-to-noise and/or poor sampling. We estimate the Doppler semi-amplitudes of Kb = 2.6(+1.1,-1.2) m/s, Kc = 1.2(+1.0,-0.8) m/s and Kd = 2.7 +/- 1.2 m/s. This translates into 2-sigma mass estimates for TOI-451 b and d of Mb = 4.7(+2.1,-2.2) Earth masses and Md = 10.2(+4.6,-4.5) Earth masses, as well as a mass upper limit for TOI-451 c of Mc &lt; 11.5 Earth masses. The derived planetary properties suggest that planets c and d contain significant hydrogen-rich envelopes. The inferred parameters of TOI-451 b are consistent with either a rocky world that still retains a small hydrogen envelope or a water world. These insights make the TOI-451 system an ideal laboratory for future follow-up studies aimed at measuring atmospheric compositions, detecting atmospheric mass-loss signatures, and further exploring planetary formation and evolution processes.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity lunar topographic reconstruction across diverse terrain and illumination environments using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topographic models are essential for characterizing planetary surfaces and for inferring underlying geological processes. Nevertheless, meter-scale topographic data remain limited, which constrains detailed planetary investigations, even for the Moon, where extensive high-resolution orbital images are available. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) exploit single-view imagery, constrained by low-resolution topography, for fast and flexible reconstruction of fine-scale topography. However, their robustness and general applicability across diverse lunar landforms and illumination conditions remain insufficiently explored. In this study, we build upon our previously proposed DL framework by incorporating a more robust scale recovery scheme and extending the model to polar regions under low solar illumination conditions. We demonstrate that, compared with single-view shape-from-shading methods, the proposed DL approach exhibits greater robustness to varying illumination and achieves more consistent and accurate topographic reconstructions. Furthermore, it reliably reconstructs topography across lunar features of diverse scales, morphologies, and geological ages. High-quality topographic models are also produced for the lunar south polar areas, including permanently shadowed regions, demonstrating the method's capability in reconstructing complex and low-illumination terrain. These findings suggest that DL-based approaches have the potential to leverage extensive lunar datasets to support advanced exploration missions and enable investigations of the Moon at unprecedented topographic resolution.</description>

      <title>Demographics of Close-In TESS Exoplanets Orbiting FGK Main-sequence Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the demographics of close-in planets is crucial for insights into exoplanet formation and evolution. We present a detailed analysis of occurrence rates for close-in (0.5-16 day) planets with radii between 2 and 20$\,R_{\oplus}$ around FGK main-sequence stars. Our study uses a comprehensive sample from four years of TESS Science Processing Operations Center full-frame image data cross-matched with Gaia, analysed through our rigorous detection, vetting, and validation pipeline. Using high-confidence planet candidates, we apply a hierarchical Bayesian model to determine occurrence rates in the two-dimensional orbital period-radius plane. Our results are presented using 10-by-10 bins across the period-radius parameter space, offering unprecedented resolution and statistical precision. We find an overall occurrence rate of $9.4^{+0.7}_{-0.6}\%$. When using identical binning, our occurrence rate posteriors distributions align with Kepler's but have a magnitude smaller uncertainties on average. For hot Jupiters, we estimate the overall occurrence rate of $0.39^{+0.03}_{-0.02}\%$. This value is consistent with the previous Kepler FGK-type result within $1\sigma$. We find an overall occurrence rate of Neptunian desert planets of $0.08\pm0.01\%$, to our knowledge the first such determination. Additionally, in a volume-limited Gaia subsample within 100 pc in the same parameter region, we measure an overall planet occurrence rate of $15.4^{+1.6}_{-1.5}\%$ and a hot Jupiter occurrence rate of $0.42^{+0.16}_{-0.12}\%$. Our results establishes an improved foundation for constraining theoretical models of exoplanet populations.</description>

      <title>Constraining the size, shape, and albedo of the large Trans-Neptunian Object (28978) Ixion with multi-chord stellar occultations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) are among the most primitive remnants of the early Solar System, and constraining their sizes, shapes, albedos, and surface properties is essential for understanding their origin and evolution. Stellar occultations provide highly accurate size and shape measurements for TNOs, while photometry constrains their albedo and surface colours. (28978) Ixion is one of the largest TNOs and a prominent Plutino, making it a key target for comparative studies. We aim to constrain Ixion's projected size, shape, absolute magnitude, geometric albedo, and surface colours, and to search for evidence of an atmosphere or circum-object material. We analysed stellar occultation campaigns by Ixion conducted between 2020 and 2023 within the Lucky Star collaboration, comprising 51 observations from eight events, including 30 positive detections. Five multi-chord events enabled a global limb fit and an accurate reconstruction of Ixion's projected shape. The occultations reveal a slightly elongated limb well represented by a single projected ellipse, yielding an area-equivalent diameter of $D_{\mathrm{equiv}} = 696.78^{+10.75}_{-8.87}$ km and an apparent oblateness $\epsilon' = 0.081^{+0.004}_{-0.010}$. Typical radial residuals of order $\sim$10 km indicate a largely stable shape across epochs, with modest epoch-dependent variations. Calibrated photometric data yield an absolute magnitude of $H_V = 3.845 \pm 0.006$, a phase-curve slope of $\beta = 0.1301 \pm 0.0078$ mag deg$^{-1}$, and a visible geometric albedo of $p_V = 0.106^{+0.003}_{-0.003}$, with colours consistent with moderately red TNO surfaces. No atmosphere or circum-object material is detected down to our sensitivity limits. The best-sampled event also allows a precise measurement of the angular diameter of the occulted star Gaia DR3 4056440205544338944, $\theta_\star = 0.670 \pm 0.010$ mas.</description>

      <title>Habitable Worlds Observatory Living Worlds Working Group: Surface Biosignatures on Potentially Habitable Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is the first NASA Astrophysics flagship mission with a key science goal of searching for signs of life on rocky habitable exoplanets beyond our solar system. The Living Worlds Community Working Group was charged with investigating how HWO could characterize planets orbiting stars in the solar neighborhood, search for signs of life, and interpret potential biosignatures within a false positive and false negative framework. The Surface Biosignatures Task assessed the measurement requirements and instrument needs to detect these biosignatures under an 'Earth through time' scenario. Surface biosignatures are planetary-scale spectral features resulting from absorption and/or scattering of radiation by organisms containing photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic pigments. This secondary class of biosignature can be used to corroborate atmospheric biosignatures by providing multiple lines of evidence to aid in assessing their biogenicity. Furthermore, surface biopigments are the only way to detect more primitive forms of anoxygenic photosynthesis if oxygenic photosynthesis never evolved. Key Findings: To detect biopigments on the surface of planets under Archean, Proterozoic, and Modern atmospheric compositions (15 percent coverage, 50 percent cloud cover), an SNR of 20-40 would be needed over 500-1100 nm. However, there may be some cases in which lower SNR is required; studies are ongoing. Coronagraph requirements: (1) The detection of surface biosignatures would be greatly enhanced by having as many parallel coronagraph channels as possible across the entire wavelength range with no or minimal gaps between channels. (2) Retrieval studies revealed that restricted wavelength ranges (e.g., 0.4 - 0.7 microns), such as may be used during initial survey strategies, are not sufficient to deconvolve the biopigment features from the abiotic background.</description>

      <title>Planet-Host Stars Across the Galaxy in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By the 2040s, the exoplanet field will have moved from the discovery of a few thousand planets to hundreds of thousands, thanks to Gaia DR5, TESS, PLATO, Roman, and their successors. At that stage, the key bottleneck will no longer be planet detection, but our ability to understand how planetary systems form, evolve, and diversify across different stellar and Galactic environments.
  To address this, we need a large-scale, high-resolution spectroscopic survey of planet-host stars, spanning a broad range of Galactic environments (thin and thick disks, bulge, halo, clusters, associations), and including a well-defined control sample of non-hosts. Such a survey must deliver homogeneous stellar parameters, detailed abundance determinations, ages, and kinematics for tens of thousands of hosts, extending to the faint magnitudes probed by future missions but are beyond the reach of existing and currently planned spectroscopic facilities.</description>

      <title>Numerical Insights into Disk Accretion, Eccentricity, and Kinematics in the Class 0 phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation and early evolution of protoplanetary disks are governed by a wide variety of physical processes during a gravitational collapse. Observations have begun probing disks in their earliest stages, and have favored the magnetically-regulated disk formation scenario. Disks are also expected to exhibit ellipsoidal morphologies in the early phases, an aspect that has been widely overlooked. We aim to describe the birth and evolution of the disk while accounting for the eccentric motions of fluid parcels. Using 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with ambipolar diffusion, we self-consistently model the collapse of isolated $1~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and $3~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ cores to form a central protostar surrounded by a disk. We account for dust dynamics, and employ gas tracer particles to follow the thermodynamical history of fluid parcels. We find that magnetic fields and turbulence drive highly anisotropic accretion onto the disk via dense streamers. This streamer-fed accretion, occurring from the vertical and radial directions, drives vigorous internal turbulence that facilitates efficient angular momentum transport and rapid radial spreading. Crucially, the anisotropic inflow delivers material with an angular momentum deficit that continuously generates and sustains significant disk eccentricity ($e\sim 0.1$). Our results reveal ubiquitous eccentric kinematics in Class 0 disks, with direct implications for disk evolution, planetesimal formation, and the interpretation of cosmochemical signatures in Solar System meteorites.</description>

      <title>Semi-convection in rotating spherical shells: flows, layers and dynamos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large regions of gaseous planets are thought to be stratified with an unstable thermal gradient, but a stabilising gradient of heavy element composition. Fluid in these regions is unstable to semi-convection, with motions driven by differences in the molecular diffusivity of temperature and composition, and could play a role in supporting planetary magnetic fields. Previous studies focus largely on local models in Cartesian boxes; here, we investigate semi-convection in rotating spherical shells. The onset of linear instability shows a transition between the two limits of rotating convection and non-rotating semi-convection. Non-linear simulations evolve into a system of concentric layers of relatively constant density, separated by narrow high-gradient regions. These layers gradually merge, resulting in a statistically steady state dominated by either a single convection region or a narrower convective zone beneath a stably stratified layer (SSL), depending on the strength of the thermal forcing compared to the rotation. When magnetic field generation is considered, our magnetohydrodynamic simulations exhibit self-sustained dynamo action. In cases where the turbulent convective region generates magnetic fields that are smoothed by zonal flows within the overlying SSL, the resulting field is strongly dipolar and axisymmetric, in encouraging agreement with Saturn's observed magnetic field. Within the regimes explored, both the Rossby number and the thickness of the SSL are well predicted by a single combination of control parameters. This enables the identification of a parameter range in which the generated magnetic fields resemble those of planetary dynamos.</description>

      <title>Parallaxes, Proper Motions, and Near-Infrared Photometry for 173 L and T Dwarfs From The US Naval Observatory Infrared Astrometry Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present near-infrared parallax and proper motion astrometry for 74 L-dwarfs and 99 T-dwarfs, as single objects or in binary systems, obtained with the ASTROCAM astrometric imager on the USNO, Flagstaff Station 1.55-m telescope over two observing periods. For all 173 objects the median number of observational epochs was 62 with a median time frame of 5.25 years, resulting in median uncertainties of $\sigma$($\pi_{abs}$) = 1.51 mas, $\sigma$($\mu_{abs}$) = 1.02 mas yr$^{-1}$, and $\sigma$($V_{\rm tan}$) = 1.01 km s$^{-1}$. Our observations provide the first parallax/proper motion results for 16 objects and the highest precision parallaxes/proper motions for an additional 116 objects. A serendipitous overlap of 40 objects with Gaia DR3 astrometry allows direct comparison and confirmation of our results, along with an investigation on the effects of resolved binarity on astrometric results. We also provide a uniform set of $J$-, $H$-, $K_{S}$-band photometry in the UKIRT/MKO system, most of it being from new observations. We use these results to examine objects included in this study of special-interest populations, consisting of binaries, wide companions, young objects, subdwarfs, and brown dwarf spectral standards.</description>

      <title>Bridging the gap: consistent modeling of protoplanetary disk heating and gap formation by planet-induced spiral shocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A giant planet embedded in a protoplanetary disk excites spiral density waves, which steepen into shocks as they propagate away from the planet. These shocks lead to secular disk heating and gap opening, both of which can have important implications for the evolution of solids near the planet. To date, these two effects have largely been modeled independently. In this study, we present a self-consistent model that unifies these processes by linking shock heating and angular momentum deposition through the entropy jumps across the spiral shocks. We show that this model accurately reproduces the temperature and surface density profiles around the planet's orbit, as obtained from two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with standard $\alpha$ viscosity and $\beta$ thermal relaxation prescriptions. Furthermore, by incorporating an empirically derived scaling law for the radial distribution of the entropy jump, we construct a fully analytic model that self-consistently predicts the temperature and surface density structures of disks hosting a giant planet. This work represents a first step toward understanding how a giant planet forming in the inner disk region influences the distribution and composition of second-generation planets and planetesimals in its vicinity.</description>

      <title>Earth-Mass Planets in Tandem Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new terrestrial planet formation theory demonstrating that Earth-mass planets form naturally in tandem protosolar disks. Our model builds upon tandem planet formation theory (Ebisuzaki and Imaeda 2017; Imaeda and Ebisuzaki 2017a,b, 2018), incorporating magneto-rotational instability (MRI) suppression (Balbus and Hawley 1991; Hawley and Balbus 1991), porous particle aggregation (Okuzumi et al. 2012; Kataoka et al. 2013), and standard planet formation mechanisms (e.g., Safronov 1969; Hayashi et al. 1985). In a tandem proto-solar disk, planets form at two distinct locations: the inner and outer edges of the MRI-suppressed region, where solid particles accumulate. The inner edge produces rocky planets, while the outer edge forms gas giants. When planetesimals reach Earth-sized mass at the inner MRI edge, they migrate outward due to gas disk torque. For a protosolar disk accretion rate of M_dot = 10^-7.08 solar masses per year (Case D), the total solid mass at the inner MRI edge reaches 1.99 Earth masses, producing two Earth-mass planets. This result closely matches the solar system's terrestrial planet distribution (Earth and Venus), which comprises 92% of total terrestrial planet mass, providing strong support for our formation mechanism.</description>

      <title>A Closed-Form Analytical Theory of Non-Isobaric Transmission Spectroscopy for Exoplanet Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analytical models are essential for building physical intuition and guiding the interpretation of exoplanet observations by clarifying the dependencies that shape atmospheric signatures. We present a generalization of the classical isothermal, isobaric transmission model by allowing the opacity to vary with pressure as a power law, $\kappa \propto P^{n}$, and explicitly defining the reference opacity $\kappa_{0}$ at a chosen pressure $P_{0}$. By treating the slant optical depth as an Abel transform of the radial absorption coefficient, we derive a closed-form expression for the effective transit radius in a hydrostatic, isothermal atmosphere with pressure-dependent opacity. The solution provides a compact framework for exploring non-isobaric effects and explicitly links the vertical opacity gradient to observable spectral features. We benchmark the model against empirical transmission spectra of Earth and the hot Jupiter WASP-39b, finding a significantly improved fit relative to the isobaric formula. This generalized expression offers a physically interpretable foundation for analyzing high-precision spectra from JWST and upcoming ARIEL observations, and can serve as a basis for semi-analytical retrieval approaches optimized for computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Synchronisation of a tidal binary by inward orbital migration. The case of Pluto and Charon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is usually taken for granted that mutual synchronisation of a tidal two body system is attained through tidal recession, assuming the reduced Hill sphere is not reached. However, synchronisation can be achieved also via tidal approach, provided the Roche limit is not crossed. For each of the two scenarios, we derive the condition under which the evolving synchronicity radius catches up with the tidally evolving orbit. We consider the two scenarios for the Pluto Charon system and examine the impact origin hypothesis of Charons formation against capture. Based on geophysical evidence, we propose that capture appears more likely. Motivated by this conclusion, we investigate the capture scenario, wherein the orbital evolution of Charon starts at a higher altitude than present and undergoes tidal descent, both analytically and numerically. We also consider the possibility that Plutos initial prograde spin underwent a reversal by a tidally approaching retrograde Charon. Depending on the initial conditions, we observe temporary locking of Charon into higher spin orbit resonances 3:2 to 7:2 during the first 0.5 Myr of the systems evolution. Owing to a greater initial separation between the partners, the power dissipated in each of them turns out to be much lower than in the case of tidal recession of bodies of the same internal structure. The greater initial separation also results in lower tidal stress, which may explain the absence of tidally generated fracture patterns.</description>

      <title>The GAPS programme at TNG LXX. HD 128717 B/Gaia-6 B: a long-period eccentric low-mass brown dwarf from astrometry and radial velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition regime between giant planets (GPs) and brown dwarfs (BDs) is still an open subject of study in exoplanetary science. A complete understanding of the population of long-period GPs and BDs would be pivotal in understanding this topic, but the number of such objects with precisely measured orbital and physical parameters is still small. Moreover, their dynamical influence on smaller companions in inner orbits is still unclear. Within the GAPS programme, we aim to confirm and characterize sub-stellar companion candidates from Gaia DR3, and to study the potential presence of additional lower-mass planets in their systems. We present the results of an intensive high-precision RV monitoring of HD 128717, which hosts the astrometric candidate Gaia-ASOI-009. We used the HARPS-N spectrograph at TNG to collect a high-cadence RV time series of the target. We used MCMC analyses to refine the Gaia DR3 orbital solution of the companion and, finally, performed a combined model of RV and proper motion anomaly (PMa) to derive the complete 3-D orbit of the companion. We also ran a suite of numerical simulations to confirm our results. We confirm the sub-stellar nature of Gaia-ASOI-009, i.e. Gaia-6 B: from the combined RV+PMa fit, we confirm that it is a high-eccentricity low-mass brown dwarf with $P_\text{B} = 9.37^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ yr, $M_\text{B} = 19.8 \pm 0.5$ $M_\text{J}$, $e_\text{B}=0.85$, $i_\text{B} = 130^{\circ}$. The derived orbital solution differs significantly from the one published in Gaia DR3. Through a series of dedicated simulations, we demonstrate that this discrepancy arises from a degeneracy in the Gaia DR3 astrometric solution. Specifically, the combination of Gaia-6 B long orbital period and high eccentricity, both poorly constrained by the limited timespan of DR3, led to an incorrect solution characterized by a shorter period and lower eccentricity.</description>

Their orbits are shaped not only by the protoplanetary disk but also by the perturbations from two stellar hosts, making them sensitive probes of both early- and late-stage dynamical processes. In this work, we investigate the unusual architecture of the VHS J125601.92-125723.9 system, where a retrograde, nearly polar tertiary orbits an extremely low-mass substellar binary in a hierarchical triple configuration. We find that triple body dynamics can naturally reproduce the observed high eccentricity of the inner binary and the tertiary's near-polar obliquity. However, this configuration alone cannot account for the observed mutual inclination, which is both near-polar and retrograde. This tension suggests two possible formation pathways: either the planet formed in an aligned, protoplanetary disk-like configuration and was later tilted by an additional, undetected fourth companion (below current Gaia limits), or the system formed close to its current state. Stellar flybys, in contrast, are unlikely due to their long timescales. Our results highlight both the explanatory power and the limitations of triple dynamics, and the potential role of hidden companions in shaping extreme planetary architectures.</description>
