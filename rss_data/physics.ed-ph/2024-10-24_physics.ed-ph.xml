      <title>Quantum Computing Education in Latin America: Experiences and Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is a rapidly advancing field facing a significant shortage of qualified experts, creating an urgent demand for skilled professionals. In Latin America, quantum education remains in its early stages, further exacerbating the regional talent gap due to deficiencies in educational infrastructure and limited financial support. This work presents the efforts of the Quantum Computing and Artificial Intelligence research group at Universidad Nacional de Colombia to integrate quantum computing into higher education using the European Competence Framework for Quantum Technologies, which offers a standardized approach to defining competency requirements and assessing essential skills in the field. We propose introductory courses aligned with the frameworks guidelines, designed to meet industry standards and reach a broad audience. Additionally, we introduce supplementary resources, including team dynamics and evaluation methodologies, to enhance the educational ecosystem. These initiatives aim to create a sustainable and comprehensive quantum education model across Latin America, to close the regional skills gap, foster inclusivity, and prepare a diverse workforce to contribute innovative solutions on the global stage.</description>

      <title>Chained computerized adaptive testing for the Force Concept Inventory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although conceptual assessment tests are frequently administered in a pre/post-semester fashion, there are inherent issues with this paradigm. Specifically, education researchers and instructors have limited ability to observe the progression of student conceptual understanding throughout the course. Furthermore, instructors are limited in the usefulness of the feedback they can give to the students involved. To address these issues, we propose the use of computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and increasing the frequency of CAT-based assessments during the course, while reducing the test length per administration, thus keeping or decreasing the total number of test items administered throughout the course. The feasibility of this idea depends on how far the test length per administration can be reduced without compromising the test accuracy and precision. Specifically, the overall test length is desired to be shorter than when the full assessment is administered as a pretest and subsequent post-test. To achieve this goal, we developed a CAT algorithm that we call Chain-CAT. This algorithm sequentially links the results of each CAT administration using collateral information. We developed the Chain-CAT algorithm using the items of the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) and analyzed the efficiency by numerical simulations. We found that collateral information significantly improved the test efficiency, and the overall test length could be shorter than the pre-post method. Without constraints for item balancing and exposure control, simulation results indicated that the efficiency of Chain-CAT is comparable to that of the pre-post method even if the length of each CAT administration is only 5 items and the CAT is administered 9 times throughout the semester.

      <title>Electric Motor -- SimuF\'isica: an application for teaching electromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the Electric Motor simulator, an application from the SimuF\'isica\textsuperscript{\textregistered} platform designed for classroom use. We briefly describe the technologies behind the application, the equations that govern its operation, some studies showing the dynamics of the electric motor, and, finally, the use of the application in High School and Higher Education.</description>
