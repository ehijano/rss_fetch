      <title>Automating Idealness Proofs for Binary Programs with Application to Rectangle Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an optimization framework for identifying ideal Mixed Binary Linear Programs (MBLP) which is linear when using known input data and nonconvex quadratic over parametric input data. These techniques are applied to various formulations for rectangle packing, conjectured to be pairwise-ideal. Additionally, we address a variation of the rectangle packing problem which incorporates clearances along selected edges of the packed objects. We present both existing and novel MBLP formulations for the underlying disjunctive program and investigate the poor performance of Gurobi's default branch-and-cut methodology. We operate under a strip-packing objective that aims to minimize the overall height of the packed objects.</description>

      <title>Mixed Markov-Perfect Equilibria in the Continuous-Time War of Attrition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a Markov-perfect equilibrium in randomized stopping times for a model of the war of attrition in which the underlying state variable follows a homogenous linear diffusion. The proof uses the fact that the space of Markovian randomized stopping times can be topologized as a compact absolute retract, which in turn enables us to use a powerful fixed-point theorem by Eilenberg and Montgomery. We illustrate our results with an example of a war of attrition that admits a mixed-strategy Markov-perfect equilibrium but no pure-strategy Markov-perfect equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Analytic analysis of the worst-case complexity of the gradient method with exact line search and the Polyak stepsize</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a novel analytic analysis of the worst-case complexity of the gradient method with exact line search and the Polyak stepsize, respectively, which previously could only be established by computer-assisted proof. Our analysis is based on studying the linear convergence of a family of gradient methods, whose stepsizes include the one determined by exact line search and the Polyak stepsize as special instances. The asymptotic behavior of the considered family is also investigated which shows that the gradient method with the Polyak stepsize will zigzag in a two-dimensional subspace spanned by the two eigenvectors corresponding to the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the Hessian.</description>

      <title>Bilinear Controllability of a Simple Reparable System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reparable systems are systems that are characterized by their ability to undergo maintenance actions when failures occur. These systems are often described by transport equations, all coupled through an integro-differential equation. In this paper, we address the understudied aspect of the controllability of reparable systems. In particular, we focus on a two-state reparable system and our goal is to design a control strategy that enhances the system availability -- the probability of being operational when needed. We establish bilinear controllability, demonstrating that appropriate control actions can manipulate system dynamics to achieve desired availability levels. We provide theoretical foundations and develop control strategies that leverage the bilinear structure of the equations.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and Bilinear Controllability of a Repairable System with Degraded State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the dynamics of repairable systems characterized by three distinct states: one signifying normal operational states, another representing degraded conditions and a third denoting failed conditions. These systems are characterized by their ability to be repaired when failures and/or degradation occur. Typically described by transport equations, these systems exhibit a coupled nature, interlinked through integro-differential equations and integral boundary conditions that dictate the transitions among all the states. In this paper, we address two less-explored facets: 1) the well-posedness and the asymptotic behavior of such systems with maximum repair time being finite; and 2) the bilinear controllability of the system via repair actions. In particular, we focus on the case where only one degraded and one failed states exist. We first discuss part 1) for given time-independent repair rates and then design the space-time dependent repair strategies that can manipulate system dynamics to achieve the desired level over a finite horizon. Our objective is to enhance the system availability -- the probability of being operational when needed over a fixed period of time. We present rigorous analysis and develop control strategies that leverage the bilinear structure of the system model.</description>

      <title>A derivative-free approach to partitioned optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a partitioned optimization framework (POf) to ease the solving process for optimization problems for which fixing some variables to a tunable value removes some difficulties. The variables space may be continuously partitioned into subsets where these variables are fixed to a given value, so that minimizing the objective function restricted to any of the partition sets is easier than minimizing the objective function over the whole variables space. Then the major difficulty is translated from solving the original problem to choosing the partition set minimizing the minimum of the objective function restricted to this set. Hence, a local solution to the original problem is given by computing this partition set and selecting the minimizer of the objective function restricted to this set. This work formalizes this framework, studies its theoretical guarantees, and provides a numerical method to seek for an optimal partition set using a derivative-free algorithm. Some illustrative problems are presented to show how to apply the POf and to highlight the gain in numerical performance it provides.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Strategies of Carbon Emission Reduction in Agricultural Product Supply Chain under Carbon Sink Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As global climate change and environmental issues escalate, carbon reduction has emerged as a paramount global concern. Agriculture accounts for approximately 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions, making carbon reduction in this sector crucial for attaining global emission targets. Carbon sink trading serves as a supplementary mechanism to achieve carbon peaking and neutrality, helping to lower the rate ofcarbon emissions. However, practical projects and research in the field of carbon sink trading are not enough currently. This work aims to thoroughly explore the cooperative models between farmers and retailers within the context of agricultural carbon sink trading, as well as the optimal decisions on the efforts to reduce carbon emission for both parties under different cooperative models. To this end, we delve into three distinct cooperative frameworks: the decentralized, the Stackelberg, and the centralized models, each accompanied by a corresponding differentialgame model. The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is utilized to investigate the equilibrium strategies of each participant under these three cooperative models, respectively. Furthermore, we conducte numerical simulations to analyze the carbon emission reduction efforts of farmers and retailers, the carbon emission reduction level of the agricultural supply chain, and the overall profits of the supply chain. We also compare scenarios with and without carbon sink trading to provide a comprehensive assessment. The numerical results indicate that the centralized modelexcels in all aspects, followed by the Stackelberg model, with the decentralized model showing the weakest performance. Additionally, carbon sink trading can significantly increase the profits of the participants under each cooperative model.</description>

      <title>Disciplined Geodesically Convex Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convex programming plays a fundamental role in machine learning, data science, and engineering. Testing convexity structure in nonlinear programs relies on verifying the convexity of objectives and constraints. \citet{grant2006disciplined} introduced a framework, Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP), for automating this verification task for a wide range of convex functions that can be decomposed into basic convex functions (atoms) using convexity-preserving compositions and transformations (rules). However, the restriction to Euclidean convexity concepts can limit the applicability of the framework. For instance, many notable instances of statistical estimators and matrix-valued (sub)routines in machine learning applications are Euclidean non-convex, but exhibit geodesic convexity through a more general Riemannian lens. In this work, we extend disciplined programming to this setting by introducing Disciplined Geodesically Convex Programming (DGCP). We determine convexity-preserving compositions and transformations for geodesically convex functions on general Cartan-Hadamard manifolds, as well as for the special case of symmetric positive definite matrices, a common setting in matrix-valued optimization. For the latter, we also define a basic set of atoms. Our paper is accompanied by a Julia package SymbolicAnalysis.jl, which provides functionality for testing and certifying DGCP-compliant expressions. Our library interfaces with manifold optimization software, which allows for directly solving verified geodesically convex programs.</description>

      <title>Extended mean-field control problems with Poissonian common noise: Stochastic maximum principle and Hamiltonian-Jacobi-Bellman equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the extended mean-field control problems with state-control joint law dependence and Poissonian common noise. We develop the stochastic maximum principle (SMP) and establish the connection to the Hamiltonian-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation on the Wasserstein space. The presence of the conditional joint law in the McKean-Vlasov dynamics and its discontinuity caused by the Poissonian common noise bring us new technical challenges. To develop the SMP when the control domain is not necessarily convex, we first consider a strong relaxed control formulation that allows us to perform the first-order variation. We also propose the technique of extension transformation to overcome the compatibility issues arising from the joint law in the relaxed control formulation. By further establishing the equivalence between the relaxed control formulation and the strict control formulation, we obtain the SMP for the original problem in the strict control formulation. In the part to investigate the HJB equation, we formulate an auxiliary control problem subjecting to a controlled measure-valued dynamics with Poisson jumps, which allows us to derive the HJB equation of the original problem through an equivalence argument. We also show the connection between the SMP and HJB equation and give an illustrative example of linear quadratic extended mean-field control with Poissonian common noise.</description>

      <title>Subsidizing a New Technology: An Impulse Stackelberg Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Governments are motivated to subsidize profit-driven firms that manufacture zero-emission vehicles to ensure they become price-competitive. This paper introduces a dynamic Stackelberg game to determine the government's optimal subsidy strategy for zero-emission vehicles, taking into account the pricing decisions of a profit-maximizing firm. While firms have the flexibility to change prices continuously, subsidies are adjusted at specific time intervals. This is captured in our game formulation by using impulse controls for discrete-time interventions. We provide a verification theorem to characterize the Feedback Stackelberg equilibrium and illustrate our results with numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for solving linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) problems with linear equality constraints. This is the first such exact algorithm that is guaranteed to have a runtime that is linear in the number of stages, as well as linear in the number of both state-only constraints as well as mixed state-and-control constraints, without imposing any restrictions on the problem instances. We also show how to easily parallelize this algorithm to run in parallel runtime logarithmic in the number of stages of the problem.</description>

      <title>Speeding-up Large-scale LP Energy System Models: Using Graph-theory to Remove the Overhead Cost of Flexible Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy system models are crucial for planning, supporting, and understanding energy transition pathways. Flexible energy modelling tools have emerged to provide practitioners, planners, and decision-makers with various alternatives to represent diverse energy systems, including green hydrogen or exclusively renewable-powered storage assets. The increased interaction between energy sectors, temporal resolution, and extensive geographical scopes have led to large-scale problems posing significant computational challenges. Despite improvements in computing power and linear programming (LP) solvers, large-scale LP models are often simplified, sacrificing fidelity to speed up solutions. This paper aims to debunk the misconception that an LP model's simplicity cannot be improved without sacrificing fidelity. We propose exploiting the graph nature of energy systems using a single building block, the Energy Asset, to reduce computational complexity. By using only one building block, the Energy Asset, we avoid intermediary assets and connections, thus reducing the number of variables by 26% and constraints by 35%. This approach naturally speeds up solving times by 1.27 times without sacrificing model fidelity. Our illustrative case study demonstrates these improvements compared to traditional two-building-block approaches. This paper raises awareness in the energy modelling community about the quality of LP models and shows that not all LPs are created equal. Our proposed method speeds up energy system models regardless of anticipated advances in software and hardware, allowing for the solution of larger and more detailed models with existing technology.</description>

      <title>Hidden Convexity-Based Distributed Operation of Integrated Electricity-Gas Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hidden convexity-based method to address distributed optimal energy flow (OEF) problems for transmission-level integrated electricity-gas systems. First, we develop a node-wise decoupling method to de-compose an OEF problem into multiple OEF subproblems. Then, we propose a hidden convexity-based method to equivalently reformulate nonconvex OEF subproblems as semi-definite programs. This method differs from any ap-proximation and convexification methods that may incur infeasible solutions. Since all OEF subproblems are origi-nally convex or equivalently convexified, we adopt an ADMM to solve the hidden convexity-based distributed OEF problem with convergence analysis. Test results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially in handling a large number of agents.</description>

      <title>A Re-solving Heuristic for Dynamic Assortment Optimization with Knapsack Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a multi-stage dynamic assortment optimization problem with multi-nomial choice modeling (MNL) under resource knapsack constraints. Given the current resource inventory levels, the retailer makes an assortment decision at each period, and the goal of the retailer is to maximize the total profit from purchases. With the exact optimal dynamic assortment solution being computationally intractable, a practical strategy is to adopt the re-solving technique that periodically re-optimizes deterministic linear programs (LP) arising from fluid approximation. However, the fractional structure of MNL makes the fluid approximation in assortment optimization highly non-linear, which brings new technical challenges. To address this challenge, we propose a new epoch-based re-solving algorithm that effectively transforms the denominator of the objective into the constraint. Theoretically, we prove that the regret (i.e., the gap between the resolving policy and the optimal objective of the fluid approximation) scales logarithmically with the length of time horizon and resource capacities.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on vessel automation and autonomy is currently being conducted by various countries and institutions. Safe and accurate ship control algorithms are crucial to realize automated operation. Actuator drive constraints of a target ship may jeopardize the stability of the control law and require complex theory. In this study, we include a penalty term to the control law gain optimization stage of dynamic positioning systems to account for the amounts by which the actuator input value and its rate of change exceed the constraint. The parameters for generating a suitable reference path for the control law are identified simultaneously with the control gains. The simulation results show that the proposed method can realize control parameters and a reference design with excellent tracking performance while determining the cost of the controller design by considering the effects of both the actuators and rate saturation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kalman filter is indispensable for state estimation across diverse fields but faces computational challenges with higher dimensions. Approaches such as Riccati equation approximations aim to alleviate this complexity, yet ensuring properties like bounded errors remains challenging. Yamada and Ohki introduced low-rank Kalman-Bucy filters for continuous-time systems, ensuring bounded errors. This paper proposes a discrete-time counterpart of the low-rank filter and shows its system theoretic properties and conditions for bounded mean square error estimation. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>An example of a small-time globally approximately controllable bilinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variety of physically relevant bilinear Schr\"odinger equations are known to be globally approximately controllable in large times. There are however examples which are globally approximately controllable in large times, but not in small times. This obstruction happens e.g. in the presence of (sub)quadratic potentials, because Gaussian states are preserved, at least for small times.
  In this work, we provide the first examples of small-time globally approximately controllable bilinear Schr\"odinger equations. In particular, we show that a control on the frequency of a quadratic potential permits to construct approximate solutions that evolve arbitrarily fast along specific transport flows, namely, space-dilations. Once we have access to space-dilations, we can exploit them to generate time-contractions. In this way, we build on previous results of large-time control, to obtain global approximate controllability in small times.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Linear-Quadratic Stackelberg Differential Game with Asymmetric Informational Uncertainties: Robust Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a two-person zero-sum indefinite stochastic linear-quadratic Stackelberg differential game with asymmetric informational uncertainties, where both the leader and follower face different and unknown disturbances. We take a robust optimization approach and soft-constraint analysis, a min-max stochastic linear-quadratic optimal control problem is solved by the follower firstly. Then, the leader deal with a max-min stochastic linear-quadratic optimal control problem of forward-backward stochastic differential equations in an augmented space. State feedback representation of the robust Stackelberg equilibrium is given in a more explicit form by decoupling technique, via some Riccati equations.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Distributed Observers for Quasilinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of finite/fixed-time cooperative state estimation is considered for a class of quasilinear systems with nonlinearities satisfying a H\"older condition. A strongly connected nonlinear distributed observer is designed under the assumption of global observability. By proper parameter tuning with linear matrix inequalities, the observer error equation possesses finite/fixed-time stability in the perturbation-free case and input-to-state stability with respect to bounded perturbations. Numerical simulations are performed to validate this design.</description>

      <title>Installation of renewable capacities to meet emission targets and demand under uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on minimizing the costs related to renewable energy installations under emission constraints. We tackle the problem in three different cases. Assuming intervening once, we determine the optimal time to install and the optimal capacity expansions under uncertainty. By assuming the possibility of two or multiple interventions, we find that the optimal strategy is to intervene only once. We also prove that there are instances where capacity expansions should be delayed.</description>

      <title>Almost Sure Convergence and Non-asymptotic Concentration Bounds for Stochastic Mirror Descent Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter investigates the convergence and concentration properties of the Stochastic Mirror Descent (SMD) algorithm utilizing biased stochastic subgradients. We establish the almost sure convergence of the algorithm's iterates under the assumption of diminishing bias. Furthermore, we derive concentration bounds for the discrepancy between the iterates' function values and the optimal value, based on standard assumptions. Subsequently, leveraging the assumption of Sub-Gaussian noise in stochastic subgradients, we present refined concentration bounds for this discrepancy.</description>

      <title>A general framework for inexact splitting algorithms with relative errors and applications to Chambolle-Pock and Davis-Yin methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we apply the recently introduced framework of degenerate preconditioned proximal point algorithms to the hybrid proximal extragradient (HPE) method for maximal monotone inclusions. The latter is a method that allows inexact proximal (or resolvent) steps where the error is controlled by a relative-error criterion. Recently the HPE framework has been extended to the Douglas-Rachford method by Eckstein and Yao. In this paper we further extend the applicability of the HPE framework to splitting methods. To that end we use the framework of degenerate preconditioners that allows to write a large class of splitting methods as preconditioned proximal point algorithms. In this way we modify many splitting methods such that one or more of the resolvents can be computed inexactly with an error that is controlled by an adaptive criterion. Further, we illustrate the algorithmic framework in the case of Chambolle-Pock's primal dual hybrid gradient method and the Davis-Yin's forward Douglas-Rachford method. In both cases, the inexact computation of the resolvent shows clear advantages in computing time and accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the class of nonlinear input-affine systems with polynomial dynamics, we consider the problem of designing an input-to-state stabilizing controller with respect to typical exogenous signals in a feedback control system, such as actuator and process disturbances. We address this problem in a data-based setting when we cannot avail ourselves of the dynamics of the actual system, but only of data generated by it under unknown bounded noise. For all dynamics consistent with data, we derive sum-of-squares programs to design an input-to-state stabilizing controller, an input-to-state Lyapunov function and the corresponding comparison functions. This numerical design for input-to-state stabilization seems to be relevant not only in the considered data-based setting, but also in a model-based setting. Illustration of feasibility of the provided sum-of-squares programs is provided on a numerical example.</description>

      <title>All You Need is a Paraboloid: Quadratic Cuts for Non-Convex MINLP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is only half the job to find a good solution for a mathematical optimization problem, as one needs to verify its quality by specifying a dual bound. When it comes to mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), strong prerequisites such as constraint qualifications appear suitable, but may be difficult to verify computationally. In practice, solvers apply local refinement or convexification strategies to retrieve tight dual bounds. However, these concepts require appropriate big-M formulations, generate new sub-problems, or struggle to represent non-convex characteristics in terms of high accuracy, all of which can lead to long running times.
  As an alternative, we aim to leverage recent advances in mixed-integer quadratically-constrained programming (MIQCP) and propose a global approximation of constraint functions by paraboloids, \ie, univariate quadratic terms. The approximation is retrieved as a solution to a mixed-integer linear programming (MIP) problem. Further, for each nonlinear constraint function, we solve such MIPs and determine small numbers of paraboloids approximating it from either side. A replacement of the nonlinearities with the corresponding quadratic functions leads to a quadratically-constrained relaxation of the original problem. Solving the MIQCP relaxation then leads to a dual bound whose tightness depends on the approximation guarantee of the paraboloids. In summary, this approach enables solvers that are explicitly tailored for quadratic constraints to solve MINLPs to global optimality.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a heretofore unseen application of Ising machines to perform trust region-based optimisation with box constraints. This is done by considering a specific form of opto-electronic oscillator-based coherent Ising machines with clipped transfer functions, and proposing appropriate modifications to facilitate trust-region optimisation. The enhancements include the inclusion of non-symmetric coupling and linear terms, modulation of noise, and compatibility with convex-projections to improve its convergence. The convergence of the modified Ising machine has been shown under the reasonable assumptions of convexity or invexity. The mathematical structures of the modified Ising machine and trust-region methods have been exploited to design a new trust-region method to effectively solve unconstrained optimisation problems in many scenarios, such as machine learning and optimisation of parameters in variational quantum algorithms. Hence, the proposition is useful for both classical and quantum-classical hybrid scenarios. Finally, the convergence of the Ising machine-based trust-region method, has also been proven analytically, establishing the feasibility of the technique.</description>

      <title>A Decomposition Theorem for Dynamic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The famous edge flow decomposition theorem of Gallai (1958) states that any static edge $s$,$d$-flow in a directed graph can be decomposed into a linear combination of incidence vectors of paths and cycles. In this paper, we study the decomposition problem for the setting of dynamic edge $s$,$d$-flows assuming a quite general dynamic flow propagation model. We prove the following decomposition theorem: For any dynamic edge $s$,$d$-flow with finite support, there exists a decomposition into a linear combination of $s$,$d$-walk inflows and circulations, i.e. edge flows that circulate along cycles with zero transit time. We show that a variant of the classical algorithmic approach of iteratively subtracting walk inflows from the current dynamic edge flow converges to a dynamic circulation. The algorithm terminates in finite time, if there is a lower bound on the minimum edge travel times. We further characterize those dynamic edge flows which can be decomposed purely into linear combinations of $s$,$d$-walk inflows.
  The proofs rely on the new concept of parameterized network loadings which describe how particles of a different walk flow would hypothetically propagate throughout the network under the fixed travel times induced by the given edge flow. We show several technical properties of this type of network loading and as a byproduct we also derive some general results on dynamic flows which could be of interest outside the context of this paper as well.</description>

      <title>Closing the Gaps: Optimality of Sample Average Approximation for Data-Driven Newsvendor Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the regret performance of Sample Average Approximation (SAA) for data-driven newsvendor problems with general convex inventory costs. In literature, the optimality of SAA has not been fully established under both \alpha-global strong convexity and (\alpha,\beta)-local strong convexity (\alpha-strongly convex within the \beta-neighborhood of the optimal quantity) conditions. This paper closes the gaps between regret upper and lower bounds for both conditions. Under the (\alpha,\beta)-local strong convexity condition, we prove the optimal regret bound of \Theta(\log T/\alpha + 1/ (\alpha\beta)) for SAA. This upper bound result demonstrates that the regret performance of SAA is only influenced by \alpha and not by \beta in the long run, enhancing our understanding about how local properties affect the long-term regret performance of decision-making strategies. Under the \alpha-global strong convexity condition, we demonstrate that the worst-case regret of any data-driven method is lower bounded by \Omega(\log T/\alpha), which is the first lower bound result that matches the existing upper bound with respect to both parameter \alpha and time horizon T. Along the way, we propose to analyze the SAA regret via a new gradient approximation technique, as well as a new class of smooth inverted-hat-shaped hard problem instances that might be of independent interest for the lower bounds of broader data-driven problems.</description>

      <title>Equitable Congestion Pricing under the Markovian Traffic Model: An Application to Bogota</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Congestion pricing is used to raise revenues and reduce traffic and pollution. However, people have heterogeneous spatial demand patterns and willingness (or ability) to pay tolls, and so pricing may have substantial equity implications. We develop a data-driven approach to design congestion pricing given policymakers' equity and efficiency objectives. First, algorithmically, we extend the Markovian traffic equilibrium setting introduced by Baillon &amp; Cominetti (2008) to model heterogeneous populations and incorporate prices and outside options such as public transit. Second, we empirically evaluate various pricing schemes using data collected by an industry partner in the city of Bogota, one of the most congested cities in the world. We find that pricing personalized to each economic stratum can be substantially more efficient and equitable than uniform pricing; however, non-personalized but area-based pricing can recover much of the gap.</description>

      <title>Distributional stability of sparse inverse covariance matrix estimators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding an approximation of the inverse of the covariance matrix, also known as precision matrix, of a random vector with empirical data is widely discussed in finance and engineering. In data-driven problems, empirical data may be ``contaminated''. This raises the question as to whether the approximate precision matrix is reliable from a statistical point of view. In this paper, we concentrate on a much-noticed sparse estimator of the precision matrix and investigate the issue from the perspective of distributional stability. Specifically, we derive an explicit local Lipschitz bound for the distance between the distributions of the sparse estimator under two different distributions (regarded as the true data distribution and the distribution of ``contaminated'' data). The distance is measured by the Kantorovich metric on the set of all probability measures on a matrix space. We also present analogous results for the standard estimators of the covariance matrix and its eigenvalues. Furthermore, we discuss two applications and conduct some numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Privacy of the last iterate in cyclically-sampled DP-SGD on nonconvex composite losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) refers to a family of optimization algorithms that provide a guaranteed level of differential privacy (DP) through DP accounting techniques. However, current accounting techniques make assumptions that diverge significantly from practical DP-SGD implementations. For example, they may assume the loss function is Lipschitz continuous and convex, sample the batches randomly with replacement, or omit the gradient clipping step.
  In this work, we analyze the most commonly used variant of DP-SGD, in which we sample batches cyclically with replacement, perform gradient clipping, and only release the last DP-SGD iterate. More specifically - without assuming convexity, smoothness, or Lipschitz continuity of the loss function - we establish new R\'enyi differential privacy (RDP) bounds for the last DP-SGD iterate under the mild assumption that (i) the DP-SGD stepsize is small relative to the topological constants in the loss function, and (ii) the loss function is weakly-convex. Moreover, we show that our bounds converge to previously established convex bounds when the weak-convexity parameter of the objective function approaches zero. In the case of non-Lipschitz smooth loss functions, we provide a weaker bound that scales well in terms of the number of DP-SGD iterations.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Registration and Fusion Method for Hyperspectral Super-resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fusing hyperspectral images (HSIs) with multispectral images (MSIs) has become a mainstream approach to enhance the spatial resolution of HSIs. Many HSI-MSI fusion methods have achieved impressive results. Nevertheless, certain challenges persist, including: (a) A majority of current methods rely on accurate registration of HSI and MSI, which can be challenging in real-world applications.(b) The obtained HSI-MSI pairs may not be fully utilized. In this paper, we propose a hybrid registration and fusion constrained optimization model named RAF-NLRGS. With respect to challenge (a), the RAF model integrates batch image alignment within the fusion process, facilitating simultaneous execution of image registration and fusion. To address issue (b), the NLRGS model incorporates a nonconvex low-rank and group-sparse structure, leveraging group sparsity to effectively harness valuable information embedded in the residual data. Moreover, the NLRGS model can further enhance fusion performance based on the RAF model. Subsequently, the RAF-NLRGS model is solved within the framework of Generalized Gauss-Newton (GGN) algorithm and Proximal Alternating Optimization (PAO) algorithm. Theoretically, we establish the error bounds for the NLRGS model and the convergence analysis of corresponding algorithms is also presented. Finally, extensive numerical experiments on HSI datasets are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Stability and Generalization for Stochastic Recursive Momentum-based Algorithms for (Strongly-)Convex One to $K$-Level Stochastic Optimizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: STOchastic Recursive Momentum (STORM)-based algorithms have been widely developed to solve one to $K$-level ($K \geq 3$) stochastic optimization problems. Specifically, they use estimators to mitigate the biased gradient issue and achieve near-optimal convergence results. However, there is relatively little work on understanding their generalization performance, particularly evident during the transition from one to $K$-level optimization contexts. This paper provides a comprehensive generalization analysis of three representative STORM-based algorithms: STORM, COVER, and SVMR, for one, two, and $K$-level stochastic optimizations under both convex and strongly convex settings based on algorithmic stability. Firstly, we define stability for $K$-level optimizations and link it to generalization. Then, we detail the stability results for three prominent STORM-based algorithms. Finally, we derive their excess risk bounds by balancing stability results with optimization errors. Our theoretical results provide strong evidence to complete STORM-based algorithms: (1) Each estimator may decrease their stability due to variance with its estimation target. (2) Every additional level might escalate the generalization error, influenced by the stability and the variance between its cumulative stochastic gradient and the true gradient. (3) Increasing the batch size for the initial computation of estimators presents a favorable trade-off, enhancing the generalization performance.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of computing the value function from a discretely-observed trajectory of a continuous-time diffusion process. We develop a new class of algorithms based on easily implementable numerical schemes that are compatible with discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation. We establish high-order numerical accuracy as well as the approximation error guarantees for the proposed approach. In contrast to discrete-time RL problems where the approximation factor depends on the effective horizon, we obtain a bounded approximation factor using the underlying elliptic structures, even if the effective horizon diverges to infinity.</description>

Abstract: The cone of nonnegative polynomials is of fundamental importance in real algebraic geometry, but its facial structure is understood in very few cases. We initiate a systematic study of the facial structure of the cone of nonnegative polynomials $\pos$ on a smooth real projective curve $X$. We show that there is a duality between its faces and totally real effective divisors on $X$. This allows us to fully describe the face lattice in case $X$ has genus $1$. The dual cone $\pos^\vee$ is known as the moment cone, and it plays an important role in real analysis. We compute the Carath\'{e}odory number of $\pos^\vee$ for an elliptic normal curve $X$, which measures the complexity of quadrature rules of measures supported on $X$. This number can also be interpreted as a maximal typical Waring rank with nonnegative coefficients. Interestingly, the topology of the real locus of $X$ influences the Carath\'{e}odory number of $\pos^\vee$. We apply our results to truncated moment problems on affine cubic curves, where we deduce sharp bounds on the flat extension degree.</description>

      <title>$\Gamma$-Limsup estimate for a nonlocal approximation of the Willmore functional</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a possible nonlocal approximation of the Willmore functional, in the sense of Gamma-convergence, based on the first variation ot the fractional Allen-Cahn energies, and we prove the corresponding $\Gamma$-limsup estimate. Our analysis is based on the expansion of the fractional Laplacian in Fermi coordinates and fine estimates on the decay of higher order derivatives of the one-dimensional nonlocal optimal profile. This result is the nonlocal counterpart of that obtained by Bellettini and Paolini, where they proposed a phase-field approximation of the Willmore functional based on the first variation of the (local) Allen-Cahn energies.</description>

      <title>Delay-Aware Robust Edge Network Hardening Under Decision-Dependent Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge computing promises to offer low-latency and ubiquitous computation to numerous devices at the network edge. For delay-sensitive applications, link delays can have a direct impact on service quality. These delays can fluctuate drastically over time due to various factors such as network congestion, changing traffic conditions, cyberattacks, component failures, and natural disasters. Thus, it is crucial to efficiently harden the edge network to mitigate link delay variation as well as ensure a stable and improved user experience. To this end, we propose a novel robust model for optimal edge network hardening, considering the link delay uncertainty. Departing from the existing literature that treats uncertainties as exogenous, our model incorporates an endogenous uncertainty set to properly capture the impact of hardening and workload allocation decisions on link delays. However, the endogenous set introduces additional complexity to the problem due to the interdependence between decisions and uncertainties. We present two efficient methods to transform the problem into a solvable form. Extensive numerical results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Algorithms for Constrained Nonconvex-Nonconcave Min-Max Optimization and Comonotone Inclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05248v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study constrained comonotone min-max optimization, a structured class of nonconvex-nonconcave min-max optimization problems, and their generalization to comonotone inclusion. In our first contribution, we extend the Extra Anchored Gradient (EAG) algorithm, originally proposed by Yoon and Ryu (2021) for unconstrained min-max optimization, to constrained comonotone min-max optimization and comonotone inclusion, achieving an optimal convergence rate of $O\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)$ among all first-order methods. Additionally, we prove that the algorithm's iterations converge to a point in the solution set. In our second contribution, we extend the Fast Extra Gradient (FEG) algorithm, as developed by Lee and Kim (2021), to constrained comonotone min-max optimization and comonotone inclusion, achieving the same $O\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)$ convergence rate. This rate is applicable to the broadest set of comonotone inclusion problems yet studied in the literature. Our analyses are based on simple potential function arguments, which might be useful for analyzing other accelerated algorithms.</description>

      <title>Constrained Shortest-Path Reformulations via Decision Diagrams for Structured Two-stage Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.12962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many discrete optimization problems are amenable to constrained shortest-path reformulations in an extended network space, a technique that has been key in convexification, bound strengthening, and search. In this paper, we propose a constrained variant of these models for two challenging classes of discrete two-stage optimization problems, where traditional methods (e.g., dualize-and-combine) are not applicable compared to their continuous counterparts. Specifically, we propose a framework that models problems as decision diagrams and introduces side constraints either as linear inequalities in the underlying polyhedral representation, or as state variables in shortest-path dynamic programming models. For our first structured class, we investigate two-stage problems with interdiction constraints. We show that such constraints can be formulated as indicator functions in the arcs of the diagram, providing an alternative single-level reformulation of the problem via a network-flow representation. Our second structured class is classical robust optimization, where we leverage the decision diagram network to iteratively identify label variables, akin to an L-shaped method. We evaluate these strategies on a competitive project selection problem and the robust traveling salesperson with time windows, observing considerable improvements in computational efficiency as compared to general methods in the respective areas.</description>

      <title>Improved Global Guarantees for the Nonconvex Burer--Monteiro Factorization via Rank Overparameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider minimizing a twice-differentiable, $L$-smooth, and $\mu$-strongly convex objective $\phi$ over an $n\times n$ positive semidefinite matrix $M\succeq0$, under the assumption that the minimizer $M^{\star}$ has low rank $r^{\star}\ll n$. Following the Burer--Monteiro approach, we instead minimize the nonconvex objective $f(X)=\phi(XX^{T})$ over a factor matrix $X$ of size $n\times r$. This substantially reduces the number of variables from $O(n^{2})$ to as few as $O(n)$ and also enforces positive semidefiniteness for free, but at the cost of giving up the convexity of the original problem. In this paper, we prove that if the search rank $r\ge r^{\star}$ is overparameterized by a \emph{constant factor} with respect to the true rank $r^{\star}$, namely as in $r&gt;\frac{1}{4}(L/\mu-1)^{2}r^{\star}$, then despite nonconvexity, local optimization is guaranteed to globally converge from any initial point to the global optimum. This significantly improves upon a previous rank overparameterization threshold of $r\ge n$, which we show is sharp in the absence of smoothness and strong convexity, but would increase the number of variables back up to $O(n^{2})$. Conversely, without rank overparameterization, we prove that such a global guarantee is possible if and only if $\phi$ is almost perfectly conditioned, with a condition number of $L/\mu&lt;3$. Therefore, we conclude that a small amount of overparameterization can lead to large improvements in theoretical guarantees for the nonconvex Burer--Monteiro factorization.</description>

      <title>Towards Improving Unit Commitment Economics: An Add-On Tailor for Renewable Energy and Reserve Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13065v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generally, day-ahead unit commitment (UC) is conducted in a predict-then-optimize process: it starts by predicting the renewable energy source (RES) availability and system reserve requirements; given the predictions, the UC model is then optimized to determine the economic operation plans. In fact, predictions within the process are raw. In other words, if the predictions are further tailored to assist UC in making the economic operation plans against realizations of the RES and reserve requirements, UC economics will benefit significantly. To this end, this paper presents a cost-oriented tailor of RES-and-reserve predictions for UC, deployed as an add-on to the predict-then-optimize process. The RES-and-reserve tailor is trained by solving a bi-level mixed-integer programming model: the upper level trains the tailor based on its induced operating cost; the lower level, given tailored predictions, mimics the system operation process and feeds the induced operating cost back to the upper level; finally, the upper level evaluates the training quality according to the fed-back cost. Through this training, the tailor learns to customize the raw predictions into cost-oriented predictions. Moreover, the tailor can be embedded into the existing predict-then-optimize process as an add-on, improving the UC economics. Lastly, the presented method is compared to traditional, binary-relaxation, neural network-based, stochastic, and robust methods.</description>

      <title>On the Relationship Between the Value Function and the Efficient Frontier of a Mixed Integer Linear Optimization Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00785v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the connection between the efficient frontier (EF) of a general multiobjective mixed integer linear optimization problem (MILP) and the so-called restricted value function (RVF) of a closely related single-objective MILP. In the first part of the paper, we detail the mathematical structure of the RVF, including characterizing the set of points at which it is differentiable, the gradients at such points, and the subdifferential at all nondifferentiable points. We then show that the EF of the multiobjective MILP is comprised of points on the boundary of the epigraph of the RVF and that any description of the EF suffices to describe the RVF and vice versa. Because of the close relationship of the RVF to the EF, we observe that methods for constructing the so-called value function (VF) of an MILP and methods for constructing the EF of a multiobjective optimization problem are effectively interchangeable. Exploiting this observation, we propose a generalized cutting-plane algorithm for constructing the EF of a multiobjective MILP that arises from an existing algorithm for constructing the classical MILP VF. The algorithm identifies the set of all integer parts of solutions on the EF. We prove that the algorithm converges finitely under a standard boundedness assumption and comes with a performance guarantee if terminated early.</description>

      <title>The Nonstationary Newsvendor with (and without) Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07993v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classic newsvendor model yields an optimal decision for a "newsvendor" selecting a quantity of inventory, under the assumption that the demand is drawn from a known distribution. Motivated by applications such as cloud provisioning and staffing, we consider a setting in which newsvendor-type decisions must be made sequentially, in the face of demand drawn from a stochastic process that is both unknown and nonstationary. All prior work on this problem either (a) assumes that the level of nonstationarity is known, or (b) imposes additional statistical assumptions that enable accurate predictions of the unknown demand.
  We study the Nonstationary Newsvendor, with and without predictions. We first, in the setting without predictions, design a policy which we prove (via matching upper and lower bounds) achieves order-optimal regret -- ours is the first policy to accomplish this without being given the level of nonstationarity of the underlying demand. We then, for the first time, introduce a model for generic (i.e. with no statistical assumptions) predictions with arbitrary accuracy, and propose a policy that incorporates these predictions without being given their accuracy. We upper bound the regret of this policy, and show that it matches the best achievable regret had the accuracy of the predictions been known. Finally, we empirically validate our new policy with experiments based on three real-world datasets containing thousands of time-series, showing that it succeeds in closing approximately 74% of the gap between the best approaches based on nonstationarity and predictions alone.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Chordal Conversion for Sparse Semidefinite Programs with Small Treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If a sparse semidefinite program (SDP), specified over $n\times n$ matrices and subject to $m$ linear constraints, has an aggregate sparsity graph $G$ with small treewidth, then chordal conversion will sometimes allow an interior-point method to solve the SDP in just $O(m+n)$ time per-iteration, which is a significant speedup over the $\Omega(n^{3})$ time per-iteration for a direct application of the interior-point method. Unfortunately, the speedup is not guaranteed by an $O(1)$ treewidth in $G$ that is independent of $m$ and $n$, as a diagonal SDP would have treewidth zero but can still necessitate up to $\Omega(n^{3})$ time per-iteration. Instead, we construct an extended aggregate sparsity graph $\bar{G}\supseteq G$ by forcing each constraint matrix $A_{i}$ to be its own clique in $G$. We prove that a small treewidth in $\bar{G}$ does indeed guarantee that chordal conversion will solve the SDP in $O(m+n)$ time per-iteration, to $\epsilon$-accuracy in at most $O(\sqrt{m+n}\log(1/\epsilon))$ iterations. This sufficient condition covers many successful applications of chordal conversion, including the MAX-$k$-CUT relaxation, the Lov\'asz theta problem, sensor network localization, polynomial optimization, and the AC optimal power flow relaxation, thus allowing theory to match practical experience.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Recursive Optimal Control of McKean-Vlasov Type: A Viscosity Solution Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a kind of optimal control problem for forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs for short) of McKean--Vlasov type via the dynamic programming principle (DPP for short) motivated by studying the infinite dimensional Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB for short) equation derived from the decoupling field of the FBSDEs posed by Carmona and Delarue (\emph{Ann Probab}, 2015, \cite{cd15}). At the beginning, the value function is defined by the solution to the controlled BSDE alluded to earlier. On one hand, we can prove the value function is deterministic function with respect to the initial random variable; On the other hand, we can show that the value function is \emph{law-invariant}, i.e., depending on only via its distribution by virtue of BSDE property. Afterward, utilizing the notion of differentiability with respect to probability measures introduced by P.L. Lions \cite{Lions2012}, we are able to establish a DPP for the value function in the Wasserstein space of probability measures based on the application of BSDE approach, particularly, employing the notion of stochastic \emph{backward semigroups} associated with stochastic optimal control problems and It\^{o} formula along a flow property of the conditional law of the controlled forward state process. We prove that the value function is the unique viscosity solutions of the associated generalized HJB equations in some separable Hilbert space. Finally, as an application, we formulate an optimal control problem for linear stochastic differential equations with quadratic cost functionals of McKean-Vlasov type under nonlinear expectation, $g$-expectation introduced by Peng \cite{Peng04} and derive the optimal feedback control explicitly by means of several groups of Riccati equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10506v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on a class of binary orthogonal optimization problems frequently arising in semantic hashing. Consider that this class of problems may have an empty feasible set, rendering them not well-defined. We introduce an equivalent model involving a restricted Stiefel manifold and a matrix box set, and then investigate its penalty problems induced by the $\ell_1$-distance from the box set and its Moreau envelope. The two penalty problems are always well-defined. Moreover, they serve as the global exact penalties provided that the original feasible set is non-empty. Notably, the penalty problem induced by the Moreau envelope is a smooth optimization over an embedded submanifold with a favorable structure. We develop a retraction-based line-search Riemannian gradient method to address the penalty problem. Finally, the proposed method is applied to supervised and unsupervised hashing tasks and is compared with several popular methods on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The numerical comparisons reveal that our algorithm is significantly superior to other solvers in terms of feasibility violation, and it is comparable even superior to others in terms of evaluation metrics related to the Hamming distance.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Proximal Point Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study a nonlinear dual space preconditioning approach for the relaxed Proximal Point Algorithm (PPA) with application to monotone inclusions, called anisotropic PPA. The algorithm is an instance of Luque's nonlinear PPA wherein the nonlinear preconditioner is chosen as the gradient of a Legendre convex function. Since the preconditioned operator is nonmonotone in general, convergence cannot be shown using standard arguments, unless the preconditioner exhibits isotropy (preserves directions) as in existing literature. To address the broader applicability we show convergence along subsequences invoking a Bregman version of Fej\`er-monotonicity in the dual space. Via a nonlinear generalization of Moreau's decomposition for operators, we provide a dual interpretation of the algorithm in terms of a forward iteration applied to a $D$-firmly nonexpansive mapping which involves the Bregman resolvent. For a suitable preconditioner, convergence rates of arbitrary order are derived under a mild H\"older growth condition. Finally, we discuss an anisotropic generalization of the proximal augmented Lagrangian method obtained via the propsed scheme. This has strong connections to Rockafellar's generalized and sharp Lagrangian functions.</description>

Abstract: This paper concentrates on decentralized composite optimization for strongly convex functions. Decentralized optimization, renowned for its robustness to network variations and the absence of a central server communication bottleneck, has garnered considerable interest in signal processing, control, and optimization communities. Although numerous algorithms have been proposed for smooth and strongly convex objective functions in recent years, the development of an optimal algorithm that includes a non-smooth regularization term remains an unresolved challenge in decentralized optimization. This paper bridges the divide between smooth decentralized optimization and decentralized composite optimization, introducing the first algorithm capable of achieving optimal computational and communication complexities. Moreover, our experimental results substantiate the efficacy and efficiency of our algorithm in both computation and communication aspects.</description>

      <title>The optimizing mode classification stabilization of sampled stochastic jump systems via an improved hill-climbing algorithm based on Q-learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the stabilization problem of stochastic jump systems (SJSs) closed by a generally sampled controller. Because of the controller's switching and state both sampled, it is challenging to study its stabilization. A new stabilizing method deeply depending on the mode classifications is proposed to deal with the above sampling situation, whose quantity is equal to a Stirling number of the second kind. For the sake of finding the best stabilization effect among all the classifications, a convex optimization problem is developed, whose globally solution is proved to be existent and can be computed by an augmented Lagrangian function. More importantly, in order to further reduce the computation complexity but retaining a better performance as much as possible, a novelly improved hill-climbing algorithm is established by applying the Q-learning technique to provide an optimal attenuation coefficient. A numerical example is offered so as to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the methods proposed in this study.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space-Valued LQ Mean Field Games: An Infinite-Dimensional Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of linear-quadratic (LQ) mean field games (MFGs) in Hilbert spaces, generalizing the classic LQ MFG theory to scenarios involving $N$ agents with dynamics governed by infinite-dimensional stochastic equations. In this framework, both state and control processes of each agent take values in separable Hilbert spaces. All agents are coupled through the average state of the population which appears in their linear dynamics and quadratic cost functional. Specifically, the dynamics of each agent incorporates an infinite-dimensional noise, namely a $Q$-Wiener process, and an unbounded operator. The diffusion coefficient of each agent is stochastic involving the state, control, and average state processes. We first study the well-posedness of a system of $N$ coupled semilinear infinite-dimensional stochastic evolution equations establishing the foundation of MFGs in Hilbert spaces. We then specialize to $N$-player LQ games described above and study the asymptotic behaviour as the number of agents, $N$, approaches infinity. We develop an infinite-dimensional variant of the Nash Certainty Equivalence principle and characterize a unique Nash equilibrium for the limiting MFG. Finally, we study the connections between the $N$-player game and the limiting MFG, demonstrating that the empirical average state converges to the mean field and that the resulting limiting best-response strategies form an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium for the $N$-player game in Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Model-Based Control Methodology for Glycemic Management in the Intensive Care Unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intensive care unit (ICU) patients exhibit erratic blood glucose (BG) fluctuations, including hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic episodes, and require exogenous insulin delivery to keep their BG in healthy ranges. Glycemic control via glycemic management (GM) is associated with reduced mortality and morbidity in the ICU, but GM increases the cognitive load on clinicians. The availability of robust, accurate, and actionable clinical decision support (CDS) tools reduces this burden and assists in the decision-making process to improve health outcomes. Clinicians currently follow GM protocol flow charts for patient intravenous insulin delivery rate computations. We present a mechanistic model-based control algorithm that predicts the optimal intravenous insulin rate to keep BG within a target range; the goal is to develop this approach for eventual use within CDS systems. In this control framework, we employed a stochastic model representing BG dynamics in the ICU setting and used the linear quadratic Gaussian control methodology to develop a controller. We designed two experiments, one using virtual (simulated) patients and one using a real-world retrospective dataset. Using these, we evaluate the safety and efficacy of this model-based glycemic control methodology. The presented controller avoids hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in virtual patients, maintaining BG levels in the target range more consistently than two existing GM protocols. Moreover, this methodology could theoretically prevent a large proportion of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events recorded in a real-world retrospective dataset.</description>

      <title>Prediction techniques for dynamic imaging with online primal-dual methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online optimisation facilitates the solution of dynamic inverse problems, such as image stabilisation, fluid flow monitoring, and dynamic medical imaging. In this paper, we improve upon previous work on predictive online primal-dual methods on two fronts. Firstly, we provide a more concise analysis that symmetrises previously unsymmetric regret bounds, and relaxes previous restrictive conditions on the dual predictor. Secondly, based on the latter, we develop several improved dual predictors. We numerically demonstrate their efficacy in image stabilisation and dynamic positron emission tomography.</description>

      <title>Specifying a Game-Theoretic Extensive Form as an Abstract 5-ary Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.10801v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper specifies an extensive form as a 5-ary relation (that is, as a set of quintuples) which satisfies eight abstract axioms. Each quintuple is understood to list a player, a situation (that is, a name for an information set), a decision node, an action, and a successor node. Accordingly, the axioms are understood to specify abstract relationships between players, situations, nodes, and actions. Such an extensive form is called a "pentaform". Finally, a "pentaform game" is defined to be a pentaform together with utility functions.
  To ground this new specification in the literature, the paper defines the concept of a "traditional game" to represent the literature's many specifications of finite-horizon and infinite-horizon games. The paper's main result is to construct an intuitive bijection between pentaform games and traditional games. Secondary results concern disaggregating pentaforms by subsets, constructing pentaforms by unions, and initial pentaform applications to Selten subgames and perfect-recall (an extensive application to dynamic programming is in Streufert 2023, arXiv:2302.03855).</description>

      <title>An active learning method for solving competitive multi-agent decision-making and control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12561v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To identify a stationary action profile for a population of competitive agents, each executing private strategies, we introduce a novel active-learning scheme where a centralized external observer (or entity) can probe the agents' reactions and recursively update simple local parametric estimates of the action-reaction mappings. Under very general working assumptions (not even assuming that a stationary profile exists), sufficient conditions are established to assess the asymptotic properties of the proposed active learning methodology so that, if the parameters characterizing the action-reaction mappings converge, a stationary action profile is achieved. Such conditions hence act also as certificates for the existence of such a profile. Extensive numerical simulations involving typical competitive multi-agent control and decision-making problems illustrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed learning-based approach.</description>

      <title>Data-based system representations from irregularly measured data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-parametric representations of dynamical systems based on the image of a Hankel matrix of data are extensively used for data-driven control. However, if samples of data are missing, obtaining such representations becomes a difficult task. By exploiting the kernel structure of Hankel matrices of irregularly measured data generated by a linear time-invariant system, we provide computational methods for which any complete finite-length behavior of the system can be obtained. For the special case of periodically missing outputs, we provide conditions on the input such that the former result is guaranteed. In the presence of noise in the data, our method returns an approximate finite-length behavior of the system. We illustrate our result with several examples, including its use for approximate data completion in real-world applications and compare it to alternative methods.</description>

      <title>Sparse Submodular Function Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the problem of minimizing a submodular function $f : 2^V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that is guaranteed to have a $k$-sparse minimizer. We give a deterministic algorithm that computes an additive $\epsilon$-approximate minimizer of such $f$ in $\widetilde{O}(\mathsf{poly}(k) \log(|f|/\epsilon))$ parallel depth using a polynomial number of queries to an evaluation oracle of $f$, where $|f| = \max_{S \subseteq V} |f(S)|$. Further, we give a randomized algorithm that computes an exact minimizer of $f$ with high probability using $\widetilde{O}(|V| \cdot \mathsf{poly}(k))$ queries and polynomial time. When $k = \widetilde{O}(1)$, our algorithms use either nearly-constant parallel depth or a nearly-linear number of evaluation oracle queries. All previous algorithms for this problem either use $\Omega(|V|)$ parallel depth or $\Omega(|V|^2)$ queries.
  In contrast to state-of-the-art weakly-polynomial and strongly-polynomial time algorithms for SFM, our algorithms use first-order optimization methods, e.g., mirror descent and follow the regularized leader. We introduce what we call {\em sparse dual certificates}, which encode information on the structure of sparse minimizers, and both our parallel and sequential algorithms provide new algorithmic tools for allowing first-order optimization methods to efficiently compute them. Correspondingly, our algorithm does not invoke fast matrix multiplication or general linear system solvers and in this sense is more combinatorial than previous state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Fast Neighborhood Search Heuristics for the Colored Bin Packing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Colored Bin Packing Problem (CBPP) is a generalization of the Bin Packing Problem (BPP). The CBPP consists of packing a set of items, each with a weight and a color, in bins of limited capacity, minimizing the number of used bins and satisfying the constraint that two items of the same color cannot be packed side by side in the same bin. In this article, we proposed an adaptation of BPP heuristics and new heuristics for the CBPP. Moreover, we propose a set of fast neighborhood search algorithms for CBPP. These neighborhoods are applied in a meta-heuristic approach based on the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) and a matheuristic approach that combines linear programming with the meta-heuristics VNS and Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search (GRASP). The results indicate that our matheuristic is superior to VNS and that both approaches can find near-optimal solutions for a large number of instances, even for those with many items.</description>

      <title>Blending Data-Driven Priors in Dynamic Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As intelligent robots like autonomous vehicles become increasingly deployed in the presence of people, the extent to which these systems should leverage model-based game-theoretic planners versus data-driven policies for safe, interaction-aware motion planning remains an open question. Existing dynamic game formulations assume all agents are task-driven and behave optimally. However, in reality, humans tend to deviate from the decisions prescribed by these models, and their behavior is better approximated under a noisy-rational paradigm. In this work, we investigate a principled methodology to blend a data-driven reference policy with an optimization-based game-theoretic policy. We formulate KLGame, an algorithm for solving non-cooperative dynamic game with Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization with respect to a general, stochastic, and possibly multi-modal reference policy. Our method incorporates, for each decision maker, a tunable parameter that permits modulation between task-driven and data-driven behaviors. We propose an efficient algorithm for computing multi-modal approximate feedback Nash equilibrium strategies of KLGame in real time. Through a series of simulated and real-world autonomous driving scenarios, we demonstrate that KLGame policies can more effectively incorporate guidance from the reference policy and account for noisily-rational human behaviors versus non-regularized baselines.

      <title>Incentive-Compatible Vertiport Reservation in Advanced Air Mobility: An Auction-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of advanced air mobility (AAM) is expected to become a multibillion-dollar industry in the near future. Market-based mechanisms are touted to be an integral part of AAM operations, which comprise heterogeneous operators with private valuations. In this work, we study the problem of designing a mechanism to coordinate the movement of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, operated by multiple operators each having heterogeneous valuations associated with their fleet, between vertiports, while enforcing the arrival, departure, and parking constraints at vertiports. Particularly, we propose an incentive-compatible and individually rational vertiport reservation mechanism that maximizes a social welfare metric, which encapsulates the objective of maximizing the overall valuations of all operators while minimizing the congestion at vertiports. Additionally, we improve the computational tractability of designing the reservation mechanism by proposing a mixed binary linear programming approach that is based on constructing network flow graph corresponding to the underlying problem.</description>

      <title>Alon's transmitting problem and multicolor Beck--Spencer Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hamming graph $H(n,q)$ is defined on the vertex set $\{1,2,\ldots,q\}^n$ and two vertices are adjacent if and only if they differ in precisely one coordinate. Alon proved that for any sequence $v_1,\ldots,v_b$ of $b=\lceil\frac n2\rceil$ vertices of $H(n,2)$, there is a vertex whose distance from $v_i$ is at least $b-i+1$ for all $1\leq i\leq b$. In this note, we prove that for any $q\geq 3$ and any sequence $v_1,\ldots,v_b$ of $b=\lfloor(1-\frac1q)n\rfloor$ vertices of $H(n,q)$, there is a vertex whose distance from $v_i$ is at least $b-i+1$ for all $1\leq i\leq b$.
  Alon used the Beck--Spencer Lemma which, in turn, was based on the floating variable method introduced by Beck and Fiala who studied combinatorial discrepancies. For our proof, we extend the Beck--Spencer Lemma by using a multicolor version of the floating variable method due to Doerr and Srivastav.</description>
