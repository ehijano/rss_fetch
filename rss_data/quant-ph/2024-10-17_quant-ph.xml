      <title>Instability of steady-state mixed-state symmetry-protected topological order to strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental progress in controlling open quantum systems enables the pursuit of mixed-state nonequilibrium quantum phases. We investigate whether open quantum systems hosting mixed-state symmetry-protected topological states as steady states retain this property under symmetric perturbations. Focusing on the decohered cluster state -- a mixed-state symmetry-protected topological state protected by a combined strong and weak symmetry -- we construct a parent Lindbladian that hosts it as a steady state. This Lindbladian can be mapped onto exactly solvable reaction-diffusion dynamics, even in the presence of certain perturbations, allowing us to solve the parent Lindbladian in detail and reveal previously-unknown steady states. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we find that typical symmetric perturbations cause strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking at arbitrarily small perturbations, destabilize the steady-state mixed-state symmetry-protected topological order. However, when perturbations introduce only weak symmetry defects, the steady-state mixed-state symmetry-protected topological order remains stable. Additionally, we construct a quantum channel which replicates the essential physics of the Lindbladian and can be efficiently simulated using only Clifford gates, Pauli measurements, and feedback.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Stabilization of Floquet States Using Static Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floquet engineering, in which the properties of a quantum system are modified through the application of strong periodic drives, is an indispensable tool in atomic and condensed matter systems. However, it is inevitably limited by intrinsic heating processes. We describe a simple autonomous scheme, which exploits a static coupling between the driven system and a lossy auxiliary, to cool large classes of Floquet systems into desired states. We present experimental and theoretical evidence for the stabilization of a chosen quasienergy state in a strongly modulated transmon qubit coupled to an auxiliary microwave cavity with fixed frequency and photon loss. The scheme naturally extends to Floquet systems with multiple degrees of freedom. As an example, we demonstrate the stabilization of topological photon pumping in a driven cavity-QED system numerically. The coupling to the auxiliary cavity increases the average photon current and the fidelity of non-classical states, such as high photon number Fock states, that can be prepared in the system cavity.</description>

      <title>Composable free-space continuous-variable quantum key distribution using discrete modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD) allows for quantum secure communication with the benefit of being close to existing classical coherent communication. In recent years, CV QKD protocols using a discrete number of displaced coherent states have been studied intensively, as the modulation can be directly implemented with real devices with a finite digital resolution. However, the experimental demonstrations until now only calculated key rates in the asymptotic regime. To be used in cryptographic applications, a QKD system has to generate keys with composable security in the finite-size regime. In this paper, we present a CV QKD system using discrete modulation that is especially designed for urban atmospheric channels. For this, we use polarization encoding to cope with the turbulent but non-birefringent atmosphere. This will allow to expand CV QKD networks beyond the existing fiber backbone. In a first laboratory demonstration, we implemented a novel type of security proof allowing to calculate composable finite-size key rates against i.i.d. collective attacks without any Gaussian assumptions. We applied the full QKD protocol including a QRNG, error correction and privacy amplification to extract secret keys. In particular, we studied the impact of frame errors on the actual key generation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Boltzmann machine learning of ground-state energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the ground-state energy of Hamiltonians is a fundamental task for which it is believed that quantum computers can be helpful. Several approaches have been proposed toward this goal, including algorithms based on quantum phase estimation and hybrid quantum-classical optimizers involving parameterized quantum circuits, the latter falling under the umbrella of the variational quantum eigensolver. Here, we analyze the performance of quantum Boltzmann machines for this task, which is a less explored ansatz based on parameterized thermal states and which is not known to suffer from the barren-plateau problem. We delineate a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for this task and rigorously prove that it converges to an $\varepsilon$-approximate stationary point of the energy function optimized over parameter space, while using a number of parameterized-thermal-state samples that is polynomial in $\varepsilon^{-1}$, the number of parameters, and the norm of the Hamiltonian being optimized. Our algorithm estimates the gradient of the energy function efficiently by means of a novel quantum circuit construction that combines classical sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test, thus overcoming a key obstacle to quantum Boltzmann machine learning that has been left open since [Amin \textit{et al.}, Phys.~Rev.~X \textbf{8}, 021050 (2018)]. Additionally supporting our main claims are calculations of the gradient and Hessian of the energy function, as well as an upper bound on the matrix elements of the latter that is used in the convergence analysis.</description>

      <title>Single-shot and measurement-based quantum error correction via fault complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonics provides a viable path to a scalable fault-tolerant quantum computer. The natural framework for this platform is measurement-based quantum computation, where fault-tolerant graph states supersede traditional quantum error-correcting codes. However, the existing formalism for foliation - the construction of fault-tolerant graph states - does not reveal how certain properties, such as single-shot error correction, manifest in the measurement-based setting. We introduce the fault complex, a representation of dynamic quantum error correction protocols particularly well-suited to describe foliation. Our approach enables precise computation of fault tolerance properties of foliated codes and provides insights into circuit-based quantum computation. Analyzing the fault complex leads to improved thresholds for three- and four-dimensional toric codes, a generalization of stability experiments, and the existence of single-shot lattice surgery with higher-dimensional topological codes.</description>

      <title>p-Adic quantum mechanics, infinite potential wells, and continuous-time quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article discusses a p-adic version of the infinite potential well in quantum mechanics (QM). This model describes the confinement of a particle in a p-adic ball. We rigorously solve the Cauchy problem for the Schr\"odinger equation and determine the stationary solutions. The p-adic balls are fractal objects. By dividing a p-adic ball into a finite number of sub-balls and using the wavefunctions of the infinite potential well, we construct a continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW) on a fully connected graph, where each vertex corresponds to a sub-ball in the partition of the original ball. In this way, we establish a connection between p-adic QM and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Satellite-Terrestrial Quantum Networks and the Global Quantum Internet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper will explore the design and implementation of quantum networks in space integrated with quantum networks on Earth. We propose a three-layer approach, involving GEO and LEO satellites integrated with terrestrial ground stations. We first analyze the channel conditions between the three layers, and then highlight the key role of LEO satellites in the integrated space-terrestrial system - namely the source of entanglement distribution between specified terrestrial stations via direct downlink quantum-optical channels. The GEO satellites in the considered system are used primarily as coordination stations, managing and directing the LEO satellites regarding the positioning and timing of entanglement distribution. Complexity, in the form of entanglement distillation and quantum-state correction, is concentrated at the terrestrial stations, and teleportation is used as the primary quantum channel in the LEO uplinks and the inter-terrestrial channels. Although our designs are futuristic in that they assume limited quantum memory at the transceivers, we also discuss some near-term uses of our network in which no quantum memory is available.</description>

      <title>Cost-Effective Realization of n-Bit Toffoli Gates for IBM Quantum Computers Using the Bloch Sphere Approach and IBM Native Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cost-effective n-bit Toffoli gate is proposed to be realized (or transpiled) based on the layouts (linear, T-like, and I-like) and the number of n physical qubits for IBM quantum computers. This proposed gate is termed the "layout-aware n-bit Toffoli gate". The layout-aware n-bit Toffoli gate is designed using the visual approach of the Bloch sphere, from the visual representations of the rotational quantum operations for IBM native gates. In this paper, we also proposed a new formula for the quantum cost, which calculates the total number of native gates, the crossing connections, and the depth of the final transpiled quantum circuit. This formula is termed the "transpilation quantum cost". After transpilation, our proposed layout-aware n-bit Toffoli gate always has a much lower transpilation quantum cost than that of the conventional n-bit Toffoli gate, where 3 &lt;= n &lt;= 7 qubits, for different IBM quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We look for all linear isomorphisms from the mapping spaces onto the tensor products of matrices which send $k$-superpositive maps onto unnormalized bi-partite states of Schmidt numbers less than or equal to $k$. They also send $k$-positive maps onto $k$-block-positive matrices. We also look for all the bilinear pairings between the mapping spaces and tensor products of matrices which retain the usual duality between $k$-positivity and Schmidt numbers $\le k$. They also retain the duality between $k$-superpositivity and $k$-block-positivity.</description>

      <title>Revocable Encryption, Programs, and More: The Case of Multi-Copy Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fundamental principles of quantum mechanics have inspired many new research directions, particularly in quantum cryptography. One such principle is quantum no-cloning which has led to the emerging field of revocable cryptography. Roughly speaking, in a revocable cryptographic primitive, a cryptographic object (such as a ciphertext or program) is represented as a quantum state in such a way that surrendering it effectively translates into losing the capability to use this cryptographic object. All of the revocable cryptographic systems studied so far have a major drawback: the recipient only receives one copy of the quantum state. Worse yet, the schemes become completely insecure if the recipient receives many identical copies of the same quantum state -- a property that is clearly much more desirable in practice. While multi-copy security has been extensively studied for a number of other quantum cryptographic primitives, it has so far received only little treatment in context of unclonable primitives. Our work, for the first time, shows the feasibility of revocable primitives, such as revocable encryption and revocable programs, which satisfy multi-copy security in oracle models. This suggest that the stronger notion of multi-copy security is within reach in unclonable cryptography more generally, and therefore could lead to a new research direction in the field.</description>

      <title>Quantum-classical correspondence of non-Hermitian spin-orbit coupled bosonic junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the classical-quantum correspondence of non-Hermitian Spin-orbit (SO)-coupled bosonic junctions, where an effective decay term is introduced in one of the two wells. Starting from the normalized two-point functions, we analytically demonstrate that the mean-field system has a classical Hamiltonian structure, and we successfully derive a non-Hermitian discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger (Gross-Pitaevskii) equation. We discover that near the symmetry-breaking phase transition point, the correspondence between classical (mean-field) and quantum dynamics is more likely to break down. When the effective spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength assumes half-integer values, atomic self-trapping in the non-lossy well definitely occurs, regardless of the system parameters, and the quantum dynamics is insensitive to the number of particles. Additionally, we reveal that in both the mean-field and many-particle models, the SOC effects can greatly promote the synchronous periodic oscillations between the spin-up and spin-down components, and this synchronization dynamics is protected by a symmetry mechanism.</description>

      <title>Fast-forwarding quantum algorithms for linear dissipative differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish improved complexity estimates of quantum algorithms for linear dissipative ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and show that the time dependence can be fast-forwarded to be sub-linear. Specifically, we show that a quantum algorithm based on truncated Dyson series can prepare history states of dissipative ODEs up to time $T$ with cost $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\log(T) (\log(1/\epsilon))^2 )$, which is an exponential speedup over the best previous result. For final state preparation at time $T$, we show that its complexity is $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T} (\log(1/\epsilon))^2 )$, achieving a polynomial speedup in $T$. We also analyze the complexity of simpler lower-order quantum algorithms, such as the forward Euler method and the trapezoidal rule, and find that even lower-order methods can still achieve $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ cost with respect to time $T$ for preparing final states of dissipative ODEs. As applications, we show that quantum algorithms can simulate dissipative non-Hermitian quantum dynamics and heat process with fast-forwarded complexity sub-linear in time.</description>

      <title>Topological quantum slinky motion in resonant extended Bose-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model under the resonant condition, where a series of quantum slinky oscillations occur in a two-site system for boson numbers $n\in \lbrack 2,\infty )$. In the strong interaction limit, it can be shown that the quantum slinky motions become the dominant channels for boson propagation, which are described by a set of effective non-interacting Hamiltonians. They are sets of generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains with an $n$-site unit cell, referred to as trimerization, tetramerization, and pentamerization, etc., possessing non-trivial Zak phases. The corresponding edge states are demonstrated by the $n$-boson bound states at the ends of the chains. We also investigate the dynamic detection of edge boson clusters through an analysis of quench dynamics. Numerical results indicate that stable edge oscillations clearly manifest the interaction-induced topological features within the extended Bose-Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>QuL: Programming Library for Computational Cooling of Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key hurdle to the success of quantum computers is the ability to initialize qubits into a pure state, which can be achieved by cooling qubits down to very low temperatures. Computational cooling of qubits, whereby a subset of the qubits is cooled at the expense of heating the other qubits via the application of special sets of logic gates, offers a route to effectively cool qubits. Here, we present QuL, a programming library which can be used to generate, analyze, and test quantum circuits for various computational cooling protocols. In its most basic usage, QuL enables a novice user to easily produce cooling circuits with minimal input or knowledge required. The programming library, however, offers flexibility to more advanced users to finely tune the cooling protocol used to generate the quantum circuit. Finally, QuL offers methods to assess and compare various cooling protocols for users interested in studying optimal implementation of computational cooling in general, or on specific quantum backends. It is our hope that QuL will not only facilitate the execution of computational cooling on current quantum computers, but also serve as a tool to investigate open questions in the optimal implementation of computational cooling.</description>

      <title>Quantum digital signature based on single-qubit without a trusted third-party</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital signature is a strong tool widely used in different industry areas since by using this technology, the identity of a signer can be safely authenticated by communications between the signers and verifiers. Although quantum digital signature has been extensively studied, the security still depends on a trusted third party under many existing protocols. Hence, to fit it in more actual applications, here we propose a brand new quantum digital signature protocol without a trusted third party only with qubit technology to further improve the security. We note that a quantum one-way function can work appropriately in digital signature due to the intrinsic non-cloning property for quantum states. Secret keys in the protocol are constituted by classical private keys and quantum public keys because we assume that no user is trusted in the protocol. We prove that the protocol has information-theoretical unforgeability. Moreover, it satisfies other important secure properties, including asymmetry, undeniability, and expandability.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg scaling based on population coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Heisenberg scaling of quantum metrology in the viewpoint of population coding. Although Fisher information has been used for a figure of merit to characterize Heisenberg scaling in quantum metrology, several studies pointed out it does not work as a figure of merit because it does not reflect the global structure. As an alternative figure of merit, we propose the mutual information, which connects the number of distinguishable elements of the parameter space in the viewpoint of population coding. We show that several unitary models achieve Heisenberg scaling in this context.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quantum Overlapping Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial tomography, which focuses on reconstructing reduced density matrices (RDMs), has emerged as a promising approach for characterizing complex quantum systems, particularly when full state tomography is impractical. Recently, overlapping tomography has been proposed as an efficient method for determining all $k$-qubit RDMs using logarithmic polynomial measurements, though it has not yet reached the ultimate limit. Here, we introduce a unified framework for optimal quantum overlapping tomography by mapping the problem to the clique cover model. This framework provides the most efficient and experimentally feasible measurement schemes to date, significantly reducing the measurement costs. Our approach is also applicable to determining RDMs with different topological structures. Moreover, we experimentally validate the feasibility of our schemes on practical nuclear spin processor using average measurements and further apply our method to noisy data from a superconducting quantum processor employing projection measurements. The results highlight the strong power of overlapping tomography, paving the way for advanced quantum system characterization and state property learning in the future.</description>

      <title>Architecting a reliable quantum operating system: microkernel, message passing and supercomputing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum operating system (QCOS) is a classic software running on classic hardware. The QCOS is preparing, starting, controlling and managing quantum computations. The reliable execution of fault-tolerant quantum computations will require the QCOS to be as reliable and fault-tolerant as the computation itself. In the following, we discuss why a QCOS should be architected according to the following principles: 1) using a microkernel; 2) the components are working in an aggregated, non-stacked manner and communicate by message passing; 3) the components are executed by default on supercomputers, unless there are very good reasons not to. These principles can guarantee that the execution of error-corrected, fault-tolerant quantum computation is not vulnerable to the failures of the QCOS.</description>

      <title>Super-activating quantum memory by entanglement-breaking channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is an essential resource for various quantum-information tasks. When a target system shares entanglement with another memory system and is stored reliably, one can use entanglement at a later time -- this is quantum memory. In practice, entanglement can be exceedingly fragile during a system's evolution. In particular, no entanglement can survive when a so-called entanglement-breaking channel acts on the target system. Are entanglement-breaking channels really useless for maintaining entanglement? As a single channel, this is certainly the case; it cannot be useful for quantum memory. However, in this work, we show that putting together two entanglement-breaking channels in a broadcasting scenario can activate their ability to maintain entanglement -- the channel's quantum memory resource can be super-activated.</description>

      <title>Quasi-quantum states and the quasi-quantum PCP theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce $k$-local quasi-quantum states: a superset of the regular quantum states, defined by relaxing the positivity constraint. We show that a $k$-local quasi-quantum state on $n$ qubits can be 1-1 mapped to a distribution of assignments over $n$ variables with an alphabet of size $4$, which is subject to non-linear constraints over its $k$-local marginals. Therefore, solving the $k$-local Hamiltonian over the quasi-quantum states is equivalent to optimizing a distribution of assignment over a classical $k$-local CSP. We show that this optimization problem is essentially classical by proving it is NP-complete. Crucially, just as ordinary quantum states, these distributions lack a simple tensor-product structure and are therefore not determined straightforwardly by their local marginals. Consequently, our classical optimization problem shares some unique aspects of Hamiltonian complexity: it lacks an easy search-to-decision reduction, and it is not clear that its 1D version can be solved with dynamical programming (i.e., it could remain NP-hard).
  Our main result is a PCP theorem for the $k$-local Hamiltonian over the quasi-quantum states in the form of a hardness-of-approximation result. The proof suggests the existence of a subtle promise-gap amplification procedure in a model that shares many similarities with the quantum local Hamiltonian problem, thereby providing insights on the quantum PCP conjecture.</description>

      <title>On estimating the trace of quantum state powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the computational complexity of estimating the trace of quantum state powers $\text{tr}(\rho^q)$ for an $n$-qubit mixed quantum state $\rho$, given its state-preparation circuit of size $\text{poly}(n)$. This quantity is closely related to and often interchangeable with the Tsallis entropy $\text{S}_q(\rho) = \frac{1-\text{tr}(\rho^q)}{q-1}$, where $q = 1$ corresponds to the von Neumann entropy. For any non-integer $q \geq 1 + \Omega(1)$, we provide a quantum estimator for $\text{S}_q(\rho)$ with time complexity $\text{poly}(n)$, exponentially improving the prior best results of $\exp(n)$ due to Acharya, Issa, Shende, and Wagner (ISIT 2019), Wang, Guan, Liu, Zhang, and Ying (TIT 2024), and Wang, Zhang, and Li (TIT 2024), and Wang and Zhang (ESA 2024). Our speedup is achieved by introducing efficiently computable uniform approximations of positive power functions into quantum singular value transformation.
  Our quantum algorithm reveals a sharp phase transition between the case of $q=1$ and constant $q&gt;1$ in the computational complexity of the Quantum $q$-Tsallis Entropy Difference Problem (TsallisQED$_q$), particularly deciding whether the difference $\text{S}_q(\rho_0) - \text{S}_q(\rho_1)$ is at least $0.001$ or at most $-0.001$:
  - For any $1+\Omega(1) \leq q \leq 2$, TsallisQED$_q$ is $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete, which implies that Purity Estimation is also $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete.
  - For any $1 \leq q \leq 1 + \frac{1}{n-1}$, TsallisQED$_q$ is $\mathsf{QSZK}$-hard, leading to hardness of approximating von Neumann entropy because $\text{S}_q(\rho) \leq \text{S}(\rho)$, as long as $\mathsf{BQP} \subsetneq \mathsf{QSZK}$.
  The hardness results are derived from reductions based on new inequalities for the quantum $q$-Jensen-(Shannon-)Tsallis divergence with $1\leq q \leq 2$, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Measurement-free, scalable and fault-tolerant universal quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable execution of large-scale quantum algorithms requires robust underlying operations and this challenge is addressed by quantum error correction (QEC). Most modern QEC protocols rely on measurements and feed-forward operations, which are experimentally demanding, and often slow and prone to high error rates. Additionally, no single error-correcting code intrinsically supports the full set of logical operations required for universal quantum computing, resulting in an increased operational overhead. In this work, we present a complete toolbox for fault-tolerant universal quantum computing without the need for measurements during algorithm execution by combining the strategies of code switching and concatenation. To this end, we develop new fault-tolerant, measurement-free protocols to transfer encoded information between 2D and 3D color codes, which offer complementary and in combination universal sets of robust logical gates. We identify experimentally realistic regimes where these protocols surpass state-of-the-art measurement-based approaches. Moreover, we extend the scheme to higher-distance codes by concatenating the 2D color code with itself and by integrating code switching for operations that lack a natively fault-tolerant implementation. Our measurement-free approach thereby provides a practical and scalable pathway for universal quantum computing on state-of-the-art quantum processors.</description>

      <title>The Magic in Qudit Shadow Estimation based on the Clifford Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shadow estimation is a sample-efficient protocol for learning the properties of a quantum system through randomized measurements, but the current understanding on qudit shadow estimation is quite limited compared with the qubit setting. Here we clarify the sample complexity of qudit shadow estimation based on the Clifford group, where the local dimension $d$ is an odd prime. Notably, we show that the overhead of qudit shadow estimation over the qubit counterpart is only $\mathcal{O}(d)$, which is independent of the qudit number $n$, although the set of stabilizer states may deviate exponentially from a 3-design with respect to the third moment operator. Furthermore, by adding one layer of magic gates, we propose a simple circuit that can significantly boost the efficiency. Actually, a single magic gate can already eliminate the $\mathcal{O}(d)$ overhead in qudit shadow estimation and bridge the gap from the qubit setting.</description>

      <title>Third moments of qudit Clifford orbits and 3-designs based on magic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the local dimension $d$ is an odd prime, the qudit Clifford group is only a 2-design, but not a 3-design, unlike the qubit counterpart. This distinction and its extension to Clifford orbits have profound implications for many applications in quantum information processing. In this work we systematically delve into general qudit Clifford orbits with a focus on the third moments and potential applications in shadow estimation. First, we introduce the shadow norm to quantify the deviations of Clifford orbits from 3-designs and clarify its properties. Then, we show that the third normalized frame potential and shadow norm are both $\mathcal{O}(d)$ for any Clifford orbit, including the orbit of stabilizer states, although the operator norm of the third normalized moment operator may increase exponentially with the number $n$ of qudits when $d\neq 2\mod 3$. Moreover, we prove that the shadow norm of any magic orbit is upper bounded by the constant $15/2$, so a single magic gate can already eliminate the $\mathcal{O}(d)$ overhead in qudit shadow estimation and bridge the gap between qudit systems and qubit systems. Furthermore, we propose simple recipes for constructing approximate and exact 3-designs (with respect to three figures of merit simultaneously) from one or a few Clifford orbits. Notably, accurate approximate 3-designs can be constructed from only two Clifford orbits. For an infinite family of local dimensions, exact 3-designs can be constructed from two or four Clifford orbits. In the course of study, we clarify the key properties of the commutant of the third Clifford tensor power and the underlying mathematical structures.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of the spectral gap in rotationally symmetric Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of determining the existence of a spectral gap in a lattice quantum spin system was previously shown to be undecidable for one [J. Bausch et al., "Undecidability of the spectral gap in one dimension", Physical Review X 10 (2020)] or more dimensions [T. S. Cubitt et al., "Undecidability of the spectral gap", Nature 528 (2015)]. In these works, families of nearest-neighbor interactions are constructed whose spectral gap depends on the outcome of a Turing machine Halting problem, therefore making it impossible for an algorithm to predict its existence. While these models are translationally invariant, they are not invariant under the other symmetries of the lattice, a property which is commonly found in physically relevant cases, posing the question of whether the spectral gap is still an undecidable problem for Hamiltonians with stronger symmetry constraints. We give a positive answer to this question, in the case of models with 4-body (plaquette) interactions on the square lattice satisfying rotation, but not reflection, symmetry: rotational symmetry is not enough to make the problem decidable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current NISQ era, there is demand for functional quantum devices to solve relevant computational problems, which motivates a utilitarian perspective on device design: The goal is to create a device that is able to run a given algorithm with state-of-the-art performance.
  In this work, we use optimal control tools to derive the gate set required by a toy algorithm and, in tandem, explore the model space of superconducting quantum computer design, from dispersively coupled to stronger interacting qubits, to maximize gate fidelity. We employ perfect entangler theory to provide flexibility in the search for a two-qubit gate on a given platform and to compare designs with different entangling mechanisms, e.g., $\texttt{CPHASE}$ and $\sqrt{\texttt{iSWAP}}$. To ensure the applicability of our investigation, we limit ourselves to "simple" (i.e., sparse parametrization) pulses and quantify, where results differ from using the full complexity of piecewise constant controls.</description>

Abstract: Estimating steady state properties of open quantum systems is a crucial problem in quantum technology. In this work, we show how to derive in a scalable way using semi-definite programming certified bounds on the expectation value of an arbitrary observable of interest on the steady state of Lindbladian dynamics. We illustrate our method on a series of many-body systems, including a one-dimensional chain and a two-dimensional ladder, and benchmark it with state-of-the-art tensor-network approaches. For the tested models, only modest computational effort is needed to obtain certified bounds whose precision is comparable to variational methods</description>

      <title>Photon Entangled States and Atomic Correlations in Superradiance from Multilevel Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze here the collective emission dynamics from ensembles of multilevel atoms. We show that the photonic states emitted by the multilevel atoms superradiance process exhibit entanglement in the modal (frequency) degree of freedom, making ensembles of such atoms candidates for fast and deterministic sources of entangled photons. The photonic entanglement is controlled by modifying the excitation of the atomic ensemble. This entanglement is driven by two mechanisms: (i) excitation of the atomic ensemble to a superimposed (combination) state and (ii) degeneracies of the transitions due to internal structure of the emitting atoms, resulting in intricate non-radiative virtual transitions in the ensemble, which create interatomic correlations that are imprinted onto the emitted photons. In addition, we dwell on the correlations of the superradiating atomic ensembles and their dynamics, and demonstrate a case where inter-atomic correlations exhibit beating in steady-state due to the aforementioned virtual transitions. A mode-independent entangled photon source is also demonstrated and discussed.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Framework for Nonlinear PDE Constrained Optimization Using Carleman Linearization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel variational quantum framework for nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) constrained optimization problems. The proposed work extends the recently introduced bi-level variational quantum PDE constrained optimization (BVQPCO) framework for linear PDE to a nonlinear setting by leveraging Carleman linearization (CL). CL framework allows one to transform a system of polynomial ordinary differential equations (ODE), i,e. ODE with polynomial vector field, into an system of infinite but linear system of ODE. For instance, such polynomial ODEs naturally arise when the PDE are semi-discretized in the spatial dimensions. By truncating the CL system to a finite order, one obtains a finite system of linear ODE to which the linear BVQPCO framework can be applied. In particular, the finite system of linear ODE is discretized in time and embedded as a system of linear equations. The variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) is used to solve the linear system for given optimization parameters, and evaluate the design cost/objective function, and a classical black box optimizer is used to select next set of parameter values based on this evaluated cost. We present detailed computational error and complexity analysis and prove that under suitable assumptions, our proposed framework can provide potential advantage over classical techniques. We implement our framework using the PennyLane library and apply it to solve inverse Burgers' problem. We also explore an alternative tensor product decomposition which exploits the sparsity/structure of linear system arising from PDE discretization to facilitate the computation of VQLS cost functions.</description>

Abstract: Establishing secure data communication necessitates secure key exchange over a public channel. Quantum key distribution (QKD), which leverages the principles of quantum physics, can achieve this with information-theoretic security. The discrete modulated (DM) continuous variable (CV) QKD protocol, in particular, is a suitable candidate for large-scale deployment of quantum-safe communication due to its simplicity and compatibility with standard high-speed telecommunication technology. Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of a four-state DM CVQKD system, successfully generating composable finite-size keys, secure against collective attacks over a 20 km fiber channel with 2.3 \times 10^{9} coherent quantum states, achieving a positive composable key rate of 11.04 \times 10^{-3} bits/symbol. This accomplishment is enabled by using an advanced security proof, meticulously selecting its parameters, and the fast, stable operation of the system. Our results mark a significant step toward the large-scale deployment of practical, high-performance, cost-effective, and highly secure quantum key distribution networks using standard telecommunication components.</description>

      <title>Solving eigenvalue problems obtained by the finite element method on a quantum annealer using only a few qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main obstacles for achieving a practical quantum advantage in quantum computing lies in the relatively small number of qubits currently available in quantum hardware. Here, we show how to circumvent this problem in the context of eigenvalue problems obtained by the finite element method, via the use of an adaptive algorithm for quantum annealers -- the Adaptive Quantum Annealer Eigensolver (AQAE) -- in a way that only a few qubits are required to achieve a high precision. As an example, we apply AQAE to eigenvalue problems that are relevant in a wide range of contexts, such as electromagnetism, acoustics and seismology, and quantify its robustness against different types of experimental errors. Our approach could be applied to other algorithms, and makes it possible to take the most of current Noisy-Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices.</description>

      <title>On the practicality of quantum sieving algorithms for the shortest vector problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main candidates of post-quantum cryptography is lattice-based cryptography. Its cryptographic security against quantum attackers is based on the worst-case hardness of lattice problems like the shortest vector problem (SVP), which asks to find the shortest non-zero vector in an integer lattice. Asymptotic quantum speedups for solving SVP are known and rely on Grover's search. However, to assess the security of lattice-based cryptography against these Grover-like quantum speedups, it is necessary to carry out a precise resource estimation beyond asymptotic scalings. In this work, we perform a careful analysis on the resources required to implement several sieving algorithms aided by Grover's search for dimensions of cryptographic interests. For such, we take into account fixed-point quantum arithmetic operations, non-asymptotic Grover's search, the cost of using quantum random access memory (QRAM), different physical architectures, and quantum error correction. We find that even under very optimistic assumptions like circuit-level noise of $10^{-5}$, code cycles of 100 ns, reaction time of 1 $\mu$s, and using state-of-the-art arithmetic circuits and quantum error-correction protocols, the best sieving algorithms require $\approx 10^{13}$ physical qubits and $\approx 10^{31}$ years to solve SVP on a lattice of dimension 400, which is roughly the dimension for minimally secure post-quantum cryptographic standards currently being proposed by NIST. We estimate that a 6-GHz-clock-rate single-core classical computer would take roughly the same amount of time to solve the same problem. We conclude that there is currently little to no quantum speedup in the dimensions of cryptographic interest and the possibility of realising a considerable quantum speedup using quantum sieving algorithms would require significant breakthroughs in theoretical protocols and hardware development.</description>

      <title>Observation of string-breaking dynamics in a quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous particle-pair formation is a fundamental phenomenon in nature. It can, for example, appear when the potential energy between two particles increases with separation, as if they were connected by a tense string. Beyond a critical separation, new particle pairs can form, causing the string to break. String-breaking dynamics in quantum chromodynamics play a vital role in high-energy particle collisions and early universe evolution. Simulating string evolution and hadron formation is, therefore, a grand challenge in modern physics. Quantum simulators, well-suited for studying dynamics, are expected to outperform classical computing methods. However, the required experimental capabilities to simulate string-breaking dynamics have not yet been demonstrated, even for simpler models of the strong force. We experimentally probe, for the first time, the spatiotemporal dynamics of string-breaking in a (1+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory using a fully programmable trapped-ion quantum simulator. We emulate external static charges and strings via site-dependent magnetic-field control enabled by a dual array of tightly focused laser beams targeting individual ions. First, we study how confinement affects isolated charges, finding that they freely spread without string tension but exhibit localized oscillations when tension is increased. Then, we observe and characterize string-breaking dynamics of a string stretched between two static charges after an abrupt increase in string tension. Charge pairs appear near the string edges and spread into the bulk, revealing a route to dynamical string-breaking distinct from the conventional Schwinger mechanism. Our work demonstrates that analog quantum simulators have achieved the necessary control to explore string-breaking dynamics, which may ultimately be relevant to nuclear and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>A Fourier analysis framework for approximate classical simulations of quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What makes a class of quantum circuits efficiently classically simulable on average? I present a framework that applies harmonic analysis of groups to circuits with a structure encoded by group parameters. Expanding the circuits in a suitable truncated multi-path operator basis gives algorithms to evaluate the Fourier coefficients of output distributions or expectation values that are viewed as functions on the group. Under certain conditions, a truncated Fourier series can be efficiently estimated with guaranteed mean-square convergence. For classes of noisy circuits, it leads to algorithms for sampling and mean value estimation under error models with a spectral gap, where the complexity increases exponentially with the gap's inverse and polynomially with the circuit's size. This approach unifies and extends existing algorithms for noisy parametrised or random circuits using Pauli basis paths. For classes of noiseless circuits, mean values satisfying Lipschitz continuity can be on average approximated using efficient sparse Fourier decompositions. I also discuss generalisations to homogeneous spaces, qudit systems and a way to analyse random circuits via matrix coefficients of irreducible representations.</description>

      <title>Megastable quantization in generalized pilot-wave hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical particle in a harmonic potential gives rise to a continuous energy spectra, whereas the corresponding quantum particle exhibits countably infinite quantized energy levels. In recent years, classical non-Markovian wave-particle entities that materialize as walking droplets, have been shown to exhibit various hydrodynamic quantum analogs, including quantization in a harmonic potential via limit cycle orbits. However, the number of co-existing quantized states are limited to at most a few limit cycles. By considering a minimal generalized pilot-wave model of the system in the low-memory and low-dissipation regime, we obtain a classical harmonic oscillator perturbed by an oscillatory non-conservative force that displays a countably infinite coexisting limit-cycle states, also know as \emph{megastability}; thus forming a dynamical analog of infinite quantized states. Using averaging techniques, we derive an analytical approximation of the orbital radii, orbital frequency and Lyapunov energy function, of this megastable spectrum, and further show average energy conservation along these quantized states. Our formalism extends to a general class of self-excited oscillators and can be used to construct megastable spectrum with different energy-frequency relations.</description>

      <title>Local Properties of the Rapidity Distribution in the Lieb-Liniger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the rapidity distribution in the Lieb-Liniger model and derive exact relations for its derivatives at the Fermi level. The latter enables us to treat analytically the free energy of the system at low temperatures and arbitrary interactions. We calculated the leading-order correction to the well-known result obtained using conformal field theory. In contrast to the leading-order term controlled by the sound velocity or the Luttinger liquid parameter, the new term is controlled by an additional dimensionless parameter. We calculated its series expansions in the limiting cases of weak and strong interactions. Our results are generalized to other Galilean-invariant integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Variational Scarring in Graphene Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum eigenstate of a classically chaotic system is referred as scarred by an unstable periodic orbit if its probability density is concentrated in the vicinity of that orbit. Recently, a new class of scarring - variational scarring - was discovered in numerical studies of disordered quantum dots, arising from near-degeneracies in the quantum spectrum associated with classical resonances of the unperturbed system. Despite the increasing body of theoretical evidence on variational scarring, its experimental observation has remained out of reach. Motivated by this dearth, we argue and demonstrate that variational scarring can occur in an elliptical quantum dot fabricated on monolayer graphene, and locally perturbed by a nanotip. Then, we further show that the fingerprint of these variational scars can potentially be detected via scanning tunneling microscopy, thus offering an attractive experimental pathway for the first validation of this puzzling quantum-chaotic phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Creation of Identical Monochromatic Quantum Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deterministic creation of quantum emitters with high single-photon-purity and excellent indistinguishability is essential for practical applications in quantum information science. Many successful attempts have been carried out in hexagonal boron nitride showing its capability of hosting room temperature quantum emitters. However, most of the existing methods produce emitters with heterogeneous optical properties and unclear creation mechanisms. Here, the authors report a deterministic creation of identical room temperature quantum emitters using masked-carbon-ion implantation on freestanding hBN flakes. Quantum emitters fabricated by our approach showed thermally limited monochromaticity with an emission center wavelength distribution of 590.7 +- 2.7 nm, a narrow full width half maximum of 7.1 +- 1.7 nm, excellent brightness (1MHz emission rate), and extraordinary stability. Our method provides a reliable platform for characterization and fabrication research on hBN based quantum emitters, helping to reveal the origins of the single-photon-emission behavior in hBN and favoring practical applications, especially the industrial-scale production of quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Measuring Non-Hermitian Topological Invariants Directly from Quench Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While non-Hermitian (NH) topological phases and phenomena have been observed across various quantum systems, directly measuring NH topological invariants remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a generic and unified framework for the direct measurement of various NH topological invariants in odd-dimensional systems through quench dynamics. We demonstrate that in one-dimensional (1D) NH systems with sublattice symmetry, the line-gap winding number and point-gap braiding degree can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamically constructed field based on post-quench spin textures. Specifically, line-gap topology is characterized by integer-valued winding, whereas point-gap complex-band braiding is revealed by half-integer or integer winding with abrupt jumps. We also extend our approach to higher-dimensional winding numbers and non-Bloch topological invariants under open-boundary conditions. Additionally, we propose a practical cold-atom setup to realize and detect 1D NH topological phases, showing that our dynamical measurement scheme is feasible in current experimental settings. This work paves the way for the direct measurement of NH topological invariants in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Bumpified Haar Wavelets and Tsirelson's Bound: Some Mathematical Properties and Insights from Block Toeplitz Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a recent construction using bumpified Haar wavelets to demonstrate explicit violations of the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality within the vacuum state in quantum field theory. The construction was tested for massless spinor fields in $(1+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime and is claimed to achieve violations arbitrarily close to an upper bound known as Tsirelson's bound. We show that this claim can be reduced to a mathematical conjecture involving the maximal eigenvalue of a sequence of symmetric matrices composed of integrals of Haar wavelet products. More precisely, the asymptotic eigenvalue of this sequence should approach $\pi$. We present a formal argument using a subclass of wavelets, allowing us to reach $3.11052$. Although a complete proof remains elusive, we present further compelling numerical evidence to support it.</description>

Abstract: Optical fibers constitute an attractive platform for the realization of nonlinear and quantum optics processes. Here we show, through theoretical considerations, how polarization effects of both third-order parametric down-conversion and four-wave-mixing in optical fibers may be exploited to enhance detection schemes. We apply our general framework specifically to the case of tapered fibers for photon triplet generation, a long-standing goal within quantum optics, and obtain explicit expectation values for its efficiency. A quantitative investigation of four-wave-mixing in a microstructured solid-core fiber provides significant consequences for the role of polarization in experimental design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct and study inhomogenoeus non-Hermitian strongly coupled holographic field theories. We consider two models: a lattice where in each site there is some inflow/outflow of matter and a Hermitian/non-Hermitian/Hermitian junction. Depending on whether we turn on a complex external gauge field, we find solutions that spontaneously break PT (thus hinting at a lack of unitary evolution) and solutions that do not. The former present an imaginary current responsible for the spontaneous breaking of PT. We also study the IR geometry of these solutions finding that they flow to a PT-unbroken fixed point. This leads us to claim that there is a PT-symmetry restoration in the IR, similar to the one observed in the perturbative setup of arXiv:2110.05289.</description>

      <title>Path integral Monte Carlo in a discrete variable representation with Gibbs sampling: dipolar planar rotor chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) approach based on discretized continuous degrees of freedom and rejection-free Gibbs sampling. The ground state properties of a chain of planar rotors with dipole-dipole interactions are used to illustrate the approach. Energetic and structural properties are computed and compared to exact diagonalization and Numerical Matrix Multiplication for $N \leq 3$ to assess the systematic Trotter factorization error convergence. For larger chains with up to N = 100 rotors, Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) calculations are used as a benchmark. We show that using Gibbs sampling is advantageous compared to traditional Metroplolis-Hastings rejection importance sampling. Indeed, Gibbs sampling leads to lower variance and correlation in the computed observables.</description>

Abstract: We present a systematic study of the nucleon-electron tensor-pseudotensor (Ne-TPT) interaction in candidate molecules for next-generation experimental searches for new sources of charge-parity violation. The considered molecules are all amenable to assembly from laser-cooled atoms, with the francium-silver (FrAg) molecule previously shown to be the most sensitive to the Schiff moment interaction in this set. Interelectron correlation effects are treated through relativistic general-excitation-rank configuration-interaction theory in the framework of the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian. We find in FrAg the Ne-TPT interaction constant to be $W_T({\text{Fr}}) = 2.58 \pm 0.21 [\left&lt;\Sigma\right&gt;_A \mathrm{kHz}]$, considering the Francium atom as target of the measurement. Taking into account nuclear structure in a multi-source interpretation of a measured electric dipole moment, FrAg is found to be an excellent probe of physics beyond the Standard Model as this system will in addition to its sizeable Ne-TPT interaction constant greatly constrain fundamental parameters such as the quantum-chromo-dynamic $\bar{\theta}$ or the semileptonic four-fermion interaction $C_{lequ}$ from which nuclear and atomic ${\cal{CP}}$-violating properties arise.</description>

      <title>On-chip cryogenic multiplexing of Si/SiGe quantum devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The challenges of operating qubits in a cryogenic environment point to a looming bottleneck for large-scale quantum processors, limited by the number of input-output connections. Classical processors solve this problem via multiplexing; however, on-chip multiplexing circuits have not been shown to have similar benefits for cryogenic quantum devices. In this work we integrate classical circuitry and Si/SiGe quantum devices on the same chip, providing a test bed for qubit scale-up. Our method uses on-chip field-effect transistors (FETs) to multiplex a grid of work zones, achieving a nearly tenfold reduction in control wiring. We leverage this set-up to probe device properties across a 6x6mm$^2$ array of 16 Hall bars. We successfully operate the array at cryogenic temperatures and high magnetic fields where the quantum Hall effect is observed. Building upon these results, we propose a vision for readout in a large-scale silicon quantum processor with a limited number of control connections.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking meets average symmetry-protected topological order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have unveiled new possibilities for discovering intrinsic quantum phases that are unique to open systems, including phases with average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) order and strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) order in systems with global symmetry. In this work, we propose a new class of phases, termed the double ASPT phase, which emerges from a nontrivial extension of these two orders. This new phase is absent from prior studies and cannot exist in conventional closed systems. Using the recently developed imaginary-Lindbladian formalism, we explore the phase diagram of a one-dimensional open system with $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma}\times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\tau}$ symmetry. We identify universal critical behaviors along each critical line and observe the emergence of an intermediate phase that completely breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma}$ symmetry, leading to the formation of two triple points in the phase diagram. These two triple points are topologically distinct and connected by a domain-wall decoration duality map. Our results promote the establishment of a complete classification for quantum phases in open systems with various symmetry conditions.</description>

      <title>Post-measurement Quantum Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how the effects of large numbers of measurements on many-body quantum ground and thermal states can be studied using Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). Density matrices generated by measurement in this setting feature products of many local nonunitary operators, and by expanding these density matrices as sums over operator strings we arrive at a generalized stochastic series expansion (SSE). Our `post-measurement SSE' is based on importance sampling of operator strings contributing to a measured thermal density matrix. We demonstrate our algorithm by probing the effects of measurements on the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice. Thermal states of this system have SU(2) symmetry, and we preserve this symmetry by measuring SU(2) symmetric observables. We identify classes of post-measurement states for which correlations can be calculated efficiently, as well as states for which SU(2) symmetric measurements generate a QMC sign problem when working in any site-local basis. For the first class, we show how deterministic loop updates can be leveraged. Using our algorithm we demonstrate the creation of long-range Bell pairs and symmetry-protected topological order, as well as the measurement-induced enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations. The method developed in this work opens the door to scalable experimental probes of measurement-induced collective phenomena, which require numerical estimates for the effects of measurements.</description>

Abstract: Building a Quantum Internet requires the development of innovative quantum-enabling networking architectures that integrate advanced communication systems with long-distance quantum communication hardware. Here, we present the implementation of a quantum-enabled internet prototype using a novel physics-centric stack-based quantum network paradigm to govern the dynamics of multiple light-matter Hamiltonians across distant nodes. We demonstrate this concept using a deployed large-scale intercity quantum network connecting laboratories at Stony Brook University and the Brookhaven National Laboratory. This network facilitates a fundamental long-distance quantum network service -that of high-visibility Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of telecom quantum states generated in two independent, telecom-compatible quantum light-matter interfaces separated by a distance of 158 km.</description>

      <title>The Optimization of Flux Trajectories for the Adiabatic Controlled-Z Gate on Split-Tunable Transmons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.06067v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a system of two tunable-frequency qubits, it is well-known that adiabatic tuning into strong coupling-interaction regions between the qubit subspace and the rest of the Hilbert space can be used to generate an effective controlled Z rotation. We address the problem of determining a preferable adiabatic trajectory along which to tune the qubit frequency, and apply this to the flux-tunable transmon model. The especially minimally anharmonic nature of these quantum processors makes them good candidates for qubit control using non-computational states, as long as higher-level leakage is properly addressed. While the statement of this method has occurred multiple times in literature, there has been little discussion of which trajectories may be used. We present a generalized method for optimizing parameterized families of possible flux trajectories and provide examples of use on five test families of one and two parameters.</description>

      <title>Programmable adiabatic demagnetization for systems with trivial and topological excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17256v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a simple, robust protocol to prepare a low-energy state of an arbitrary Hamiltonian on a quantum computer or programmable quantum simulator. The protocol is inspired by the adiabatic demagnetization technique, used to cool solid-state systems to extremely low temperatures. A fraction of the qubits (or spins) is used to model a spin bath that is coupled to the system. By an adiabatic ramp down of a simulated Zeeman field acting on the bath spins, energy and entropy are extracted from the system. The bath spins are then measured and reset to the polarized state, and the process is repeated until convergence to a low-energy steady state is achieved. We demonstrate the protocol via application to the quantum Ising model. We study the protocol's performance in the presence of noise and show how the information from the measurement of the bath spins can be used to monitor the cooling process. The performance of the algorithm depends on the nature of the excitations of the system; systems with non-local (topological) excitations are more difficult to cool than those with local excitations. We explore the possible mitigation of this problem by trapping topological excitations.</description>

      <title>High-rate continuous-variable measurement device-independent quantum key distribution with finite-size security</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building scalable and secure quantum networks requires advanced quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols that support multi-user connectivity. Continuous-variable (CV) measurement-device-independent (MDI) QKD, which eliminates all detector side-channel attacks, is a promising candidate for creating various quantum network topologies-such as quantum access networks and star-type topologies-using standard technology and providing high secure key rates. However, its security has so far only been experimentally demonstrated in asymptotic regimes with limited secret key rates and complex experimental setups, limiting its practical applications. Here, we report the first experimental validation of a CV MDI-QKD system, achieving a secure key rate of 2.6 Mbit/s against collective attacks in the finite-size regime over a 10 km fiber link. This is achieved using a new system design, incorporating a locally generated local oscillator, a new relay structure, a real-time phase locking system, and a well-designed digital-signal-processing pipeline for quantum state preparation and CV Bell measurements at a symbol rate of 20 MBaud. Our results set a new benchmark for secure key exchange and open the possibility of establishing high-performance CV MDI-QKD networks, paving the way toward a scalable quantum network.</description>

      <title>Decoding quantum color codes with MaxSAT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In classical computing, error-correcting codes are well established and are ubiquitous both in theory and practical applications. For quantum computing, error-correction is essential as well, but harder to realize, coming along with substantial resource overheads and being concomitant with needs for substantial classical computing. Quantum error-correcting codes play a central role on the avenue towards fault-tolerant quantum computation beyond presumed near-term applications. Among those, color codes constitute a particularly important class of quantum codes that have gained interest in recent years due to favourable properties over other codes. As in classical computing, decoding is the problem of inferring an operation to restore an uncorrupted state from a corrupted one and is central in the development of fault-tolerant quantum devices. In this work, we show how the decoding problem for color codes can be reduced to a slight variation of the well-known LightsOut puzzle. We propose a novel decoder for quantum color codes using a formulation as a MaxSAT problem based on this analogy. Furthermore, we optimize the MaxSAT construction and show numerically that the decoding performance of the proposed decoder achieves state-of-the-art decoding performance on color codes. The implementation of the decoder as well as tools to automatically conduct numerical experiments are publicly available as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Modified Landauer's principle: How much can the Maxwell's demon gain by using general system-environment quantum state?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Landauer principle states that decrease in entropy of a system, inevitably leads to a dissipation of heat to the environment. This statement is usually established by considering the system to be in contact with an environment that is initially in a thermal state, with the system-environment initial state being in a product state. Here we show that a modified Landauer principle, with correction terms, still holds even if the system and environment are initially correlated and the environment is in an athermal state. This is the most general quantum mechanically allowed operation in the Maxwell demon's arsenal, and, in particular, includes non-completely positive but physically realizable maps on the system. The correction terms provide an advantage: they reduce the work required by the Maxwell's demon to erase its memory. The modified principle also incorporates the possibility of arbitrary charge flows, including the usual heat flow, between system and environment. Furthermore, we consider a case where the system is in contact with a large initially-decoupled athermal environment, and we derive the finite-time modified Landauer's bound for the same.</description>

      <title>Learning quantum states and unitaries of bounded gate complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While quantum state tomography is notoriously hard, most states hold little interest to practically-minded tomographers. Given that states and unitaries appearing in Nature are of bounded gate complexity, it is natural to ask if efficient learning becomes possible. In this work, we prove that to learn a state generated by a quantum circuit with $G$ two-qubit gates to a small trace distance, a sample complexity scaling linearly in $G$ is necessary and sufficient. We also prove that the optimal query complexity to learn a unitary generated by $G$ gates to a small average-case error scales linearly in $G$. While sample-efficient learning can be achieved, we show that under reasonable cryptographic conjectures, the computational complexity for learning states and unitaries of gate complexity $G$ must scale exponentially in $G$. We illustrate how these results establish fundamental limitations on the expressivity of quantum machine learning models and provide new perspectives on no-free-lunch theorems in unitary learning. Together, our results answer how the complexity of learning quantum states and unitaries relate to the complexity of creating these states and unitaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop quantum algorithms for pricing Asian and barrier options under the Heston model, a popular stochastic volatility model, and estimate their costs, in terms of T-count, T-depth and number of logical qubits, on instances under typical market conditions. These algorithms are based on combining well-established numerical methods for stochastic differential equations and quantum amplitude estimation technique. In particular, we empirically show that, despite its simplicity, weak Euler method achieves the same level of accuracy as the better-known strong Euler method in this task. Furthermore, by eliminating the expensive procedure of preparing Gaussian states, the quantum algorithm based on weak Euler scheme achieves drastically better efficiency than the one based on strong Euler scheme. Our resource analysis suggests that option pricing under stochastic volatility is a promising application of quantum computers, and that our algorithms render the hardware requirement for reaching practical quantum advantage in financial applications less stringent than prior art.</description>

      <title>Efficient, High-Fidelity Single-Photon Switch Based on Waveguide-Coupled Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05714v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate theoretically that waveguide-coupled cavities with embedded two-level emitters can act as a highly efficient, high-fidelity single-photon switch. The photon switch is an optical router triggered by a classical signal -- the propagation direction of single input photons in the waveguide is controlled by changing the emitter-cavity coupling parameters in situ, for example using applied fields. The switch reflects photons in the weak emitter-cavity coupling regime and transmits photons in the strong coupling regime. By calculating transmission and reflection spectra using the input-output formalism of quantum optics and the transfer matrix approach, we obtain the fidelity and efficiency of the switch with a single-photon input in both regimes. We find that a single waveguide-coupled cavity can route input photon wave packets with near-unity efficiency and fidelity if the wave packet width is smaller than the cavity mode linewidth. We also find that using multiple waveguide-coupled cavities increases the switching bandwidth, allowing wider wave packets to be routed with high efficiency and fidelity. For example, an array of three waveguide-coupled cavities can reflect an input Gaussian wave packet with a full width at half-maximum of 1 nm (corresponding to a few-picosecond pulse) with an efficiency E_r = 96.4% and a fidelity F_r = 97.7%, or transmit the wave packet with an efficiency E_t = 99.7% and a fidelity F_t = 99.8%. Such efficient, high-fidelity single-photon routing is essential for scalable photonic quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: The product of two unitaries can normally be expressed as a single exponential through the famous Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. We present here a counterexample in quantum optics, by showing that an expression in terms of a single exponential is possible only at the expense of the introduction of a new element (a central extension of the algebra), implying that there will be unitaries, generated by a sequence of gates, that cannot be generated by any time-independent quadratic Hamiltonian. A quantum-optical experiment is proposed that brings to light this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Postselection technique for optical Quantum Key Distribution with improved de Finetti reductions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11851v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The postselection technique is an important proof technique for proving the security of quantum key distribution protocols against coherent attacks. In this work, we go through multiple steps to rigorously apply the postselection technique to optical quantum key distribution protocols. First, we place the postselection technique on a rigorous mathematical foundation by fixing a technical flaw in the original postselection paper. Second, we extend the applicability of the postselection technique to prepare-and-measure protocols by using a de Finetti reduction with a fixed marginal. Third, we show how the postselection technique can be used for decoy-state protocols by tagging the source. Finally, we extend the applicability of the postselection technique to realistic optical setups by developing a new variant of the flag-state squasher. We also improve existing de Finetti reductions, which reduce the effect of using the postselection technique on the key rate. These improvements can be more generally applied to other quantum information processing tasks. As an example to demonstrate the applicability of our work, we apply our results to the time-bin encoded three-state protocol. We observe that the postselection technique performs better than all other known proof techniques against coherent attacks.</description>

      <title>Noncommuting charges can remove non-stationary quantum many-body dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying noncommuting conserved quantities, or 'charges,' has revealed a conceptual puzzle: noncommuting charges hinder thermalization in some ways yet promote it in others. While many quantum systems thermalize according to the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), systems with 'dynamical symmetries' violate the ETH and exhibit non-stationary dynamics, preventing them from equilibrating, much less thermalizing. We demonstrate that each pair of dynamical symmetries corresponds to a specific charge. We find that introducing new charges that do not commute with existing ones disrupts these symmetries, thereby eliminating non-stationary dynamics and facilitating thermalization. We illustrate this behavior across various models, including the Hubbard model and Heisenberg spin chains. Our findings demonstrate that noncommuting charges can enhance thermalization by reducing the number of local observables that thermalize according to the ETH.</description>

      <title>Increasing Interference Detection in Quantum Cryptography using the Quantum Fourier Transform</title>

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) and quantum message encryption protocols promise a secure way to distribute information while detecting eavesdropping. However, current protocols may suffer from significantly reduced eavesdropping protection when only a subset of qubits are observed by an attacker. In this paper, we present two quantum cryptographic protocols leveraging the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and show their higher effectiveness even when an attacker measures only a subset of the transmitted qubits. The foremost of these protocols is a novel QKD method that leverages this effectiveness of the QFT while being more practical than previously proposed QFT-based protocols, most notably by not relying on quantum memory. We additionally show how existing quantum encryption methods can be augmented with a QFT-based approach to improve eavesdropping detection. Finally, we provide equations to analyze different QFT-based detection schemes within these protocols so that protocol designers can make custom schemes for their purpose.</description>

      <title>Feed-Forward Probabilistic Error Cancellation with Noisy Recovery Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC) aims to improve the accuracy of expectation values for observables. This is accomplished using the probabilistic insertion of recovery gates, which correspond to the inverse of errors. However, the inserted recovery gates also induce errors. Thus, it is difficult to obtain accurate expectation values with PEC since the estimator of PEC has a bias due to noise induced by recovery gates. To address this challenge, we propose an improved version of PEC that considers the noise resulting from gate insertion, called Feed-Forward PEC (FFPEC). FFPEC provides an unbiased estimator of expectation values by cancelling out the noise induced by recovery gates. We demonstrate that FFPEC yields more accurate expectation values compared to the conventional PEC method through analytical evaluations. Numerical experiments are used to evaluate analytical results.</description>

Abstract: Exploring the time-dependent characteristics of AB-type effects holds significant importance in contemporary physics and its practical applications. Here, we delve into the investigation of time-dependent topological effects emerging in AB-type experimental setups. We first analyze the topological effects on magnetic dipoles moving in closed trajectories around the time-varying magnetic field source solenoid, then on electrical dipoles around a time-varying electric field source in 2+1 dimensions without any approximation. Last, we discuss the characteristics of the topological effects by considering the identity and dualities between phases from an integrated perspective.</description>

Abstract: We present an experimental implementation of a polarization-entangled photon pair source based on beam displacers. The down-converted photons are emitted via spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a non-degenerate and type-0 process. We obtain a state fidelity of $F=0.975\pm0.004$ and violate a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality with $S=2.75\pm0.01$. Our source also uses thin crystals for applications in quantum imaging, taking advantage of the large number of spatial modes. We estimate that our source could produce 550$\pm$12 spatial modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of Stochastic Hill Climbing with Random Restarts (SHC-RR) compared to Local Search (LS) strategies within the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) framework across various problem models. Employing uniform parameter settings, including the number of restarts and SHC steps, we analyze LS with two distinct perturbation operations: multiplication and summation. Our comparative analysis encompasses multiple versions of max-cut and random Ising model (RI) problems, utilizing QAOA models with depths ranging from $1L$ to $3L$. These models incorporate diverse mixing operator configurations, which integrate $RX$ and $RY$ gates, and explore the effects of an entanglement stage within the mixing operator. Our results consistently show that SHC-RR outperforms LS approaches, showcasing superior efficacy despite its ostensibly simpler optimization mechanism. Furthermore, we observe that the inclusion of entanglement stages within mixing operators significantly impacts model performance, either enhancing or diminishing results depending on the specific problem context.</description>

      <title>The observer effect in quantum: the case of classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observer effect in quantum physics states that observation inevitably influences the system being observed. Our proposed epistemic framework treats the observer as an integral part of sensory information processing within entangled quantum systems, highlighting the subjective and probabilistic aspects of observation and inference. Our study introduces a hierarchical model for fuzzy instance classification, which aligns sensory input with an observer's pre-existing beliefs and associated quantum probability-based truth values. Sensory data evolves via interaction with observer states, as described by the Lindblad master equation, and is then classified adaptively using positive operator-valued measures (POVM). Our parametrization employs measures of concurrent similarity and dissimilarity, facilitating perceptual associations and asymmetric cognition. The observer's position on a skeptic-believer spectrum modulates ambiguous matching of noisy perceptions. We show that sensory information becomes intricately entangled with observer states, yielding a wide array of probabilistic classification results. This framework lays the groundwork for a quantum-probability-based understanding of the observer effect, encouraging further exploration of quantum correlations and properties in cognitive processes.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Opto-Electro-Mechanical Entanglement through Three-Level Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the dynamical bipartite entanglement in an opto-electro-mechanical system that involves a three-level atom. The system consists of a degenerate three-level atom, a mechanical resonator, an optical cavity, and a microwave cavity. By utilizing the linearization approximation and nonlinear quantum-Langevin equations, the dynamics of the system are analyzed, and the bipartite entanglement is evaluated using the logarithmic negativity. The research findings indicate that the entanglement between each subsystem increases with the atom injection rate, suggesting that a higher atom injection rate leads to enhanced information transmission between the subsystems. Additionally, it is observed that the correlation between subsystems increases with an increase in the coupling rate. Moreover, the study demonstrates that the correlation between each subsystem decreases as temperature rises. We also show that the degree of tripartite entanglement diminishes with increasing atomic decay rates. The results highlight the positive impact of three-level atoms on the bipartite entanglement in an opto-electro-mechanical system. Consequently, such electro-optomechanical systems can offer a framework for optomechanical information transfer.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we show how to measure in the setting of digital quantum simulations the reflection and transmission amplitudes of the one-dimensional scattering of a particle with a short-ranged potential. The main feature of the protocol is the coupling between the particle and an ancillary spin-1/2 degree of freedom. This allows us to reconstruct tomographically the scattering amplitudes, which are in general complex numbers, from the readout of one qubit. Applications of our results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Quantum Optimization for Dynamic Self-Reliant Community Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power grid partitioning is an important requirement for resilient distribution grids. Since electricity production is progressively shifted to the distribution side, dynamic identification of self-reliant grid subsets becomes crucial for operation. This problem can be represented as a modification to the well-known NP-hard Community Detection (CD) problem. We formulate it as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem suitable for solving using quantum computation{\color{blue}, which is expected to find better-quality partitions faster. The formulation aims to find communities with maximal self-sufficiency and minimal power flowing between them}. To assess quantum optimization for sizeable problems, we apply a hierarchical divisive method that solves sub-problem QUBOs to perform grid bisections. Furthermore, we propose a customization of the Louvain heuristic that includes self-reliance. In the evaluation, we first demonstrate that this problem examines exponential runtime scaling classically. Then, using different IEEE power system test cases, we benchmark the solution quality for multiple approaches: D-Wave's hybrid quantum-classical solvers, classical heuristics, and a branch-and-bound solver. As a result, we observe that the hybrid solvers provide very promising results, both with and without the divisive algorithm, regarding solution quality achieved within a given time frame. Directly utilizing D-Wave's Quantum Annealing (QA) hardware shows inferior partitioning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generation of entanglement across different nodes in distributed quantum architectures plays a pivotal role for different applications. In particular, deterministic, robust, and fast protocols that prepare genuine multipartite entangled states are highly desirable. In this article, we propose a fractional quantum state transfer, in which the excitation of an emitter is partially transmitted through the quantum communication channel and then absorbed at a spatially separated node. This protocol is based on wavepacket shaping allowing for a fast deterministic generation of Bell states among two quantum registers and $W$ states for a general setting of $N$ qubits, either in a sequential or simultaneous fashion, depending on the topology of the network. By means of detailed numerical simulations, we show that genuine multipartite entangled states can be faithfully prepared within current experimental platforms and discuss the role of the main decoherence sources, qubit dephasing and relaxation, depending on the network topology.</description>

      <title>Additivity of quantum capacities in simple non-degradable quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum channel capacities give the fundamental performance limits for information flow over a communication channel. However, the prevalence of superadditivity is a major obstacle to understanding capacities, both quantitatively and conceptually. Examples of additivity, while rare, provide key insight into the origins of nonadditivity and enable our best upper bounds on capacities. Degradable channels, which have additive coherent information, are some of the only channels for which we can calculate the quantum capacity. In this paper we construct non-degradable quantum channels that nevertheless have additive coherent information and therefore easily calculated quantum capacity. The first class of examples is constructed by generalizing the Platypus channel, as introduced by Leditzky et al., which demonstrates interesting properties of additivity and non-additivity. The second class of examples, whose additivity follows from a conjectured reverse-type data processing inequality, is based on probabilistic mixture of degradable and anti-degradable channels. As a byproduct, we provide some possible examples of quantum channels with zero quantum capacity, which are neither anti-degradable nor PPT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pseudoentangled states are defined by their ability to hide their entanglement structure: they are indistinguishable from random states to any observer with polynomial resources, yet can have much less entanglement than random states. Existing constructions of pseudoentanglement based on phase- and/or subset-states are limited in the entanglement structures they can hide: e.g., the states may have low entanglement on a single cut, on all cuts at once, or on local cuts in one dimension. Here we introduce new constructions of pseudoentangled states based on (pseudo)random tensor networks that affords much more flexibility in the achievable entanglement structures. We illustrate our construction with the simplest example of a matrix product state, realizable as a staircase circuit of pseudorandom unitary gates, which exhibits pseudo-area-law scaling of entanglement in one dimension. We then generalize our construction to arbitrary tensor network structures that admit an isometric realization. A notable application of this result is the construction of pseudoentangled `holographic' states whose entanglement entropy obeys a Ryu-Takayanagi `minimum-cut' formula, answering a question posed in [Aaronson et al., arXiv:2211.00747].</description>

      <title>Weak local measurements reproduce the measurement time of strong measurements on entangled systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well established that starting only with strong, projective quantum measurements, experiments can be designed to allow weak measurements, which lead to random walk between the possible final measurement outcomes. However, one can ask the reverse question: starting with only weak measurements, can all the results of standard strong measurements be recovered? Prior work has shown that some results can be, such as the Born rule for the probability of measurement outcomes as a function of wave intensity. In this paper we show that another crucial result can be reproduced by purely weak measurements, namely the collapse of a many-body, nonlocally entangled wave function on a time scale comparable to the characteristic time of a single, local measurement; for an entangled state of a single excitation among $N$ qubits, we find the collapse time scales as a double logarithm of $N$. This result affirms the self-consistency of the hypothesis that spontaneous weak measurements lie at the base of all physical measurements, independent of human observers.</description>

      <title>Commuting Local Hamiltonians Beyond 2D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10495v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Commuting local Hamiltonians provide a testing ground for studying many of the most interesting open questions in quantum information theory, including the quantum PCP conjecture and the existence of area laws. Although they are a simplified model of quantum computation, the status of the commuting local Hamiltonian problem remains largely unknown. A number of works have shown that increasingly expressive families of commuting local Hamiltonians admit completely classical verifiers. Despite intense work, the largest class of commuting local Hamiltonians we can place in NP are those on a square lattice, where each lattice site is a qutrit. Even worse, many of the techniques used to analyze these problems rely heavily on the geometry of the square lattice and the properties of the numbers 2 and 3 as local dimensions. In this work, we present a new technique to analyze the complexity of various families of commuting local Hamiltonians: guided reductions. Intuitively, these are a generalization of typical reduction where the prover provides a guide so that the verifier can construct a simpler Hamiltonian. The core of our reduction is a new rounding technique based on a combination of Jordan's Lemma and the Structure Lemma. Our rounding technique is much more flexible than previous work, and allows us to show that a larger family of commuting local Hamiltonians is in NP, albiet with the restriction that all terms are rank-1. Specifically, we prove the following two results:
  1. Commuting local Hamiltonians in 2D that are rank-1 are contained in NP, independent of the qudit dimension. Note that this family of commuting local Hamiltonians has no restriction on the local dimension or the locality.
  2. We prove that rank-1, 3D commuting Hamiltonians with qudits on edges are in NP. To our knowledge this is the first time a family of 3D commuting local Hamiltonians has been contained in NP.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the efficiency of polariton OLEDs in and beyond the single-excitation subspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have redefined lighting with their environment-friendliness and flexibility. However, only 25 % of the electronic states of organic molecules can emit light upon electrical excitation, limiting the overall efficiency of OLEDs. Strong light-matter coupling, achieved by confining light within OLEDs using mirrors, creates hybrid light-matter states known as polaritons, which could "activate" the remaining 75 % electronic triplet states. Here, we study triplet-to-polariton transition and derive rates for both reverse inter-system crossing and triplet-triplet annihilation. In addition, we explore how the harmful singlet-singlet annihilation could be reduced with strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Squeezing the quantum noise of a gravitational-wave detector below the standard quantum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precision measurements of space and time, like those made by the detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), are often confronted with fundamental limitations imposed by quantum mechanics. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle dictates that the position and momentum of an object cannot both be precisely measured, giving rise to an apparent limitation called the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). Reducing quantum noise below the SQL in gravitational-wave detectors, where photons are used to continuously measure the positions of freely falling mirrors, has been an active area of research for decades. Here we show how the LIGO A+ upgrade reduced the detectors' quantum noise below the SQL by up to 3 dB while achieving a broadband sensitivity improvement, more than two decades after this possibility was first presented.</description>

      <title>Entanglement flow in the Kane-Fisher quantum impurity problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of a local impurity in a Luttinger liquid, just like the anisotropic Kondo problem (of which it is technically a cousin), describes many different physical systems. As shown by Kane and Fisher, the presence of interactions profoundly modifies the physics familiar from Fermi liquid theory, and leads to non-intuitive features, best described in the Renormalization Group language (RG), such as flows towards healed or split fixed points. While this problem has been studied for many years using more traditional condensed matter approaches, it remains somewhat mysterious from the point of view of entanglement, both for technical and conceptual reasons. We propose and explore in this paper a new way to think of this important aspect. We use the realization of the Kane Fisher universality class provided by an XXZ spin chain with a modified bond strength between two sites and explore the difference of (Von Neumann) entanglement entropies of a region of length $\ell$ with the rest of the system - to which it relates to a modified bond - in the cases when $\ell$ is even and odd. Surprisingly, we find out that this difference $\delta S\equiv S^e-S^o$ remains of $O(1)$ in the thermodynamic limit, and gives rise now, depending on the sign of the interactions, to "resonance" curves, interpolating between $-\ln 2$ and $0$, and depending on the product $\ell T_B$, where $1/T_B$ is a characteristic length scale akin to the Kondo length in Kondo problems. $\delta S$ can be interpreted as a measure of the hybridization of the left-over spin in odd length subsystems with the "bath" constituted by the rest of the chain. The problem is studied both numerically using DMRG and analytically near the healed and split fixed points. Interestingly - and in contrast with what happens in other impurity problems - $\delta S$ can, at least to lowest order, be tackled by conformal perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced dissipative quantum phase transition in a head-to-tail atomic Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02890v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a dissipative phase transition in a head-to-tail Bose Josephson junction. The quantum phase transition has the same origin as the one in a resistively shunted Josephson junction, but the intrinsic momentum coupling between the Josephson mode and the bath modes enables us to observe the dissipative phase transition without any synthetic dissipation. We show that the interatomic interaction strength plays the role of the damping parameter. Consequently, in contrast to a resistively shunted Josephson circuit, the Bose Josephson junction can exhibit an insulating phase in a wider parameter region by increasing the repulsive interaction strength, which is robust against nonperturbative effects. We argue that tight transverse confinement of the quasi-one-dimensional atomic gas allows us to reach the insulating phase.</description>

      <title>Measuring kinetic inductance and superfluid stiffness of two-dimensional superconductors using high-quality transmission-line resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of van der Waals superconductors in recent years has generated a lot of excitement for their potentially novel pairing mechanisms. However, their typical atomic-scale thickness and micrometer-scale lateral dimensions impose severe challenges to investigations of pairing symmetry by conventional methods. In this report we demonstrate a new technique that employs high-quality-factor superconducting resonators to measure the kinetic inductance -- up to a part per million -- and loss of a van der Waals superconductor. We analyze the equivalent circuit model to extract the kinetic inductance, superfluid stiffness, penetration depth, and ratio of imaginary and real parts of the complex conductivity. We validate the technique by measuring aluminum and finding excellent agreement in both the zero-temperature superconducting gap as well as the complex conductivity data when compared with BCS theory. We then demonstrate the utility of the technique by measuring the kinetic inductance of multi-layered niobium diselenide and discuss the limits to the accuracy of our technique when the transition temperature of the sample, NbSe$_2$ at 7.06 K, approaches our Nb probe resonator at 8.59 K. Our method will be useful for practitioners in the growing fields of superconducting physics, materials science, and quantum sensing, as a means of characterizing superconducting circuit components and studying pairing mechanisms of the novel superconducting states which arise in layered 2D materials and heterostructures.</description>

      <title>D-Wave's Nonlinear-Program Hybrid Solver: Description and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of advanced quantum-classical algorithms is among the most prominent strategies in quantum computing. Numerous hybrid solvers have been introduced recently. Many of these methods are created ad hoc to address specific use cases. However, several well-established schemes are frequently utilized to address optimization problems. In this context, D-Wave launched the Hybrid Solver Service in 2020, offering a portfolio of methods designed to accelerate time-to-solution for users aiming to optimize performance and operational processes. Recently, a new technique has been added to this portfolio: the Nonlinear-Program Hybrid Solver. This paper describes this solver and evaluates its performance through a benchmark of 45 instances across three combinatorial optimization problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem, the Knapsack Problem, and the Maximum Cut Problem. To facilitate the use of this relatively unexplored solver, we provide details of the implementation used to solve these three optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Transferable Belief Model on Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transferable belief model, as a semantic interpretation of Dempster-Shafer theory, enables agents to perform reasoning and decision making in imprecise and incomplete environments. The model offers distinct semantics for handling unreliable testimonies, allowing for a more reasonable and general process of belief transfer compared to the Bayesian approach. However, because both the belief masses and the structure of focal sets must be considered when updating belief functions-leading to extra computational complexity during reasoning-the transferable belief model has gradually lost favor among researchers in recent developments. In this paper, we implement the transferable belief model on quantum circuits and demonstrate that belief functions offer a more concise and effective alternative to Bayesian approaches within the quantum computing framework. Furthermore, leveraging the unique characteristics of quantum computing, we propose several novel belief transfer approaches. More broadly, this paper introduces a new perspective on basic information representation for quantum AI models, suggesting that belief functions are more suitable than Bayesian approach for handling uncertainty on quantum circuits.</description>
