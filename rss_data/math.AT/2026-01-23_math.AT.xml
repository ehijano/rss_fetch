      <title>Equivariant linear isometries and infinite little discs operads via transfer systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we apply the recently developed theory of transfer systems to study the relationship between $G$-equivariant linear isometries and infinite little discs operads, for a finite group $G$. This framework allows us to reduce involved topological problems to discrete problems regarding the subgroup structure and representation theory of the group $G$. Our main result is an example of this: we classify the $G$-universes $\mathcal{U}$ for which the linear isometries operad $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{U})$ and the infinite little discs operad $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{U})$ are homotopically equivalent. To achieve this, we use ideas that originate from the work of Balchin-Barnes-Roitzheim on the combinatorics of transfer systems on a total order. Additionally, the use of transfer systems gives us insight into the algebraic structures that arise from equivariant homotopy theory. Compatible pairs of transfer systems provide rules for when multiplicative transfer maps can be paired with additive transfer maps. In the case that the group $G$ is abelian, we provide conditions for when the pair $(\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{U}),\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{U}))$ defines a maximally compatible pair of transfer systems. As a consequence, we contribute to a recent conjecture about equivariant operad pairs.</description>

      <title>2-Equivariant 2-Vector bundles and 2K-theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a theory of 2-vector bundles over a Lie groupoid, with fibers modeled by the bicategory of super algebras, bimodules and intertwiners. We demonstrate that these 2-vector bundles form a symmetric monoidal 2-stack. From this structure, we define the 2K-theory as the Grothendieck group of the internal equivalence classes of the 2-vector bundle over the given Lie groupoid, and we construct the spectra representing this theory. We then extend this framework to the equivariant setting. For any Lie groupoid equipped with an action by a coherent 2-group, we introduce the bicategory of 2-equivariant 2-vector bundles over it. This leads to the definition of 2-equivariant 2K-theory as the Grothendieck group of the internal equivalence classes in the bicategory. Furthermore, we define a higher analogue of orbifold, which generalizes Lie groupoids with a 2-group action, and construct the bicategory of 2-orbifold 2-vector bundles. Finally, we can define the 2-orbifold 2K-theory.</description>

      <title>Bivariate topological complexity: a framework for coordinated motion planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a bivariate version of topological complexity, $\mathrm{TC}(f,g)$, associated with two continuous maps $f\colon X\to Z$ and $g\colon Y\to Z$. This invariant measures the minimal number of continuous motion planning rules required to coordinate trajectories in $X$ and $Y$ through a shared target space $Z$. It recovers Farber's classical topological complexity when $f=g=\mathrm{id}_X$ and Pave\v{s}i\'c's map-based invariant when one of the maps is the identity.
  We develop a structural theory for $\mathrm{TC}(f,g)$, including symmetry, product inequalities, stability properties, and a collaboration principle showing that, when one of the maps is a fibration, the complexity of synchronization is controlled by the other. We also introduce a homotopy-invariant bivariate complexity $\mathrm{TC}_H(f,g)$ of Scott type, defined via homotopic distance, and study its relationship with the strict invariant.
  Concrete examples reveal rigidity phenomena with no analogue in the classical case, including strict gaps between $\mathrm{TC}(f,g)$ and $\mathrm{TC}_H(f,g)$ and situations where synchronization becomes impossible. Cohomological estimates provide computable obstructions in both the strict and homotopy-invariant settings.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Morse-Bott cohomology through stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For closed manifolds with compact Lie group actions, we study Austin-Braam's Morse-theoretic construction of Borel equivariant cohomology using the technique of stabilization. We show that a $C^1$-small equivariant perturbation produces stable invariant Morse-Bott functions. This allows us to realize the equivariant transversality and orientability assumptions in Austin-Braam's framework by choosing generic invariant Riemannian metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop new techniques for constructing model structures from a given class of cofibrations, together with a class of fibrant objects and a choice of weak equivalences between them. As a special case, we obtain a more flexible version of the classical right-transfer theorem in the presence of an adjunction. Namely, instead of lifting the classes of fibrations and weak equivalences through the right adjoint, we now only do so between fibrant objects, which allows for a wider class of applications.</description>

      <title>Through the Grapevine: Vineyard Distance as a Measure of Topological Dissimilarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new measure of distance between datasets, based on vineyards from topological data analysis, which we call the vineyard distance. Vineyard distance measures the extent of topological change along an interpolation from one dataset to another, either along a pre-computed trajectory or via a straight-line homotopy. We demonstrate through theoretical results and experiments that vineyard distance is less sensitive than $L^p$ distance (which considers every single data value), but more sensitive than Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams (which accounts only for shape and not location). This allows vineyard distance to reveal distinctions that the other two distance measures cannot. In our paper, we establish theoretical results for vineyard distance including as upper and lower bounds. We then demonstrate the usefulness of vineyard distance on real-world data through applications to geospatial data and to neural network training dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stability, Complexity and Data-Dependent Worst-Case Generalization Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Providing generalization guarantees for stochastic optimization algorithms remains a key challenge in learning theory. Recently, numerous works demonstrated the impact of the geometric properties of optimization trajectories on generalization performance. These works propose worst-case generalization bounds in terms of various notions of intrinsic dimension and/or topological complexity, which were found to empirically correlate with the generalization error. However, most of these approaches involve intractable mutual information terms, which limit a full understanding of the bounds. In contrast, some authors built on algorithmic stability to obtain worst-case bounds involving geometric quantities of a combinatorial nature, which are impractical to compute. In this paper, we address these limitations by combining empirically relevant complexity measures with a framework that avoids intractable quantities. To this end, we introduce the concept of \emph{random set stability}, tailored for the data-dependent random sets produced by stochastic optimization algorithms. Within this framework, we show that the worst-case generalization error can be bounded in terms of (i) the random set stability parameter and (ii) empirically relevant, data- and algorithm-dependent complexity measures of the random set. Moreover, our framework improves existing topological generalization bounds by recovering previous complexity notions without relying on mutual information terms. Through a series of experiments in practically relevant settings, we validate our theory by evaluating the tightness of our bounds and the interplay between topological complexity and stability.</description>

      <title>On the torsion-free nilpotent fundamental groups of smooth quasi-projective varieties of rank up to seven</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth quasi-projective variety. Assume that the (topological) fundamental group $\pi_1(X, x)$ is torsion-free nilpotent. We show that if the first Betti number $b_1(X) \le 3$, then $\pi_1(X, x)$ is isomorphic to either $\mathbb{Z}^n$ for $n = 1, 2, 3$, a lattice in the Heisenberg group $H_3(\mathbb{R})$ or $\mathbb{R} \times H_3(\mathbb{R})$. Moreover, we prove that $\pi_1(X, x)$ is abelian or $2$-step nilpotent if its rank is less than or equal to seven. More precisely, we determine the real nilpotent Lie groups in which torsion-free nilpotent fundamental groups can be embedded as lattices for ranks up to six and seven, respectively. Our main results are a partial positive answer to a question on nilpotent (quasi-)K\"ahler groups posed by Aguilar and Campana.</description>

Abstract: These are lecture notes for a course in Winter 2022/23, updated and completed in October 2025.
  The goal of the lectures is to present some recent developments around six-functor formalisms, in particular: the abstract theory of 6-functor formalisms; the 2-category of cohomological correspondences, and resulting simplifications in the proofs of Poincar\'e--Verdier duality results; the relation between 6-functor formalisms and ``geometric rings''; many examples of 6-functor formalisms, both old and new.</description>

      <title>TUN: Detecting Significant Points in Persistence Diagrams with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persistence diagrams (PDs) provide a powerful tool for understanding the topology of the underlying shape of a point cloud. However, identifying which points in PDs encode genuine signals remains challenging. This challenge directly hinders the practical adoption of topological data analysis in many applications, where automated and reliable interpretation of persistence diagrams is essential for downstream decision-making. In this paper, we study automatic significance detection for one-dimensional persistence diagrams. Specifically, we propose Topology Understanding Net (TUN), a multi-modal network that combines enhanced PD descriptors with self-attention, a PointNet-style point cloud encoder, learned fusion, and per-point classification, alongside stable preprocessing and imbalance-aware training. It provides an automated and effective solution for identifying significant points in PDs, which are critical for downstream applications. Experiments show that TUN outperforms classic methods in detecting significant points in PDs, illustrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a weak form of formality for differential graded algebras, called $A_3$-formality, for the cohomology of pro-p Demushkin groups at odd primes p. We show that the differential graded $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebras of continuous cochains of Demushkin groups with q-invariant not equal 3 are $A_3$-formal, whereas Demushkin groups with q-invariant 3 are not $A_3$-formal. We prove these results by an explicit computation of the Benson-Krause-Schwede canonical class in Hochschild cohomology.</description>
