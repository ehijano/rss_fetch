      <title>Defining ideals of some numerical semigroup rings with arithmetic pseudo-Frobenius numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study defining ideals of numerical semigroup rings. Let $H$ be a numerical semigroup with multiplicity $a_0$ and embedding dimension $n$. Assuming $a_0/2+1\leq n$, we prove that the defining ideal of $H$ is determinantal when the set of pseudo-Frobenius numbers forms an arithmetic sequence of length $n-1$. This partly resolves a conjecture of Cuong, Kien, Truong and, Matsuoka.</description>

      <title>Nonnil-S-Laskerian Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of nonnil-S-Laskerian rings, which generalize both nonnil-Laskerian rings and S-Laskerian rings. A ring R is said to be nonnil-S-Laskerian if every nonnil ideal I (disjoint from S) of R is S-decomposable. As a main result, we prove that the class of nonnil-S-Noetherian rings belongs to the class of nonnil-S-Laskerian rings. Also, we prove that a nonnil-S-Laskerian ring has S-Noetherian spectrum under a mild condition. Among other results, we prove that if the power series ring R[[X]] is nonnil-S-Laskerian with S-decomposable nilradical, then R is S-laskerian and satisfies the S-SFT property.</description>

      <title>Defect Functions Between Filtrations of Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the defect function associated to a pair of filtrations of ideals, which generalizes the symbolic defect of ideals. Under the assumption that the Rees algebra of one filtration is Noetherian and that a natural graded module measuring the interaction between the filtrations is finitely generated over it, we show that the corresponding defect function is asymptotically a quasi-polynomial. Moreover, the defect function becomes eventually polynomial when the Rees algebra of the first filtration is standard graded. For filtrations arising from saturations and ordinary powers of monomial ideals, we further analyze the structure of the quasi-polynomial. We prove that the top two coefficients of the eventual quasi-polynomial are constant under natural hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Polynomial vector fields in $\mathbb{C}^\infty$ determining differentiation of hyperelliptic functions of any genus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we give direct proofs of two theorems concerning explicitly defined polynomial vector fields connected to differentiation of hyperelliptic functions of any genus. We prove that the operators determining the fields commute, and we show that each of them annul polynomials defined in terms of generating functions in $\mathbb{C}^\infty$.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical structure of graded Betti numbers in the quadratic strand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical results, initiated by Castelnuovo and Fano and later refined by Eisenbud and Harris, provide several upper bounds on the number of quadrics defining a nondegenerate projective variety. Recently, it has been revealed that these bounds extend naturally to certain linear syzygies, suggesting the presence of a hierarchical structure governing the quadratic strand of graded Betti numbers.
  In this article, we establish such a hierarchy in full generality. We first prove sharp upper bounds for $\beta_{p,1}(X)$ depending on the degree of a projective variety $X$, extending the classical quadratic bounds to all linear syzygies and identifying the extremal varieties in each range. We then introduce geometric conditions that describe how containment of $X$ in low-degree varieties influences syzygies, and we show that these conditions stratify the quadratic strand into a finite sequence of hierarchies. This leads to a complete description of all possible extremal behavior. We also prove a generalized $K_{p,1}$-theorem, demonstrating that the vanishing of $\beta_{p,1}(X)$ detects containment in a variety of minimal degree at each hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Edge ideals with linear quotients and without homological linear quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A monomial ideal $I$ is said to have homological linear quotients if for each $k\geq 0$, the homological shift ideal $\mathrm{HS}_k(I)$ has linear quotients. It is a well-known fact that if an edge ideal $I(G)$ has homological linear quotients, then $G$ is co-chordal. We construct a family of co-chordal graphs $\{\mathrm{H}_n^c\}_{n\geq 6}$ and propose a conjecture that an edge ideal $I(G)$ has homological linear quotients if and only if $G$ is co-chordal and $\mathrm{H}_n^c$-free for any $n\geq 6$. In this paper, we prove one direction of the conjecture. Moreover, we study possible patterns of pairs $(G,k)$ of a co-chordal graph $G$ and integer $k$ such that $\mathrm{HS}_k(I(G))$ has linear quotients.</description>

      <title>The Smith form of Sylvester and B\'ezout matrices for zero-dimensional ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a field and let $f,g \in \mathbb{K}[x,y]$ be such that the ideal $\langle f,g \rangle$ is zero-dimensional. We study the Sylvester and B\'{e}zout resultant polynomial matrices, built by interpreting $f$ and $g$ as univariate polynomials in $x$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{K}[y]$. We characterize their Smith forms over $\mathbb{K}[y]$ in terms of the dual spaces of differential operators, that were defined and studied by H. M. M\"{o}ller et al. In particular, if $\mathbb{K}$ is algebraically closed we show that, if the leading coefficients of $f$ and $g$ are coprime over $\mathbb{K}[y]$, then the partial multiplicities of the Sylvester and B\'{e}zout resultant matrices coincide with certain integers, that we call M\"{o}ller indices. These indices are uniquely determined by $\langle f,g \rangle$, and can be easily computed from a Gauss basis, as defined in [M. G. Marinari, H. M. M\"{o}ller, T. Mora, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 348(8):3283--3321, 1996], of the dual spaces. We then generalize this result to the case of common factors in the leading coefficients, which correspond to intersections at $x=\infty$, again describing all the invariant factors of Sylvester and B\'{e}zout resultant matrices. As a corollary, this fully characterizes the algebraic multiplicity of all the roots of the resultant $\mathrm{Res}_x(f,g) \in \mathbb{K}[y]$ in terms of the intersection multiplicities for $f$ and $g$, including those arising from infinite intersections. We discuss both algebraic and computational implications of our results.</description>

      <title>Oracle-Based Multistep Strategy for Solving Polynomial Systems Over Finite Fields and Algebraic Cryptanalysis of the Aradi Cipher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multistep solving strategy consists in a divide-and-conquer approach: when a multivariate polynomial system is computationally infeasible to solve directly, one variable is assigned over the elements of the base finite field, and the procedure is recursively applied to the resulting simplified systems. In a previous work by the same authors (among others), this approach proved effective in the algebraic cryptanalysis of the Trivium cipher.
  In this paper, we present a new recursive formulation of the corresponding algorithm based on a Depth-First Search strategy, along with a novel complexity analysis leveraging tree structures. We also introduce the notion of an "oracle function", which is intended to determine whether evaluating a new variable is required to simplify the current polynomial system. This notion allows us to unify all previously proposed variants of the multistep strategy, including the classical hybrid approach, by appropriately selecting the oracle function.
  Finally, we employ the multistep solving strategy in the cryptanalysis of the NSA's recently introduced low-latency block cipher Aradi, achieving a first full-round algebraic attack that exposes structural features in its symbolic model.</description>

      <title>Finiteness of leaps of modules of integrable derivations of algebras of finite type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the finiteness of leaps of modules of $m$-integrable derivations for algebras essentially of finite type and, more generally, for schemes essentially of finite type over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic. This provides an affirmative answer to a question posed by L. N. Macarro. As an application, we establish the coherence of the module of $\infty$-integrable derivations.</description>
