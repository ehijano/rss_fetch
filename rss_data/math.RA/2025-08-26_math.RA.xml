      <title>Aut-stable subspaces of Grassmann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the concept of Aut-stable subspaces has played an important role in the characterization of polynomial rings, a topic that remains a challenging problem in algebraic geometry (see [8]). It turns out that polynomial rings with more than two variables do not have any Aut-stable subspaces over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero [7]. In this work, we characterize all Aut-stable subspaces and Aut-stable subalgebras of Grassmann algebras.</description>

      <title>Elementary divisor rings with Dubrovin-Komarnytsky property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce noncommutative rings with $DK$-property (Dubrovin-Komarnytsky's property) and investigate elementary divisor rings with such property. Mostly we pay attention to these kinds of noncommutative rings which have stable range $1$. A theory of reduction matrices over such rings is constructed. As a consequence, new families of non-commutative rings of elementary divisor rings are constructed.</description>

      <title>On Strongly \( J^{\#} \)-Clean Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and examine the class of {\it strongly \( J^{\#} \)-clean rings} consisting of those rings $R$ such that each element of $R$ is the sum of an idempotent from $R$ and an element from $J^{\#}(R)$ that commute with each other. More exactly, we prove that these rings are simultaneously strongly clean and Dedekind-finite as well as that they factor-ring modulo the Jacobson radical is always Boolean, and also provide some close relations with certain other well-established classes of rings like these of local, semi-local and strongly J-clean rings (as introduced by Chen on 2010) showing the surprising fact that the classes of strongly \( J^{\#} \)-clean and strongly J-clean rings, actually, do coincide. Moreover, a few more extensions of the newly defined class such as group rings and generalized matrix rings are provided too.</description>

      <title>Cohomology theory of Nijenhuis family $\Omega$-associative algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Family algebraic structures indexed by a semigroup first appeared in the algebraic aspects of renormalizations in quantum field theory. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of Nijenhuis family $\Omega$-associative algebras and we discuss the relationship between Nijenhuis family and other operators families on $\Omega$-associative algebras. Then, we define the cohomology theory of Nijenhuis family $\Omega$-associative algebras and show that this cohomology controls the corresponding deformations. Finally, we study abelian extensions of Nijenhuis family $\Omega$-associative algebras in terms of the second cohomology group.</description>

      <title>On the injectivity of evaluation maps induced by polynomials on certain algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the injectivity of the evaluation map eva f,A from Am A to A, where A is an associative algebra over a field F, and f is a polynomial in m \ge 1 variables with coefficients in F. Our investigation reveals that injectivity is possible only when m equal 1 and f has degree one; for functions in two or more variables, such injectivity is impossible.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathscr{A}$ and $\mathscr{B}$ be two connected cochain DG algebra such that $\mathscr{A}^{\#}=\mathscr{B}^{\#}$ and the cohomology rings $H(\mathscr{A})$ and $H(\mathscr{B})$ are isomorphic. We give examples to show that $\mathscr{A}$ and $\mathscr{B}$ are not necessarily derived equivalent, thereby answering to a question of Dugas.</description>

      <title>Cohomological rigidity of conformal Galilei algebras and their central extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the second adjoint cohomology of the compexification of the real conformal Galilei algebras \(\mathfrak{cga}_\ell(d,\mathbb{R})\) and their central extensions. These algebras are non-semisimple Lie algebras that appear as non-relativistic analogues of conformal Lie algebras. Using cohomological methods, including the Hochschild-Serre factorization theorem, we compute the space \(H^2(\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g})\) and examine conditions under which these algebras are cohomologically rigid. Our main result shows that the conformal Galilei algebras are rigid for all spatial dimensions \(d \neq 2\) when the spin \(\ell\) is a half-integer. This provides a complete characterization of the formal rigidity of these algebras in the specified parameter range.</description>

      <title>Complexity and recurrence in infinite words and related structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotics and fine-scale behavior of quantitative combinatorial measures of infinite words and related dynamical and algebraic structures.
  We construct infinite recurrent words $w$ whose complexity functions $p_w(n)$ are arbitrarily close to linear, but whose discrete derivatives are not bounded from above by $p_w(n)/n$. Moreover, we construct words of polynomially bounded complexity whose discrete derivatives exceed $p_w(n)/n^\varepsilon$ infinitely often, for every given $\varepsilon&gt;0$. These provide negative answers in a strong sense to an open question of Cassaigne from 1997, showing that his theorem on words of linear complexity is best possible.
  Next, we characterize, up to a linear multiplicative error, the complexity functions of strictly ergodic subshifts, showing that every non-decreasing, submultiplicative function arises in this setting. This gives the first `industrial' construction of strictly ergodic subshifts of prescribed subexponential complexity.
  We then investigate quantitative recurrence in uniformly recurrent words and, as an application, address a question of Bavula from 2006 related to holonomic inequalities on the spectrum of possible filter dimensions of simple associative algebras: we construct simple algebras of prescribed filter dimension in $[1,\infty)$ and essentially settling the problem entirely in the graded case. Throughout, we construct uniformly recurrent words of linear complexity and with arbitrary polynomial recurrence growth.</description>

      <title>On semigroups that are prime in the sense of Tarski, and groups prime in the senses of Tarski and of Rhodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $\mathcal{C}$ is a category of algebras closed under finite direct products, and $M_\mathcal{C}$ the commutative monoid of isomorphism classes of members of $\mathcal{C},$ with operation induced by direct product, A.Tarski defined a nonidentity element $p$ of $M_\mathcal{C}$ to be prime if, whenever it divides a product of two elements in that monoid, it divides one of them, and called an object of $\mathcal{C}$ prime if its isomorphism class has this property.
  McKenzie, McNulty and Taylor ask whether the category of nonempty semigroups has any prime objects. We show in section 2 that it does not. However, for the category of monoids, and some other subcategories of semigroups, we obtain examples of prime objects in sections 3-4. In section 5, two related questions open so far as I know, are recalled.
  In section 6, which can be read independently of the rest of this note, we recall two related conditions that are called primeness by semigroup theorists, and obtain results and examples on the relationships among those two conditions and Tarski's, in categories of groups. Section 7 notes an interesting characterization of one of those conditions when applied to finite algebras in an arbitrary variety.
  Various questions are raised.</description>

      <title>Deformation Theory and Hopf Actions on Koszul Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider graded deformations and PBW deformations of algebras defined over noncommutative algebras. We explain how fibers of graded deformations correspond to filtered algebras admitting a PBW property, with focus on smash product algebras for Hopf algebras acting on quadratic algebras. In particular, we describe all PBW deformations arising from Hopf actions on Koszul algebras, giving Hopf-Koszul Hecke algebras. Alexander-Whitney and Eilenberg-Zilber maps for twisted tensor products transfer homological information between resolutions and convert conditions on Hochschild cocycles and Gerstenhaber brackets into explicit PBW conditions.</description>

      <title>Polynomial log-volume growth in slow dynamics and the GK-dimensions of twisted homogeneous coordinate rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.03423v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let f be a zero entropy automorphism of a compact K\"ahler manifold X. We study the polynomial log-volume growth Plov(f) of f in light of the dynamical filtrations introduced in our previous work with T.-C. Dinh. We obtain new upper bounds and lower bounds of Plov(f). As a corollary, we completely determine Plov(f) when dim X = 3, extending a result of Artin--Van den Bergh for surfaces. When X is projective, Plov(f) + 1 coincides with the Gelfand--Kirillov dimensions GKdim(X,f) of the twisted homogeneous coordinate rings associated to (X,f). Reformulating these results for GKdim(X,f), we improve Keeler's bounds of GKdim(X,f) and provide effective upper bounds of GKdim(X,f) which only depend on dim X.</description>

      <title>Splittings in a complete local ring and decomposition its group of units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(R,M,k)$ be a complete local ring (not necessarily Noetherian). Then we prove that the natural surjective ring map $R\rightarrow k$ admits a splitting if and only if $\Char(R)=\Char(k)$. In addition, if $\Char(R)\neq\Char(k)$, then we prove that the natural surjective map between the groups of units $R^{\ast}\rightarrow k^{\ast}$ admits a splitting. As an application of this theorem, we show that the following short exact sequence of Abelian groups: $$\xymatrix{1\ar[r]&amp;1+M\ar[r]&amp; R^{\ast}\ar[r]&amp;k^{\ast} \ar[r]&amp;1}$$ is always split. We also show with an example that the above exact sequence does not split for many incomplete local rings.</description>
