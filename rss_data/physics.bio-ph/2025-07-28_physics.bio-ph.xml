      <title>Non-normal Dynamics on Non-reciprocal Networks: Reactivity and Effective Dimensionality in Neural Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions are a defining feature of many complex systems, biological, ecological, and technological, often pushing them far from equilibrium and enabling rich dynamical responses. These asymmetries can arise at multiple levels: locally, in the dynamics of individual units, and globally, in the topology of their interactions. In this work, we investigate how these two forms of non-reciprocity interact in networks of neuronal populations. At the local level, each population is modeled by a non-reciprocally coupled set of excitatory and inhibitory neural populations exhibiting transient amplification and reactivity. At the network level, these populations are coupled via directed, asymmetric connections that introduce structural non-normality. Since non-reciprocal interactions generically lead to non-normal linear operators, we frame both local and global asymmetries in terms of non-normal dynamics. Using a modified Wilson-Cowan framework, we analyze how the interplay between these two types of non-normality shapes the system's behavior. We show that their combination leads to emergent collective dynamics, including fluctuation-driven transitions, dimensionality reduction, and novel nonequilibrium steady states. Our results provide a minimal yet flexible framework to understand how multi-scale non-reciprocities govern complex dynamics in neural and other interconnected systems.</description>

      <title>Competing chemical gradients change chemotactic dynamics and cell distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cells are constantly exposed to diverse stimuli-chemical, mechanical, or electrical-that guide their movement. In physiological conditions, these signals often overlap, as seen during infections, where neutrophils and dendritic cells navigate through multiple chemotactic fields. How cells integrate and prioritize competing signals remains unclear. For instance, in the presence of opposing chemoattractant gradients, how do cells decide which direction to go? When should local signals dominate distant ones? A key factor in these processes is the precision with which cells sense each gradient, which depends non-monotonically on concentrations. Here, we study how gradient sensing accuracy shapes cell navigation in the presence of two distinct chemoattractant sources. We model cells as active random walkers that sense local gradients and combine these estimates to reorient their movement. Our results show that cells sensing multiple gradients can display a range of chemotactic behaviors, including anisotropic spatial patterns and varying degrees of confinement, depending on gradient shape and source location. The model also predicts cases where cells exhibit multistep navigation across sources or a hierarchical response toward one source, driven by disparities in their sensitivity to each chemoattractant. These findings highlight the role of gradient sensing in shaping spatial organization and navigation strategies in multi-field chemotaxis.</description>

      <title>Continuous and discontinuous shape transitions in the spatial distribution of self-propelling particles in power-law potential wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stationary states of an active Brownian particle and run-and-tumble particle in a two dimensional power-law potential well, in the limit where translational diffusion is negligible. The potential energy of the particle is taken to have the form $U(r)\propto r^{n}$, where $n\geq 2$ and even. We derive an exact equation for the positional probability distribution $\phi({\bf r})$ in two dimensions, and solve for the same, under the assumption that the particle's orientation angle is a Gaussian variable. We show that $\phi({\bf r})$ has compact support and undergoes a phase transition-like change in shape as the active velocity increases. For active Brownian particle, our theory predicts a continuous transition in shape for $n=2$ and a discontinuous transition for $n&gt;2$, both of which agree with simulation results. In the strongly active regime, the orientational probability distribution is unimodal near the outer boundary but becomes bimodal towards the interior, signifying orbiting motion. The unimodal-bimodal transition in the angular distribution is nearly absent for run-and-tumble particle.</description>

      <title>Self-organization drives symmetry-breaking, scaling, and critical growth transitions in stem cell-derived organoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of spatial patterns and organized growth is a hallmark of developing tissues. While symmetry-breaking and scaling laws govern these processes, how cells coordinate spatial patterning with size regulation remains unclear. Here, we combine quantitative imaging, a Turing activator-repressor model with self-organized reactive boundaries, and in vitro models of early mouse development to study mesodermal pattern formation in two-dimensional (2D) gastruloids. We show that colony size dictates symmetry: small colonies (radius approximately 100 micrometers) spontaneously break symmetry, while larger ones remain centro-symmetric, consistent with size-dependent positional information and model predictions. The mesodermal domain area scales robustly with colony size following a power law, independent of cell density, indicating that cells sense and respond to gastruloid size. Time-lapse imaging reveals a biphasic growth law: an early power-law expansion followed by exponential arrest, marking a dynamical phase transition. These dynamics, conserved across sizes, reflect features of criticality seen in physical systems, where self-organization, scaling, and boundary feedback converge. Our findings uncover a minimal mechanism for size-dependent pattern formation and growth control. This framework enables quantitative investigation of symmetry-breaking and scaling in self-organizing tissues, offering insights into the physical principles underlying multicellular organization.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This tutorial covers the emerging field of coarse-grained cellular growth modeling, and aims to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical application. By adopting an original "cookbook" approach, it is designed to offer a hands-on guide for constructing and analyzing different key aspects of cellular growth, focusing on available results for bacteria and beyond. The tutorial is structured as a series of step-by-step "recipes", and covers essential concepts, recent literature, and key challenges. It aims to empower a broad audience, from students to seasoned researchers, to replicate, extend, and innovate in this scientific area. Specifically, each section provides detailed, bare-bone models to start working in each area, from basic steady-state growth to variable environments and focusing on different key layers relevant to biosynthesis, transcription, translation, nutrient sensing and protein degradation, links between cell cycle and growth, ending with ecological insights.</description>

      <title>pH-Driven Fluorescence in Solid-State Lysine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is currently a growing interest in understanding the origins of intrinsic fluorescence as a way to design non-invasive probes for biophysical processes. In this regard, understanding how pH influences fluorescence in non-aromatic biomolecular assemblies is key to controlling their optical properties in realistic cellular conditions. Here, we combine experiments and theory to investigate the pH-dependent emission of solid-state L-Lysine (Lys). Lys aggregates prepared at different pH values using HCl and H$_2$SO$_4$ exhibit protonation- and counterion-dependent morphology and fluorescence, as shown by microscopy and steady-state measurements. We find an enhancement in the fluorescence moving from acidic to basic conditions. To uncover the molecular origin of these trends, we performed non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations on three Lys crystal models representing distinct protonation states. Our simulations indicate that enhanced protonation under acidic conditions facilitates non-radiative decay via proton transfer, whereas basic conditions favor radiative decay. These findings highlight pH as a key factor tuning fluorescence in Lys assemblies, offering insights for designing pH responsive optical materials based on non-aromatic amino acids.</description>

      <title>Paused in translation: A model for the transcript length-dependent impact of ribosome-targeting antibiotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ribosome-targeting antibiotics, such as chloramphenicol, stall elongating ribosomes during protein synthesis, disrupting mRNA translation. These antibiotic-induced pauses occur stochastically, alter collective ribosome dynamics and transiently block protein production on the affected transcript. Existing models of ribosome traffic often rely on idealized assumptions, such as infinitely long mRNAs and simplified pausing dynamics, overlooking key biological constraints. Here, we develop a Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP) that incorporates stochastic particle pausing, using experimentally determined pausing and unpausing rates to model the effects of ribosome-targeting antibiotics. We introduce a Single-Cluster approximation, which is analytically treatable, tailored to capture the biologically relevant regime of rare and long antibiotic-induced pauses. This biologically constrained model reveals three key insights: (i) the inhibition of antibiotic-induced translation strongly depends on transcript length, with longer transcripts being disproportionately affected; (ii) reducing ribosome initiation rates significantly mitigates antibiotic vulnerability; and (iii) inhibition of translation is governed more by collective ribosome dynamics than by single-ribosome properties. Our analytical predictions match Gillespie simulations, align quantitatively with experimental observations, and yield testable hypotheses for future experiments. These findings may have broader implications for the mechanistic modeling of other biological transport processes (e.g., RNAP dynamics), and more generally for the community studying traffic models.</description>

      <title>Evolution of robust cell differentiation under epigenetic feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In multi-cellular organisms, cells differentiate into multiple types as they divide. States of these cell types, as well as their numbers, are known to be robust to external perturbations; as conceptualized by Waddington's epigenetic landscape where cells embed themselves in valleys corresponding to final cell types. How is such robustness achieved by developmental dynamics and evolution? To address this question, we consider a model of cells with gene expression dynamics and epigenetic feedback, governed by a gene regulation network. By evolving the network to achieve more cell types, we identified three major differentiation processes exhibiting different properties regarding their variance, attractors, stability, and robustness. The first of these, type A, exhibits chaos and long-lived oscillatory dynamics that slowly transition until reaching a steady state. The second, type B, follows a channeled annealing process where the epigenetic changes in combination with noise shift the cells towards varying final cell states that increase the stability. Lastly, type C exhibits a quenching process where cell fate is quickly decided by falling into pre-existing fixed points while cell trajectories are separated through periodic attractors or saddle points. We find types A and B to correspond well with Waddington's landscape while being robust. Finally, the dynamics of type B demonstrate a differentiation process that uses a directed shifting of fixed points, visualized through the dimensional reduction of gene-expression states. Correspondence with the experimental data of gene expression variance through differentiation is also discussed.</description>

      <title>A versatile experimental method to measure the traction forces at interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement of surface forces, including cohesive forces and contact forces, is critical for understanding and controlling interactions at interfaces to optimize the interfacial performance of applications. The objective of this paper is to introduce a general in-situ method that enables the measurement of 3D micron-scale displacements and corresponding force distribution at interfaces in dry or wet environment. Stereo digital image correlation was used to measure the 3D-displacement of a soft and deformable substrate. The efficiency and accuracy of the technique were evaluated by applying compression to the substrate using a steel ball, with the measured 3D displacements aligning closely with finite element analysis simulations. To further assess the method's applicability, the wet adhesion between mussel plaques and substrate was tested under aqueous conditions. The interfacial displacements and forces at different stages during the test were measured. The application of the technique can be extended for varied circumstances regarding force range and substrate materials based on Winkler Spring model.</description>
