      <title>Detection of a highly stable orbital-period signal in GRACE-FO one-way intersatellite ranging using a synchronization-free differential observable (origin currently unidentified)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of a consistent, large-amplitude signal using a new synchronization-free protocol for probing directional time-dilation asymmetries with one-way ranging data between Earth-orbiting satellites. Our method, which relies exclusively on comparing successive range intervals measured by independent local clocks, was applied to data from the GRACE-FO mission. We observe a coherent signal in the derivative of the relative velocity projection, (v_A-v_B) dot V, that exhibits a clear orbital-period modulation. Crucially, the phase and amplitude of this modulation are found to be in excellent agreement across four distinct seasonal datasets, providing strong evidence against a purely random origin.
  Expressing this observable within the Standard-Model Extension (SME) framework yields an effective velocity magnitude of |V| ~= 139.3 +/- 0.1 km/s. While the corresponding effective SME coefficients (s-bar^0j from 10^-5 to 10^-4) exceed current laboratory bounds, the signal's stability and its coherence with the orbital frame make it a valuable diagnostic for systematic effects in orbital ranging. This work constitutes the first synchronization-free detection of a stable, orbital-scale signal of this type and establishes a clear, experimental path forward: applying this method to other platforms, most critically GNSS, to determine if the signal is a mission-specific systematic or a universal physical effect.</description>

      <title>Characterization of exotic matter in PT-symmetric wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous work [H. Zejli, Int. J. Mod. Phys. D 34, 2550052 (2025), arXiv:2508.00035], we introduced a PT-symmetric wormhole model based on a bimetric geometry, capable of generating closed timelike curves (CTCs). In this paper, we extend the analysis to the null hypersurface at the throat of this modified Einstein-Rosen bridge, where two regular Eddington-Finkelstein metrics render the geometry traversable. Using the Barrabes--Israel formalism in Poisson's reformulation, we evaluate the null shell's surface stress-energy tensor $S^{\alpha\beta}$ from the jump of the transverse curvature, revealing a violation of the null energy condition: a lightlike membrane of exotic matter with negative surface energy density and positive tangential pressure. This exotic fluid acts as a repulsive source stabilizing the throat, ensuring consistency with the Einstein field equations, including conservation laws on the shell. Beyond the local characterization, we outline potential observational signatures: (i) gravitational-wave echoes from the photon-sphere cavity; (ii) horizon-scale imaging with duplicated and through-throat photon rings, and non-Kerr asymmetries; (iii) quantum effects such as PT-induced frequency pairing with possible QNM doublets and partial suppression of vacuum flux at the throat; and (iv) a relic cosmological population yielding an effective $\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and seeding voids. Compared with timelike thin-shell constructions, our approach is based on a null junction interpreted as a lightlike membrane, combined with PT symmetry, providing a distinct route to traversability and clarifying the conditions under which CTCs can arise in a self-consistent framework.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Black Holes and Their Environments: Consequences for Gravitational Wave Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ten short years ago, we had the rare privilege of witnessing the onset of a renaissance in science: humanity finally succeeded in its arduous quest to directly detect gravitational waves. This breakthrough did not occur in a vacuum: it was the natural culmination of decades of research dedicated towards understanding the nature of gravitation based on Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. It is a story of false starts, perseverance, and remarkable insights, propelled as much by technological progress as by human curiosity. We now proudly live in the new golden age of gravitational physics. The detection of gravitational wave signals from the merger of binary black holes and neutron stars are becoming routine. Coupled with our theoretical understanding of phenomena in the strong gravity regime, black hole physics has become a precision science. The purpose of these lecture notes is to help the reader understand the language and framework of this rapidly evolving subject, and to develop the ability to interpret, think, and discuss ideas that lie at the confluence of gravitational wave astronomy and black hole physics. It is our hope that these notes will prepare students and colleagues for the next revolution when gravitational wave events become commonplace and we begin to observe unexpected features in the signal, indicating either surprising astrophysical scenarios or a strong need to modify the theoretical description of gravitational interactions. We provide first principles analysis of black hole and gravitational wave physics, and sometimes a very personal interpretation of results. We share with the readers a number of notebooks that will allow them to reproduce some of the most important results in the field, and could even help in carrying out state-of-the-art research. We also include a few original results that we think are helpful in understanding the broader picture.</description>

      <title>From minimal-length quantum theory to modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider generalized uncertainty principles (GUPs) that incorporate a minimal length through generic momentum-dependent deformation functions. We thus develop a systematic approach connecting such a framework to effective gravitational actions extending general relativity. By examining quantum gravity-motivated corrections to black hole entropy induced by the GUP and employing Wald's formalism, we reconstruct modifications to Einstein's gravity within the contexts of $f(R)$ and $f(R, R_{\mu\nu} R^{\mu\nu})$ theories. In this way, we establish a direct mapping between the GUP parameters and the higher-order curvature coefficients in the gravitational Lagrangian. As an illustrative application, we compute corrections to the general relativistic prediction for light deflection, which in turn allows us to infer a stringent upper bound on the minimal measurable length. Our results show that GUP-induced effects can be consistently embedded into extended gravity theories, offering a promising framework for testing quantum gravity phenomenology through astrophysical and cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Simulations of gravitational collapse in null coordinates IV: evolving through the event horizon, with an application to the spherical charged scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider line elements of the form $-2G\,du\,(dx+B\,du) + R^2(...)$, where $(...)$ does not contain $dx$. Surfaces of constant $u$ are then null surfaces, and their affinely parameterised generators have tangent vector $G^{-1}\partial_x$. Considering $u$ as the time coordinate, we can evolve either $R$ or $G$, with the other one found by solving the Raychaudhuri equation along the null generators, or we can evolve both. This choice of formulation is independent from the remaining gauge choice $x\to x'(u,x,...)$ in the line element above, which is fixed incrementally by the choice of $B$. For example, we can evolve $G$, in order to be able to evolve through an event horizon, and use $B$ in to adapt the coordinates to type-II critical collapse. As a demonstration of these ideas, we consider a charged scalar field in spherical symmetry. We consider two settings: a domain where the outgoing null cones of constant $u$ emanate from a regular centre $R=0$, and a domain where the outgoing null cones emanating from an ingoing-null boundary. We demonstrate convergence with resolution, within each formulation and between the three formulations in both settings. As testbeds, we compute the critical exponents and periodic fine-structures of the black hole charge and mass scaling laws in a one-parameter family of charged regular initial data, and examples of perturbed extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om solutions.</description>

      <title>Tides and energy conditions in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet thin-shell wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study spherical thin-shell wormholes in five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We show that configurations supported by non-exotic matter, that is matter satisfying the weak energy condition, are possible at the same time that traversability problems associated with strong radial tides at the throat can be avoided when suitable values of the parameters are adopted. Our construction is performed in such a way that it also allows for the admissible behaviour of the geometry in the whole spacetime.</description>

      <title>Modifications of Newtonian dynamics from higher moments of quantum spin connection in precanonical quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon previous work that derived an alternative to (galactic) dark matter in the form of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), with a specific theoretical interpolating function, from the motion of a non-relativistic test particle in the gravitational field of a point mass immersed in the non-relativistic static limit of the spin connection foam -- which represents the quantum analogue of Minkowski spacetime within precanonical quantum gravity -- we now show the consequences of using higher moments (third and fourth) of the corresponding geodesic equation with a random spin connection term. These higher moments lead to more general quantum modifications of the Newtonian potential (qMOND potentials expressed in terms of Gauss and Appell hypergeometric functions), more general (steeper) MOND interpolating functions, and a new modification of MOND at low accelerations (mMOND) that features an almost-flat asymptotic rotation curve $\propto r^{-1/18}$, which is expected to operate at approximately the same galactic scales as MOND.</description>

      <title>The effects of dark energy on the matter-gravity coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark energy perturbations are expected to modify the evolution of cosmological perturbations, producing observable effects on scalar perturbations and gravitational waves. We show that the effects of dark energy for a generic modified gravity model can be encoded in a momentum, space and polarization dependent effective matter-gravity coupling, in agreement with the results obtained in some specific theories, and that this is not just related to the effective Planck mass appearing in the action as a coefficient of the Ricci's scalar. Using appropriately defined effective energy tensors, we show that the method can be extended to include also the effects of higher order perturbations. The generality of this effective description of the effects of dark energy on cosmological perturbations gives a solid theoretical justification for the phenomenological approaches often used in the analysis of cosmological observations, allowing to understand the mapping between the results of phenomenological analysis of observational data and theoretical models. The momentum and polarization dependence of the effective gravitational coupling implies that the gravitational energy emitted by a binary coalescence can have an additional frequency and polarization dependence, due to the effects of dark energy perturbations.</description>

      <title>Power-law Bianchi type I inflation with multiple vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We seek power-law Bianchi type I solutions for an inflationary universe in a model with one scalar field non-minimally coupled to three vector fields aligned along the three axes. As a result, we find four types of power-law solutions that are classified according to the number of non-vanishing vector fields. Moreover, we find that all these solutions are stable for certain conditions on the parameters (stability regions), which are described both quantitatively and qualitatively. The attractor property of these solutions is also confirmed by numerical calculations.</description>

Abstract: We consider the general construction of near-horizon limit for extremal black hole solutions with non-trivial torsion, and derive the covariant geometric conditions for the existence this limit. A near-horizon solution with torsion is constructed in the case of extremal Kerr-AdS black hole, starting from an ansatz compatible with near-horizon symmetry. We demonstrate that this solution corresponds to the limit of a new black hole solution with torsion.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Bound State Perturbations Inside Black Holes and Isospectrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the bound state solutions for the polar perturbations in the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole. It is shown that for a given value of the spherical harmonic index $\ell$, there are a total of $\ell-1$ bound states for polar perturbations. We show both analytically and numerically that the spectrum of $\ell-2$ of these perturbations agrees identically with the spectrum of axial perturbations. Correspondingly, the isospectrality between the bound states of the axial and polar perturbations in the interior of the black hole does hold. This is significant since the effective potential is singular at the center of the black hole, and the existence of the isospectrality is far from obvious. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the additional mode found in the spectrum of polar perturbations is the algebraically special mode, which is the ground state of polar perturbations as well.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Evolution and Graceful Exit in Quartic Warm Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the full nonlinear dynamics of warm inflation driven by the quartic inflaton potential, avoiding any simplifying approximations. The thermal backreaction is incorporated through a dissipation coefficient that depends linearly on the temperature, and the model parameters are chosen to remain consistent with Planck observational constraints. By numerically integrating the complete set of three coupled, nonlinear differential equations that describe the evolution of the inflaton field, radiation energy density, and background expansion, we obtain an exact description of the system's dynamics. Our results reveal that, while transition to radiation domination is suppressed in the weak regime, the strong dissipative regime leads to a smooth and natural transition to a hot, radiation-dominated Universe, thereby confirming graceful-exit within warm inflation in the quartic scenario. The reheating temperature is extracted directly from the nonlinear evolution of warm inflation, yielding a temperature of approximately 10^13 GeV at the end of inflation, which cools to about 10^12 GeV near radiation-inflaton equality, whence the Universe transitions into a radiation-dominated era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the gravitational waveforms from the periodic orbits of a massive particle around a dyonic ModMax black hole. We begin with a brief analysis of the spacetime and then examine how its parameters influence the dynamics of a massive neutral particle using the Lagrangian formalism. In particular, we compute the characteristics of marginally bound orbits and innermost stable circular orbits. Our results show that the values of these quantities increase with the black hole charge $Q$ and the screening parameter $\gamma$. We then plot various periodic orbits, characterized by the integers ($z$,$w$,$v$). Finally, we present the gravitational waveforms associated with extreme mass ratio inspirals, consisting of a stellar-mass compact object orbiting a supermassive black hole.</description>

      <title>Addressing the gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field remains a demanding benchmark for numerical methods in numerical relativity, as it exhibits critical behavior at the boundary between dispersion and black hole formation. In this work we revisit this problem by relying on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as flexible partial differential equations solvers thereby providing a comparative assessment of several recent neural architectures. Building on the Einstein-massless-Klein-Gordon formulation in polar-areal coordinates, we consider four initial-value problems encompassing subcritical, critical, and supercritical regimes and use high-resolution finite-difference simulations as reference solutions. Our study is primarily comparative: we evaluate several state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, including vanilla and high-precision PINNs, sinusoidal-feature and quadratic-residual variants, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, all trained under a common loss design that encodes the field equations, boundary conditions, and causal time-space enforcement, together with a novel adaptive spacetime sampling. Within this framework we also introduce ModPINN, a modest modification of standard PINNs that augments standard multiplayer perceptrons with coordinate embeddings, quadratic layers among other common ingredients in recent literature. This study shows that deep-learning-based methods can reproduce finite-difference solutions for the scalar field and the spacetime metric with competitive accuracy using significantly fewer collocation points than more traditional methodologies. While no single architecture dominates in all regimes, ModPINN achieves particularly stable and accurate solutions near criticality, indicating that suitable designed embeddings and adaptive sampling can enhance the robustness of PINNs for challenging gravitational-collapse scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Standard measures of quantum non-Markovianity are usually defined in terms of dynamical maps on a preferred time foliation and therefore do not extend straightforwardly to curved spacetimes, where no global time coordinate exists and causal structure is primary. We develop a covariant framework for open quantum dynamics along arbitrary timelike worldlines by building multi-time quantum processes (process tensors) from overlapping causal diamonds. For an Unruh--DeWitt detector weakly coupled to a scalar field in a Hadamard state, we define a foliation-independent measure of non-Markovianity as the operational distance between the physical process tensor and the convex set of Markovian (CP-divisible) processes. Numerical benchmarks in $(1{+}1)$ dimensions compare inertial motion, uniform acceleration, and static and infalling trajectories in Schwarzschild spacetime. Inertial trajectories are found to be almost Markovian, whereas acceleration and curvature generate pronounced long-range temporal correlations and strong non-Markovian behaviour. In Rindler spacetime, acceleration produces horizon-induced memory tails. In Schwarzschild spacetime, near-horizon field correlations cause both static and freely falling observers to experience enhanced memory, which can remain hidden in single-step diagnostics but becomes evident in multi-time protocols and can even be superactivated by combining different time steps. Our results provide, to our knowledge, the first coordinate-independent, operational quantification of quantum memory in relativistic settings. They identify spacetime curvature, horizons, and acceleration as controllable ingredients that can either degrade or be harnessed as resources in relativistic quantum information tasks, including communication and metrology with accelerated detectors and near black holes.</description>

      <title>On the action principle as a guide to substantive general covariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Einstein was guided by the principle of general covariance in formulating general relativity, Kretschmann later argued that this principle lacks physical significance, since any space-time theory can be reformulated in a generally covariant form. This critique has prompted an ongoing debate over how to distinguish substantive general covariance from mere formal general covariance. Some proposals for defining substantive general covariance are based on the requirement that a theory be derivable from a diffeomorphism-invariant action. The present work aims to critically assess these proposals by examining canonical examples of Kretschmannian formulations of special relativistic theories. It will be shown that these formulations -- which seem merely formally generally covariant -- can always be derived from a diffeomorphism-invariant action. Although these actions involve auxiliary variables, these variables are trivial in the sense that they are either pure gauge or dynamically fixed by the other variables. Consequently, the theories described by these actions are arguably equivalent to the original Kretschmannian formulations. This stands in contrast to the actions proposed by Rosen and Sorkin, which include non-trivial auxiliary variables and hence seem to describe distinct physical theories. More recently, Freidel and Teh have suggested an additional criterion for substantial general covariance, namely that the action should also yield a non-trivial corner charge associated to diffeomorphism invariance. However, this too appears insufficient, since such actions can always be constructed.</description>

      <title>A New Definition of Horndeski Theory and the Possibility of Multiple Scalar Field Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the single-field case, Horndeski provides the most general scalar-tensor theory with second-order field equations. By contrast, systematic multi-field extensions remain incomplete: while the general field equations for the bi-Horndeski case are known, a general action has not been established, and for cases with three or more fields, neither a general action nor general equations are available. We characterize Horndeski by two mild axioms: closure under invertible pure disformal transformations and the requirement that the theory includes the minimal Horndeski theory. Under this characterization, we recover the standard single-field action up to boundary terms and obtain a practical path to multi-field constructions. In particular, we show that antisymmetric structures, such as those identified by Allys, Akama, and Kobayashi, appear within this framework, and indicate that this viewpoint has the potential to account for features captured by known bi-Horndeski equations.</description>

      <title>Detectability of axion-like dark matter for different time-delay interferometry combinations in space-based gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the space-based gravitational wave detections, the axion-like dark matter would alter the polarization state of the laser link between spacecrafts due to the birefringence effect. However, current designs of space-based laser interferometer are insensitive to variations in the polarization angle. Thus, the additional wave plates are employed to enable the response of the axion-induced birefringence effect. We calculate and compare the sensitivities of different space-based detectors, accounting for three time-delay interferometry combinations, including Monitor, Beacon, and Relay. We find that the Monitor and Beacon combinations have better sensitivity in the high-frequency range, and the optimal sensitivity reaches $g_{a\gamma}\sim 10^{-13}\text{GeV}^{-1}$, while the Sagnac combination is superior in the low-frequency range. We also find that ASTROD-GW can cover the detection range of axion-like dark matter mass down to $10^{-20}\text{eV}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to provide an analytical model for the formation of stable structures (cosmological or astrophysical), where stability is obtained through the tangential pressure countering the effect of gravity. We utilize the generalization of the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) spacetime to matter with tangential pressure generated by the angular momentum of fluid particles. Extending the Krasi\'nski-Hellaby (KH) LTB reconstruction method, we show how set of three functions defined on two arbitrary hypersurfaces can fully determine the spacetime geometry. We further restrict our attention to the bounded case and develop the weak-field and the small-angular-momentum approximations. We show how these can be applied to the exact solution on the initial hypersurface, together with the oscillatory solution on the final hypersurface, to considerably simplify the reconstruction scheme. The so obtained models exhibit explicit dust-like behaviour in the early and middle stages of the collapse, and reach the final state as oscillations around the static solution.</description>

      <title>Starobinsky potential and power suppression in hybrid Loop Quantum Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect on the primordial tensor power spectrum of varying the number of e-folds during slow-roll inflation in Loop Quantum Cosmology with a Starobinsky potential. Using the hybrid quantization approach, we derive the effective mass governing tensor mode evolution. The choice of vacuum state is crucial, especially since the preinflationary phase predicted by Loop Quantum Cosmology invalidates the choice of the Bunch-Davies state as the preferred vacuum. We adopt a choice which is optimally adapted to the dynamics, so that it provides a non-oscillating (NO) spectrum free of spurious contributions, and permits an asymptotic Hamiltonian diagonalization (AHD) of the perturbations. For this so-called NO-AHD vacuum, we compute the power spectrum using both analytic approximations and numerical integration. Our results confirm the accuracy of our approximations in a wide range of situations, including short- and long-lived inflationary scenarios. The primordial power spectrum exhibits a characteristic cutoff on a wavenumber scale determined primarily by the background dynamics around the bounce that replaces the big bang in Loop Quantum Cosmology.</description>

      <title>An Analytical Formula for Gravitational Faraday Rotation in the ADM Split of Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytical expression is derived for the rate of gravitational Faraday rotation measured by Eulerian observers. The reference frame is a Fermi-Walker triad aligned with the spatial wave vector. Attention is restricted to the ADM split of Kerr spacetime and geometric optics. Our exact, closed-form GFR formula is implemented and verified to be consistent with numerical predictions. The approach offers a new perspective on Faraday rotation, and it allows a single Eulerian observer to compare experimentally measured polarization holonomy with analytical prediction. Sliced spacetime does not suffer from a mathematical singularity at the ergosphere associated with Boyer-Lindquist coordinates in the threading decomposition. These physically intuitive coordinates can therefore be used to analytically produce and study GFR predictions for transits of light that pierce the ergosphere.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Renormalisation: A Categorical Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a categorical formulation of the Hamiltonian renormalisation programme for quantum field theories, establishing a systematic bridge between functional and lattice renormalisation. To this end, we introduce two categories, $Seq$ and $Func$, whose objects correspond to resolution spaces at different ultraviolet scales, and whose morphisms encode embeddings, projections, coarse-graining maps, and discrete derivatives.
  Focusing on Dirichlet-type embeddings, we construct the corresponding subcategories $Seq_D$, $Func_D$ and prove that the embedding and its adjoint define functors between them.
  Furthermore we revisit and extend the analysis of the convergence rate to the fixed point for the couplings of the $U(1)^3$ model for $3+1$ Euclidean quantum gravity, analysing different combinations of Haar and Dirichlet embeddings.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic models in LQC with GBP polymerisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer models are effective in describing quantum gravity effects around the initial singularity, leading to its replacement by bouncing surfaces on which the curvature and densities are finite. Their properties depend on the space-time symmetry and on the particular polymerisation scheme adopted. In this article we investigate anisotropic models under the Gambini-Ben\'itez-Pullin polymerisation, recently used to quantise spherically symmetric black-holes, whose interiors are isometric to Kantowski-Sachs (KS) space-times. Demanding that the minimum area defined by the bouncing surface matches the Loop Quantum Gravity area gap, we can find its radius alongside the curvature and effective density and pressures at the bounce. The density is always positive, while the pressures are negative enough to avoid the singularity. Due to the positive spatial curvature, the solution is oscillatory, reaching a maximum radius where a re-collapse occurs. Therefore, a positive cosmological constant is included in order to have an eternal expansion to a late de Sitter phase. We have also considered a Bianchi III metric, showing that the bounce is still present, but the space-time is asymptotically flat in this case, with no re-collapse. In this hyperbolic space, the minimal area constraint can also be imposed on compact $2$-surfaces. Nevertheless, in contrast to the KS case, it is enough for avoiding the singularity, independently of polymerisation procedures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are a number of classical double copies, each providing a prescription for generating solutions to the Maxwell and scalar wave equations from exact solutions of Einstein's equations. Two such prescriptions are the Kerr-Schild and twistorial double copies. We argue that for a broad class of self-dual vacuum solutions of the Kerr-Schild form, which we refer to as twistorial Kerr-Schild spacetimes, these two prescriptions are in fact equivalent. The approach is elementary, utilizing null Lorentz transformations, with homogenous functions on twistor space playing a central role. The equivalence is illustrated explicitly for the example of the self-dual (Kerr)-Taub-NUT spacetime. A detailed proof and several more examples will be presented in a long-form companion to this letter.</description>

      <title>Unitary SUSY for the chiral graviton and chiral gravitino in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that a unitary supersymmetric quantum field theory (QFT) involving graviton and gravitino fields on fixed 4-dimensional de Sitter spacetime ($dS_4$) cannot exist due to known challenges associated with supersymmetry (SUSY) on spaces with positive cosmological constant. In this talk, we contradict this expectation by presenting a new unitary supersymmetric QFT on fixed $dS_4$ : the free supersymmetric theory of the chiral graviton and chiral gravitino fields. The theory overcomes the known obstacles to unitary global SUSY on de Sitter because the commutator between two SUSY transformations closes on the conformal algebra $so(4,2)$ rather than the de Sitter algebra $so(4,1)$. Crucially, the $so(4,2)$ symmetry is realised through unconventional conformal-like transformations. Based on arxiv:2503.04515.</description>

      <title>A Neural Network Approach to Preferred Event Selection for Low-Latency Gravitational-Wave Alerts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration uses multiple independent search pipelines to detect gravitational waves, often resulting in multiple triggers (g-events) for a single astrophysical source. These triggers are grouped into superevents, raising a critical question for multimessenger astronomy: which g-event provides the most accurate sky localization for electromagnetic follow-up? Currently, the g-event with the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is selected, under the assumption that it should provide the best estimators of the source's parameters, including its location on the sky. Analysis of simulated signals reveals systematic deviations from this expectation. In particular, a false-alarm rate (FAR)-based selector performs slightly better than the SNR-based method, but introduces pipeline biases. We present a neural network-based selector trained on simulated signals to identify the g-event with the minimum searched area -- a metric quantifying localization accuracy. The network uses information (detector SNRs, FAR, and chirp mass) from all of the triggers associated with each astrophysical source and is designed to be pipeline-agnostic. Our results show that the neural network outperforms both traditional selectors, achieving a mean searched area ~2% smaller than the SNR-based selector. Unlike FAR-based selection, the neural network preserves the underlying distribution of pipeline contributions, avoiding systematic biases toward specific pipelines. The network can be trained in approximately one minute on a few thousand events and performs event selection instantaneously, making it suitable for low-latency applications. These results demonstrate that machine learning can enhance multimessenger astronomy capabilities while maintaining fairness across detection pipelines. We recommend implementing this approach for future observing runs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inclusion of higher derivatives is a necessary condition for a renormalizable or superrenormalizable local theory of quantum gravity. On the other hand, higher derivatives lead to classical instabilities and a loss of unitarity at the quantum level. A standard way to detect such issues is by examining the reflection positivity condition and the existence of a Kallen-Lehmann spectral representation for the two-point function. We demonstrate that these requirements for a consistent quantum theory are satisfied in a theory we have recently proposed. This theory is based on a six-derivative scalar field action featuring a pair of complex-mass ghost fields that form a bound state. Our results support the interpretation that physical observables can emerge from ghost dynamics in a consistent and unitary framework.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological dynamics of a universe described by Lyra's geometry in the presence of dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM). Dark energy is modeled as a quintessence scalar field with bulk viscosity, while dark matter is allowed to interact with the scalar sector. The displacement vector field, arising naturally in Lyra's manifold, provides an additional geometric contribution. By employing dynamical system techniques, we analyze stability properties and late-time attractors. Our results indicate that viscosity and DE--DM interaction enrich the phase space structure and can help address both the cosmic acceleration and the coincidence problem. Furthermore, by performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis with recent observational datasets, we derive best-fit values for the model parameters that exhibit good consistency with current data.</description>

      <title>Self-dual instantons and gravitating dyons in non-Abelian ModMax theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent interest in conformal and duality invariant nonlinear electrodynamics, we study the non-Abelian extension of ModMax electrodynamics. The theory is parameterized by a single dimensionless constant, and it is continuously connected to Yang-Mills theory in its vanishing limit. We show that the theory admits (anti-)self-dual instantons, despite the additional nonlinearities that characterize the non-Abelian ModMax theory. For $SU(2)$, we construct the generalization of the BPST instanton and extend this solution to Euclidean de Sitter and anti-de Sitter backgrounds. In the latter case, the Chern-Pontryagin index depends on the instanton size since the configuration is not a pure gauge at infinity; a property already pointed out in Yang-Mills on negative-curvature backgrounds by Callan and Wilczek. We compute the contribution of the latter to the spectrum of the Dirac operator at the boundary, which is crucial for determining the non-local contributions to the Dirac index. Then, we show that the ansatz constructed with 't Hooft symbols accommodates multi-instantons in the non-Abelian ModMax theory. The system of (anti-)self-dual equations reduces to a single nonlinear equation, which can be perturbatively solved order by order in the parameter that controls the nonlinearity. Following such a strategy, we provide a formal solution for the $N$-instanton configuration to first order in the expansion. Then, we couple non-Abelian ModMax theory to gravity with a conformally coupled scalar field and construct new gravitating solutions that describe Euclidean wormholes and other smooth configurations with secondary hair.</description>

      <title>The effective field theory of the gravitational functional measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational path integral measure has been the subject of an increasing interest lately, and no conclusive answer yet exists for its correct form. In this paper, we adopt effective field theory techniques to shed light on this issue. We build the configuration-space metric as an energy expansion, including all possible terms that satisfy the underlying symmetries, and use it to define a Riemannian measure. We study the running of the free parameters that show up in this expansion at leading order, which corresponds to the DeWitt metric with parameter $\lambda$. We show that a flat configuration space is excluded on unitarity grounds. The renormalization group contains one UV fixed point at $\lambda=-1$, thus allowing for the UV completion of the measure sector. This fixed point corresponds to the value obtained by identifying DeWitt's metric from the kinetic term of general relativity, a standard procedure in the literature that otherwise lacks physical motivation. Our results provide such a justification from first principles.</description>

      <title>Challenging the $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM parametrization through rational expansions in view of DESI data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In view of the new Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2025 results, we analyze three types of \emph{Pad\'e cosmology}, based on rational series making use of Pad\'e approximants over the equations of state, namely Pad\'e$^{\omega}$ (0,1) and Pad\'e$^{\omega}$ (1,1), plus a Pad\'e$^{q}$ (0,1), i.e., a rational expansion on the dark energy deceleration parameter, in which where the numerator and denominator orders are incorporated into the above brackets. These scenarios appear alternative dark energy parameterizations with respect to the well-known $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM model, claimed as the most viable model by DESI. Accordingly, we perform Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) analyses with the publicly available \texttt{CLASS} Boltzmann code, including the three Pad\'e cosmology, along with the $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM and $\Lambda$CDM standard pictures. To this end, we combine independent probes from high to low redshifts to obtain reliable constraints on the cosmological parameters of these models and compare them using statistical selection criteria. \emph{Our results show that Pad\'e cosmology is neither statistically excluded nor worse than the $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM parametrization}. On the contrary, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) identifies Pad\'e$^{q}$ (0,1) as \emph{the best-fit model}, with weak evidence against the $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM parameterization, while the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) provides \emph{strong evidence against the $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM model, favoring Pad\'e (1,1)}. Based on our bounds, we further investigate the evolution of the squared sound speed, revealing that the Pad\'e$^{q}$ (0,1) and Pad\'e$^{\omega}$ (0,1) parameterizations exhibit enhanced stability compared with the other cases here considered and, therefore, describe robust alternatives for the cosmological background.</description>

      <title>Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky Quantization of Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky quantization of the quadratic gravity theory, which is the most general theory with terms up to quadratic order in curvature. This approach of quantization is based on the Hamiltonian formulation. In this sense, this study contributes to the consistency of the quantum formulation of the theory. With this scheme of quantization we may introduce a broad class of additional conditions on the field variables, by including Lagrange multipliers and time derivatives. We find that a mandatory condition for the validity of the Hamiltonian formulation, previously known from classical analysis, can be incorporated consistently in this quantization. We obtain the propagators of the fields, including the propagators associated with the quantum states of negative norm. The spectrum of masses coincides with the results of Stelle, but distributed on a different way among the fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Recent GMVA observations of M 87 at event horizon scales revealed a ring-like structure which is 50% larger at 86 GHz than the ring observed by the Event Horizon Telescope at 230 GHz. Aims. In this paper, we study a possible origin of the increased ring size at 86 GHz. We specifically aim to study the role the nonthermal electron population plays in the observed event horizon scales. Methods. We carry out 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations followed by radiative transfer calculations. We incorporate into the latter synchrotron emission from both thermal and nonthermal electrons. To better compare our results to observations, we generate synthetic interferometric data adjusted to the properties of the observing arrays. We fit geometrical models to this data in Fourier space through Bayesian analysis to monitor the variable ring size and width over the simulated time span of years. Results. We find that the 86 GHz ring is always larger than the 230 GHz ring, which can be explained by the increased synchrotron self-absorption at 86 GHz and the mixed emission from both the accretion disk and the jet footpoints, as well as flux arcs ejected from a magnetized disk. We find agreement with the observations, particularly within the error range of the observational value of M/D for M 87. Conclusions. We show that state-of-the art 3D GRMHD simulations combined with thermal and nonthermal emitting particles can explain the observed frequency-dependent ring size in M 87. Importantly we found that MAD events triggered in the accretion disk can significantly increase the lower frequency ring sizes.</description>

      <title>Detector Response to Gravitational Wave Polarizations in Gravitational Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of gravitational wave polarization modes within Gravitational Quantum Field Theory (GQFT), a unified theoretical framework reconciling general relativity and quantum field theory. In the six fundamental polarization: two tensors ($+, \times$), two vectors (x, y), and two scalars (breathing, longitudial) modes of gravitational wave, two tensors and breathing are favored by GQFT. Their distinctive detection signatures in space-based interferometers like LISA and Taiji can be verified. Using first-order orbital dynamics in the Solar System Barycenter frame, we identify three novel observational features: (1) characteristic interference patterns between polarization modes, (2) provide a model-independent response function, and (3) sky-position-dependent optimal detection methods. Our approach provides complete sky coverage through polarization mapping while remaining fully compatible with existing mission designs, notably avoiding the need for challenging direct breathing-mode measurements. The results are presented through comprehensive sky maps, offering both theoretical insights into gravitational wave polarization and practical tools for future detectors. This work establishes a new paradigm for testing fundamental gravity theories through their unique polarization fingerprints</description>

      <title>A unified topological classification of circular orbits for charged particles in black hole spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05061v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of circular orbits offers profound insights into the structure of spacetime around black holes. While the topological properties of these orbits are well-established for neutral particles, the influence of electric charge-particularly for massless particles-remains a subject of exploration. In this work, we employ a topological current $\phi$-mapping approach to systematically investigate the circular orbits of charged test particles in static, spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes with flat, anti-de Sitter (AdS), and de Sitter (dS) asymptotics. We demonstrate that the particle's charge significantly alters the topological classification of both timelike and null circular orbits. A key finding is that for multi-horizon black holes, if a circular orbit with fixed angular momentum and charge exists between two neighboring horizons, there will always be at least one unstable null and one unstable timelike circular orbit. Outside the outermost horizon, the asymptotic behavior of spacetime and the specific charge ratio crucially determine the topological charge $W$, dictating the existence and stability of orbits. Our results, validated through Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN), RN-AdS, and RN-dS examples, extend the topological orbit classification framework and provide a foundation for potential applications in environments where effective charge dynamics may be relevant, such as magnetized plasmas around black holes.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we derive exact solutions for four-dimensional static spherically symmetric black holes and three-dimensional rotating black holes within a Lorentz-violating gravity theory. In this framework, Lorentz symmetry is spontaneously broken when a nonminimally coupled Kalb-Ramond tensor field acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value. Building upon these solutions, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of the black holes using the Iyer-Wald formalism. Our findings reveal that the standard first law of thermodynamics and the Smarr relation remain valid for black holes in the presence of the Kalb-Ramond field.</description>

      <title>Measuring spin precession from massive black hole binaries with gravitational waves: insights from time-domain signal morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robustly measuring binary black hole spins via gravitational waves is key to understanding these systems' astrophysical origins, but remains challenging -- especially for high-mass systems, whose signals are short and dominated by the merger. Nonetheless, events like GW190521 show that strong spin precession can indeed be gleaned. In this work, we track how spin precession imprints on simulated high-mass binary black hole signals cycle-by-cycle using time-domain inference. We investigate a suite of signals, all with the same spins and (near-unity) mass ratio -- yielding identical spin evolution -- but different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), total masses, and extrinsic angles, all of which affect the observed waveform morphology. We truncate each signal at various times and infer source parameters using only the data before or after each cutoff. The resultant posterior allows us to identify which time segments of each signal inform its spin precession constraints. We find that at a sufficiently high post-peak SNR ($\sim 20$), spin precession can be constrained by the NRSur7dq4 waveform model when just the post-peak data (i.e., ringdown) are visible. Similarly, at a large enough pre-cutoff SNR ($\sim 10$), spin precession can be constrained using only pre-peak data (i.e., inspiral); this occurs for signals with detector-frame total mass $\lesssim 100 M_{\odot}$ at GW190521's full-signal SNR. Finally, we vary the inclination, polarization, and phase angles, finding that their configuration need not be fine-tuned to measure spin precession, even for very high-mass and short signals with two to three observable cycles. We do not find that the same morphological features consistently drive precession constraints: in some signals, precession inference hinges on the relationship between a loud merger and quiet pre-merger cycle, as was the case for GW190521, but this is not generically true.</description>

      <title>A new exact rotating spacetime in vacuum: The Kerr--Levi-Civita Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new rotating solution of Einstein's theory in vacuum by exploiting the Lie point symmetries of the field equations in the complex potential formalism of Ernst. In particular, we perform a discrete symmetry transformation, known as inversion, of the gravitational potential associated with the Kerr metric. The resulting metric describes a rotating generalization of the Schwarzschild--Levi-Civita spacetime, and we refer to it as the Kerr--Levi-Civita metric. We study the key geometric features of this novel spacetime, which turns out to be free of curvature singularities, topological defects, and closed timelike curves. These attractive properties are also common to the extremal black hole and the super-spinning case. The solution is algebraically general (Petrov-type I), and its horizons lie at the horizon radii of the Kerr black hole. The ergoregions, however, are strongly influenced by the Levi-Civita-like asymptotic structure, producing an effect akin to the magnetized Kerr--Newman and swirling solutions. Interestingly, while its static counterpart permits a Kerr--Schild representation, the Kerr--Levi-Civita metric does not admit such a formulation.</description>

      <title>Complete quasinormal modes of Type-D black holes</title>

Abstract: Quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra of black holes exhibit two open problems [Conf. Proc. C 0405132, 145 (2004); CQG 26, 163001 (2009)]: (i) the discontinuity in highly damped QNMs between Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions as $a \to 0$, and (ii) the unexplained spectral proximity between QNMs and algebraically special (AS) frequencies, particularly the anomalous multiplet splitting for Kerr $\ell=2$, $m \geq 0$ modes. We develop a novel method to compute complete QNM spectra for Type-D black holes, solving both problems and establishing a mathematical framework for boundary value problems of dissipative systems. Using analytic continuation of radial eigenvalue equations, our method eliminates the dependence on auxiliary parameters in the connection formulas for confluent Heun solutions. This breakthrough overcomes the long-standing challenge of calculating QNMs that cross or lie on the negative imaginary axis (NIA). For Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes ($0 \leq {n} \leq 41$, $2 \leq \ell \leq 16$), we present complete spectra validated through scattering amplitudes with errors $&lt;10^{-10}$. The results provide definitive solutions to both open problems: (i) The inability of conventional methods to compute QNMs crossing or residing on the NIA leads to apparent discontinuities in Kerr spectra as $a \to 0$. (ii) When a QNM exactly coincides with the AS frequency, an additional QNM (unconventional mode) appears nearby. For the Kerr case with $\ell=2$, overtone sequences from both unconventional and AS modes exhibit precisely $2\ell+1$ branches, without multiplets or supersymmetry breaking at AS frequencies. Our method confirms Leung's conjecture of high-$\ell$ unconventional mode deviations from the NIA through the first $\ell=3$ calculation. Moreover, this paradigm surpasses the state-of-the-art Cook's continued fraction and isomonodromic methods in computational efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In earlier companion papers, we showed that non-singular primordial black holes (PBHs) could account for all the dark matter (DM) over a significantly wider mass range compared to Schwarzschild PBHs. Those studies, mostly based on phenomenological metrics, are now extended by considering the quantum-corrected space-time recently proposed by Zhang, Lewandowski, Ma and Yang (ZLMY), derived from an effective canonical (loop) quantum gravity approach explicitly enforcing general covariance. Unlike the BHs considered earlier, ZLMY BHs are free from Cauchy horizons, and are hotter than their Schwarzschild counterparts. We show that this higher temperature boosts the evaporation spectra of ZLMY PBHs, tightening limits on their abundance relative to Schwarzschild PBHs and shrinking the asteroid mass window where they can constitute all the DM, a result which reverses the earlier trend, but rests on firmer theoretical ground. While stressing the potential key role of quantum gravity effects in addressing the singularity and DM problems, our study shows that working within a consistent theoretical framework can strongly affect observational predictions.</description>

      <title>A spacetime-covariant approach to inertial and accelerated quantum clocks in first-quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is expected that a quantum theory of gravity will radically alter our current notion of spacetime geometry. However, contrary to what was commonly assumed for many decades, quantum gravity effects could manifest in scales much larger than the Planck Scale, provided that there is enough coherence in the superposition of geometries. Quantum Clocks, i.e. quantum mechanical systems whose internal dynamics can keep track of proper-time lapses, are a very promising tool for probing such low-energy quantum gravity effects. In this work, we contribute to this subject by proposing a spacetime-covariant formalism to describe clocks in first quantization. In particular, we account for the possibility of dynamically accelerated clocks via suitable couplings with external fields. We find that a particular decomposition of the (quadratic) clock Hamiltonian into positive- and negative-mass sectors, when attainable, enables one to compute the evolution of the system directly in terms of the clock's proper-time while maintaining explicit covariance. When this decomposition is possible, the evolution obtained is always unitary, even with couplings with external fields used to, e.g., accelerate the clocks. We then apply this formulation to compute the joint time evolution of a pair of quantum clocks in two cases: (i) inertial clocks with relative motion and (ii) charged clocks accelerated by a uniform magnetic field. In both cases, when our clocks are prepared in coherent states, we find that the density matrix $\rho_{\tau_2|\tau_1}$ describing time-measurements of the two clocks yields not only conditional probabilities whose peaks match exactly the classical expected values for time dilation, but also yields coherent quantum fluctuations around that peak, with a profile which is either a pure Gaussian (i) or a Gaussian combined with a periodic modulation (ii).</description>

      <title>Black holes in the external Bertotti-Robinson-Bonnor-Melvin electromagnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12908v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An exact and analytical solution, in four-dimensional general relativity coupled with Maxwell electromagnetism, is built by means of a Lie point symmetry of the Ernst equations, the Harrison transformation. The new spacetime describes a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded into a general external back-reacting electromagnetic field, which is the superposition of the Levi-Civita-Bertotti-Robinson and the Bonnor-Melvin ones. The relation between the two homogeneous electromagnetic fields is clarified. Conserved charges and the first law of thermodynamics are analysed. Swirling generalisations are also considered. Limits to the known metrics such as Schwarzschild-Bertotti-Robinson, Schwarzschild-Bonnor-Melvin and Bertotti-Robinson-Bonnor-Melvin are discussed.</description>

      <title>Radial Oscillations of Scalar Hair in Black Hole Bombs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research has revealed a novel nonlinear mechanism, distinct from the linear superradiant instability, which triggers the black hole bomb phenomenon. Introducing a massive complex scalar field with nonlinear self-interactions drives the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole to shed substantial energy, thereby triggering a black hole bomb. Radial oscillations in the scalar hair profile are observed during this process. In this paper, we further reveal that physical quantities associated with scalar hair exhibit identical oscillation patterns during the evolution of the black hole-scalar field system. Moreover, the oscillation frequency exhibits a linear dependence on the gauge coupling constant of the scalar field with other parameters fixed. Meanwhile, the horizon radius of hairy black holes and the mass within the horizon increase monotonically with the gauge coupling constant. We have also identified a critical initial charge value that distinguishes hairy solutions that trigger black hole bombs from those that do not.</description>

      <title>Lightweight posterior construction for gravitational-wave catalogs with the Kolmogorov-Arnold network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural density estimation has seen widespread applications in the gravitational-wave (GW) data analysis, which enables real-time parameter estimation for compact binary coalescences and enhances rapid inference for subsequent analysis such as population inference. In this work, we explore the application of using the Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) to construct efficient and interpretable neural density estimators for lightweight posterior construction of GW catalogs. By replacing conventional activation functions with learnable splines, KAN achieves superior interpretability, higher accuracy, and greater parameter efficiency on related scientific tasks. Leveraging this feature, we propose a KAN-based neural density estimator, which ingests megabyte-scale GW posterior samples and compresses them into model weights of tens of kilobytes. Subsequently, analytic expressions requiring only several kilobytes can be further distilled from these neural network weights with minimal accuracy trade-off. In practice, GW posterior samples with fidelity can be regenerated rapidly using the model weights or analytic expressions for subsequent analysis. Our lightweight posterior construction strategy is expected to facilitate user-level data storage and transmission, paving a path for efficient analysis of numerous GW events in the next-generation GW detectors.</description>

      <title>Amplification of new physics in the quasinormal mode spectrum of highly-rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that perturbatively-small higher-derivative corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action can lead to order-one modifications of the quasinormal mode spectrum of near-extremal Kerr black holes. The spectrum of such black holes contains zero-damping modes (ZDMs) and damped modes (DMs), with the latter only existing when the ratio $\mu=m/(l+1/2)$ is below a critical value $\bar{\mu}_{\rm cr}\approx 0.744$. Thus, this value represents a "phase boundary" that separates a region with both ZDMs and DMs and a region with only ZDMs. We find that the modes lying close to the phase boundary are very sensitive to modifications of GR, as their lifetimes receive corrections inversely proportional to their distance to the boundary. We link this growth of the corrections to a modification of the critical point $\bar{\mu}_{\rm cr}$, which can lead to a change in the number of DMs and produce order-one effects in the spectrum. We show that these large effects can take place in a regime in which the higher-derivative expansion remains under control. We also perform an exact analysis of the modification of the phase boundary for lower $(l,m)$ modes and pinpoint those that are most sensitive to corrections. Our results indicate that spectroscopy of highly-rotating black holes is by far the most powerful way to search for new physics in ringdown signals.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for the Spontaneous Scalarization of Regular Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous scalarization of generic, static, and spherically symmetric regular black holes supported by nonlinear electrodynamics. Starting from an arbitrary seed metric, we employ the P-dual formalism to reconstruct the electromagnetic sector and subsequently couple a real scalar field nonminimally. As a worked example, we apply the framework to the regular Balart-Vagenas black hole, showing that scalarized and scalar-free branches can coexist in a region where the scalarized configurations are entropically preferred. We further assess possible observational imprints, finding percent-level deviations in both the shadow size and the fundamental scalar quasi-normal modes ($&lt; 10\%$ for small charge-to-mass ratios), indicating that current electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations do not rule out these solutions. Our construction thus provides a general route to explore scalarization on top of nonlinear-electrodynamics-supported spacetimes, extending beyond specific Reissner-Nordstr\"om-like cases.</description>

      <title>Generating optimal Gravitational-Wave template banks with metric-preserving autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matched filtering for signal detection in noisy data requires template banks that capture variation in signal waveforms while minimizing computational cost. Dimensionality reduction of signal waveforms can be important for building efficient template banks. In various domains of physics, dimensionality reduction is very commonly performed using linear methods such as singular value decomposition (SVD). This can, however, introduce redundancies if the signals span curved, nonlinear manifolds in parameter space. Alternatively, autoencoders are a type of neural networks that can be used for non-linear dimensionality reduction. We use a variation of the autoencoder which preserves the metric in its latent space ($g_{ij}^{\text{latent}} \approx g_{ij}^{\text{physical}}$); this enables template banks to be constructed by simply placing a uniform grid in the autoencoder's low-dimensional latent space. We apply our method for creating geometric template banks for gravitational wave searches and show that our banks require fewer dimensions compared to using the SVD basis. Our method can also be useful for other applications requiring dimensionality reduction, such as gravitational waveform modeling, fast parameter estimation and model-independent tests of general relativity. Finally, we discuss extensions to other domains including cosmological parameter estimation, and we show tests of our method in extreme cases of periodic signal manifolds.</description>

      <title>Detecting Collective Excitations in Self-Gravitating Bose-Einstein Condensates via Faraday Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18593v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Faraday waves as a probe for collective excitations in self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates (SGBECs). Using a semi-classical approach based on linear stability analysis of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Newton equations, we derive a damped Mathieu equation governing parametric instabilities. Our analysis reveals well-separated regions of parametric resonance and Jeans instability in parameter space, with distinct growth rate characteristics: Jeans instability decreases monotonically to zero at the critical wavenumber $k_J$, while parametric resonance exhibits non-monotonic behavior with a clear maximum. These findings provide explicit experimental guidelines for accessing the parametric resonance regime. Numerical simulations demonstrate the transition from Faraday wave formation to Jeans collapse as gravitational strength increases, validating our theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity Corrections to the Scalar Quasi-Normal Modes in Near-Extremal Reissener-Nordstr\"{o}m Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22945v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum corrections to scalar quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in the near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole background with quantum correction in the near-horizon AdS$_2\times \mathrm{S}^2$ region. By performing a dimensional reduction, we obtain an effective Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity theory, whose quantum fluctuations are captured by the Schwarzian action. Using path integral techniques, we derive the quantum-corrected scalar field equation, which modifies the effective potential governing the QNMs. These corrections are extended from the near-horizon region to the full spacetime via a matching procedure. We compute the corrected QNMs using both the third-order WKB method and the Prony method and find consistent results. Our analysis reveals that quantum corrections can lead to substantial shifts in the real parts of QNM frequencies, particularly for small-mass or near-extremal black holes, while the imaginary parts remain relatively stable. This suggests that quantum gravity effects may leave observable imprints on black hole perturbation spectra, which could be potentially relevant for primordial or microscopic black holes.</description>

      <title>Using tunable coherence for reaching micrometer coherence lengths and suppressing stray light in a power-recycled Michelson interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By reentering into laser interferometers, scattered or stray light introduces non-linear noise. This is a major limitation of precision interferometers as preventing such parasitic light is nearly impossible. Thus, substantial effort is put into mitigating the reentering of these fields in various ways. Ground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors employ such mitigation techniques to reduce otherwise restrictive stray light noise. However, they are now reaching sensitivities where conventional mitigation techniques reach limitations. Further improvements planed for future observatories are placing even more demanding constraints on tolerable stray light power. We previously presented tunable coherence as a possible technique to ease these constraints and suppress unwanted coherent interference. For these promising demonstrations, the remaining coherence length and achievable suppression in length-constrained layouts was limited, among other things, by the used pseudo-random-noise phase modulation frequency. In this work, we demonstrate stray light suppression and cavity performance at modulation frequencies up to 10 GHz. This reduces the remaining coherence to a few centimeter in an interferometer, and even to the scale of the laser wavelength in a cavity. We further present a first demonstration of tunable coherence in a power-recycled Michelson interferometer, successfully suppressing stray light in a more complex topology.</description>

      <title>Dust Attenuation of Lyman-Werner Feedback: Reassessing Early Super Massive Black Holes Seed Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11111v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dust shielding on Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation fields and its implications for supermassive black hole (SMBH) seed formation at high redshift. Using a custom-built semi-analytical model developed specifically for this study, we implement a simple dust shielding prescription that accounts for the absorption of LW photons by dust grains. We find that even modest dust enrichment can significantly reduce the effective LW radiation field, allowing H$_2$ cooling to persist in regions previously thought to be affected by LW feedback. This changes the conditions for seed formation, particularly for heavy seeds which require suppression of H$_2$ cooling. Our results suggest that dust shielding extends the redshift range and volume where heavy seeds can form, and significantly alters the relative importance of different seed populations. We discuss the implications for the formation of high-redshift SMBHs and future observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a symmetry argument for the vanishing and non-renormalization of static Love numbers for spherically symmetric black holes at full nonlinear order in four-dimensional General Relativity. The symmetry is realized both in full GR and in the worldline EFT, allowing for a unified treatment and proving both vanishing and non-renormalization to all orders. This closes some loop-holes in previous arguments that neglected nonlinearities in the worldline EFT, and extends previous vanishing results to all nonlinear static tides. When extended to higher-dimensional gravity, these arguments also explain the pattern of vanishing and running static Love numbers of electric and tensor type, and predict new results at the nonlinear order. We also apply our findings to the tidal response of shift-symmetric scalar fields, predicting the vanishing of even order nonlinear static Love numbers and unifying these statements with the no-hair theorem (and its violations).</description>

      <title>Kerr Black Hole Shadows in Dispersive Plasma: Frequency-Dependent Geodesics and Shadow Distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The black hole shadow, a direct probe of the event horizon's gravitational influence, has been observationally confirmed by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). While theoretical models of shadows in vacuum are mature, real astrophysical black holes like M87* and Sgr A* are enveloped in plasma, which can alter photon trajectories through dispersion. Current understanding, based on foundational work, indicates that only specific plasma distributions allow for an analytical treatment via the separation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work, we build upon this framework to systematically investigate the propagation of light rays in Kerr spacetime surrounded by a pressureless, non-magnetized cold plasma. We explicitly derive the separability condition, identifying the exact class of plasma densities that permit a generalized Carter constant. For these models, we compute the photon regions and shadow boundaries, characterizing how the shadow's size and shape deviate from the vacuum case in a frequency-dependent manner. Our results provide analytical benchmarks for the distortion of shadows in dispersive media and determine the critical plasma frequency beyond which the shadow is erased, offering a direct link between observable shadow features and the properties of the ambient plasma environment and providing a foundation for studying more dynamic, non-separable plasma distributions.</description>

      <title>Recalibrating Inflation: Insights from Starobinsky Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent analyses of low-redshift supernova and Cepheid data reveal localized shifts in the distance modulus, often interpreted as calibration anomalies or hints of new physics. We propose that these features may emerge naturally from environment-dependent modifications to gravity. In particular, we examine the Starobinsky \(f(R) = R + \lambda R^2\) model, which introduces a scalar degree of freedom that couples to ambient matter density and alters photon propagation in underdense regions. We derive the corresponding corrections to luminosity distance and show that they can reproduce the observed magnitude shifts without invoking discontinuities or empirical step functions. Statistical comparisons using AIC and BIC favor the Starobinsky framework over phenomenological models, supporting its role as a minimal, geometric explanation for emergent calibration transitions.</description>
