      <title>Bridging the Gap Between Contextual and Standard Stochastic Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextual Stochastic Bilevel Optimization (CSBO) extends standard Stochastic Bilevel Optimization (SBO) by incorporating context-specific lower-level problems, which arise in applications such as meta-learning and hyperparameter optimization. This structure imposes an infinite number of constraints - one for each context realization - making CSBO significantly more challenging than SBO as the unclear relationship between minimizers across different contexts suggests computing numerous lower-level solutions for each upper-level iteration. Existing approaches to CSBO face two major limitations: substantial complexity gaps compared to SBO and reliance on impractical conditional sampling oracles. We propose a novel reduction framework that decouples the dependence of the lower-level solution on the upper-level decision and context through parametrization, thereby transforming CSBO into an equivalent SBO problem and eliminating the need for conditional sampling. Under reasonable assumptions on the context distribution and the regularity of the lower-level, we show that an $\epsilon$-stationary solution to CSBO can be achieved with a near-optimal sampling complexity $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$. Our approach enhances the practicality of solving CSBO problems by improving both computational efficiency and theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Local Linear Convergence of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Semidefinite Programming under Strict Complementarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the local linear convergence properties of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) when applied to Semidefinite Programming (SDP). A longstanding belief suggests that ADMM is only capable of solving SDPs to moderate accuracy, primarily due to its sublinear worst-case complexity and empirical observations of slow convergence. We challenge this notion by introducing a new sufficient condition for local linear convergence: as long as the converged primal-dual optimal solutions satisfy strict complementarity, ADMM attains local linear convergence, independent of nondegeneracy conditions. Our proof is based on a direct local linearization of the ADMM operator and a refined error bound for the projection onto the positive semidefinite cone, improving previous bounds and revealing the anisotropic nature of projection residuals. Extensive numerical experiments confirm the significance of our theoretical results, demonstrating that ADMM achieves local linear convergence and computes high-accuracy solutions in a variety of SDP instances, including those cases where nondegeneracy fails. Furthermore, we identify where ADMM struggles, linking these difficulties with near violations of strict complementarity-a phenomenon that parallels recent findings in linear programming.</description>

      <title>Contractivity Analysis and Control Design for Lur'e Systems: Lipschitz, Incrementally Sector Bounded, and Monotone Nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the contractivity of Lur'e dynamical systems whose nonlinearity is either Lipschitz, incrementally sector bounded, or monotone. We consider both the discrete- and continuous-time settings. In each case, we provide state-independent linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which are necessary and sufficient for contractivity. Additionally, we provide LMIs for the design of controller gains such that the closed-loop system is contracting. Finally, we provide a numerical example for control design.</description>

      <title>Two-Player Dynamic Potential LQ Games with Sequentially Revealed Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a novel finite-horizon linear-quadratic (LQ) feedback dynamic potential game with a priori unknown cost matrices played between two players. The cost matrices are revealed to the players sequentially, with the potential for future values to be previewed over a short time window. We propose an algorithm that enables the players to predict and track a feedback Nash equilibrium trajectory, and we measure the quality of their resulting decisions by introducing the concept of \emph{price of uncertainty}. We show that under the proposed algorithm, the price of uncertainty is bounded by horizon-invariant constants. The constants are the sum of three terms; the first and second terms decay exponentially as the preview window grows, and another depends on the magnitude of the differences between the cost matrices for each player. Through simulations, we illustrate that the resulting price of uncertainty initially decays at an exponential rate as the preview window lengthens, then remains constant for large time horizons.</description>

      <title>Relative portfolio optimization via a value at risk based constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider $n$ agents who invest in a general financial market that is free of arbitrage and complete. The aim of each investor is to maximize her expected utility while ensuring, with a specified probability, that her terminal wealth exceeds a benchmark defined by her competitors' performance. This setup introduces an interdependence between agents, leading to a search for Nash equilibria. In the case of two agents and CRRA utility, we are able to derive all Nash equilibria in terms of terminal wealth. For $n&gt;2$ agents and logarithmic utility we distinguish two cases. In the first case, the probabilities in the constraint are small and we can characterize all Nash equilibria. In the second case, the probabilities are larger and we look for Nash equilibria in a certain set. We also discuss the impact of the competition using some numerical examples. As a by-product, we solve some portfolio optimization problems with probability constraints.</description>

      <title>Turnpike in optimal control and beyond: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The turnpike principle is a fundamental concept in optimal control theory, stating that for a wide class of long-horizon optimal control problems, the optimal trajectory spends most of its time near a steady-state solution (the ''turnpike'') rather than being influenced by the initial or final conditions. In this article, we provide a survey on the turnpike property in optimal control, adding several recent and novel considerations. After some historical insights, we present an elementary proof of the exponential turnpike property for linear-quadratic optimal control problems in finite dimension. Next, we show an extension to nonlinear optimal control problems, with a local exponential turnpike property. On simple but meaningful examples, we illustrate the local and global aspects of the turnpike theory, clarifying the global picture and raising new questions. We discuss key generalizations, in infinite dimension and other various settings, and review several applications of the turnpike theory across different fields.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of suboptimality under bounded disturbances for the adaptive systems based on speed-graadient approach is discussed. A formulation of the estimated optimality of nonlinear nonlinearly parametrized adaptive control systems is given and sufficient conditions for the estimated optimality in a specified uncertainty class are described for algorithms robustified by negative parametric feedback. A special case of passification based adaptive control for linear time invariant systems is studied to demonstrate application of the paper results..</description>

      <title>Development of New Methods for Detection and Control of Credit Card Fraud Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Credit card fraud causes significant financial losses and frequently occurs as fraud attack, defined as short-term sequence of fraudulent transactions associated with high transaction rates and amounts, business areas historically tied to fraud, unusual transaction times and locations and different types of errors. Confidence interval method in the moving window with exponential forgetting is proposed in this report which allows to capture recent changes in the shopping behaviour of the cardholder, detect fraudulent amounts and mitigate the attack. Fraud risk scoring method is used for estimation of the intensity of the fraudulent activity via monitoring of the transaction rates, merchant category codes, times and some other factors for detection of the start of the attack. The development and verification are based on detailed analysis of the transaction patterns from the dataset, which represents an extensive collection of around 24.4 million credit card transactions from IBM financial database. Recommendations for further development of the detection techniques are also presented.</description>

      <title>Extended mean field control: a finite-dimensional numerical approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a finite-dimensional numerical approximation for a class of extended mean field control problems. Our algorithm learns the value function on the whole Wasserstein domain, as opposed to a fixed initial condition. We leverage the approximation of the mean field problem by a finite-player cooperative optimisation problem, due to the propagation of chaos, together with the usage of finite-dimensional solvers. This avoids the need to directly approximate functions on an infinite-dimensional domain, and allows for more efficient memory usage and faster computation.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Objective Capacity-Constrained Optimization of Corn Planting Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article describes an improved set of solutions to the problems presented in the 2021 Syngenta Crop Challenge in Analytics \citep{Syngenta2021}. In particular, we use multiobjective optimization and predictive modeling methods to determine a corn planting schedule. The problem involves the following objectives: i. minimize the median and maximum absolute difference between weekly harvest quantity and the storage capacity, the number of nonzero harvest weeks, and the total amount of corn wasted. This is accomplished while respecting planting windows, expected harvest amounts, the growing degree units required to bring seeds to harvest, and historical weather data. We used a Long Short-Term Memory model to predict growing degree units for 2020 and 2021, based on historical data. Then, we used a genetic algorithm, and an extensive search of the tuning parameter space, to produce a Pareto front of solutions for three distinct optimization models related to the Challenge. We evaluate the quality of the Pareto fronts for each model, and use the results to choose a preferred model and final solution. We also provide comparisons between our final solutions, previous solutions submitted to the Challenge, and solutions from other groups.</description>

      <title>Optimal reinsurance in a competitive market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a stochastic differential game in a ruin theoretic environment. In our setting two insurers compete for market share, which is represented by a joint performance functional. Consequently, one of the insurers strives to maximize it, while the other seeks to minimize it. As a modelling basis we use classical surplus processes extended by dynamic reinsurance opportunities, which allows us to use techniques from the theory of piecewise deterministic Markov processes to analyze the resulting game. In this context we show that a dynamic programming principle for the upper and lower value of the game holds true and that these values are unique viscosity solutions to the associated Bellman-Isaacs equations. Finally, we provide some numerical illustrations.</description>

      <title>Singular Arcs on Average Optimal Control-Affine Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we address optimal control problems in which the system parameters follow a probability distribution, and the optimization is based on average performance. These problems, known as Riemann-Stieltjes optimal control or optimal ensemble control problems, involve uncertainties that influence system dynamics. Focusing on control-affine systems, we apply the Pontryagin Maximum Principle to characterize singular arcs in a feedback form. To demonstrate the practical relevance of our approach, we apply it to the sterile insect technique, a biological pest control method. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of our framework in addressing control problems under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Infinite Time Horizon Optimal Control of McKean-Vlasov SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory of optimal control for McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations with infinite time horizon and discounted gain functional. We first establish the well-posedness of the state equation and of the associated control problem under suitable hypotheses for the coefficients. We then especially focus on the time invariance property of the value function V, stating that it is in fact independent of the initial time of the dynamics. This property can easily be derived if the class of controls can be restricted, forgetting the past of the Brownian noise, without modifying the value. This result is not trivial in a general McKean-Vlasov case; in fact, we provide a counterexample where changing the class of controls worsens the value. We thus require appropriate continuity assumptions in order to prove the time invariance property. Furthermore, we show that the value function only depends on the initial random condition through its probability distribution. The function V can thus be rewritten as a map v on the Wasserstein space of order 2. After establishing a Dynamic Programming Principle for v, we derive an elliptic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, solved by v in the viscosity sense. Finally, using a finite horizon approximation of our optimal control problem, we prove that the aforementioned equation admits a unique viscosity solution under stronger assumptions.</description>

      <title>Projection-based curve pattern search for black-box optimization over smooth convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the problem of optimizing a black-box smooth function over a full-dimensional smooth convex set. We study sets of feasible curves that allow to properly characterize stationarity of a solution and possibly carry out sound backtracking curvilinear searches. We then propose a general pattern search algorithmic framework that exploits curves of this type to carry out poll steps and for which we prove properties of asymptotic convergence to stationary points. We particularly point out that the proposed framework covers the case where search curves are arcs induced by the Euclidean projection of coordinate directions. The method is finally proved to arguably be superior, on smooth problems, than other recent projection-based algorithm from the literature on constrained black-box optimization.</description>

      <title>Implementing Dynamic Power Feed-In Limitations of Photovoltaic Systems in Distribution Grids for Generation Expansion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of photovoltaic (PV) systems in Austria's medium- and low-voltage grids has intensified challenges in grid access, with technical limits increasingly leading to restrictions on full feed-in power. This issue has sparked discussions about limiting PV feed-in power and the implications for both generated and curtailed PV energy. At the same time, expanding PV capacity remains critical to achieving future climate targets. However, there is a lack of robust methodologies of quantify the impact of PV feed-in limitations when implemented in an optimization model. This impact affects both the curtailed energy and the increase in maximum PV installation capacity and total energy production. To address this gap, we have developed a mathematical formulation of dynamic PV feed-in limitations and integrated it into an optimization model. This approach enables a comprehensive evaluation of its effects on PV integration potential and energy curtailment, validated through case studies on four representative real-world Austrian medium- and low-voltage grids. We analyzed maximum PV expansion, energy generation, and curtailment under feed-in constraints. The results highlight the potential for integrating up to 32% additional PV systems within existing infrastructure while keeping PV curtailment relatively low, i.e. at 2%. We provide actionable insights for grid operators and policymakers aiming to balance renewable energy expansion with grid reliability.</description>

      <title>Welfare and Cost Aggregation for Multi-Agent Control: When to Choose Which Social Cost Function, and Why?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many multi-agent socio-technical systems rely on aggregating heterogeneous agents' costs into a social cost function (SCF) to coordinate resource allocation in domains like energy grids, water allocation, or traffic management. The choice of SCF often entails implicit assumptions and may lead to undesirable outcomes if not rigorously justified. In this paper, we demonstrate that what determines which SCF ought to be used is the degree to which individual costs can be compared across agents and which axioms the aggregation shall fulfill. Drawing on the results from social choice theory, we provide guidance on how this process can be used in control applications. We demonstrate which assumptions about interpersonal utility comparability -- ranging from ordinal level comparability to full cardinal comparability -- together with a choice of desirable axioms, inform the selection of a correct SCF, be it the classical utilitarian sum, the Nash SCF, or maximin. We then demonstrate how the proposed framework can be applied for principled allocations of water and transportation resources.</description>

      <title>Accurate, provable, and fast nonlinear tomographic reconstruction: A variational inequality approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of signal reconstruction for computed tomography (CT) under a nonlinear forward model that accounts for exponential signal attenuation, a polychromatic X-ray source, general measurement noise (e.g. Poisson shot noise), and observations acquired over multiple wavelength windows. We develop a simple iterative algorithm for single-material reconstruction, which we call EXACT (EXtragradient Algorithm for Computed Tomography), based on formulating our estimate as the fixed point of a monotone variational inequality. We prove guarantees on the statistical and computational performance of EXACT under practical assumptions on the measurement process. We also consider a recently introduced variant of this model with Gaussian measurements, and present sample and iteration complexity bounds for EXACT that improve upon those of existing algorithms. We apply our EXACT algorithm to a CT phantom image recovery task and show that it often requires fewer X-ray projection exposures, lower source intensity, and less computation time to achieve similar reconstruction quality to existing methods.</description>

      <title>A stochastic gradient descent algorithm with random search directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic coordinate descent algorithms are efficient methods in which each iterate is obtained by fixing most coordinates at their values from the current iteration, and approximately minimizing the objective with respect to the remaining coordinates. However, this approach is usually restricted to canonical basis vectors of $\mathbb{R}^d$. In this paper, we develop a new class of stochastic gradient descent algorithms with random search directions which uses the directional derivative of the gradient estimate following more general random vectors. We establish the almost sure convergence of these algorithms with decreasing step. We further investigate their central limit theorem and pay particular attention to analyze the impact of the search distributions on the asymptotic covariance matrix. We also provide the non-asymptotic $\mathbb{L}^p$ rates of convergence.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Lagrangian scheme for Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the numerical approximation of time-dependent, possibly degenerate, second-order Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations in bounded domains with nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. It is well known that convergence towards the exact solution of the equation, considered here in the viscosity sense, holds if the scheme is monotone, consistent, and stable. While standard finite difference schemes are, in general, not monotone, the so-called semi-Lagrangian schemes are monotone by construction. On the other hand, these schemes make use of a wide stencil and, when the equation is set in a bounded domain, this typically causes an overstepping of the boundary and hence the loss of consistency. We propose here a semi-Lagrangian scheme defined on an unstructured mesh, with a suitable treatment at grid points near the boundary to preserve consistency, and show its convergence for problems where the viscosity solution can even be discontinuous. We illustrate the numerical convergence in several tests, including degenerate and first-order equations.</description>

      <title>DR-PETS: Learning-Based Control With Planning in Adversarial Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20660v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring robustness against epistemic, possibly adversarial, perturbations is essential for reliable real-world decision-making. While the Probabilistic Ensembles with Trajectory Sampling (PETS) algorithm inherently handles uncertainty via ensemble-based probabilistic models, it lacks guarantees against structured adversarial or worst-case uncertainty distributions. To address this, we propose DR-PETS, a distributionally robust extension of PETS that certifies robustness against adversarial perturbations. We formalize uncertainty via a p-Wasserstein ambiguity set, enabling worst-case-aware planning through a min-max optimization framework. While PETS passively accounts for stochasticity, DR-PETS actively optimizes robustness via a tractable convex approximation integrated into PETS planning loop. Experiments on pendulum stabilization and cart-pole balancing show that DR-PETS certifies robustness against adversarial parameter perturbations, achieving consistent performance in worst-case scenarios where PETS deteriorates.</description>

      <title>Decoherence time maximization and partial isolation for open quantum harmonic oscillator memory networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a network of open quantum harmonic oscillators which interact with their neighbours through direct energy and field-mediated couplings and also with external quantum fields. The position-momentum dynamic variables of the network are governed by linear quantum stochastic differential equations associated with the nodes of a graph whose edges specify the interconnection of the component oscillators. Such systems can be employed as Heisenberg picture quantum memories with an engineered ability to approximately retain initial conditions over a bounded time interval. We use the quantum memory decoherence time defined previously in terms of a fidelity threshold on a weighted mean-square deviation for a subset (or linear combinations) of network variables from their initial values. This approach is applied to maximizing a high-fidelity asymptotic approximation of the decoherence time over the direct energy coupling parameters of the network. The resulting optimality condition is a set of linear equations for blocks of a sparse matrix associated with the edges of the direct energy coupling graph of the network. We also discuss a setting where the quantum network has a subset of dynamic variables which are affected by the external fields only indirectly, through a complementary ``shielding'' system. This holds under a rank condition on the network-field coupling matrix and can be achieved through an appropriate field-mediated coupling between the component oscillators. The partially isolated subnetwork has a longer decoherence time in the high-fidelity limit, thus providing a particularly relevant candidate for a quantum memory.</description>

      <title>ASGO: Adaptive Structured Gradient Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) is a structured optimization problem, because the parameters are naturally represented by matrices and tensors rather than simple vectors. Under this structural representation, it has been widely observed that gradients are low-rank and Hessians are approximately block-wise diagonal. These structured properties are crucial for designing efficient optimization algorithms but may not be utilized by current popular optimizers like Adam. In this paper, we present a novel optimization algorithm ASGO that capitalizes on these properties by employing a preconditioner that is adaptively updated using structured gradients. By fine-grained theoretical analysis, ASGO is proven to achieve superior convergence rates compared to existing structured gradient methods. Based on the convergence theory, we further demonstrate that ASGO can benefit from the low-rank and block-wise diagonal properties. We also discuss practical modifications of ASGO and empirically verify the effectiveness of the algorithm on language model tasks.</description>

Abstract: We study distributionally robust optimization with Sinkhorn distance -- a variant of Wasserstein distance based on entropic regularization. We derive a convex programming dual reformulation for general nominal distributions, transport costs, and loss functions. To solve the dual reformulation, we develop a stochastic mirror descent algorithm with biased subgradient estimators and derive its computational complexity guarantees. Finally, we provide numerical examples using synthetic and real data to demonstrate its superior performance.</description>

      <title>An Accelerated Distributed Stochastic Gradient Method with Momentum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09714v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an accelerated distributed stochastic gradient method with momentum for solving the distributed optimization problem, where a group of $n$ agents collaboratively minimize the average of the local objective functions over a connected network. The method, termed ``Distributed Stochastic Momentum Tracking (DSMT)'', is a single-loop algorithm that utilizes the momentum tracking technique as well as the Loopless Chebyshev Acceleration (LCA) method. We show that DSMT can asymptotically achieve comparable convergence rates as centralized stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method under a general variance condition regarding the stochastic gradients. Moreover, the number of iterations (transient times) required for DSMT to achieve such rates behaves as $\mathcal{O}(n^{5/3}/(1-\lambda))$ for minimizing general smooth objective functions, and $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n/(1-\lambda)})$ under the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition. Here, the term $1-\lambda$ denotes the spectral gap of the mixing matrix related to the underlying network topology. Notably, the obtained results do not rely on multiple inter-node communications or stochastic gradient accumulation per iteration, and the transient times are the shortest under the setting to the best of our knowledge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the reachability analysis of curves in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with a prescribed curvature bound. Based on Pontryagin Maximum Principle, we leverage the existing knowledge on the structure of solutions to minimum-time problems, or Markov-Dubins problem, to reachability considerations. Based on this development, two types of reachability are discussed. First, we prove that any boundary point of the reachability set, with the directional component taken into account as well as geometric coordinates, can be reached via curves of H, CSC, CCC, or their respective subsegments, where H denotes a helicoidal arc, C a circular arc with maximum curvature, and S a straight segment. Second, we show that the reachability set when directional component is not considered\textemdash{}the position reachability set\textemdash{}is simply a solid of revolution of its two-dimensional counterpart, the Dubins car. These findings extend the developments presented in literature on Dubins car into spatial curves in $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Facility Location under Cumulative Customer Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic facility location problems aim at placing one or more valuable resources over a planning horizon to meet customer demand. Existing literature commonly assumes that customer demand quantities are defined independently for each time period. In many planning contexts, however, unmet demand carries over to future time periods. Unmet demand at some time periods may therefore affect decisions of subsequent time periods. This work studies a novel location problem, where the decision maker places facilities over time to capture cumulative customer demand. We propose two mixed-integer programming models for this problem, and show that one of them has a tighter continuous relaxation and allows the representation of more general customer demand behaviour. We characterize the computational complexity for this problem, and analyze which problem characteristics result in NP-hardness. We then propose an exact branch-and-Benders-cut method, and show that this method is approximately five times faster than solving the tighter formulation directly. Our results also quantify the benefit of accounting for cumulative customer demand within the optimization framework, since the corresponding planning solutions perform much better than those obtained by ignoring cumulative demand or employing myopic heuristics. We also draw managerial insights about the service quality perceived by customers when the provider places facilities under cumulative customer demand.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with a general maximum principle for the fully coupled forward-backward stochastic optimal control problem with jumps, where the control domain is not necessarily convex, within the progressively measurable framework. A distinct feature in this paper is that the solution $Z$ of BSDEPs could include the variable ``$e$'', further, the diffusion term of BSDEPs takes the form $\int_{\mathcal{E}}Z_{(t,e)}\nu(d e)d W_t$ rather than the conventional $Z_t dW_t$, reflecting the essential coupling between the solution component $Z$ and the Polish space $\mathcal{E}$.</description>

      <title>A Bregman-Sinkhorn Algorithm for the Maximum Weight Independent Set Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scalable approximate algorithm for the NP-hard maximum-weight independent set problem. The core component of our algorithm is a dual coordinate descent applied to a smoothed LP relaxation of the problem. This technique is commonly known by the names Bregman method and Sinkhorn algorithm in the literature. Our algorithm addresses a family of clique cover LP relaxations, where the constraints are determined by the set of cliques covering the underlying graph. The objective function of the relaxation is smoothed with an entropy term. A crucial aspect determining efficiency of our approach is controlling the smoothing level during the optimization process. While several dedicated techniques have been considered in the literature to this end, we propose a new one based on estimation of the relaxed duality gap. To make this estimation possible, we developed a new projection method to the feasible set of the considered LP relaxation. We experimentally show that our smoothing scheduling significantly outperforms the standard one based on feasibility estimation. Additionally to solving the relaxed dual, we utilize a simple and very efficient primal heuristic to obtain feasible integer solutions of the original non-relaxed problem. Our heuristic is a combination of randomized greedy generation and optimal recombination applied to the reduced costs computed by the dual optimization. Our experimental validation considers two datasets rooted in real-world applications, where our method demonstrates the ability to discover high-quality approximate solutions within 10 seconds for graphs with up to 882 thousand nodes and 344 million edges.</description>

Abstract: We consider MaxCut-type semidefinite programs (SDP) which admit a low rank solution. To numerically leverage the low rank hypothesis, a standard algorithmic approach is the Burer-Monteiro factorization, which allows to significantly reduce the dimensionality of the problem at the cost of its convexity. We give a sharp condition on the conditioning of the Laplacian matrix associated with the SDP under which any second-order critical point of the non-convex problem is a global minimizer. By applying our theorem, we improve on recent results about the correctness of the Burer-Monteiro approach on $\mathbb{Z}_2$-synchronization problems and the Kuramoto model.</description>

Abstract: We prove the exact worst-case convergence rate of gradient descent for smooth strongly convex optimization on $\mathbb{R}^d$. Concretely, assuming that the objective function $f$ is $\mu$-strongly convex and $L$-smooth, we identify the smallest possible value of $\tau$ for which the inequality $f(x_{N})-f_{*}\leq\tau\|x_{0}-x_{*}\|^{2}$ always holds. The result was previously conjectured by Drori and Teboulle for the case $\mu=0$, and by Taylor, Hendrickx, and Glineur for the case $\mu&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Degradation-based Energy Management for Microgrids in the Presence of Energy Storage Elements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integration of Inverter-based Resources (IBRs) such as solar-powered plants which lack the intrinsic characteristics such as the inertial response of the traditional synchronous-generator (SG) based sources presents a new challenge in the form of analyzing the grid stability under their presence. For example, solar power is available for approximately from 9 AM-5 PM. However, the result of the rise in power consumption after 6 PM and the reverting back to the non-renewable source of power generation during that period puts immense stress on the grid, testing the ramp limitations of the SGs. Failure to meet the required power demand due to SG ramp limitations leads to failure of the power grid and other catastrophes. Numerous mitigation techniques exist in order to address the ramping issues with adding the energy storage elements (ESE) to the grid being one. ESEs have higher ramping capabilities compared to the traditional SGs. Also, the ESEs can store the energy and supply it to the grid when required making them extremely responsive to high ramp situations. However, the rate of degradation of the ESEs is faster than the SGs. This raises an important issue of addressing the degradation of the ESEs while meeting the required power demand objectives and constraints. This work proposes a battery degradation-aware model predictive energy management strategy and it is tested via a numerical simulation on multiple physical systems such as Shipboard Power Systems (SPS). Moreover, the risk arising due to the fault in the IBR is also studied by means of a numerical simulation. Overall, the goal of this study is to make the existing power grid more robust, resilient, and risk-free from component degradation and eventual failures.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Non-Parametric Model Learning and Adaptive Control of MDPs with Borel spaces: Identifiability and Near Optimal Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an average cost stochastic control problem with standard Borel spaces and an unknown transition kernel. We do not assume a parametric structure on the unknown kernel. We present topologies on kernels which lead to their identifiability and ensures near optimality through robustness to identifiability errors. Following this, we present two data-driven identifiability results; the first one being Bayesian (with finite time convergence guarantees) and the second one empirical (with asymptotic convergence guarantees). The identifiability results are, then, used to design near-optimal adaptive control policies which alternate between periods of exploration, where the agent attempts to learn the true kernel, and periods of exploitation where the knowledge accrued throughout the exploration phase is used to minimize costs. We will establish that such policies are near optimal. Moreover, we will show that near optimality can also be achieved through policies that simultaneously explore and exploit the environment. Thus, our primary contributions are to present very general conditions ensuring identifiability, as well as adaptive learning and control which leads to optimality. Key tools facilitating our analysis are a general measurability theorem, robustness to model learning, and continuity of expected average cost in stationary policies under Young topology.</description>

      <title>Polytope Volume Monitoring Problem: Formulation and Solution via Parametric Linear Program Based Control Barrier Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the latest research on feasible space monitoring of multiple control barrier functions (CBFs) as well as polytopic collision avoidance, this paper studies the Polytope Volume Monitoring (PVM) problem, whose goal is to design a control law for inputs of nonlinear systems to prevent the volume of some state-dependent polytope from decreasing to zero. Recent studies have explored the idea of applying Chebyshev ball method in optimization theory to solve the case study of PVM; however, the underlying difficulties caused by nonsmoothness have not been addressed. This paper continues the study on this topic, where our main contribution is to establish the relationship between nonsmooth CBF and parametric optimization theory through directional derivatives for the first time, so as to solve PVM problems more conveniently. In detail, inspired by Chebyshev ball approach, a parametric linear program (PLP) based nonsmooth barrier function candidate is established for PVM, and then, sufficient conditions for it to be a nonsmooth CBF are proposed, based on which a quadratic program (QP) based safety filter with guaranteed feasibility is proposed to address PVM problems. Finally, a numerical simulation example is given to show the efficiency of the proposed safety filter.</description>

      <title>QOCO: A Quadratic Objective Conic Optimizer with Custom Solver Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Second-order cone programs (SOCPs) with quadratic objective functions are common in optimal control and other fields. Most SOCP solvers which use interior-point methods are designed for linear objectives and convert quadratic objectives into linear ones via slack variables and extra constraints, despite the computational advantages of handling quadratic objectives directly. In applications like model-predictive control and online trajectory optimization, these SOCPs have known sparsity structures and require rapid solutions. When solving these problems, most solvers use sparse linear algebra routines, which introduce computational overhead and hinder performance. In contrast, custom linear algebra routines can exploit the known sparsity structure of problem data and be significantly faster. This work makes two key contributions: (1) the development of QOCO, an open-source C-based solver for quadratic objective SOCPs, and (2) the introduction of QOCOGEN, an open-source custom solver generator for quadratic objective SOCPs, which generates a solver written in C that leverages custom linear algebra. Both implement a primal-dual interior-point method with Mehrotra's predictor-corrector. Our benchmarks show that QOCO is faster and more robust than many commonly used solvers, and solvers generated by QOCOGEN are significantly faster than QOCO and are free of dynamic memory allocation making them an attractive option for real-time optimization on resource-constrained embedded systems.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for Weighted Sample Average Approximation in Contextual Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contextual stochastic optimization provides a framework for decision-making under uncertainty incorporating observable contextual information through covariates. We analyze statistical inference for weighted sample average approximation (wSAA), a widely-used method for solving contextual stochastic optimization problems. We first establish central limit theorems for wSAA estimates of optimal values when problems can be solved exactly, characterizing how estimation uncertainty scales with covariate sample size. We then investigate practical scenarios with computational budget constraints, revealing a fundamental tradeoff between statistical accuracy and computational cost as sample sizes increase. Through central limit theorems for budget-constrained wSAA estimates, we precisely characterize this statistical-computational tradeoff. We also develop "over-optimizing" strategies for solving wSAA problems that ensure valid statistical inference. Extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>On the optimal control of viscous Cahn-Hilliard systems with hyperbolic relaxation of the chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an optimal control problem for a viscous Cahn--Hilliard system with zero Neumann boundary conditions in which a hyperbolic relaxation term involving the second time derivative of the chemical potential has been added to the first equation of the system. For the initial-boundary value problem of this system, results concerning well-posedness, continuous dependence and regularity are known. We show Fr\'echet differentiability of the associated control-to-state operator, study the associated adjoint state system, and derive first-order necessary optimality conditions. Concerning the nonlinearities driving the system, we can include the case of logarithmic potentials. In addition, we perform an asymptotic analysis of the optimal control problem as the relaxation coefficient approaches zero.</description>

      <title>Learning Soft Constrained MPC Value Functions: Efficient MPC Design and Implementation providing Stability and Safety Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07780v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) can be applied to safety-critical control problems, providing closed-loop safety and performance guarantees. Implementation of MPC controllers requires solving an optimization problem at every sampling instant, which is challenging to execute on embedded hardware. To address this challenge, we propose a framework that combines a tightened soft constrained MPC formulation with supervised learning to approximate the MPC value function. This combination enables us to obtain a corresponding optimal control law, which can be implemented efficiently on embedded platforms. The framework ensures stability and constraint satisfaction for various nonlinear systems. While the design effort is similar to that of nominal MPC, the proposed formulation provides input-to-state stability (ISS) with respect to the approximation error of the value function. Furthermore, we prove that the value function corresponding to the soft constrained MPC problem is Lipschitz continuous for Lipschitz continuous systems, even if the optimal control law may be discontinuous. This serves two purposes: First, it allows to relate approximation errors to a sufficiently large constraint tightening to obtain constraint satisfaction guarantees. Second, it paves the way for an efficient supervised learning procedure to obtain a continuous value function approximation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method using a nonlinear numerical example.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian control to desynchronize Kuramoto oscillators with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronization is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature. Although it is necessary for the functioning of many systems, too much synchronization can also be detrimental, e.g., (partially) synchronized brain patterns support high-level cognitive processes and bodily control, but hypersynchronization can lead to epileptic seizures and tremors, as in neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease.
  Consequently, a critical research question is how to develop effective pinning control methods capable to reduce or modulate synchronization as needed.
  Although such methods exist to control pairwise-coupled oscillators, there are none for higher-order interactions, despite the increasing evidence of their relevant role in brain dynamics.
  In this work, we fill this gap by proposing a generalized control method designed to desynchronize Kuramoto oscillators connected through higher-order interactions. Our method embeds a higher-order Kuramoto model into a suitable Hamiltonian flow, and builds up on previous work in Hamiltonian control theory to analytically construct a feedback control mechanism.
  We numerically show that the proposed method effectively prevents synchronization in synthetics and empirical higher-order networks. Although our findings indicate that pairwise contributions in the feedback loop are often sufficient, the higher-order generalization becomes crucial when pairwise coupling is weak. Finally, we explore the minimum number of controlled nodes required to fully desynchronize oscillators coupled via an all-to-all hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Multi-level Magic State Factories for Fault-Tolerant Quantum Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel technique for optimizing a modular fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture, taking into account any desired space-time trade-offs between the number of physical qubits and the fault-tolerant execution time of a quantum algorithm. We consider a concept architecture comprising a dedicated zone as a multi-level magic state factory and a core processor for efficient logical operations, forming a supply chain network for production and consumption of magic states. Using a heuristic algorithm, we solve the multi-objective optimization problem of minimizing space and time subject to a user-defined error budget for the success of the computation, taking the performance of various fault-tolerant protocols into account. As an application, we show that physical quantum resource estimation reduces to a simple model involving a small number of key parameters, namely, the circuit volume, the error prefactors ($\mu$) and error suppression rates ($\Lambda$) of the fault-tolerant protocols, the reaction time ($\gamma$), and an allowed slowdown factor ($\beta$).</description>

      <title>Control, Optimal Transport and Neural Differential Equations in Supervised Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From the perspective of control theory, neural differential equations (neural ODEs) have become an important tool for supervised learning. In the fundamental work of Ruiz-Balet and Zuazua (SIAM REVIEW 2023), the authors pose an open problem regarding the connection between control theory, optimal transport theory, and neural differential equations. More precisely, they inquire how one can quantify the closeness of the optimal flows in neural transport equations to the true dynamic optimal transport. In this work, we propose a construction of neural differential equations that converge to the true dynamic optimal transport in the limit, providing a significant step in solving the formerly mentioned open problem.</description>
