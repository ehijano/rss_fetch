      <title>Hodge theory of secant varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local cohomology modules for the secant variety of lines of a smooth projective variety $Y$ and for higher secant varieties of smooth projective curves. We show that the local cohomological defect in the first case is related to the primitive cohomology of $Y$, and in the second case it is $0$.
  As applications, we compute their (intersection) Hodge-Lyubeznik numbers, the mixed Hodge structure on their singular cohomology, the pure Hodge structure on their intersection cohomology, the generating level of the Hodge filtration on their local cohomology modules and their $\mathbf Q$-factoriality defect. As byproducts, we recover and refine various results from the literature by removing restrictive positivity assumptions.</description>

      <title>On Pseudo-Effectivity and Volumes of Adjoint Classes in K\"ahler Families with Projective Central Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying the deformation behavior of pseudo-effective canonical divisors and volumes of adjoint classes in K\"ahler families. Based on recent developments in the K\"ahler minimal model program, for flat families with fiberwise canonical singularities, we establish the global stability of the pseudo-effectivity of canonical divisors, assuming in addition that one fiber is projective, while the same conclusion for K\"ahler threefolds is also true without the projectivity assumption of the central fiber. For smooth K\"ahler families whose central fiber is projective with a big adjoint class, we show that its volume remains locally constant. Finally, using the (relative) minimal model program for K\"ahler threefolds, we verify the deformation invariance of volumes of adjoint classes and plurigenera for smooth families of K\"ahler threefolds, thereby confirming Siu's invariance of plurigenera conjecture in dimension three.</description>

      <title>Mirror symmetry for lattice-polarized abelian surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Dolgachev's mirror symmetry for lattice-polarized K3 surfaces, we study its analogue for abelian surfaces. In this paper, we introduce lattice-polarized abelian surfaces and construct their coarse moduli spaces. We then construct stringy K\"ahler moduli spaces for abelian surfaces and show that these two spaces are naturally identified for mirror pairs. We also introduce a natural involution on stringy K\"ahler moduli spaces which, under mirror symmetry, pairs abelian surfaces and their duals. Finally, we determine conditions for the existence of mirror partners and classify self-mirror abelian surfaces via their N\'eron-Severi lattices.</description>

      <title>Nef Cones of the Hilbert Schemes of Points on Generalized Cayley K3 Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nef cones and fundamental domains of Hilbert schemes of points on the Cayley K3 surface $S$ and its generalizations $S_a$. For the Hilbert square $S^{[2]}$, we explicitly compute the nef cone and describe a fundamental domain using the automorphisms of $S^{[2]}$ and lattice-theoretic methods. For higher Hilbert schemes $S_a^{[n]}$, we determine the nef cones using Bridgeland stability methods that identify the contracted curves defining walls and the divisors generating the extremal rays.</description>

      <title>Exact Volumes of Semi-Algebraic Convex Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the volumes of convex bodies that are given by inequalities of concave polynomials. These volumes are found to arbitrary precision thanks to the representation of periods by linear differential equations. Our approach rests on work of Lairez, Mezzarobba, and Safey El Din. We present a novel method to identify the relevant critical values. Convexity allows us to reduce the required number of creative telescoping steps by an exponential factor. We provide an implementation based on the ore_algebra package in SageMath. This is applied to a problem in geometric statistics, where the convex body is an intersection of $\ell_p$-balls.</description>

      <title>The Riemann Hypothesis: Past, Present and a Letter Through Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper, commissioned as a survey of the Riemann Hypothesis, provides a comprehensive overview of 165 years of mathematical approaches to this fundamental problem, while introducing a new perspective that emerged during its preparation. The paper begins with a detailed description of what we know about the Riemann zeta function and its zeros, followed by an extensive survey of mathematical theories developed in pursuit of RH -- from classical analytic approaches to modern geometric and physical methods. We also discuss several equivalent formulations of the hypothesis. Within this survey framework, we present an original contribution in the form of a "Letter to Riemann," using only mathematics available in his time. This letter reveals a method inspired by Riemann's own approach to the conformal mapping theorem: by extremizing a quadratic form (restriction of Weil's quadratic form in modern language), we obtain remarkable approximations to the zeros of zeta. Using only primes less than 13, this optimization procedure yields approximations to the first 50 zeros with accuracies ranging from $2.6 \times 10^{-55}$ to $10^{-3}$. Moreover we prove a general result that these approximating values lie exactly on the critical line. Following the letter, we explain the underlying mathematics in modern terms, including the description of a deep connection of the Weil quadratic form with the world of information theory. The final sections develop a geometric perspective using trace formulas, outlining a potential proof strategy based on establishing convergence of zeros from finite to infinite Euler products. While completing the commissioned survey, these new results suggest a promising direction for future research on Riemann's conjecture.</description>

      <title>The uniform asymptotics for real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification II: lower bounds and asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the second of two papers on the uniform asymptotics for real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification. Using the modified tropical correspondence theorem established in the first paper of this series, we introduce a combinatorial invariant that serves as a lower bound for real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification. We derive a uniform lower bound for the large-degree and large-genus logarithmic asymptotics of these combinatorial invariants. This uniform lower bound yields the following results: (1) We establish a uniform lower bound for the large-degree and large-genus logarithmic asymptotics of real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification and their complex analogues. In particular, we provide a partial answer to an open question proposed by Dubrovin, Yang and Zagier on the uniform bound for simple Hurwitz numbers. (2) We prove logarithmic equivalence between real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification and their complex analogues as the degree tends to infinity and only simple branch points are added. (3) As the genus tends to infinity and only simple branch points are added, we show that the logarithms of real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification and their complex analogues are of the same order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a resurgence analysis of the perturbative partition functions of orientifolded conifolds and obtain the full nonperturbative partition functions in terms of multiple sine functions. We derive the unoriented Donaldson--Thomas invariants from the analysis of associated Stokes jumps. We further discuss the Riemann--Hilbert problems defined by the Donaldson--Thomas invariants arising from orientifolded conifolds and the corresponding $\tau$-functions.</description>

      <title>Dyck Paths, Configuration Spaces and Polytopes For Linear Nakayama algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a combinatorial model of configuration spaces and polytopes associated to the quotients of $\mathbb{C} A_n$, the path algebra of the linearly oriented $A_n$ quiver, i.e. the algebra of upper triangular matrices. These quotient algebras are known as linear Nakayama algebras. Such configuration spaces were recently introduced for more general algebras by the second author and collaborators. In this special setting, we provide elementary proofs and explicit combinatorial constructions. From a Dyck path we define three related objects: a finite-dimensional algebra, an affine algebraic variety, and a polytope. Moreover, our constructions are natural: each relation in the poset of Dyck paths gives a morphism between the corresponding objects.</description>

      <title>Translating auxiliary symmetries between Schottky uniformization and Jacobi parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The explicit description and computation of functions defined on Riemann surfaces of various genera depends on the choice of language: while the Jacobi parametrization is widely known and used, the Schottky uniformization has been proven to provide an alternative approach, useful in particular for (but not limited to) numerical calculations. Despite capturing the geometry of the Riemann surface completely, the two languages are subject to rather different sets of auxiliary symmetries. In this article we translate and compare the symplectic transformations inherent in the Jacobi parametrization to the freedom in choosing M\"obius transformations generating the Schottky group for the Schottky uniformization. Our results are aimed at transferring functional relations expressed in the Schottky language to the Jacobi language and vice versa. An immediate application would be the efficient numerical evaluation of special functions in a physics context by favorably tuning the Schottky cover leading to quicker convergence.</description>

      <title>Geometric realization of $W$-operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Certain integrable hierarchies appearing in random matrix theory, enumerative geometry, and conformal field theory are governed by Virasoro/$W$-algebra constraints and their $W$-representations.Motivated by the Gaussian Hermitian $\beta$-ensemble and recent studies of superintegrable partition function hierarchies, we build an explicit bridge from symmetric group class algebras to bosonic Fock spaces and further to geometry.
  On the algebraic side, we decompose the transposition class sum into cut and join channels and recover the classical cut-and-join operator on the ring of symmetric functions. On the geometric side, we use the Grojnowski-Nakajima Fock space identification to realize the ladder operator $E_1=[W_0,p_1]$ as the Hecke correspondence on $\mathrm{Hilb}_n(\mathbb C^2)$, and we interpret the cubic generator $W_0$ as a normal ordered triple incidence correspondence. We then explain how the $\beta$-deformed cubic generator $W_0^{(\beta)}$ arises from the Ward identities/Virasoro constraints of the Gaussian $\beta$-ensemble via a background charge parametrization, clarifying its conformal field theoretic meaning. Finally, using the Grojnowski-Nakajima Heisenberg-Fock isomorphism $\Phi_{\mathrm{Hilb}}:\Lambda\xrightarrow{\sim}\bigoplus_{n\ge0}H_T^*(\Hilb^n(\mathbb C^2))$, we transport the resulting commutator hierarchy to Hilbert schemes, where $E_1$ is realised by the Hecke correspondence (adding one point) and the diagonal correction terms are computed by equivariant localization from the $T$-weights of the tangent bundle $T\Hilb^n(\mathbb C^2)$ and the tautological bundle $\mathcal V$. This provides a geometric realization framework that unifies $\beta$-deformed integrable structures and offers new tools for studying quiver gauge theory partition functions.</description>

      <title>Homological Mirror Symmetry for orbifold log Calabi-Yau surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct mirror abstract Lefschetz fibrations associated to a class of surfaces with cyclic quotient singularities which we call effective. These surfaces can be obtained by contracting disjoint chains of smooth rational curves inside the anticanonical cycle $D$ of a smooth log Calabi-Yau surface $(Y,D)$ with maximal boundary and considering the result as an orbifold. The Fukaya-Seidel categories of these abstract Lefschetz fibrations admit semiorthogonal decompositions akin to the ones described via the derived special McKay correspondence of Ishii and Ueda arXiv:1104.2381v2 [math.AG]. We apply this construction to establish an equivalence at the large volume limit between the derived category of an effective orbifold log Calabi-Yau surface with points of type $\frac{1}{k}(1,1)$ and the Fukaya-Seidel category of its mirror Lefschetz fibration. We also compare the abstract construction to an explicit Landau-Ginzburg model defined by a Laurent polynomial associated to a toric degeneration in the case of the family of hypersurfaces $X_{k+1}\subset \mathbb{P}(1,1,1,k)$. The hypersurfaces $X_{k+1}$ admit a non-trivial moduli of complex structures, which we compare with an open subset of the space of symplectic structures on the total space of the mirror Landau-Ginzburg model via a mirror map built out of intrinsic quantities in a non-exact Fukaya-Seidel category.</description>

      <title>The uniform asymptotics for real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification I: the tropical correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03671v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the first of two papers on the uniform asymptotics for real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification. Real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification count the number of real ramified coverings of the complex projective line $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^1$ by real Riemann surfaces of genus $g$, where the ramification profiles over $0$ and $\infty$ are $\lambda$ and $\mu$ respectively, and the ramification profiles over the remaining real branch points consist of either $(3,1,\ldots,1)$ or $(2,1,\ldots,1)$.
  We apply a modified version of the tropical computation framework developed by Markwig and Rau for real Hurwitz numbers (Math. Z. 281 (2015), no. 1-2, 501-522) to compute the real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification. The new ingredient in our computation is the application of real simple resolution, a technique that enables us to resolve a triple branch point into a pair of simple branch points. Using real simple resolution, we establish a correspondence between real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification and weighted counts of tropical covers. This modified tropical correspondence simplifies the asymptotic analysis of real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the computational approach to the results established by Okuyama and Saito \cite{log19}. Although their results are often difficult to compute, we prove that, when the negative support of a fake exponent $\bm{v}$ with respect to a generic weight $\bm{w}$ is included in a certain set, solutions can be computed using only the reduced Gr\"{o}bner basis, and we can construct all $A$-hypergeometric series with exponent $\bm{v}$ in the direction $\bm{w}$ by Frobenius's method. As an example, we describe the Aomoto-Gel'fand system of type $3 \times 3$ in details.</description>

      <title>An obstruction to smoothing stable maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe an obstruction to smoothing stable maps in smooth projective varieties, which generalizes some previously known obstructions. Our obstruction comes from the non-existence of certain rational functions on the ghost components, with prescribed simple poles and residues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1989, Faltings proved the comparison theorem between \'etale cohomology and crystalline cohomology by studying Fontaine-Faltings modules and crystalline representations. In his paper, he mentioned these modules and representations can be extended to the logarithmic context, but without detail. This note aims to explicitly present the construction of logarithmic Fontaine-Faltings modules and logarithmic crystalline representations.</description>

Abstract: We describe a differential graded Lie algebra controlling infinitesimal deformations of triples $(X,\mathcal{F},\sigma)$, where $\mathcal{F}$ is a coherent sheaf on a smooth variety $X$ over a field of characteristic 0 and $\sigma\in H^0(X,\mathcal{F})$.

      <title>Rank Two Sheaves With Low Discriminant on the Fano Threefold of Index 2 and Degree 5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe rank 2 Gieseker semistable sheaves $E$ on the Fano threefold $X_5$ of index 2 and degree 5 with maximal third Chern class $c_3(E)$ for all possible low values of discriminant $\overline{\Delta}_H(E)\le 40$. The work uses the theory of tilt-stability and Bridgeland stability conditions on smooth projective threefolds. We also make a conjecture about the rank 2 sheaves on $X_5$ with maximal $c_3$ and discriminant big enough.</description>

Abstract: We study the universal PGL_n$character variety over M_g whose fiber over a point [C] is the space of PGL_n-local systems on the curve C. We use nonabelian Hodge theory and properties of Saito's mixed Hodge modules to show that the Leray-Serre spectral sequence for the projection to M_g degenerates at E_2. As an application, we prove that the rational cohomology of these varieties stabilizes as g goes to infinity and compute the stable limit. We also deduce similar results for the universal G-character variety over M_{g,1} whose fiber over a punctured curve is the variety of G-local systems with fixed central monodromy around the puncture, for G = GL_n or SL_n.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00752v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we solve an open question formulated in the original paper of twisted skew group codes regarding when a twisted skew group code is checkable. Also, we prove that all ideals of dimension 3 over a twisted group algebra are abelian group codes, generalising another previous result over group algebras. Finally, we prove a bound on the dimension and distance of a twisted group code, as well as when such bound is reached.</description>

      <title>Rational Homotopy Type of Complements of Submanifold Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we provide an explicit cdga that controls the rational homotopy type of the complement $X-\cup_i Z_i$, where $X$ is a smooth compact algebraic variety and $\{Z_i\}$ is a collection of subvarieties such that all set-theoretical intersections are smooth. The model is given in terms of the cohomology of all intersections of $Z_i$'s, and the natural maps induced by the inclusions. Our construction is inspired by the work of J.Morgan, who covered the fundamental case where $\{Z_i\}$ is a divisor with normal crossings, and it is built on developments of the theory of mixed Hodge diagrams by Cirici-Horel. We avoid any explicit reduction to the normal crossings divisor case, e.g. via the wonderful compactification of De Concini-Procesi. As an application of our approach we recover and generalize a few separate results on the complements of arrangements in a uniform manner. These include the Kritz-Totaro model for graph configuration spaces, Yuzvinsky's model for affine subspace arrangements and Dupont's model for complements of hypersurfaces with hyperplane-like intersection.</description>

      <title>The virtual Euler characteristic for binary matroids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Kontsevich's graphic orbifold Euler characteristic we define a virtual Euler characteristic for any finite set of isomorphism classes of matroids of rank $r$. Our main result provides a simple formula for the virtual Euler characteristic for the set of isomorphism classes of matroids of rank $r$ realizable over $\mathbb{F}_2$ (i.e., binary matroids). We prove this formula by relating the virtual Euler characteristic for binary matroids to the point counts of certain subsets of Grassmanians over finite fields. We conclude by providing several follow-up questions in relation to matroids realizable over other finite prime fields, matroid homology, and beta invariants.</description>

      <title>The universal structure of moment maps in complex geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a geometric approach to the construction of moment maps in finite and infinite-dimensional complex geometry. We apply this to two settings: K\"ahler manifolds and holomorphic vector bundles. Our new approach exploits the existence of universal families and the theory of equivariant differential forms.
  For K\"ahler manifolds we give a new, geometric proof of Donaldson-Fujiki's moment map interpretation of the scalar curvature. Associated to arbitrary products of Chern classes of the manifold - namely to a central charge - we further introduce a geometric PDE determining a $Z$-critical K\"ahler metric, and show that these general equations also satisfy moment map properties. For holomorphic vector bundles, using a similar strategy we give a geometric proof of Atiyah-Bott's moment map interpretation of the Hermitian Yang-Mills condition. We then go on to give a new, geometric proof that the PDE determining a $Z$-critical connection - again associated to a choice of central charge - can be viewed as a moment map; deformed Hermitian Yang-Mills connections are a special case, in which our work gives a geometric proof of a result of Collins-Yau.
  Our main assertion is that this is the canonical way of producing moment maps in complex geometry - associated to any geometric problem along with a choice of stability condition - and hence that this accomplishes one of the main steps towards producing PDE counterparts to stability conditions in large generality.</description>

      <title>Two-chart Beltrami Optimization for Distortion-Controlled Spherical Bijection with Application to Brain Surface Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many genus-0 surface mapping tasks such as landmark alignment, feature matching, and image-driven registration, can be reduced (via an initial spherical conformal map) to optimizing a spherical self-homeomorphism with controlled distortion. However, existing works lack efficient mechanisms to control the geometric distortion of the resulting mapping. To resolve this issue, we formulate this as a Beltrami-space optimization problem, where the angle distortion is encoded explicitly by the Beltrami differential and bijectivity can be enforced through the constraint $\|\mu\|_{\infty}&lt;1$. To make this practical on the sphere, we introduce the Spherical Beltrami Differential (SBD), a two-chart representation of quasiconformal self-maps of the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$, together with cross-chart consistency conditions that yield a globally bijective spherical deformation (up to conformal automorphisms). Building on the Spectral Beltrami Network, we develop BOOST, a differentiable optimization framework that updates two Beltrami fields to minimize task-driven losses while regularizing distortion and enforcing consistency along the seam. Experiments on large-deformation landmark matching and intensity-based spherical registration demonstrate improved task performance meanwhile maintaining controlled distortion and robust bijective behavior. We also apply the method to cortical surface registration by aligning sulcal landmarks and matching cortical sulcal depth, achieving comparative or better registration performance without sacrificing geometric validity.</description>
