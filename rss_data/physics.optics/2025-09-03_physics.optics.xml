      <title>SU(2) symmetry of spatiotemporal Gaussian modes propagating in the isotropic dispersive media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The far-field intensity distribution of spatiotemporal Laguerre-Gaussian (STLG) modes propagating in free space exhibits a multi-petal pattern analogous to that observed in tilted Hermite-Gaussian modes. Here, we show that this phenomenon can be explained by the SU(2) symmetry of spatiotemporal Gaussian modes, which can support the irreducible representation of SU(2) group and enable the construction of the spatiotemporal model Poincar\'e sphere. We have also derived analytical expressions for the STLG mode with an arbitrary radial and angular indices propagating in the isotropic media. The propagation dynamics can be understood as a unitary transformation generated by a conserved quantity, where the rotation angle is exactly the intermodal Gouy phase of the spatiotemporal modes in the same order subspace. This spatiotemporal Gouy phase depends on the ellipticity of the wave packets and the group velocity dispersion (GVD) of the media. The phase, as a function of propagation distance, is categorized into three distinct regimes: normal dispersion, anomalous dispersion, and zero dispersion. Interestingly, in the regime of anomalous dispersion, the non-monotonic behavior induces to both distortion and revival of the intensity distribution, thereby establishing a phase-locked mechanism that is analogous to the Talbot effect.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Chiral Optics with Ordered Carbon Nanotube Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral optical terahertz (THz) devices have significant technological implications for telecommunications, spectroscopy, and sensing. Engineering tunable, broadband, and cost-effective THz chiral materials has long been recognized as a challenging endeavor and has been the bottleneck hindering the full exploitation of the THz spectrum. Here, we present an artificial structure based on aligned carbon nanotube films that exhibit a tunable broadband circular dichroism (CD) up to 2.8 degrees. Its behavior is reciprocal. The developed theoretical simulations are in agreement with the experiments and predict a further increase of CD signal up to ~30 degrees when more CNT layers are added.</description>

      <title>All-optical classification of real biomedical cell images using a diffractive neural network: a simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an in-silico demonstration of an all-optical cell classification system using a single-layer diffractive neural network (DNN) optimized for real-world biomedical images. Implemented virtually with a spatial light modulator (SLM), the DNN was numerically trained via backpropagation to differentiate breast and lung cancer cells. The training utilized experimentally acquired phase and amplitude images from optofluidic time-stretch quantitative phase imaging. Classification was simulated by computing the optical intensities at the detection plane. The optimized DNN achieved 93.6% accuracy, approaching that of conventional convolutional neural networks. This study highlights the potential of SLM-based DNNs for ultrafast, energy-efficient biomedical image processing in practical optical computing scenarios.</description>

      <title>On-chip amplification-free fCEO detection and broadband SCG in parabolically width-modulated TFLN waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate amplification-free carrier-envelope offset (fCEO) detection in parabolically width-modulated z-cut thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) waveguide that simultaneously engineers dispersion and enhances nonlinear interactions. With 116 fs pulses at 1560 nm, the device generates more than two octaves broadband SCG spanning 600 to beyond 2400 nm, enabling spectral overlap between dispersive waves and second-harmonic generation near 780 nm for robust f-2f self-referencing. Most notably, we achieve the first fully amplification-free, on-chip fCEO detection without optical or electronic amplifiers, obtaining 34 dB SNR at 100 kHz RBW and 57 dB at 100 Hz RBW, the highest reported to date under such conditions. These results establish a new benchmark for scalable, power-efficient, self-referenced frequency combs and quantum-enabled photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation by a spatiotemporally modulated nonreciprocal metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation, which dictates that the emissivity of a surface equals its absorptivity under thermal equilibrium, which dictates that the emissivity of a surface equals its absorptivity under thermal equilibrium, fundamentally limits the efficiency of photonic systems by enforcing reciprocal energy exchange between source and detector. Breaking this reciprocity is particularly important for advancing photonic devices for energy conversion, radiative cooling, and mid-infrared sensing and imaging. Driven by the growing need for photonic platforms to overcome reciprocity constraints, we present the first demonstration of spatiotemporally modulated nonreciprocal metasurfaces operating at mid-infrared frequencies suitable for the violation of the Kirchhoff's law at room temperature. We fabricate a graphene-based integrated photonic structure and experimentally demonstrate nonreciprocal reflection from a metasurface modulated at gigahertz frequencies. We develop a theoretical framework to relate nonreciprocal scattering under spatiotemporal modulation with unequal absorptivity and emissivity for violation of the spectral directional Kirchhoff's law. Our experiment and theory imply effective decoupling of absorption and emission channels by breaking time-reversal symmetry at thermal wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Space Tomography for Electromagnetic Biomaterial Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present a concise, first principles metrological framework for imaging dielectric biomaterials by probing the full phase space (Wigner) distribution of a quantum electromagnetic field. Building on a rigorous multilayer Maxwell and Cole Cole model for stratified tissue, my method (Quantum Phase space Tomography, QPST) couples analytical forward theory with quantum metrology and Bayesian inference. I prepare a structured quantum EM probe (e.g. a squeezed microwave pulse) that interacts with tissue and then perform full quantum state tomography of the outgoing field. The recovered Wigner quasi probability reveals subwavelength and non classical features lost in classical imaging. By projecting the measurement onto the analytically derived tissue response manifold, I recover key physiological parameters (e.g. layer thickness, dispersion). I further define a Dielectric Anaplasia Metric (DAM) that quantifies tissue microstructural heterogeneity (e.g. malignancy) via deviations in Cole Cole parameters. My design leverages state of the art quantum sensors (e.g. NV diamond magnetometers) and advanced inverse algorithms (physics informed neural networks, diffusion priors). Numerical examples demonstrate that QPST can non invasively map tissue permittivity with unprecedented sensitivity. This work bridges fundamental electromagnetic theory and emerging quantum technologies, promising a new paradigm for medical imaging.</description>

Abstract: A detailed investigation is presented of a simple unidirectional finite-energy solution of the 3D wave equation. Its asymptotics as a spatial point runs to infinity with the wave propagations speed is a standard spherical wave as z &lt; 0, where z is a Cartesian coordinate, and has an additional factor logarithmic with respect to the distance as z &gt; 0.

      <title>Multimodal near-infrared spectroscopy for biosensing applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The near infrared (NIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum contains valuable information about vibrational overtone and combination modes. Additionally, fluorophores that emit in the NIR are desired because this spectral range falls into the tissue transparency window. However, NIR techniques are not as widespread as their counterparts in the visible range because detectors, microscopes and fluorophores are less available. Here, we present a NIR multimodal and low footprint spectroscopy (NIR-MMS) setup. The setup excites NIR fluorescence using a LED or uses broadband NIR light to capture absorption spectra in the range from 900 nm to 1650 nm with a fiber-coupled InGaAs spectrograph. We demonstrate the measurement of NIR fluorescent materials and biosensors for the neurotransmitter dopamine. Additionally, the setup allows to simultaneously measure absorption and emission spectra to assess chemical changes in NIR fluorescent carbon nanotubes. Overall, this small footprint setup provides simultaneous access to NIR fluorescence and absorption spectra with broad applications in biosensing.</description>

      <title>Band Geometry Induced Third-Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Third-harmonic generation (THG) is a key nonlinear optical process for ultrafast imaging, terahertz (THz) signal generation, and symmetry-sensitive probes, often dominating in centrosymmetric materials where lower-order responses vanish. Yet, the role of band geometry, Fermi surface effects, and disorder in enabling large and tunable THG remains poorly understood. Here, we develop a finite-frequency quantum kinetic theory of THG based on the density matrix formalism, deriving the third-harmonic conductivity tensor. Our framework isolates five distinct band-geometric contributions to interband and intraband processes, separates Fermi sea from Fermi surface terms, and incorporates disorder effects phenomenologically. We further provide a complete symmetry classification of THG for all 122 magnetic point groups. Applying the theory to the spin-split altermagnet RuO$_2$, we trace its THG response to specific geometric terms. These results establish a predictive foundation for designing materials with enhanced and tunable THG in the finite-frequency regime.</description>

      <title>Non-Foster Photonic Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic time crystals (PhTCs) are spatially uniform media whose material parameters vary periodically in time, opening momentum bandgaps within which the fields of electromagnetic modes can grow exponentially in time. To date, PhTCs have utilized only passive, lossless materials with "positive" dispersion (Foster materials), and a theoretical framework addressing active materials with "negative" dispersion (non-Foster materials) in PhTCs and their associated physical properties remains undeveloped. Here, we explore the two classes of isotropic PhTCs with embedded non-Foster inclusions: a bulk medium with periodically modulated negative permittivity, and a metasurface whose surface capacitance alternates between positive and negative values. Employing an analytical transfer-matrix formulation, we demonstrate that non-Foster permittivity modulation not only broadens momentum bandgaps without bounds but also provides a gain rate that increases linearly with momentum. Remarkably, the proposed isotropic PhTCs support exponential amplification down to zero frequency-a regime inaccessible in conventional isotropic PhTCs. These results open new avenues for ultra-broadband wave control, high-gain signal processing, and energy-harvesting devices that leverage the unique dispersion of active, time-modulated circuitry.</description>

      <title>Effective gain spectra vary the pulses spectrum in a mode-locked cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filters typically play a crucial role in generating solitons by strictly confirming the working wavelength in a mode-locked laser. However, we have found that the broad smoothing filter with saturable gain also helps to regulate the pulses' operating wavelength. The effective gain, formed by the original gain spectrum and filters, shifts its center based on pulse energy, thereby affecting the pulse spectrum. A virtual mode-locked cavity is established to verify this approach in simulation. The results indicate that the spectrum changes with pulse energy, leading to a wider spectrum output. Our method paves the way for further investigations of the pulse spectrum and provides a practical approach to generating pulses at specific wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Transition from exceptional points to observable nonlinear bifurcation points in anti-PT symmetric coupled cavity systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) in anti-parity-time (APT)-symmetric systems have attracted significant interest. While linear APT-symmetric systems exhibit structural similarities with nonlinear dissipative systems, such as mutually injection-locked lasers, the correspondence between exceptional points in linear non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear lasing dynamics has remained unclear. We demonstrated that, in a two-cavity system with APT symmetry and gain saturation nonlinearity, an EP coincides with a bifurcation point of nonlinear equilibrium states, which appears exactly at the lasing threshold. Although the EP and the bifurcation point originate from fundamentally different physical concepts, the bifurcation point is observable and retains key EP characteristics even above the lasing threshold. Notably, the bifurcation point that originates from the linear EP also bridges linear and nonlinear dynamics of the system: it serves as an accessible transition point in the nonlinear dynamics between the limit-cycle and synchronization regimes. Furthermore, we clarified that beat oscillation that conserves the energy difference, which is a unique dynamic in the weak-coupling regime of a linear APT system, evolves into a nonlinear limit cycle with equal amplitudes in the two cavities in the presence of gain saturation. Our findings establish a direct link between EP-induced bifurcation points and nonlinear dynamics, providing fundamental insights into non-Hermitian and nonlinear optical systems.</description>

      <title>Calibration-sample free distortion correction of electron diffraction patterns using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accuracy of the information that can be extracted from electron diffraction patterns is often limited by the presence of optical distortions. Existing distortion characterization techniques typically require knowledge of the reciprocal lattice of either the sample of interest or a separate calibration sample, the latter of which would need to be swapped in, thus adding time and inconvenience to an experiment. To overcome this limitation, we develop a deep learning (DL) framework for measuring and correcting combinations of different types of optical distortion in CBED patterns. Quantitative performance tests of our DL model are conducted using testing datasets of artificial distorted CBED patterns of molybdenum disulfide on amorphous carbon, with varying sizes of CBED disks, that are generated using multislice simulations. The performance test results of our DL approach are benchmarked against those obtained using a conventional distortion estimation technique that uses the radial gradient maximization (RGM) technique and knowledge of the reciprocal lattice system. While the RGM approach outperforms our DL approach for the CBED patterns with very small disks, our DL approach outperforms the RGM approach for the CBED patterns with medium-sized disks, as well as those with large overlapping disks. The benchmarking results suggest that our DL approach, which does not require knowledge of the sample, achieves a good compromise between convenience and accuracy. We also show how our DL framework can be used to improve experimental ptychographic reconstructions, and to correct optical distortion in experimental selected area electron diffraction patterns.</description>

      <title>Repetition-Rate-Difference Tunable Dual-Comb Fiber Laser Using Bidirectional Lyot filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single cavity dual-comb fiber lasers adopting different multiplexing configurations are benefited from the natures of common-mode noise suppression and superior coherence. Particularly, repetition-rate tunable dual-combs enable non-ambiguous ranging and aliasing-free spectroscopy. However, their sampling rate and spectral resolution is severely restricted by the mechanical delay lines. In a previous work, as rapid as 500 kHz/s tuning rate was realized to address this issue, while the minimum comb frequency difference remained large under the inaccuracy of mechanical DLL. In this work, a dual-comb prototype incorporated with a thermally controlled bidirectional lyot filter is demonstrated with 870-times enhanced tuning precision compared with mechanical schemes. Linear correlation between temperature and repetition-rate-difference of this tuning mechanism is revealed. We achieve a tuning efficiency of 4.4 Hz/{\deg}C and a control accuracy of 0.44 Hz/K, denoting a significant advance in operating Hz-scale differential comb lines. This design offers an optimal playground for extending non-ambiguous distance in dead-zone-free dual-comb ranging and eliminating aliasing in spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-enhanced Hyperspectral Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging is gaining attention in the field of disease diagnosis due to its ability to enhance tissue contrast, surpassing the capabilities of conventional brightfield imaging techniques. Typically, histological sections lack sufficient intrinsic contrast in the visible spectrum, necessitating the use of dyes or stains for adequate visualization. However, a recent breakthrough involves the application of plasmonic meta-materials as substrates for histological sections, replacing staining or labelling on traditional microscope glass slides. These nanofabricated microscope slides, shortened to nanoMslides, operate by selectively transmitting colors based on refractive index variations within the sample when illuminated with white light. This study investigates the feasibility of integration of nanoMslides for hyperspectral imaging. By employing a tunable light source, specific plasmon resonances within the slides can be selectively excited. This precise control over plasmonic interactions results in significantly heightened sensitivity and specificity, showcasing the potential for advanced applications in disease diagnosis and biomedical research.</description>

      <title>Content-Aware Foveated Camera for Multi-Target Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern image sensors deliver substantial space-time bandwidth, yet indiscriminate acquisition often overwhelms memory, computation, and downstream perception. We present a content-aware, multi-foveated camera that dynamically reallocates sensing and magnification to multiple regions of interest (ROIs). A phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) serves as a solid-state, inertia-free beam-steering and lens element, enabling per-frame field-of-view (FOV) reconfiguration and content-aware target tracking. By interleaving frames across foveae, our system preserves a wide-FOV situational context while refreshing each ROI at high rates, thereby reducing data volume without degrading task performance. We constructed a prototype employing single-SLM, single-sensor architecture and demonstrated its application in real-time multi-object tracking with dynamic ROI maintenance across multiple viewpoints. The approach offers a general pathway to integrate detection, tracking, and segmentation algorithms in the acquisition loop, shifting workload from post hoc processing to intelligent capture.</description>

      <title>Inverse-Designed On-Chip Terahertz Three-Channel Mode and Wavelength Division Demultiplexer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-performance multimode/multiwavelength (de)multiplexer is one of the most pivotal photonic devices for advanced on-chip interconnect systems. Traditional on-chip photonic (de)multiplexing requires large device footprint for maintaining high efficiency, large operation bandwidth, and small insertion losses. Here a hybrid inverse design method is therefore proposed to combine genetic algorithms (GA) and topology optimization for developing an ultracompact (lateral size&lt; 2{\lambda}) terahertz (THz) mode-/wavelength-division demultiplexer (MDM-WDM). The method leverages the global search capability of GA in continuous parameter spaces and the local topology optimization strategy driven by the adjoint method, effectively improving design convergence efficiency and global performance robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that the device simultaneously achieves stable three-channel MDM and WDM with insertion loss (IL) of less than 3 dB and inter-channel crosstalk (CT) can be -22 dB. The output achieves spatial separation of the orthogonal TE10, TE20, and TE30 modes that correspond to three central wavelengths {\lambda}1~690 {\mu}m, {\lambda}2~700 {\mu}m, and {\lambda}3~710 {\mu}m, respectively, verifying the device's precise control over target modes and wavelengths. This work provides an efficient optimization approach for developing broadband, multichannel, and highly integrated THz multiplexing devices, offering new pathways for constructing next-generation integrated photonic interconnects and signal processing systems.</description>

      <title>Topological Control of Polaritonic Flatbands in Anisotropic van der Waals Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibit direction-dependent optical and electronic properties, making them valuable for tailoring directional light-matter interactions. Rhenium disulfide (ReS$_2$) stands out for its strong in-plane anisotropy and its thickness-independent direct-bandgap excitons, which can hybridize with light to form exciton-polaritons. In parallel, metasurfaces, engineered arrays of nanoscale subwavelength resonators, can support ultra-sharp photonic modes in the form of quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBICs). Topological transformations of photonic modes can give rise to flatbands, i.e., dispersionless states with quenched kinetic energy and vanishing group velocity. Intrinsic material anisotropy offers an unexplored route to robust far-field flatband formation and control. Here, we demonstrate how structuring an intrinsically anisotropic excitonic material into a resonant metasurface fundamentally transforms its photonic topological features and light-matter coupling behavior, allowing us to drive and topologically control extended far-field flatband formation. To this end, we fabricate C$_4$-symmetric metasurfaces directly from bulk ReS$_2$. The intrinsic anisotropy lifts the initial double degeneracy of the qBIC mode and yields two distinctly polarized resonances. It also reshapes the topological landscape: the integer topological charge of the qBIC mode splits into momentum-separated half-integer singularities, thereby flattening the far-field photonic dispersion. The resulting topologically-controlled photonic flatbands are then tuned in resonance with the linearly polarized excitonic transitions of ReS$_2$, resulting in two distinct, directionally hybridized exciton-polariton flatband regimes. These findings establish anisotropic vdW metasurfaces as a new platform for topologically engineered flatbands and flatband-driven light-matter coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced explosive growth in recent years. The large models have been widely applied in various fields, including natural language processing, image generation, and complex decision-making systems, revolutionizing technological paradigms across multiple industries. Nevertheless, the substantial data processing demands during model training and inference result in the computing power bottleneck. Traditional electronic chips based on the von Neumann architecture struggle to meet the growing demands for computing power and power efficiency amid the continuous development of AI. Photonic neuromorphic computing, an emerging solution in the post-Moore era, exhibits significant development potential. Leveraging the high-speed and large-bandwidth characteristics of photons in signal transmission, as well as the low-power consumption advantages of optical devices, photonic integrated computing chips have the potential to overcome the memory wall and power wall issues of electronic chips. In recent years, remarkable advancements have been made in photonic neuromorphic computing. This article presents a systematic review of the latest research achievements. It focuses on fundamental principles and novel neuromorphic photonic devices, such as photonic neurons and photonic synapses. Additionally, it comprehensively summarizes the network architectures and photonic integrated neuromorphic chips, as well as the optimization algorithms of photonic neural networks. In addition, combining with the current status and challenges of this field, this article conducts an in-depth discussion on the future development trends of photonic neuromorphic computing in the directions of device integration, algorithm collaborative optimization, and application scenario expansion, providing a reference for subsequent research in the field of photonic neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Probing Optical Vortex Beams via a Controllable Anisotropic Diffractive Phase Element</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the diffraction of optical vortex beams through a tunable elliptical Fresnel phase mask (TEFPM). The resulting diffraction patterns are influenced by both the topological charge of the beam and the ellipticity of the mask, exhibiting characteristic intensity distributions that allow direct determination of the magnitude and sign of the topological charge. Requiring only a single controllable parameter, the TEFPM offers a simple and adaptable approach for vortex charge characterization, with a reduced detection distance that supports optical system compactness. The experimental results are confirmed by the exact analytical solutions.</description>

      <title>Coherent perfect absorption and lasing in bimodal Fabry-P\'erot interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bimodal Fabry-P\'erot interferometer is a model generalizing the conventional Fabry-P\'erot interferometer, in which not one but two kinds of waves propagate between the interfaces. Here, we study coherent perfect absorption (CPA) and lasing at threshold in bimodal Fabry-P\'erot interferometers. We show that CPA and lasing appear only in certain "allowed" regions in the parameter space, which, as we demonstrate, are described by closed-form inequalities imposed on the elements of the scattering matrix of the interferometer interfaces. We demonstrate topologically governed annihilation of CPA points as they approach the boundary of a CPA-allowed region. In the particular case when the absorption losses tend to zero, the presented model describes the formation of bound states in the continuum exactly at the CPA annihilation points. The presented analytical model is in perfect agreement with the rigorous numerical simulation results of high-contrast gratings and ridge resonators implementing the bimodal Fabry-P\'erot interferometer model.</description>

      <title>A matter of perspective: how nanoscale optical defects limit cosmic-scale gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, have revolutionised as- tronomy. Now, future detectors like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer aim to achieve even greater sensitivity. Advanced optical simulations are crucial to overcoming the challenges faced by these complex in- terferometers. Finesse, the leading interferometer simulation tool in the GW community, supports the design and commissioning of these detectors by modeling optical, quantum, and mechanical effects. A key focus is understanding optical defects that distort the shape of the laser light and limit detector performance. This work explores how nanoscale defects affect GW observations and presents recent advancements in modeling their effects to guide the development of next-generation detector optics.</description>

      <title>Complete suppression of the non-dipole drift effect in high harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high harmonic generation (HHG), non-dipole effects become increasingly significant at long driving wavelengths, as the magnetic field leads to a lateral drift of the continuum electron, which disrupts the electron recollision and inhibits the harmonic emission. To address this problem, we revisit the dynamics of the continuum electrons under electromagnetic fields in the HHG process and show that the magnetic effect on the drift includes a fundamental-frequency and a double-frequency component. By adding an additional field to counteract the double-frequency effect caused by the magnetic field, we construct an effective linearly polarized field that recovers the recollision of all returning electrons to the parent ion. Consequently, the harmonic yield is restored and becomes the same as the result within the dipole approximation across the broad spectral range. This work provides a scheme that completely suppresses the non-dipole drift effect and fully compensates for the harmonic yield reduction, paving the way to efficiently generate coherent radiation in the range from extreme ultraviolet to soft x-ray and ultrashort pulses based on HHG.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-beam-induced luminescence typically relies on direct excitation by high energy primary electrons. Here, we explore properties of an alternative excitation approach where cathodoluminescence (CL) is driven by substrate-generated electrons rather than by the primary electron beam. Using color centers in diamond as sensitive and durable local probes, we investigate the spatial profiles of such indirect CL in different geometries and substrates. Photon-correlation experiments demonstrate increased synchronization of emitters at reduced currents, which we propose as a method for extracting the effective indirect excitation currents experienced by the emitters. This approach enables the estimation of remarkably low currents, down to 0.1 pA, highlighting the potential of substrate-assisted excitation for minimally invasive probing of sensitive emitters in CL microscopy.</description>

Abstract: Though interference from different emission channels enabled a deeper understanding of strong-field photoemission in atoms and molecules, it remained out of reach for solids. Here, we explore metal needle tips under single-cycle pulses via classical trajectories extended by quantum diffusion and interference and numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. We find interference of direct and backscattered electrons with fringe pattern encoding sub-cycle information on birth times and near-field driven acceleration dynamics, opening routes for ultrafast solid-state metrology.</description>

      <title>400-Gbps/$\lambda$ Ultrafast Silicon Microring Modulator for Scalable Optical Compute Interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential growth of artificial intelligence (AI) workloads is driving an urgent demand for optical interconnects with ultrahigh bandwidth, energy efficiency, and scalability. Silicon photonics, with its CMOS compatibility and wafer-scale manufacturability, has emerged as a promising platform for optical interconnect architectures. Silicon microring modulators (MRMs), with their compact footprint, low power consumption, and high modulation efficiency, have become ideal devices for modulation in interconnects. However, silicon MRMS have so far been constrained by the trade-off between modulation efficiency and bandwidth, hindering their potential for 400 Gbps-per-wavelength operation. To mitigate this trade-off, here we demonstrate a wafer-level fabricated and high-bandwidth silicon MRM with a novel heavily-doped trench-integrated structure on a 300-mm silicon photonic platform, achieving both outstanding device performance and remarkable wafer-scale uniformity. Exploiting dual operation modes: self-biasing for energy-efficient scale-up interconnects and depletion driving for ultrafast scale-out links, the device supports error-free 32-Gbps NRZ transmission over 2-km SSMF with only 0.43-Vpp drive and zero electrical bias, yielding energy efficiency of 0.97 fJ/bit without DSP. At higher swings, it further supports 280-Gbps PAM4 and error-free 80-Gbps NRZ optical modulation. For scale-out interconnects, open eye diagrams are achieved at 200 Gbps (NRZ), 360 Gbps (PAM4), and a record 400 Gbps (PAM6), establishing the first wafer-scale silicon MRM solution reaching 400 Gbps/$\lambda$. The sub-fJ/bit energy efficiency and high bandwidth demonstrated in this work establish the MRM as a scalable, high-performance solution for next-generation optical interconnect architectures in AI computing networks</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a tandem lens optical setup, comprising two diffractive optics, that focuses a high-power ultrafast laser with a shaped on-axis intensity profile, producing a meter-long Bessel focus. The intended use of the optical setup is to produce a laser-ionized plasma source for plasma wakefield acceleration. By controlling the on-axis intensity, the density profile of the plasma ramps at the entrance and exit of the plasma can be tailored to optimize matching of the electron beam into the plasma. In addition to demonstrating the optical system, we describe the algorithm used to calculate the lens phases and present detailed calculations of the lenses' expected performance.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optical neurons (QONs) are emerging as promising computational units that leverage photonic interference to perform neural operations in an energy-efficient and physically grounded manner. Building on recent theoretical proposals, we introduce a family of QON architectures based on Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) and Mach-Zehnder (MZ) interferometers, incorporating different photon modulation strategies -- phase, amplitude, and intensity. These physical setups yield distinct pre-activation functions, which we implement as fully differentiable modules in software. We evaluate these QONs both in isolation and as building blocks of multilayer networks, training them on binary and multiclass image classification tasks using the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets. Our experiments show that two configurations -- HOM-based amplitude modulation and MZ-based phase-shifted modulation -- achieve performance comparable to that of classical neurons in several settings, and in some cases exhibit faster or more stable convergence. In contrast, intensity-based encodings display greater sensitivity to distributional shifts and training instabilities. These results highlight the potential of QONs as efficient and scalable components for future quantum-inspired neural architectures and hybrid photonic-electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Can We Conjugate the Orbital Angular Momentum of a Single Photon with Nonlinear Optics? A Theoretical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stimulated parametric down-conversion (StimPDC) produces an idler beam that exhibits a phase conjugate of the spatial structure of the classical seed beam. Extending this effect to the single-photon regime can, in principle, enable the control of the orbital angular momentum of single photons. However, its experimental implementation remains challenging due to the lower photon flux of realistic single-photon sources compared to a classical pump beam, which causes the StimPDC process to occur less frequently compared to its spontaneous counterpart. To overcome this, we propose a cascaded parametric down-conversion scheme, in which the signal photon from a spontaneously down-converted pair seeds the StimPDC process, while the idler photon heralds the seed's presence. This configuration uses coincidence detection to effectively post-select for stimulated events among the background of spontaneous contributions. We show that phase conjugation at the single-photon level manifests as a bias towards equal orbital angular momentum between the heralding idler and the stimulated idler. Our results offer a practical route to manipulate single-photon correlations in the orbital angular momentum degree of freedom and could have implications for applications such as free-space quantum communication and quantum-enhanced sensing.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-free optical mode degeneracy lifting in lithium niobate microring resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breaking time-reversal symmetry in integrated photonics without magnetic fields remains a fundamental challenge. We demonstrate phonon-induced non-reciprocity through direct lifting of forward-backward mode degeneracy in microring resonators. Coherent acousto-optic coupling generates differential AC Stark shifts between counter-propagating fundamental optical modes, eliminating the need for intermodal conversion or complex photonic structures. Simple microwave excitation of integrated piezoelectric transducers provides dynamic control of non-reciprocal response, with experimentally demonstrated mode splitting exceeding twice the optical linewidth. The linear relationship between the splitting and acoustic power enables real-time reconfigurability across a wide range of optical wavelengths. This mechanism requires only simple microring resonators and fundamental optical modes, transforming non-reciprocity from a specialized technique requiring careful modal engineering to a universal, electrically-controlled functionality. Our approach establishes a new paradigm for magnetic-free optical isolation and dynamic topological photonics.</description>

      <title>Bending space-time wave packets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical beams with certain asymmetric profiles, such as the Airy beam, can depart from rectilinear propagation and instead travel along curved (typically parabolic) trajectories. Here we show that sculpting the spatiotemporal spectrum of optical pulses yields self-accelerating beams that have symmetric profiles, remain diffraction-free, and travel along power-law curves with propagation distance having arbitrary positive exponent (integer or fractional). We build upon propagation-invariant space-time wave packets (STWPs), in which each spatial frequency is associated with a single wavelength. A linear tilt in the propagation path of an STWP is produced by a corresponding tilt in the spectral domain. A curved trajectory is then produced through locally changing the tilt direction along the propagation axis, which requires associating a prescribed finite-bandwidth spatial spectrum to each wavelength. Using this approach, we realize symmetric STWPs traveling along curved trajectories that follow linear, quadratic, cubic, or even square-root power laws with an acceleration rate that is independent of the beam spatial scale. These novel bending STWPs open new avenues for realizing target-avoidance with electromagnetic waves.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Raman scattering by fast GaN phonon-polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon-polaritons propagating in crystal volume offer the possibility of transferring information throughout matter (via phonons) at high (photon-like) velocity and tunable frequency/wavelength in the far-infrared. However, from the phonon-polariton Raman cross section, the phonon and photon advantages seem mutually exclusive. Either the phonon-polaritons are fast (photon-like) but hardly supported by the lattice (not phonon-like), or they are well supported by the lattice (testified by a high Raman efficiency) but slow (not photon-like). An optimal phonon-photon coupling is currently searched for in hexagonal-GaN by near-forward Raman scattering across parallel crystal faces with in-plane singular c-axis. Two accessible phonons, i.e., the ordinary A1 and E1 ones, plus two refractive indices, i.e., the ordinary and extraordinary ones, generate various phonon-polariton candidates. Notably, in perfect forward Raman scattering and in crossed polarizations of the incident (along c) and scattered lights, which, altogether, maximizes the transferred wavevector to the crystal at minimum scattering angle, a fast phonon-polariton, stemming from the bottleneck of the E1 dispersion on entry to the deep photon-like regime, is activated. It is well supported by the lattice since its Raman signal is strong and sharp, enhanced by multi-reflection of the laser beam between crystal faces at near-normal incidence. This fast Raman-enhanced phonon-polariton is interesting for infrared-photonics in that it cumulates the advantages of a photon (speed) and of a phonon (Raman intensity). Besides, it commutates from a phonon-polariton to a phonon by deviating from normal incidence or by permuting the incident and scattered polarizations, with potential applications as a vibrational/optical switch.</description>

      <title>Phonon-polariton mediated dual electromagnetically induced transparency-like response in a THz metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light and matter can intertwine to create entirely new quantum states in the so-called strong-coupling regime, allowing unprecedented control over electromagnetic waves. In this work, strong-coupling mediated polaritonic states are exploited to demonstrate tunable dual electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) like response in the terahertz (THz) frequency range using a micron-sized metamaterial system coupled with the phonon mode of a lead halide perovskite film. This architecture allows us to reversibly switch between the single and the dual EIT-like behavior without modifying the metamaterial structures. The dual EIT-like nature is further confirmed through the in-plane electric field distributions and the slow-light effects. The specific structural symmetry further allowed us to effectively switch between the dual EIT-like response and the conventional strong-coupling responses. Such tunability bears potential implications for developing metamaterial-phonon-based tunable THz devices such as switches, filters, and slow-light devices.</description>

      <title>NIR/VIS dual-comb spectroscopy comparing high and low repetition rate regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual-comb spectroscopy enables broadband analysis of key molecules with unparalleled frequency resolution and exceptional signal-to-noise ratios across various spectral regions. However, fully harnessing its potential for broadband spectroscopy with high sensitivity and spectral resolution depends critically on selecting the appropriate frequency combs with optimized (comb) parameters tailored to specific applications. This study compares dual-comb spectroscopy systems operating at 80 MHz and 1 GHz repetition rates, in the near infrared and visible spectral regions. The 80 MHz system provides high spectral resolution, ideal for resolving complex spectra, showcased with measurements of NH$_3$ vibrational bands and I$_2$ hyperfine transitions. Utilizing phase-locked feed-forward stabilization, the system delivers excellent signal-to-noise ratios but faces limitations in temporal resolution. The free-running 1 GHz system offers superior temporal resolution and compactness, making it suitable for real-time environmental monitoring in laboratory and field settings. A self-correction algorithm advances the high mutual coherence, enabling high-signal-to-noise measurements without additional electronics. With its 1 GHz resolution, it excels in monitoring NH$_3$ transitions or NO$_2$ lines at high speeds. This work highlights the complementary strengths of these systems for high-resolution spectroscopy and real time trace gas sensing.</description>

      <title>Polarization Control and TM-Pass Filtering in SiN Photonics Integrated with 2D Multiferroic Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization control is a critical function in integrated photonic circuits, directly impacting performance, stability, and signal integrity. In this work, we demonstrate the integration of multiferroic two-dimensional (2D) material CuCrP2S6 (CCPS) with silicon nitride (SiN) photonic devices to achieve polarization-selective filtering and rotation. Our experimental results show that microring resonators incorporating CCPS exhibit transverse magnetic (TM)-pass filtering with a polarization extinction ratio exceeding 25 dB and a low insertion loss of ~ 0.2-0.4 dB at 1500-1600 nm. Additionally, under TM-mode input, straight waveguides loaded with CCPS can achieve a significant polarization rotation, with azimuth angle shifts reaching up to 92.9{\deg}. Simulations and experimental validation indicate that the primary mechanism behind these effects is the polarization-dependent optical mode overlap, governed by the refractive index profile of the CCPS/SiN hybrid system and the waveguides' geometrical dimensions. The anisotropic properties of CCPS provide further enhancement but play a secondary role. These results highlight the potential of CCPS-integrated devices for compact, high-performance polarization control in on-chip photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Observation of moir\'e trapped biexciton through sub-diffraction-limit probing using hetero-bilayer on nanopillar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to tune the degree of interaction among particles at the nanoscale is highly intriguing. The spectroscopic signature of such interaction is often subtle and requires special probes to observe. To this end, inter-layer excitons trapped in the periodic potential wells of a moir\'e superlattice offer rich interaction physics, specifically due to the presence of both attractive and repulsive components in the interaction. Here we show that the Coulomb force between two inter-layer excitons switches from repulsive to attractive when the length scale reduces from inter-moir\'e-pocket to intra-moir\'e-pocket in a WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ hetero-bilayer - thanks to the complex competition between direct and exchange interaction. The finding is a departure from the usual notion of repelling inter-layer excitons due to layer polarization. This manifests as the simultaneous observation of an anomalous superlinear power-law of moir\'e exciton and a stabilization of moir\'e trapped biexciton. The experimental observation is facilitated by placing the hetero-bilayer on a polymer-nanopillar/gold-film stack which significantly reduces the inhomogeneous spectral broadening by selectively probing a smaller ensemble of moir\'e pockets compared with a flat sample. This creates an interesting platform to explore interaction among moir\'e trapped excitons and higher order quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Optically detected nuclear magnetic resonance of coherent spins in a molecular complex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful tool for applications ranging from chemical analysis to quantum information processing. Achieving optical initialization and detection of molecular nuclear spins promises new opportunities - including improved NMR signals at low magnetic field, sensitivity down to the single-molecule level, and full access to atomically precise molecular architectures for quantum technologies. In this study, we report optical readout of coherently controlled nuclear spins in a europium-based molecular crystal. By harnessing ultra-narrow optical transitions, we achieve optical initialization and detection of nuclear spin states. Through radio-frequency driving, we address two nuclear quadrupole resonances, characterized by narrow inhomogeneous linewidths and a distinct correlation with the optical transition frequency. We implement Rabi oscillations, spin echo and dynamical decoupling techniques, achieving nuclear spin quantum coherence with a lifetime of up to 2 ms. These results highlight the capabilities of optically detected NMR (ODNMR) and underscore the potential of molecular nuclear spins for quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray scattering at the carbon absorption edge is uniquely sensitive to local molecular bond identity and orientation in organic nanostructures, encoded as a function of photon energy and polarization. However, quantitative analysis is precluded due to the lack of accurate optical models with bond and orientation specificity. We generate such a model through an algorithm that parameterizes and refines density functional theory calculations with angle-resolved absorbance spectroscopy measurements. The resulting optical tensor is shown to reproduce data from samples with domains of different orientation and crystalline packing, enabling label-free orientation analyses of individual chemical moieties within molecular nanostructures using resonant X-rays.</description>

      <title>Landscape of scattering universality with general dispersion relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universality in physics describes how disparate systems can exhibit identical low-energy behavior. Here, we reveal a rich landscape of new universal scattering phenomena governed by the interplay between an interaction and a system's density of states. We investigate one-dimensional scattering with general dispersion relations of the form $\epsilon(k) = |k|^m$ and $\epsilon(k) = \text{sign}(k)|k|^m$ for any real $m \geq 1$. For key models such as emitter scattering and separable potentials, we prove that the low-energy S-matrix converges to universal forms determined solely by the dispersion exponent $m$ and a few integers defining the interaction. This establishes a broad classification of new universality classes, extending far beyond the standard quadratic dispersion paradigm. Furthermore, we derive a generalized Levinson's theorem relating the total winding of the scattering phase to the number of bound states. Our findings are directly relevant to synthetic quantum systems, where engineered dispersion relations in atomic arrays and photonic crystals offer a platform to explore these universal behaviors.</description>

      <title>Highly Efficient and Broadband Optical Delay Line towards a Quantum Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a high-efficiency, free space optical delay line utilizing a nested multipass cell architecture. This design supports extended optical paths with low loss, aided by custom broadband dielectric coating that provides high reflectivity across a wide spectral bandwidth. The cell is characterized using polarization-entangled photon pairs, with signal photons routed through the delay line and idler photons used as timing reference. Quantum state tomography performed on the entangled pair reveals entanglement preservation with a fidelity of $99.6(9)\%$ following a single-transit delay of up to $687$~ns, accompanied by a photon retrieval efficiency of $95.390(5)%$. The delay is controllable and can be set between $1.8$~ns to $687$~ns in $\sim12.6$~ns increments. The longest delay and wide spectral bandwidth result in a time-bandwidth product of $3.87\times 10^7$. These results position this delay line as a strong candidate for all-optical quantum memories and synchronization modules for scalable quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Approaching transform-limited linewidths in telecom-wavelength transitions of ungated quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly coherent quantum emitters operating in the telecommunication C-band (1530 - 1565nm), where ultra-low-loss fibers and photonic circuits are available, are crucial to the development of scalable quantum technologies. In this work, we report on a modified Stranski-Krastanov growth scheme using chemical beam epitaxy to enable the generation of high-quality InAs/InP quantum dots, characterized by near-transform-limited linewidths ($\Gamma_{\mathrm{TL}}$). We demonstrate the growth of highly-symmetric quantum dots with aspect ratios &gt;0.8 and densities ranging from 2 to 22$\,\mu$m$^{-2}$. Optical characterization of these sources reveal fine-structure splittings down to $25\pm4\,\mu$eV and a single-photon purity of $g^{(2)}(0) = 0.012\pm\mathrm{0.007}$, confirming the quality of these dots. Further, using an etalon to measure the linewidth, in combination with rigorous modelling, we find an upper-bound to the mean, low-power linewidths of only $12.1\pm 6.7\,\Gamma_\mathrm{TL}$ and, in the best case, $2.8\pm 1.8\,\Gamma_\mathrm{TL}$. These results represent a significant step in the development of telecom-wavelength quantum light sources which are essential for complex quantum networks and devices.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a cryogenic electro-optic sampling (EOS) setup that allows for the measurement of microwave signals at arbitrary positions on a cryogenic chip-scale device. We use a Josephson Arbitrary Waveform Synthesizer (JAWS) to generate quantum-accurate voltage signals and measure them with the EOS setup, allowing for the calibration of its response, yielding traceability of the microwave measurements to a quantum standard. We use the EOS setup to determine the time-domain response of ultrafast cryogenic photodiodes and the electrical reflection coefficient, i.e., the S11 scattering parameter, in a superconducting transmission line. Finally, we introduce an optical femtosecond pulse source which can be used to study the fidelity of superconducting transmission lines and terminations, as well as reflections from elements like Josephson junction arrays imbedded in them.</description>

      <title>A high-performance all-silicon photodetector enabling telecom-wavelength detection at room temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are crucial for advancing optical communications, promising substantial gains in data transmission speed, bandwidth, and energy efficiency compared to conventional electronics. Telecom-wavelength photodetectors, operating near 1550 nm, are indispensable in PICs, where they enable the sensitive and low-noise conversion of optical signals to electrical signals for efficient data processing. While silicon is ideal for passive optical components, its limited absorption in the optical telecommunication range (1260-1625 nm) typically necessitates integrating an alternative material, such as germanium, for photodetection - a process that introduces significant fabrication challenges. Here, we present a high-performance, all-silicon waveguide-coupled photodetector, which operates at room temperature within the optical telecom C band. By introducing deep-level impurities into silicon at concentrations close to the solid-solubility limit, we enable efficient sub-bandgap absorption without compromising recombination carrier lifetimes and mobilities. This detector achieves a responsivity of 0.56 A/W, a quantum efficiency of 44.8%, a bandwidth of 2 GHz, and a noise-equivalent power of 4.2E-10 W/Hz1/2 at 1550 nm, fulfilling requirements for telecom applications. Our approach provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for the monolithic integration of telecom-wavelength photodetectors into silicon-based PICs, advancing the development of compact photonic systems for modern communication infrastructures.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we experimentally and theoretically show the improvement in noise characteristics in a distributed Raman amplifier (DRA) system for wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) transmission, utilizing our proposed pumping technique. We show that forward (Fwd) pumping is clearly superior to backward (Bwd) pumping in terms of noise figure (NF) defined by amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise and gain. We also show that bi-directional pumping is a more desirable configuration for NF improvement. However, it is known that Bwd pumping is preferable to Fwd pumping in suppressing signal quality degradation caused by nonlinear optical effects, especially the interaction between signal and pump light. To compare these advantages and disadvantages of Fwd pumping, we conducted WDM transmission experiments using a recirculating loop including DRA and erbium doped fiber amplifiers. We measured the Q-factors of 9-channel 131.6-GBaud polarization division multiplexed probabilistically shaped 32-quadrature amplitude modulation signals while changing the ratio of Fwd pumping to Bwd pumping in the DRA. By introducing the previously proposed low-noise Fwd pumping technique, a higher Q-factor could be achieved with a lower signal launch power, even when the total Raman gain remained constant. A Q-factor improvement of 0.4 dB and signal launch power reduction of more than 3.4 dB were simultaneously achieved. We also show that when Fwd pumping was performed with a conventional pump light source, the disadvantage of Fwd pumping was more noticeable than its advantage.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Dimensional Cathodoluminescence Detector with 3D Printed Micro-Optics on a Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cathodoluminescence, i.e. the radiation caused by the interaction of high-energy electron beams with matter, has gained a major interest in the analysis of minerals, semiconductors, and plasmonic resonances in nanoparticles. This radiation can either be coherent or incoherent, depending on the underlying interaction mechanism of electrons with nanostructured matter. Thanks to their high spatial resolution and large spectral excitation bandwidth, the evanescent near-field of a moving electron in a scanning electron microscope is used to probe locally photonic modes at the nanoscale, e.g., exciton or plasmon polaritons. The properties of these excitations can be analyzed through both spectral and temporal statistics of the emitted light. Here, we report on the technical design and implementation of a novel fiber-based cathodoluminescence detector for a scanning electron microscope. Moreover, we present first characterization measurements to prove the ability for raster scanning the cathodoluminescence emission using optical fibers with 3D printed micro-optics. The functionality and flexibility of this fiber-based detector is highlighted by resolving the spatial far-field distribution of the excited light, as well as cathodoluminescence spectroscopy and time-correlated single photon counting. Our findings pave the way for a better understanding of the characteristic of the light emitted from electron beams interacting with nanostructures and two-dimensional materials.</description>

Abstract: We benchmark Lumerical FDTD and Tidy3D for 3D simulations of passive silicon photonic components on the SOI platform. Six devices -- including an MMI, directional coupler, waveguide crossing, mode converter, polarization splitter rotator, and ring resonator -- are simulated under matched conditions using geometries from the generic PDK from GDSFactory.

      <description>arXiv:2507.03654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the coupling of bulk space-time-structured waves, such as spatiotemporal vortex pulses (STVPs), to surface waves, such as surface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs). For resonant coupling that preserves the frequency and tangent wavevector components, it is challenging to transfer the space-time wave structure because of the difference between the bulk and surface wave dispersions. We describe three mechanisms allowing for the bulk-to-surface conversion of STVPs: (i) a suitable tilt of the pulse spectrum in the $(\omega,{\bf k})$ space; (ii) confinement of the incident pulse in the direction orthogonal to the vortex; and (iii) losses in the surface waves. We supply general considerations with numerical simulations of the STVP-to-SPP coupling at a dielectric-prism/metal-film interface.</description>

      <title>Statistical regimes of electromagnetic wave propagation in randomly time-varying media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wave propagation in time-varying media enables unique control of energy transport by breaking energy conservation through temporal modulation. Among the resulting phenomena, temporal disorder-random fluctuations in material parameters-can suppress propagation and induce localization, analogous to Anderson localization. However, the statistical nature of this process remains incompletely understood. We present a comprehensive analytical and numerical study of electromagnetic wave propagation in spatially uniform media with randomly time-varying permittivity. Using the invariant imbedding method, we derive exact moment equations and identify three distinct statistical regimes for initially unidirectional input: gamma-distributed energy at early times, negative exponential statistics at intermediate times, and a quasi-log-normal distribution at long times, distinct from the true log-normal. In contrast, symmetric bidirectional input yields genuine log-normal statistics across all time scales. These findings are validated using two complementary disorder models--delta-correlated Gaussian noise and piecewise-constant fluctuations--demonstrating that the observed statistics are robust and governed by input symmetry. Momentum conservation constrains the long-time behavior, linking the statistical outcome to the initial conditions. Our results establish a unified framework for understanding statistical wave dynamics in time-modulated systems and offer guiding principles for the design of dynamically tunable photonic and electromagnetic devices.</description>

      <title>Topological edge states and disorder robustness in one-dimensional off-diagonal mosaic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate topological edge states in one-dimensional off-diagonal mosaic lattices, where nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes are modulated periodically with period $\kappa&gt;1$. Analytically, we demonstrate that discrete edge states emerge at energy levels $E=\epsilon+2t\cos(\pi i/\kappa)$ ($i=1,\cdots,\kappa-1$), extending the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model to multi-band systems. Numerical simulations show that these edge states are robustly localized and display characteristic nodal structures, with their existence being strongly dictated by the specific edge arrangement of long and short bonds. We further examine their stability under off-diagonal disorder, where the hopping amplitudes $\beta$ fluctuate randomly at intervals of $\kappa$. Using the inverse participation ratio as a localization measure, we show that these topological edge states remain robust over a broad range of disorder strengths. In contrast, additional $\beta$-dependent edge states that appear for $\kappa \ge 4$ are fragile and vanish even under relatively weak disorder. These findings highlight a rich interplay between topology, periodic modulation, and disorder, offering insights for engineering multi-gap topological phases and their realization in synthetic quantum and photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Relaxing Direct Ptychography Sampling Requirements via Parallax Imaging Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct ptychography enables the retrieval of information encoded in the phase of an electron wave passing through a thin sample by deconvolving the interference effects of a converged probe with known aberrations. Under the weak phase object approximation, this permits the optimal transfer of information using non-iterative techniques. However, the achievable resolution of the technique is traditionally limited by the probe step size -- setting stringent Nyquist sampling requirements. At the same time, parallax imaging has emerged as a dose-efficient phase-retrieval technique which relaxes sampling requirements and enables scan-upsampling. Here, we formulate parallax imaging as a quadratic approximation to part of the direct ptychography kernel and use this insight to enable upsampling in direct ptychography. We validate our analytical results numerically using simulated and experimental reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Beyond Contrast Transfer: Spectral SNR as a Dose-Aware Metric for STEM Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The contrast transfer function (CTF) is widely used to evaluate phase retrieval methods in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), including center-of-mass imaging, parallax imaging, direct ptychography, and iterative ptychography. However, the CTF reflects only the maximum usable signal, neglecting the effects of finite electron fluence and the Poisson-limited nature of detection. As a result, it can significantly overestimate practical performance, especially in low-dose regimes. Here, we employ the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR), as a dose-aware statistical framework to evaluate the recoverable signal as a function of spatial frequency. Using numerical reconstructions of white-noise objects, we show that center-of-mass, parallax, and direct ptychography exhibit dose-independent SSNRs, with close-form analytic expressions. In contrast, iterative ptychography exhibits a surprising dose dependence: at low fluence, its SSNR converges to that of direct ptychography; at high fluence, it saturates at a value consistent with the maximum detective quantum efficiency predicted by recent quantum Fisher information bounds. The results highlight the limitations of CTF-based evaluation and motivate SSNR as a more accurate, dose-aware metric for assessing STEM phase retrieval methods.</description>

      <title>Universal dynamics and microwave control of programmable cavity electro-optic frequency combs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electro-optic (EO) frequency combs are foundational for metrology and spectroscopy. Specifically, microresonator-based cavity EO combs are distinguished by efficient sideband generation, precisely controlled by microwave signals, enabling high-performance integrated frequency references and pulse sources. However, the apparent simplicity of these devices, often described by the EO modulation-induced coupling of nearest-neighbor cavity modes, has limited investigations of their fundamental physics, thereby restricting their full potential. Here, we uncover the universal dynamics and complete frequency lattice connectivity underpinning cavity EO microcombs, as well as characterize the full space of nonlinear optical states, controlled by modulation depth and optical detuning, using the thin-film lithium niobate photonic platform. Leveraging this understanding, we design complex long-range couplings between cavity modes to realize programmable spectro-temporal shaping of the generated combs and pulses. We achieve three technological advances, including repetition-rate flexibility, substantial comb bandwidth extension beyond traditional scaling laws, and resonantly-enhanced flat-top spectrum. Our results provide physical insights for synchronously driven cavity-based EO systems, broadly defined, paving the way for electrically controlled and electrically enhanced comb generators for next-generation photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Extracting Membrane-like hexagonal Boron Nitride hosting single Defect Centers for Resonator Integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of membranes into optical resonators plays a key role in a variety of applications, including optomechanics. If such membranes host atom-like systems, ideally with access to spin states, new roads in quantum photonics and also in optomechanics can be taken. Layered, two-dimensional materials have emerged as candidates for membranes hosting atom-like quantum emitters. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is among the most promising two-dimensional platforms showing good mechanical properties combined with the ability to host various kinds of optical active (spin-) defects. However, the determinisitc creation of optically active defect centers in hBN membranes is an outstanding challenge. Commercially available flakes of hBN host defect centers with promising optical properties, but the integration into optical resonators suffers from scattering losses due to the flakes topography and suitable transfer, handling and manipulation techniques need to be established. Here, we develope a toolset of nano-scaled manipulation techniques to extract membrane-like structures of commercially-available hBN containing spectrally narrow single photon emitters. We demonstrate the transfer and integration into photonic devices, by coupling a single photon emitter in membran-like hBN to the mode of an open Fabry-Perot fiber cavity (FPFC) and observe cavity induced spectral enhancement by a factor of up to 100 at room temperature. Overcoming hBN-induced scattering for extracted hBN membranes, which host single photon emitters, paves the way for future applications such as its use as an optomechanical system.</description>

      <title>Programmable k-local Ising Machines and all-optical Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks on Photonic Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic computing promises energy-efficient acceleration for optimization and learning, yet discrete combinatorial search and continuous function approximation have largely required distinct devices and control stacks. Here we unify k-local Ising optimization and optical Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) learning on a single photonic platform, establishing a critical convergence point in optical computing. We introduce an SLM-centric primitive that realizes, in one stroke, all-optical k-local Ising interactions and fully optical KAN layers. The key idea is to convert the structural nonlinearity of a nominally linear scatterer into a per-window computational resource by adding a single relay pass through the same spatial light modulator: a folded 4f relay re-images the first Fourier plane onto the SLM so that each selected clique or channel occupies a disjoint window with its own second pass phase patch. Propagation remains linear in the optical field, yet the measured intensity in each window becomes a freely programmable polynomial of the clique sum or projection amplitude. This yields native, per clique k-local couplings without nonlinear media and, in parallel, the many independent univariate nonlinearities required by KAN layers, all trainable with in-situ physical gradients using two frames (forward and adjoint). We outline implementations on spatial photonic Ising machines, injection-locked vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) arrays, and Microsoft analog optical computers; in all cases the hardware change is one extra lens and a fold (or an on-chip 4f loop), enabling a minimal overhead, massively parallel route to high-order Ising optimization and trainable, all-optical KAN processing on one platform.</description>

      <title>Designing across domains with declarative thinking: Insights from the 96-Eyes ptychographic imager project</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a practitioner's reflection on applying declarative, 5th generation, problem formulation language (5GL) to de novo imaging system design, informed by experiences across the interdisciplinary research in academia and cross-functional product development within the private sector. Using the 96-Eyes project: 96-camera parallel multi-modal imager for high-throughput drug discovery as a representative case, I illustrate how project requirements, ranging from hardware constraints to life sciences needs, can be formalized into machine-readable problem statements to preserve mission-critical input from diverse domain stakeholders. This declarative approach enhances transparency, ensures design traceability, and minimizes costly misalignment across optical, algorithmic, hardware-accelerated compute, and life sciences teams.
  Alongside the technical discussion of 5GL with real-world code examples, I reflect on the practical barriers to adopting 5GL in environments where imperative, 3rd-generation languages (3GL) remain the default medium for inter-team collaboration. Rather than offering an one-size-fits-all solution, these learned lessons highlight how programming paradigms implicitly shapes research workflows through existing domain hierarchies. The discussion aims to invite further explorations into how declarative problem formulations can facilitate innovation in settings where concurrent R\&amp;{}D workflows are gaining traction, as opposed to environments where sequential, phase-driven workflows remain the norm.</description>

Abstract: Predicting the effects of physical perturbations on optical channels is critical for advanced photonic devices, but existing modelling techniques are often computationally intensive or require exhaustive characterisation. We present a novel data-efficient machine learning framework that learns the perturbation-dependent transmission matrix of a multimode fibre. To overcome the challenge of modelling the resulting highly oscillatory functions, we encode the perturbation into a Fourier Feature basis, enabling a compact multi-layer perceptron to learn the mapping with high fidelity. On experimental data from a compressed fibre, our model predicts the output field with a 0.995 complex correlation to the ground truth, improving accuracy by an order of magnitude over standard networks while using 85\% fewer parameters. This approach provides a general tool for modelling complex optical systems from sparse measurements.</description>

      <title>Dichography: Two-frame Ultrafast Imaging from a Single Diffraction Pattern</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray free-electron lasers can nowadays deliver pairs of ultrabright, ultrashort light pulses with controllable delays at different photon energies. When combined with diffraction experiments, the interaction of these pulses with a sample at different times can produce two snapshots of an evolving system, enabling spatial and temporal resolution of ultrafast dynamics in nanomatter at and beyond the terahertz time scale. However, light detectors are orders of magnitude slower. The diffraction signals from the two pulses overlap in the recorded data and cannot be separated using currently available analysis methods. Here, we address this challenge by introducing Dichography, a diffraction imaging technique that restores the two unique views of the sample from superimposed scattering signals. We apply Dichography to experimental diffraction patterns of isolated xenon-doped superfluid helium nanodroplets, imaged using time-delayed, two-color X-ray pulses at intensities near the detection limit. The reconstructed images provide evidence of the survival of the xenon structures up to 750 fs after the interaction with the first shot. The capabilities of Dichography are further explored by applying the method to data from a second experiment, in which we retrieve the images of two distinct silver nanoparticles intercepted by the same light pulse. Dichography enables a new class of experiments for spatially and temporally resolving ultrafast phenomena, making a significant step toward the original promise of X-ray free-electron lasers to capture ultrafast movies of nanomatter.</description>

      <title>Topological protection breakdown: a route to frustrated ferroelectricity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phases manifesting topological patterns in functional systems, like ferroelectric and ferromagnetic vortex superlattices, can manifest intricate and apparently ungovernable behavior, typical of frustrated non-ergodic states with high-dimensional energy landscapes. This is also the case for potassium-tantalate-niobate (KTN) crystals. These transparent ferroelectrics manifest remarkable but little-understood metastable domain patterns at optical (micrometer and above) scales near the cubic-to-tetragonal structural phase transition. Here, we formulate the Topological Breakdown Model based on the competition between intrinsic scales of domain-domain collinear and non-collinear interactions associated with polarization-charge screening. The model is able to explain observed KTN mesoscopic domain patterns and phase diagram as a function of temperature and external electric field. Findings include a precise set of sharp and broad percolative transitions that are experimentally verified, validating the model. Our study identifies the central role played by competing topologically protected states, identifying a fundamental link between topological protection and frustration that supports a hitherto unexplored functional non-ergodic arena.</description>

      <title>Label-free mid-infrared photothermal microscopy revisits intracellular thermal dynamics: what do fluorescent nanothermometers measure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16265v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluorescent nanothermometry has revealed pronounced inhomogeneous temperature distributions within cells, establishing the field of single-cell thermal biology. However, this finding has sparked a controversial discussion known as the "10^5 gap issue", stemming from a simple heat conduction calculation suggesting such large temperature distributions should not exist within cells. Here, we address this issue using label-free mid-infrared photothermal microscopy, which enables measurement of heat-induced temperature variations under local thermal equilibrium via micrometer-scale refractive index changes. First, we measured intracellular thermal diffusivity via transient thermal decay and determined that thermal diffusivity within living cells is 93-94% of water in the cytoplasm and nucleus. This result contradicts the hypothesis that intracellular thermal conduction is considerably slower than in water. Next, we compared fluorescent nanothermometry with our label-free microthermometry by measuring heat-induced temperature variations in living cells and found that the fluorescent nanothermometry exhibited a slowly varying signal in addition to a rapidly responding temperature change. This result clearly verifies that fluorescent nanothermometers are sensitive to an additional nonconductive factor beyond the temperature defined under local thermal equilibrium, exhibiting behavior inconsistent with thermal conduction. Our comparative measurements using fluorescent nanothermometry and label-free microthermometry suggest that this non-conductive factor may originate from slowly varying nanoscale dynamics within cells. Consequently, this work clarifies that the "10^5 gap issue" arises from comparing two fundamentally different physical quantities: the temperature defined under local thermal equilibrium and the non-conductive factor detected by fluorescent nanothermometers.</description>

      <title>Versatile Control of Nonlinear Topological States in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10398v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and nonlinearity can both delocalize topological modes (TMs) from the interface. However, the NHSE requires precise parameter tuning, while nonlinearity in Hermitian systems results in partial delocalization with limited mode capacity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-Hermitian nonlinear topological interface model that integrates Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattices with nonreciprocal hopping and nonlinearity. This system enables the complete delocalization of TMs across the entire lattice without fine-tuning, while allowing precise control over the wavefunction profile and spatial distribution through the intrinsic configuration and intensity of the nonlinearity. Using the spectral localizer, we demonstrate the topological protection and robustness of these extended non-Hermitian TMs against disorder. Furthermore, we show that under external pumping, localized excitations evolve into predefined profiles and generate long-range patterns, an effect unattainable in Hermitian systems. These findings reveal how the interplay of nonlinearity and NHSE shapes topological states, paving the way for compact topological devices.</description>

      <title>Temporally localized quantum operations on continuous-wave thermal light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous work showed that thermal light with a blackbody spectrum cannot be decomposed into a mixture of independent localized pulses. However, we find that in the weak-source limit and under the assumption of a flat spectrum, the first non-vacuum term in the state expansion does form a mixture of such pulses. This decomposition is essential for quantum-enhanced astronomical interferometry, which typically operates on localized pulses even though stellar light is inherently continuous-wave. We present a quantum derivation of the van Cittert-Zernike theorem that incorporates finite bandwidth, thereby justifying the operations on localized pulses while processing continuous-wave thermal light. For general spectra in the weak-source limit, we establish a criterion under which correlations between pulses can be safely neglected. When this criterion is not met, we provide a corrected strategy that accurately accounts for both the spectral profile and the detector-defined pulse shape.</description>

      <title>Exciton-Polariton Dynamics in Multilayered Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupling excitons with quantized radiation has been shown to enable coherent ballistic transport at room temperature inside optical cavities. Previous theoretical works employ a simple description of the material, depicting it as a one-dimensional single layer placed in the middle of an optical cavity, thereby ignoring the spatial variation of the radiation field. In contrast, in most experiments, the optical cavity is filled with organic molecules or multiple layers of two-dimensional materials. Here, we develop an efficient mixed-quantum-classical approach, introducing a bright layer description, to simulate the exciton-polariton quantum dynamics in three dimensions. Our simulations reveal that, for the same Rabi splitting, a multilayered material extends the quantum coherence lifetime and enhances transport compared to a single-layer material. We find that this enhanced coherence can be traced to a synchronization of phonon fluctuations over multiple layers, wherein the collective light-matter coupling in a multilayered material effectively suppresses the phonon-induced dynamical disorder.</description>

      <title>Integrated Multi-Wavelength Photonic Architectures for Future Scalable Trapped Ion Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances of quantum technologies rely on precise control and integration of quantum objects, and technological breakthrough is anticipated for further scaling up to realize practical applications. Trapped-ion quantum technology is a promising candidates to realize them, while its scalability depends on the development of intra-node scaling up, reproducibility of quantum nodes and photonic interconnection among them. Utilization of integrated photonics instead of free-space optics is a crucial step toward mass production of trapped-ion quantum nodes and manifests itself as useful for laser delivery for various quantum operations and photon detection. However, whole architecture of the scalable photonic circuits for them is left unexplored. In this work, we discuss photonic architectures for trapped-ion quantum devices, in which lasers of multiple wavelengths are delivered to multiple trapping zones within a single chip. We analyze two methods of configuring nanophotonic waveguides and compare them in terms of loss of total laser power. This work opens up a new landscape of photonic architecture for various applications not only to quantum ones such as trapped-ion devices but also to classical photonics, e.g. optoelectronic devices and biochemical sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23626v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the localized surface plasmon modes of a sub-wavelength spherical nanoparticle composed of a Weyl semimetal, taking into account the axion modification of electrodynamics. We derive analytical solutions for dipole and quadrupole normal modes by employing the quasistatic approximation. The axion term leads to modified Fr\"ohlich conditions, resulting in multiple non-degenerate plasmonic resonances with distinct polarization dependencies. In contrast to isotropic conventional metals, the magnetoelectric properties of Weyl semimetals enable an incident electromagnetic field, with the electric field transverse to the surface of the sphere, to excite a localized surface plasmon.</description>

      <title>Excitation-Pulse Intensity Mediated Coherent Control in V-Type Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: V-type three-level systems, where two excited states share a common ground state, serve as fundamental models for exploring coherent light-matter interactions in a range of quantum systems, from atomic gases to semiconductor nanostructures. In this work, we investigate the coherent evolution of such a system under strong femtosecond-pulse excitation by numerically solving the optical Bloch equations. We demonstrate that the coherent evolution of a three-level system critically depends on the product of the excitation-pulse duration and energy separation between the excited states. Using this understanding, we extend our analysis to simulate two-dimensional coherent spectra in a high-intensity regime. We show that by varying the pulse areas of the excitation pulses, one can selectively turn individual spectral features, corresponding to distinct quantum pathways, on or off. Moreover, we can precisely adjust the phase of these peaks, illustrating an advanced level of coherent control within the system. Our approach provides a simple and robust framework for achieving advanced coherent control in multilevel systems.</description>

      <title>An explanation of the number or points and symmetries of starbursts</title>

Abstract: Starbursts are the light intensity patterns seen when small bright sources are looked at night, typically stars. Starburst shapes are produced when the presence of the eye's wave aberrations generates caustics (light concentration) at the retina. A fascinating, but never explained fact about starbursts is that they usually present a $p$-fold symmetry pattern. We provide a theoretical explanation of the number of points and symmetries of starbursts, based on the geometric and algebraic properties of the wave aberration function expressed as a Zernike polynomial expansion. Specifically, we investigate the number and distribution of saddle cusps of Gauss of the Hessian of the wave aberration function. We also establish the connections between those points with the symmetries and the number of starburst points. We found that starbursts are likely generated by axially symmetric dominated wave aberrations with some amount of non-axially symmetric terms. For instance, whereas a wave aberration with a dominant spherical aberration (Zernike polynomial $Z_4^{0}$) plus $Z_3^{3}$ may induce a $3$ points starburst with a $3$-fold symmetry, a wave aberration combining $Z_4^{0}$ and $Z_4^{4}$ may induce a $4$-fold symmetry starburst with $4$ or $8$ points.</description>

      <title>Novel techniques of imaging interferometry analysis to study gas and plasma density for laser-plasma experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13907v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laser-plasma based experiments are always more demanding about the plasma features which need to be generated during the interaction. This is valid for laser-plasma acceleration as well as for inertial confinement fusion experiments. Most of these experiments are moving toward high repetition rate operation regimes, making even more demanding the requests on the plasma sources and the diagnostics to be implemented.
  Interferometry is one of the most used methods to characterize these sources, since it allows for non-perturbative, single-shot measurements either of the neutral gas or the plasma density. The design of the interferometric setup is non-trivial and needs to be shaped on the actual conditions of the experiment. Similarly, the analysis of the raw data is a complex task, prone to many sources of error and dependent on the manual inputs.
  In this work, we will present the techniques we are developing for the analysis of the interferograms to measure both the gas and plasma density. We will show the methods, the progress and the problems we encountered in the development of novel routines of analysis based on machine learning. The architectures and the methods to obtain data used for training and testing them will be introduced. The study is ongoing and preliminary results with synthetic data will be presented. The goal is to set up a fast and operator independent diagnostic for the feedback of plasma sources toward high repetition rate experiments.</description>

      <title>The birefringent spin-laser as a system of coupled harmonic oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adding spin-polarized carriers to semiconductor lasers strongly changes their properties and, through the transfer of angular momentum, leads to the emission of circularly polarized light. In such spin-lasers, the polarization of the emitted light can be modulated an order of magnitude faster than its intensity in the best conventional lasers. This ultrafast operation in spin-lasers relies on large linear birefringence, usually viewed as detrimental in spin and conventional lasers, which couples the two linearly polarized emission modes. We show that the dynamical properties of birefringent spin-lasers under intensity and polarization modulation are accurately described as coupled harmonic oscillators. Our model agrees with the intensity-equation description which, unlike the common complex field components describing the role of birefringence in laser dynamics, uses simpler real quantities and allows analytical solutions. We further predict unexplored operation regimes and elucidate the difference between the weak and strong coupling in spin-lasers.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry is at the heart of material properties. Symmetry of the Bravais lattice defines the degeneracy of planewaves, upon which atomic symmetry determines interaction potentials which may lift such degeneracies. This results in wavefunctions which are single planewaves throughout the Brillouin zone (BZ), except in the vicinity of lifted degeneracies. This great simplification allows for determination of optical properties from a handful of planewaves and a single transition. Further, it reveals that nonlinear optical response arises from higher order degeneracy along lines/points in the BZ.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scattering experiments with energetic particles, such as free electrons, have been historically used to reveal the quantum structure of matter. However, realizing coherent interactions between free-electron beams and solid-state quantum systems has remained out of reach, owing to their intrinsically weak coupling. Realizing such coherent control would open up opportunities for hybrid quantum platforms combining free electrons and solid-state qubits for coincident quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing. Here, we present a framework that employs negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV-) in diamond as quantum sensors of a bunched electron beam. We develop a Lindblad master equation description of the magnetic free-electron--qubit interactions and identify spin relaxometry as a sensitive probe of the interaction. Experimentally, we integrate a confocal fluorescence microscopy setup into a microwave-bunched electron beam line. We monitor charge-state dynamics and assess their impact on key sensing performance metrics (such as spin readout contrast), defining safe operating parameters for quantum sensing experiments. By performing $T_1$ relaxometry under controlled electron beam exposure, we establish an upper bound on the free-electron--spin coupling strength. Our results establish NV- centers as quantitative probes of free electrons, providing a metrological benchmark for free-electron--qubit coupling under realistic conditions, and chart a route toward solid-state quantum control with electron beams.</description>

      <title>Optical Integration With Heralded Single Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate optical integration using heralded single photons and explore the influence of spatial correlations between photons on this process. Specifically, we experimentally harness the transverse spatial degrees of freedom of light within an optical processing framework based on heralded single photons. The integration is performed over binary phase patterns encoded via a phase-only spatial light modulator, with polarization serving as an auxiliary degree of freedom. Our findings reveal a distinct contrast in how spatial correlations affect image analysis: spatially uncorrelated photons are more effective at capturing the global features of an image encoded in the modulator, whereas spatially correlated photons exhibit enhanced sensitivity to local image details. Importantly, the optical integration scheme presented here bears a strong conceptual and operational resemblance to the DQC1 (Deterministic Quantum Computation with One Qubit) model. This connection underscores the potential of our approach for quantum-enhanced information processing, even in regimes where entanglement is minimal or absent.</description>
