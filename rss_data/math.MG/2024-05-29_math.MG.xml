      <title>Small volume bodies of constant width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every large enough $n$, we explicitly construct a body of constant width $2$ that has volume less than $0.9^n \text{Vol}(\mathbb{B}^{n}$), where $\mathbb{B}^{n}$ is the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. This answers a question of O.~Schramm.</description>

      <title>Ergodic quasi-isometries and the cohomology of nilpotent Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a simplified and self-contained proof of the following result due to Shalom, Sauer, and Gotfredsen-Kyed: two quasi-isometric simply connected nilpotent Lie groups $G$ and $H$ have isomorphic cohomology algebras. Our proof is based on considering maps which induce an ergodic measure on the space of functions from $G$ to $H$ ($\textit{ergodic maps}$), and we show that, given an ergodic quasi-isometry, one can construct an explicit isomorphism from $H^*(H)$ to $H^*(G)$.
  Specifically, when $\psi$ is an ergodic quasi-isometry, the pullback $\psi^*\omega$ of a differential form $\omega$ has a well-defined $\textit{amenable average}$ $\overline{\psi^*}\omega$, and we show that $\overline{\psi^*}$ is the desired isomorphism. A key observation in our proof is that quasi-isometries of nilpotent groups are coarsely volume-preserving, so the amenable average of the pullback of the volume form is always nonzero.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian metric geometry with Riemannian bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study collections of exact Lagrangian submanifolds respecting some uniform Riemannian bounds, which we equip with a metric naturally arising in symplectic topology (e.g. the Lagrangian Hofer metric or the spectral metric). We exhibit many metric and symplectic properties of these spaces, such that they have compact completions and that they contain only finitely many Hamiltonian isotopy classes. We then use this to exclude many unusual phenomena from happening in these bounded spaces. Taking limits in the bounds, we also conclude that there are at most countably many Hamiltonian isotopy classes of exact Lagrangian submanifolds in a Liouville manifold. Under some mild topological assumptions, we get analogous results for monotone Lagrangian submanifolds with a fixed monotonicity constant. Finally, in the process of showing these results, we get new results on the Riemannian geometry of cotangent bundles and surfaces which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Quasimetric spaces with few lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chen and Chv\'atal conjectured in 2008 that in any finite metric space either there is a line containing all the points - a universal line -, or the number of lines is at least the number of points. This is a generalization of a classical result due to Erd\H{o}s that says that a set of $n$ non-collinear points in the Euclidean plane defines at least $n$ different lines.
  A line of a metric space with metric $\rho$ is defined in terms of a notion called the betweenness of the space which is the set of all triples $(x,z,y)$ such that $\rho(x,y)=\rho(x,z)+\rho(z,y)$.
  In this work we prove that for each $n\geq 4$ there are $p_3(n)$ non isomorphic betweennesses arising from \emph{quasimetric} spaces with $n$ points, without universal lines and with exactly 3 lines, where $p_3(n)$ is the number of partitions of an integer $n$ into three parts. We also prove that for $n\geq 5$, there are $2p_3(n-1)$ non isomorphic betweennesses arising from quasimetric spaces on $n$ points, without universal lines and with exactly 4 lines. Here two betweennesses are isomorphic if they are isomorphic as relational structures.
  None of the betweennesses mentioned above is metric which implies that Chen and Chv\'atal's conjecture is valid for metric spaces with at most five points.</description>

      <title>Tilings of an Isosceles Triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1974</link>
      <description>arXiv:1206.1974v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An N-tiling of triangle ABC by triangle T is a way of writing ABC as a union of N triangles congruent to T, overlapping only at their boundaries. The triangle T is the "tile". The tile may or may not be similar to ABC. In this paper we study the case of isosceles (but not equilateral) ABC. We study three possible forms of the tile: right-angled, or with one angle double another, or with a 120 degree angle. In the case of a right-angled tile, we give a complete characterization of the tilings, and prove that N must be even. In the latter two cases we prove the ratios of the sides of the tile are rational, and give a necessary condition for the existence of an N-tiling. For the case when the tile has one angle double another, we prove N cannot be prime or even squarefree.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz geometry of abnormal surfaces with circular link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04446v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study outer Lipschitz geometry of real semialgebraic or, more general, definable in a polynomially bounded o-minimal structure over the reals, circular surface germs, i.e., surfaces which link is homeomorphic to $S^1$. In particular, we show there are finitely many canonical Lipschitz invariant basic building blocks for the space of all arcs in those surfaces, called "segments" and "nodal zones". We also investigate and determine some necessary and sufficient conditions on such a surface so that it can be reduced to a H\"older triangle which shares with this surface almost the same Lipschitz invariant building blocks.</description>

      <title>Tiling an Equilateral Triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:1812.07014v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $ABC$ be an equilateral triangle. For certain triangles $T$ (the "tile") and certain $N$, it is possible to cut $ABC$ into $N$ copies of $T$. It is known that only certain shapes of $T$ are possible, but until now very little was known about the possible values of $N$. Here we prove that for $N&gt;3$, $N$ cannot be prime, and study more closely the possible tilings when the tile has a $\pi/3$ angle.</description>

      <title>The Fourier spectrum and sumset type problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07019v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the \emph{Fourier spectrum} which is a continuously parametrised family of dimensions living between the Fourier dimension and the Hausdorff dimension for both sets and measures. We establish some fundamental theory and motivate the concept via several applications, especially to sumset type problems. For example, we study dimensions of convolutions and sumsets, and solve the distance set problem for sets satisfying certain Fourier analytic conditions.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of isoperimetric sets in spaces of positive curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every $d\ge 3$, we construct a noncompact smooth $d$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with strictly positive sectional curvature without isoperimetric sets for any volume below $1$. We construct a similar example also for the relative isoperimetric problem in (unbounded) convex sets in $\mathbb R^d$. The examples we construct have nondegenerate asymptotic cone.
  The dimensional constraint $d\ge 3$ is sharp. Our examples exhibit nonexistence of isoperimetric sets only for small volumes; indeed in nonnegatively curved spaces with nondegenerate asymptotic cones isoperimetric sets with large volumes always exist.
  This is the first instance of noncollapsed nonnegatively curved space without isoperimetric sets.</description>

      <title>Fourier decay of product measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can one characterise the Fourier decay of a product measure in terms of the Fourier decay of its marginals? We make inroads on this question by describing the Fourier spectrum of a product measure in terms of the Fourier spectrum of its marginals. The Fourier spectrum is a continuously parametrised family of dimensions living between the Fourier and Hausdorff dimensions and captures more Fourier analytic information than either dimension considered in isolation. We provide several examples and applications, including to Kakeya and Furstenberg sets. In the process we derive novel Fourier analytic characterisations of the upper and lower box dimensions.</description>
