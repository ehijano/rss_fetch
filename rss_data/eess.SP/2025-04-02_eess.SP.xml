      <title>Exact local recovery for Chemical Shift Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical Shift Imaging (CSI) or Chemical Shift Encoded Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CSE-MRI) enables the quantification of different chemical species in the human body, and it is one of the most widely used imaging modalities used to quantify fat in the human body. Although there have been substantial improvements in the design of signal acquisition protocols and the development of a variety of methods for the recovery of parameters of interest from the measured signal, it is still challenging to obtain a consistent and reliable quantification over the entire field of view. In fact, there are still discrepancies in the quantities recovered by different methods, and each exhibits a different degree of sensitivity to acquisition parameters such as the choice of echo times.
  Some of these challenges have their origin in the signal model itself. In particular, it is non-linear, and there may be different sets of parameters of interest compatible with the measured signal. For this reason, a thorough analysis of this model may help mitigate some of the remaining challenges, and yield insight into novel acquisition protocols. In this work, we perform an analysis of the signal model underlying CSI, focusing on finding suitable conditions under which recovery of the parameters of interest is possible. We determine the sources of non-identifiability of the parameters, and we propose a reconstruction method based on smooth non-convex optimization under convex constraints that achieves exact local recovery under suitable conditions. A surprising result is that the concentrations of the chemical species in the sample may be identifiable even when other parameters are not. We present numerical results illustrating how our theoretical results may help develop novel acquisition techniques, and showing how our proposed recovery method yields results comparable to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Methodology for Detecting Energy Anomalies due to Multi-Replay Attacks on Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructures (EVCIs) introduces cybersecurity challenges, particularly due to inherent vulnerabilities, making them susceptible to cyberattacks. The vulnerable points in EVCI are charging ports, which serve as the links between the EVs and the EVCI as they transfer the data along with the power. Data spoofing attacks targeting these ports can compromise security, reliability, and overall system performance by introducing anomalies in operational data. An efficient method for identifying the charging port current magnitude variations is presented in this research. The MATLAB/SIMULINK environment simulates an EVCI system for various data generating scenarios. A Temporal Convolution Network - Autoencoder (TCN-AE) model is used in training the multivariate time series data of EVCI and reconstructing it. The abnormalities in data are that various charging port current magnitudes are replaced with their respective data of different durations, thus enabling the replay attack scenarios. To detect anomalies, the error between the original and reconstructed data is computed, and these error values are used for detecting the anomalies. With the help of the mean vector and covariance matrices of the errors, the anomaly score is computed in the form of Mahalanobis distance. The threshold is obtained from the short sub-sequence of the errors and optimized for the whole time series data. The obtained optimal threshold is compared with the anomaly score to detect the anomaly. The model demonstrates robust performance in data reconstruction by identifying anomalies with an accuracy of 99.64%, to enhance the reliability and security in operations of EVCI.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Radar Detection in joint Range and Azimuth based on the Hierarchical Latent Variable Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the design of a robust decision scheme capable of operating in target-rich scenarios with unknown signal signatures (including their range positions, angles of arrival, and number) in a background of Gaussian disturbance. To solve the problem at hand, a novel estimation procedure is conceived resorting to the expectation-maximization algorithm in conjunction with the hierarchical latent variable model that are exploited to come up with a maximum \textit{a posteriori} rule for reliable signal classification and angle of arrival estimation. The estimates returned by the procedure are then used to build up an adaptive detection architecture in range and azimuth based on the likelihood ratio test with enhanced detection performance. Remarkably, it is shown that the new decision scheme can maintain constant the false alarm rate when the interference parameters vary in the considered range of values. The performance assessment, conducted by means of Monte Carlo simulation, highlights that the proposed detector exhibits superior detection performance in comparison with the existing GLRT-based competitors.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Sustainable Task Offloading in UAV-Assisted MEC Systems via Meta Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated into existing Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) systems, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) serve as a cornerstone in meeting the stringent requirements of future Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The current endeavor studies an MEC system, in which a computationally-empowered UAV, wirelessly linked to a cloud server, is destined for task offloading in uplink transmission of IoT devices. The performance of this system is studied by formulating a resource allocation problem, which aims to maximize the long-term computed task efficiency, while ensuring the stability of task buffers at the IoT devices, UAV and cloud. The problem jointly optimizes the uplink transmit power of IoT devices and their offloading decisions, the trajectory of the UAV and computing power at all transceivers. Regarding the non-convex and stochastic nature of the problem, we devise a multi-step solution approach. Initially, by invoking the fractional programming and Lyapunov theory, we transform the long-term optimization problem into an equivalent per-time-slot form. Subsequently, we recast the reformulated problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which reflects the network dynamics. The MDP model, eventually, serves for training a Meta Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MTD3) agent, in charge of adaptive resource allocation with respect to the MEC system variations derived from the mobility of the UAV and IoT devices. Simulations reveal the dominance of our proposed resource allocation approach over its Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-powered counterparts, increasing computed task efficiency and reducing task buffer lengths.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Extended Target Tracking in ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using communication signals for extended target (ET) tracking in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. The ET is characterized by its center range, azimuth, orientation, and contour shape, for which conventional scatterer-based tracking algorithms are hardly feasible due to the limited scatterer resolution in ISAC. To address this challenge, we propose ISACTrackNet, a deep learning-based tracking model that directly estimates ET kinematic and contour parameters from noisy received echoes. The model consists of three modules: Denoising module for clutter and self-interference suppression, Encoder module for instantaneous state estimation, and KalmanNet module for prediction refinement within a constant-velocity state-space model. Simulation results show that ISACTrackNet achieves near-optimal accuracy in position and angle estimation compared to radar-based tracking methods, even under limited measurement resolution and partial occlusions, but orientation and contour shape estimation remains slightly suboptimal. These results clearly demonstrate the feasibility of using communication-only signals for reliable ET tracking.</description>

      <title>Near Field Localization via AI-Aided Subspace Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demands for high-throughput and energy-efficient wireless communications are driving the adoption of extremely large antennas operating at high-frequency bands. In these regimes, multiple users will reside in the radiative near-field, and accurate localization becomes essential. Unlike conventional far-field systems that rely solely on DOA estimation, near-field localization exploits spherical wavefront propagation to recover both DOA and range information. While subspace-based methods, such as MUSIC and its extensions, offer high resolution and interpretability for near-field localization, their performance is significantly impacted by model assumptions, including non-coherent sources, well-calibrated arrays, and a sufficient number of snapshots. To address these limitations, this work proposes AI-aided subspace methods for near-field localization that enhance robustness to real-world challenges. Specifically, we introduce NF-SubspaceNet, a deep learning-augmented 2D MUSIC algorithm that learns a surrogate covariance matrix to improve localization under challenging conditions, and DCD-MUSIC, a cascaded AI-aided approach that decouples angle and range estimation to reduce computational complexity. We further develop a novel model-order-aware training method to accurately estimate the number of sources, that is combined with casting of near field subspace methods as AI models for learning. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform classical and existing deep-learning-based localization techniques, providing robust near-field localization even under coherent sources, miscalibrations, and few snapshots.</description>

      <title>RapidPD: Rapid Human and Pet Presence Detection System for Smart Vehicles via Wi-Fi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heatstroke and life threatening incidents resulting from the retention of children and animals in vehicles pose a critical global safety issue. Current presence detection solutions often require specialized hardware or suffer from detection delays that do not meet safety standards. To tackle this issue, by re-modeling channel state information (CSI) with theoretical analysis of path propagation, this study introduces RapidPD, an innovative system utilizing CSI in subcarrier dimension to detect the presence of humans and pets in vehicles. The system models the impact of motion on CSI and introduces motion statistics in subcarrier dimension using a multi-layer autocorrelation method to quantify environmental changes. RapidPD is implemented using commercial Wi-Fi chipsets and tested in real vehicle environments with data collected from 10 living organisms. Experimental results demonstrate that RapidPD achieves a detection accuracy of 99.05% and a true positive rate of 99.32% within a 1-second time window at a low sampling rate of 20 Hz. These findings represent a significant advancement in vehicle safety and provide a foundation for the widespread adoption of presence detection systems.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Synchronization of Distributed Arrays using Particle-Based Loopy Belief Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensing and imaging with distributed radio infrastructures (e.g., distributed MIMO, wireless sensor networks, multistatic radar) rely on knowledge of the positions, orientations, and clock parameters of distributed apertures. We extend a particle-based loopy belief propagation (BP) algorithm to cooperatively synchronize distributed agents to anchors in space and time. Substituting marginalization over nuisance parameters with approximate but closed-form concentration, we derive an efficient estimator that bypasses the need for preliminary channel estimation and operates directly on noisy channel observations. Our algorithm demonstrates scalable, accurate spatiotemporal synchronization on simulated data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis delves into the forefront of wireless communication by exploring the synergistic integration of three transformative technologies: STAR-RIS, CoMP, and NOMA. Driven by the ever-increasing demand for higher data rates, improved spectral efficiency, and expanded coverage in the evolving landscape of 6G development, this research investigates the potential of these technologies to revolutionize future wireless networks.
  The thesis analyzes the performance gains achievable through strategic deployment of STAR-RIS, focusing on mitigating inter-cell interference, enhancing signal strength, and extending coverage to cell-edge users. Resource sharing strategies for STAR-RIS elements are explored, optimizing both transmission and reflection functionalities. Analytical frameworks are developed to quantify the benefits of STAR-RIS assisted CoMP-NOMA networks under realistic channel conditions, deriving key performance metrics such as ergodic rates and outage probabilities. Additionally, the research delves into energy-efficient design approaches for CoMP-NOMA networks incorporating RIS, proposing novel RIS configurations and optimization algorithms to achieve a balance between performance and energy consumption. Furthermore, the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques for intelligent and adaptive optimization in aerial RIS-assisted CoMP-NOMA networks is explored, aiming to maximize network sum rate while meeting user quality of service requirements. Through a comprehensive investigation of these technologies and their synergistic potential, this thesis contributes valuable insights into the future of wireless communication, paving the way for the development of more efficient, reliable, and sustainable networks capable of meeting the demands of our increasingly connected world.</description>

      <title>Robust Transmission Design for Active RIS-Aided Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different from conventional passive reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), incident signals and thermal noise can be amplified at active RISs. By exploiting the amplifying capability of active RISs, noticeable performance improvement can be expected when precise channel state information (CSI) is available. Since obtaining perfect CSI related to an RIS is difficult in practice, a robust transmission design is proposed in this paper to tackle the channel uncertainty issue, which will be more severe for active RIS-aided systems. To account for the worst-case scenario, the minimum achievable rate of each user is derived under a statistical CSI error model. Subsequently, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum of the minimum achievable rate. Since the objective function is non-concave, the formulated problem is transformed into a tractable lower bound maximization problem, which is solved using an alternating optimization method. Numerical results show that the proposed robust design outperforms a baseline scheme that only exploits estimated CSI.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Attention Networks for Lossless Point Cloud Attribute Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep hierarchical attention context model for lossless attribute compression of point clouds, leveraging a multi-resolution spatial structure and residual learning. A simple and effective Level of Detail (LoD) structure is introduced to yield a coarse-to-fine representation. To enhance efficiency, points within the same refinement level are encoded in parallel, sharing a common context point group. By hierarchically aggregating information from neighboring points, our attention model learns contextual dependencies across varying scales and densities, enabling comprehensive feature extraction. We also adopt normalization for position coordinates and attributes to achieve scale-invariant compression. Additionally, we segment the point cloud into multiple slices to facilitate parallel processing, further optimizing time complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method offers better coding performance than the latest G-PCC for color and reflectance attributes while maintaining more efficient encoding and decoding runtimes.</description>

      <title>Multi-stage Group Testing with (r,s)-regular design Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In industrial engineering and manufacturing, quality control is an essential part of the production process of a product. To ensure proper functionality of a manufactured good, rigorous testing has to be performed to identify defective products before shipment to the customer. However, testing products individually in a sequential manner is often tedious, cumbersome and not widely applicable given that time, resources and personnel are limited. Thus, statistical methods have been employed to investigate random samples of products from batches. For instance, group testing has emerged as an alternative to reliably test manufactured goods by evaluating joint test results. Despite the clear advantages, existing group testing methods often struggle with efficiency and practicality in real-world industry settings, where minimizing the average number of tests and overall testing duration is critical. In this paper, novel multistage (r,s)-regular design algorithms in the framework of group testing for the identification of defective products are investigated. Motivated by the application in quality control in manufacturing, unifying expressions for the expected number of tests and expected duration are derived. The results show that the novel group testing algorithms outperform established algorithms for low probabilities of defectiveness and get close to the optimal counting bound while maintaining a low level of complexity. Mathematical proofs are supported by rigorous simulation studies and an evaluation of the performance.</description>

      <title>A Unified Theoretic and Algorithmic Framework for Solving Multivariate Linear Model with $\ell^1$-norm Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a challenging problem that solving the \textit{multivariate linear model} (MLM) $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ with the $\ell_1 $-norm approximation method such that $||\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{b}||_1$, the $\ell_1$-norm of the \textit{residual error vector} (REV), is minimized. In this work, our contributions lie in two aspects: firstly, the equivalence theorem for the structure of the $\ell_1$-norm optimal solution to the MLM is proposed and proved; secondly, a unified algorithmic framework for solving the MLM with $\ell_1$-norm optimization is proposed and six novel algorithms (L1-GPRS, L1-TNIPM, L1-HP, L1-IST, L1-ADM, L1-POB) are designed. There are three significant characteristics in the algorithms discussed: they are implemented with simple matrix operations which do not depend on specific optimization solvers; they are described with algorithmic pseudo-codes and implemented with Python and Octave/MATLAB which means easy usage; and the high accuracy and efficiency of our six new algorithms can be achieved successfully in the scenarios with different levels of data redundancy. We hope that the unified theoretic and algorithmic framework with source code released on GitHub could motivate the applications of the $\ell_1$-norm optimization for parameter estimation of MLM arising in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, economics, and so on.</description>

      <title>REMAA: Reconfigurable Pixel Antenna-based Electronic Movable-Antenna Arrays for Multiuser Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate reconfigurable pixel antenna (RPA)-based electronic movable antennas (REMAs) for multiuser communications. First, we model each REMA as an antenna characterized by a set of predefined and discrete selectable radiation positions within the radiating region. Considering the trade-off between performance and cost, we propose two types of REMA-based arrays: the partially-connected RPA-based electronic movable-antenna array (PC-REMAA) and fully-connected REMAA (FC-REMAA). Then, we formulate a multiuser sum-rate maximization problem subject to the power constraint and hardware constraints of the PC-REMAA or FC-REMAA. To solve this problem, we propose a two-step multiuser beamforming and antenna selection scheme. In the first step, we develop a two-loop joint beamforming and antenna selection (TL-JBAS) algorithm. In the second step, we apply the coordinate descent method to further enhance the solution of the TL-JBAS algorithm. In addition, we revisit mechanical movable antennas (MMAs) to establish a benchmark for evaluating the performance of REMA-enabled multiuser communications, where MMAs can continuously adjust the positions within the transmission region. We also formulate a sum-rate maximization problem for MMA-enabled multiuser communications and propose an alternating beamforming and antenna position optimization scheme to solve it. Finally, we analyze the performance gap between REMAs and MMAs. Based on Fourier analysis, we derive the maximum power loss of REMAs compared to MMAs for any given position interval. Specifically, we show that the REMA incurs a maximum power loss of only 3.25\% compared to the MMA when the position interval is set to one-tenth of the wavelength. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>DT-DDNN: A Physical Layer Security Attack Detector in 5G RF Domain for CAVs</title>

Abstract: The Synchronization Signal Block (SSB) is a fundamental component of the 5G New Radio (NR) air interface, crucial for the initial access procedure of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), and serves several key purposes in the network's operation. However, due to the predictable nature of SSB transmission, including the Primary and Secondary Synchronization Signals (PSS and SSS), jamming attacks are critical threats. These attacks, which can be executed without requiring high power or complex equipment, pose substantial risks to the 5G network, particularly as a result of the unencrypted transmission of control signals. Leveraging RF domain knowledge, this work presents a novel deep learning-based technique for detecting jammers in CAV networks. Unlike the existing jamming detection algorithms that mostly rely on network parameters, we introduce a double-threshold deep learning jamming detector by focusing on the SSB. The detection method is focused on RF domain features and improves the robustness of the network without requiring integration with the pre-existing network infrastructure. By integrating a preprocessing block to extract PSS correlation and energy per null resource elements (EPNRE) characteristics, our method distinguishes between normal and jammed received signals with high precision. Additionally, by incorporating of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), the efficacy of training and detection are optimized. A double-threshold double Deep Neural Network (DT-DDNN) is also introduced to the architecture complemented by a deep cascade learning model to increase the sensitivity of the model to variations of signal-to-jamming noise ratio (SJNR). Results show that the proposed method achieves 96.4% detection rate in extra low jamming power, i.e., SJNR between 15 to 30 dB. Further, performance of DT-DDNN is validated by analyzing real 5G signals obtained from a practical testbed.</description>

      <title>Mutual Coupling-Aware Channel Estimation and Beamforming for RIS-Assisted Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies the problems of channel estimation and beamforming for active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication, incorporating the mutual coupling (MC) effect through an electromagnetically consistent model based on scattering parameters. We first demonstrate that MC can be incorporated into a compressed sensing (CS) estimation formulation, albeit with an increase in the dimensionality of the sensing matrix. To overcome this increased complexity, we propose a two-stage strategy. Initially, a low-complexity MC-unaware CS estimation is performed to obtain a coarse channel estimate, which is then used to implement a dictionary reduction (DR), effectively reducing the dimensionality of the sensing matrices. This method achieves low complexity comparable to the conventional MC-unaware approach while providing estimation accuracy close to that of the high-complexity MC-aware CS method. Furthermore, we consider the joint optimization of RIS configuration, base station precoding, and user combining in an single-user MIMO system. We employ an alternating optimization strategy to optimize these three beamformers. The primary challenge lies in optimizing the RIS configuration, as the MC effect renders the problem non-convex and intractable. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) and the Neumann series expansion. Within the SCA framework, we propose a surrogate function that rigorously satisfies both convexity and equal-gradient conditions to update the iteration direction. Numerical results validate our proposal, demonstrating that the proposed channel estimation and beamforming methods effectively manage the MC in RIS, achieving higher spectral efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Semantic Learning for Molecular Communication in Internet of Bio-Nano Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) provides a foundational framework for information transmission in the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT), where efficiency and reliability are crucial. However, the inherent limitations of molecular channels, such as low transmission rates, noise, and intersymbol interference (ISI), limit their ability to support complex data transmission. This paper proposes an end-to-end semantic learning framework designed to optimize task-oriented molecular communication, with a focus on biomedical diagnostic tasks under resource-constrained conditions. The proposed framework employs a deep encoder-decoder architecture to efficiently extract, quantize, and decode semantic features, prioritizing taskrelevant semantic information to enhance diagnostic classification performance. Additionally, a probabilistic channel network is introduced to approximate molecular propagation dynamics, enabling gradient-based optimization for end-to-end learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed semantic framework improves diagnostic accuracy by at least 25% compared to conventional JPEG compression with LDPC coding methods under resource-constrained communication scenarios.</description>

      <title>UAV-Assisted Coverage Hole Detection Using Reinforcement Learning in Urban Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deployment of cellular networks in urban areas requires addressing various challenges. For example, high-rise buildings with varying geometrical shapes and heights contribute to signal attenuation, reflection, diffraction, and scattering effects. This creates a high possibility of coverage holes (CHs) within the proximity of the buildings. Detecting these CHs is critical for network operators to ensure quality of service, as customers in these areas may experience weak or no signal reception. To address this challenge, we propose an approach using an autonomous vehicle, such as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), to detect CHs, for minimizing drive test efforts and reducing human labor. The UAV leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to find CHs using stored local building maps, its current location, and measured signal strengths. As the UAV moves, it dynamically updates its knowledge of the signal environment and its direction to a nearby CH while avoiding collisions with buildings. We created a wide range of testing scenarios using building maps from OpenStreetMap and signal strength data generated by NVIDIA Sionna raytracing simulations. The results show that the RL-based approach outperforms non-machine learning, geometry-based methods in detecting CHs in urban areas. Additionally, even with a limited number of UAV measurements, the method achieves performance close to theoretical upper bounds that assume complete knowledge of all signal strengths.</description>

      <title>Near-Field THz Bending Beamforming: A Convex Optimization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication systems suffer severe
  blockage issues, which may significantly degrade the communica tion coverage and quality. Bending beams, capable of adjusting
  their propagation direction to bypass obstacles, have recently
  emerged as a promising solution to resolve this issue by engineer ing the propagation trajectory of the beam. However, traditional
  bending beam generation methods rely heavily on the specific
  geometric properties of the propagation trajectory and can only
  achieve sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a new
  and general bending beamforming method by adopting the convex
  optimization techniques. In particular, we formulate the bending
  beamforming design as a max-min optimization problem, aiming
  to optimize the analog or digital transmit beamforming vector to
  maximize the minimum received signal power among all positions
  along the bending beam trajectory. However, the resulting problem
  is non-convex and difficult to be solved optimally. To tackle this
  difficulty, we apply the successive convex approximation (SCA)
  technique to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Numerical
  results show that our proposed bending beamforming method
  outperforms the traditional method and shows robustness to the
  obstacle in the environment.</description>

      <title>Robust Bayesian Optimization via Localized Online Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a sequential approach for optimizing black-box objective functions using zeroth-order noisy observations. In BO, Gaussian processes (GPs) are employed as probabilistic surrogate models to estimate the objective function based on past observations, guiding the selection of future queries to maximize utility. However, the performance of BO heavily relies on the quality of these probabilistic estimates, which can deteriorate significantly under model misspecification. To address this issue, we introduce localized online conformal prediction-based Bayesian optimization (LOCBO), a BO algorithm that calibrates the GP model through localized online conformal prediction (CP). LOCBO corrects the GP likelihood based on predictive sets produced by LOCBO, and the corrected GP likelihood is then denoised to obtain a calibrated posterior distribution on the objective function. The likelihood calibration step leverages an input-dependent calibration threshold to tailor coverage guarantees to different regions of the input space. Under minimal noise assumptions, we provide theoretical performance guarantees for LOCBO's iterates that hold for the unobserved objective function. These theoretical findings are validated through experiments on synthetic and real-world optimization tasks, demonstrating that LOCBO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art BO algorithms in the presence of model misspecification.</description>
