      <title>A Comprehensive Analysis of Hurricane Lane's (2018) Intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tropical cyclone reconnaissance data, such as that of Hurricane Lane, often exhibits discrepancies between flight-level wind measurements and SFMR data, leading to uncertainty in determining peak intensity. In this study, I analyze Hurricane Lane's recon data alongside similar cases like Hurricane Dorian (2019), Hurricane Felix (2007), and Hurricane Matthew (2016). By integrating flight-level wind data, SFMR observations, dropsonde data, microwave and satellite imagery, I propose a refined flight-level to surface wind conversion factor of 0.97, contrasting with the commonly used value of 0.9. My analysis suggests a peak intensity of 145 knots maximum sustained wind (MSW) and a minimum sea level pressure (MSLP) of 926 hPa for Hurricane Lane. I also examine how certain features of tropical cyclones can influence reconnaissance data output and infer potential weaknesses in the storm structure. My findings underscore the importance of comprehensive analysis in improving the reliability of reconnaissance instruments and understanding tropical cyclone behavior.</description>

      <title>Wave-resolving Voronoi model of Rouse number for sediment entrainment equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To integrate wave and sediment transport modeling, a computationally extensive wave-resolving Voronoi mesh-based simulation has been developed, to improve upon heretofore separate sediment and spectral wave modeling. Orbital wave motion-dependent sediment transport and fine structures of the dynamic Rouse number distribution across the seabed were brought into focus. The entirely parallelized wave-resolving hydrodynamic model is demonstrated for nearshore beach waters adjacent to artificial islands in Doha Bay. The nested model was validated with tidal time series for three locations and two seasons.</description>

      <title>Elucidation of Unique Developmental Mechanism of Storm Surge along Northern Coast of Kyushu Island, Japan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Along the northern coast of Kyushu Island, significant storm surges were unlikely to occur because the strong wind does not blow directly to the coast when typhoons passes. However, during Typhoon Maysak, various areas along the coast experienced flooding due to the storm surges. Additionally, inundation occurred when the typhoon was more than 600 km away from the coast. In this study, we classified the past typhoons into northeastward-moving, northward-moving and direct-passing overhead types and analyzed the storm surge using observational data and numerical simulations. Regarding northeastward-moving types, Hakata Bay located in the coast experienced two surge peaks. The first peak was induced by the inverted barometer effect and the stagnation of seawater in the Tsushima Strait. The second peak occurred because of the 10-hour oscillation and Ekman transport in the Tsushima Strait. For northward-moving types, Ekman transport was further intensified, resulting in a high storm surge that lasted for more than 10 hours. Regarding directly passing overhead types, one or two peaks occurred in a short period during the closest approach. The first peak was caused by the inverted barometer effect and Ekman transport, whereas the second peak was caused by the 2-hour harbor oscillation in Hakata Bay.</description>

      <title>Short-term wind speed forecasting model based on an attention-gated recurrent neural network and error correction strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate wind speed series forecast is very pivotal to security of grid dispatching and the application of wind power. Nevertheless, on account of their nonlinear and non-stationary nature, their short-term forecast is extremely challenging. Therefore, this dissertation raises one short-term wind speed forecast pattern on the foundation of attention with an improved gated recurrent neural network (AtGRU) and a tactic of error correction. That model uses the AtGRU model as the preliminary predictor and the GRU model as the error corrector. At the beginning, SSA (singular spectrum analysis) is employed in previous wind speed series for lessening the noise. Subsequently, historical wind speed series is going to be used for the predictor training. During this process, the prediction can have certain errors. The sequence of these errors processed by variational modal decomposition (VMD) is used to train the corrector of error. The eventual forecast consequence is just the sum of predictor forecast and error corrector. The proposed SSA-AtGRU-VMD-GRU model outperforms the compared models in three case studies on Woodburn, St. Thomas, and Santa Cruz. It is indicated that the model evidently enhances the correction of the wind speed forecast.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Snowpack Density, Grain Size, and Black Carbon Concentration Using Time-domain Diffuse Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS) techniques aim to characterize scattering media by examining their optical response to laser illumination. Time-domain DOS methods involve illuminating the medium with a laser pulse and using a fast photodetector to measure the time-dependent intensity of light that exits the medium after multiple scattering events. While DOS research traditionally focused on characterizing biological tissues, we demonstrate that time-domain diffuse optical measurements can also be used to characterize snow. We introduce a model that predicts the time-dependent reflectance of a dry snowpack as a function of its density, grain size, and black carbon content, and we develop an algorithm that retrieves these properties from measurements at two wavelengths. To validate our approach, we use a two-wavelength lidar system and measure the time-dependent reflectance of snow samples with varying properties. Rather than measuring direct surface returns, our system captures photons that enter and exit the snow at different points, separated by a small distance (4-10cm). We find strong, linear correlations between our retrievals of density and black carbon concentration, and ground truth measurements. Although the correlation is not as strong, we also find that our method is capable of distinguishing between small and large grains.</description>
