      <title>Joint calibration to SPX and VIX Derivative Markets with Composite Change of Time Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) is calculated from SPX options and derivatives of VIX are also traded in market, which leads to the so-called "consistent modeling" problem. This paper proposes a time-changed L\'evy model for log price with a composite change of time structure to capture both features of the implied SPX volatility and the implied volatility of volatility. Consistent modeling is achieved naturally via flexible choices of jumps and leverage effects, as well as the composition of time changes. Many celebrated models are covered as special cases. From this model, we derive an explicit form of the characteristic function for the asset price (SPX) and the pricing formula for European options as well as VIX options. The empirical results indicate great competence of the proposed model in the problem of joint calibration of the SPX/VIX Markets.</description>

      <title>Decentralised Finance and Automated Market Making: Predictable Loss and Optimal Liquidity Provision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constant product markets with concentrated liquidity (CL) are the most popular type of automated market makers. In this paper, we characterise the continuous-time wealth dynamics of strategic LPs who dynamically adjust their range of liquidity provision in CL pools. Their wealth results from fee income, the value of their holdings in the pool, and rebalancing costs. Next, we derive a self-financing and closed-form optimal liquidity provision strategy where the width of the LP's liquidity range is determined by the profitability of the pool (provision fees minus gas fees), the predictable losses (PL) of the LP's position, and concentration risk. Concentration risk refers to the decrease in fee revenue if the marginal exchange rate (akin to the midprice in a limit order book) in the pool exits the LP's range of liquidity. When the drift in the marginal rate is stochastic, we show how to optimally skew the range of liquidity to increase fee revenue and profit from the expected changes in the marginal rate. Finally, we use Uniswap v3 data to show that, on average, LPs have traded at a significant loss, and to show that the out-of-sample performance of our strategy is superior to the historical performance of LPs in the pool we consider.</description>

      <title>Convolution Bounds on Quantile Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.09320v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantile aggregation with dependence uncertainty has a long history in probability theory with wide applications in finance, risk management, statistics, and operations research. Using a recent result on inf-convolution of quantile-based risk measures, we establish new analytical bounds for quantile aggregation which we call convolution bounds. Convolution bounds both unify every analytical result available in quantile aggregation and enlighten our understanding of these methods. These bounds are the best available in general. Moreover, convolution bounds are easy to compute, and we show that they are sharp in many relevant cases. They also allow for interpretability on the extremal dependence structure. The results directly lead to bounds on the distribution of the sum of random variables with arbitrary dependence. We discuss relevant applications in risk management and economics.</description>

      <title>Stochastic control problems with state-reflections arising from relaxed benchmark tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08302v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies stochastic control problems motivated by optimal consumption with wealth benchmark tracking. The benchmark process is modeled by a combination of a geometric Brownian motion and a running maximum process, indicating its increasing trend in the long run. We consider a relaxed tracking formulation such that the wealth compensated by the injected capital always dominates the benchmark process. The stochastic control problem is to maximize the expected utility of consumption deducted by the cost of the capital injection under the dynamic floor constraint. By introducing two auxiliary state processes with reflections, an equivalent auxiliary control problem is formulated and studied, which leads to the HJB equation with two Neumann boundary conditions. We establish the existence of a unique classical solution to the dual PDE using some novel probabilistic representations involving the local time of some dual processes together with a tailor-made decomposition-homogenization technique. The proof of the verification theorem on the optimal feedback control can be carried out by some stochastic flow analysis and technical estimations of the optimal control.</description>
