      <title>On Selecting Distance Metrics in $n$-Dimensional Normed Vector Spaces of Cells: A Novel Criterion and Similarity Measure Towards Efficient and Accurate Omics Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09243</link>

Abstract: Single-cell omics enable the profiles of cells, which contain large numbers of biological features, to be quantified. Cluster analysis, a dimensionality reduction process, is used to reduce the dimensions of the data to make it computationally tractable. In these analyses, cells are represented as vectors in $n$-Dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a certain cell feature. The distance between cells is used as a surrogate measure of similarity, providing insight into the cell's state, function, and genetic mechanisms. However, as cell profiles are clustered in 3D or higher-dimensional space, it remains unknown which distance metric provides the most accurate spatiotemporal representation of similarity, limiting the interpretability of the data. I propose and prove a generalized proposition and set of corollaries that serve as a criterion to determine which of the standard distance measures is most accurate for conveying cell profile heterogeneity. Each distance method is evaluated via statistical, geometric, and topological proofs, which are formalized into a set of criteria. In this paper, I present the putative, first-ever method to elect the most accurate and precise distance metrics with any profiling modality, which are determined to be the Wasserstein distance and cosine similarity metrics, respectively, in general cases. I also identify special cases in which the criterion may select non-standard metrics. Combining the metric properties selected by the criterion, I develop a novel, custom, optimal distance metric that demonstrates superior computational efficiency, peak annotation, motif identification, and footprinting for transcription factor binding sites when compared with leading methods.</description>

      <title>GenBench: A Benchmarking Suite for Systematic Evaluation of Genomic Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Genomic Foundation Model (GFM) paradigm is expected to facilitate the extraction of generalizable representations from massive genomic data, thereby enabling their application across a spectrum of downstream applications. Despite advancements, a lack of evaluation framework makes it difficult to ensure equitable assessment due to experimental settings, model intricacy, benchmark datasets, and reproducibility challenges. In the absence of standardization, comparative analyses risk becoming biased and unreliable. To surmount this impasse, we introduce GenBench, a comprehensive benchmarking suite specifically tailored for evaluating the efficacy of Genomic Foundation Models. GenBench offers a modular and expandable framework that encapsulates a variety of state-of-the-art methodologies. Through systematic evaluations of datasets spanning diverse biological domains with a particular emphasis on both short-range and long-range genomic tasks, firstly including the three most important DNA tasks covering Coding Region, Non-Coding Region, Genome Structure, etc. Moreover, We provide a nuanced analysis of the interplay between model architecture and dataset characteristics on task-specific performance. Our findings reveal an interesting observation: independent of the number of parameters, the discernible difference in preference between the attention-based and convolution-based models on short- and long-range tasks may provide insights into the future design of GFM.</description>
