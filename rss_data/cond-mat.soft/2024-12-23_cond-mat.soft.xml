      <title>Self-generated electrokinetic flows from active-charged boundary patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a hydrodynamic description of self-generated electrolyte flow in capillaries whose bounding walls feature both non-uniform distributions of charge and non-uniform active ionic fluxes. The hydrodynamic velocity arising in such a system has components that are forbidden by symmetry in the absence of charge and fluxes. We show that flow states with unidirectional and circulatory components emerge when modulated boundary patterns are offset by a selection of flux-charge phase differences associated with the spatial mismatch between sites of peak flux and charge densities on the wall. Self-induced local ionic elevation and depletion, constantly disrupting a non-uniform double layer, promotes directed gradients yielding persistent body forces that generate longitudinal fluid motion along the capillary. Our work quantifies a boundary-driven mechanism based on active-charged patterns that produce self-sustained electrolyte flow in confined environments and exists even in the absence of any external bulk-imposed fields or gradients. It provides a theoretical framework for understanding the effect of ionic boundary properties that are relevant in biological or soft matter systems and can be utilized in nanofluidics and iontronics.</description>

      <title>Scattering-Based Structural Inversion of Soft Materials via Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-angle scattering (SAS) techniques are indispensable tools for probing the structure of soft materials. However, traditional analytical models often face limitations in structural inversion for complex systems, primarily due to the absence of closed-form expressions of scattering functions. To address these challenges, we present a machine learning framework based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for directly extracting real-space structural information from scattering spectra in reciprocal space. This model-independent, data-driven approach provides a versatile solution for analyzing intricate configurations in soft matter. By applying the KAN to lyotropic lamellar phases and colloidal suspensions -- two representative soft matter systems -- we demonstrate its ability to accurately and efficiently resolve structural collectivity and complexity. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of machine learning in enhancing the quantitative analysis of soft materials, paving the way for robust structural inversion across diverse systems.</description>

      <title>Network-forming phase separation of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes forming coacervates in a solvent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of coacervates through phase separation of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes (PEs) is critical for understanding biological condensates and developing responsive materials. Traditionally, coacervates are viewed as spherical droplets with growth dynamics resembling liquid-liquid phase separation. However, our fluid particle dynamics simulations incorporating hydrodynamic and electrostatic interactions challenge this perspective. Here, we find that oppositely charged PEs form a percolated network even in semi-dilute solutions, coarsening with a unique growth law, $\ell \propto t^{1/2}$. This self-similarity, absent for neutral polymers in poor solvents, arises because PEs in good solvents exhibit weaker, longer-range attractions due to spatial charge inhomogeneity under global charge neutrality. This results in a lower density of the PEs-rich phase and reduced interfacial tension. Increased charge asymmetry further slows network coarsening. Additionally, coacervate droplets initially display irregular shapes due to weak interfacial tension, transitioning slowly to spherical forms. Our research provides new insights into coacervate morphology and coarsening dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of active tissue deformation by a dynamic morphogen gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key process during animal morphogenesis is oriented tissue deformation, which is often driven by internally generated active stresses. Yet, such active oriented materials are prone to well-known instabilities, raising the question of how oriented tissue deformation can be robust during morphogenesis. In a simple scenario, we recently showed that active oriented deformation can be stabilized by the boundary-imposed gradient of a scalar field, which represents, e.g., a morphogen gradient in a developing embryo. Here, we discuss a more realistic scenario, where the morphogen is produced by a localized source region, diffuses across the tissue, and degrades. Consistent with our earlier results, we find that oriented tissue deformation is stable in the gradient-extensile case, i.e. when active stresses act to extend the tissue along the direction of the gradient, but it is unstable in the gradient-contractile case. In addition, we now show that gradient-contractile tissues can not be stabilized even by morphogen diffusion. Finally, we point out the existence of an additional instability, which results from the interplay of tissue shear and morphogen diffusion. Our theoretical results explain the lack of gradient-contractile tissues in the biological literature, suggesting that the active matter instability acts as an evolutionary selection criterion.</description>

      <title>Tunability of Dissipative Particle Dynamics simulations for Excluded Volume and Hydrodynamic Interactions in polymer solutions and Rheological predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even though the Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) has shown its worth in a variety of research areas, it has been rarely used for polymer dynamics, particularly in dilute and semi-dilute conditions and under imposed flow fields. For such applications, the most popular technique has been Brownian dynamics (BD), even though the formulation of the same may be complicated for flow in complex geometries, which is straightforward for DPD. This is partly due to the flexibility of BD simulations to mimic any dynamic regime for polymer solutions by independently tuning hydrodynamic interactions (HI) and excluded volume (EV). In this study, we reveal that DPD also offers a similar flexibility and the regimes with respect to dominant EV and HI can be selected as conveniently as BD. This flexibility is achieved by tuning the repulsive interaction parameter of polymer beads and the spring length (which determines the chain resolution). Our results show that the former sets the chain size (and thus, EV) while the latter can be used to set the HI, nearly independently of each other. Thus, any rheological regime of certain level of EV and HI can be attained by appropriately tuning only these two parameters, providing a flexibility of similar levels as BD simulations. We further indicate the suitability of DPD by comparing rheological predictions with equivalent models in BD. For this, we imposed startup uniaxial extensional flows and steady shear flows on the system. Our results indicate the consistency of DPD with BD simulations, which is known to agree well with experiments.</description>

      <title>pyRheo: An open-source Python package for complex rheology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical modeling is a powerful tool in rheology, and we present pyRheo, an open-source package for Python designed to streamline the analysis of creep, stress relaxation, oscillation, and rotation tests. pyRheo contains a comprehensive selection of viscoelastic models, including fractional order approaches. It integrates model selection and fitting features and employs machine intelligence to suggest a model to describe a given dataset. The package fits the suggested model or one chosen by the user. An advantage of using pyRheo is that it addresses challenges associated with sensitivity to initial guesses in parameter optimization. It allows the user to iteratively search for the best initial guesses, avoiding convergence to local minima. We discuss the capabilities of pyRheo and compare them to other tools for rheological modeling of biological matter. We demonstrate that pyRheo significantly reduces the computation time required to fit high-performance viscoelastic models.</description>

      <title>Role of the ratio of tangential to normal stiffness coefficient on the behaviour of vibrofluidised particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The selection of parameters in the contact law for inter-particle interactions affects the results of simulations of flowing granular materials. The present study aims to understand the effect of the ratio of tangential to normal spring stiffness coefficient ($\kappa$) on inter-particle contact behaviour in terms of the rotational coefficient of restitution determined using data obtained from multi-particle simulations. The effect of $\kappa$ on the profiles of the micro- and macroscopic properties of particles in a vibrofluidised bed is also investigated. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to simulate a vertically vibrated fluidised bed using the open-source software LAMMPS. The inter-particle and wall-particle contact forces are determined using the linear spring-dashpot (LSD) model. The distribution of the mean co-ordination number, force during the contact, contact regimes, and rotational coefficient of restitution are determined from the data obtained from simulations. It was shown that $\kappa$ plays a significant role in the distribution of inter-particle contacts between different regimes and, thereby, the velocity distribution and profiles of statistically averaged properties of the vibrofluidised particles. Our results show that for particles with surface friction coefficient $\mu&gt;0.1$, the commonly used value $\kappa=\frac{2}{7}$ results in quantitatively different results from those obtained using $0.67 \le \kappa &lt; 1$, a range consistent with the realistic values of Poisson ratios for simple materials.</description>

      <title>Locomotion on a lubricating fluid with spatial viscosity variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied locomotion of a crawler on a thin Newtonian fluid film whose viscosity varied spatially. We first derived a general locomotion velocity formula with fluid viscosity variations via the lubrication theory. For further analysis, the surface of the crawler was described by a combination of transverse and longitudinal travelling waves and we analysed the time-averaged locomotion behaviours under two scenarios: (i) a sharp viscosity interface and (ii) a linear viscosity gradient. Using the asymptotic expansions of small surface deformations and the method of multiple time-scale analysis, we derived an explicit form of the average velocity that captures nonlinear, accumulative interactions between the crawler and the spatially varying environment. (i) In the case of a viscosity interface, the time-averaged speed of the crawler is always slower than that in the uniform viscosity, for both the transverse and longitudinal wave cases. Notably, the speed reduction is most significant when the crawler's front enters a more viscous layer and the crawler's rear exits from the same layer. (ii) In the case of a viscosity gradient, the crawler's speed becomes slower for the transverse wave, while for the longitudinal wave, the corrections are of a higher order compared with the uniform viscosity case. As an application of the derived locomotion velocity formula, we also analysed the impacts of a substrate topography to the average speed. Our analysis illustrates the fundamental importance of interactions between a locomotor and its environment, and separating the time scale behind the locomotion.</description>

      <title>Up-Converting Luminescent Nanoparticles as Probes of Surface Dynamics in Single Evaporating Microdroplets of Suspension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the optically measurable properties of single evaporating microdroplets of suspensions containing up-converting luminescent nanoparticles (Gd2O3:Er3+), levitated in a linear electrodynamic trap. These microdroplets served as spherical optical resonators, with their resonance properties influenced by the distribution and interactions of nanoparticles (NPs) acting as nanoprobes. Using a combination of light scattering theories, we examined the evolution of the microdroplet radius, nanoparticle surface organization, and effective refractive index during evaporation. Up-conversion luminescence, driven by 805 nm excitation, enhanced the resolution of these observations. Key findings reveal that the increasing NP density in the surface layer leads to surface saturation, followed by transitions to a gel-like state through successive layer formation and collapse. Scattering and luminescence signals exhibit complex oscillatory behaviors linked to resonance phenomena and nanoparticle migration driven by photophoretic forces. Theoretical modeling closely aligns with experimental trends, confirming the interplay between NP distribution and optical resonance properties.</description>

      <title>Motility Modulates the Partitioning of Bacteria in Aqueous Two-Phase Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the partitioning of motile bacteria in an aqueous two-phase mixture of dextran (DEX) and polyethylene glycol (PEG), which can phase separate into DEX-rich and PEG-rich phases. While non-motile bacteria partition exclusively into the DEX-rich phase in all conditions tested, we observed that motile bacteria penetrate the soft DEX/PEG interface and partition variably among the two phases. For our model organism \textit{Bacillus subtilis}, the fraction of motile bacteria in the DEX-rich phase increased from 0.58 to 1 as we increased DEX composition within the two-phase region. We hypothesized that the chemical affinity between DEX and the bacteria cell wall acts to weakly confine the bacteria within the DEX-rich phase; however, motility can generate sufficient mechanical forces to overcome the soft confinement and propel the bacteria into the PEG-rich phase. Using optical tweezers to drag a bacterium across the DEX/PEG interface, we demonstrate that the overall bacteria partitioning is determined by a competition between the interfacial forces and bacterial propulsive forces. Our measurements are supported by a theoretical model of dilute active rods embedded within a periodic soft confinement potential.</description>

      <title>Universal limiting behaviour of reaction-diffusion systems with conservation laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Making sense of complex inhomogeneous systems composed of many interacting species is a grand challenge that pervades basically all natural sciences. Phase separation and pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems have been largely studied as two separate paradigms. Here we show that in reaction-diffusion systems composed of many species, the presence of a conservation law constrains the evolution of the conserved quantity to be governed by a Cahn-Hilliard-like equation. This establishes a direct link with the paradigm of coexistence and recent "active" field theories. Hence, even for complex many-species systems a dramatically simplified but accurate description emerges over coarse spatio-temporal scales. Using the nullcline (the line of homogeneous steady states) as the central motif, we develop a geometrical framework which endows chemical space with a basis and suitable coordinates. This framework allows us to capture and understand the effect of eliminating fast non-conserved degrees of freedom, and to explicitly construct coefficients of the coarse field theory. We expect that the theory we develop here will be particularly relevant to advance our understanding of biomolecular condensates.</description>

      <title>Discrete state model of a self-aggregating colloidal system with directional interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The construction of coarse-grained descriptions of a system's kinetics is well established in biophysics. One prominent example is Markov state models in protein folding dynamics. In this paper, we develop a coarse-grained, discrete state model of a self-aggregating colloidal particle system inspired by the concepts of Markov state modelling. The specific self-aggregating system studied here involves field-responsive colloidal particles in orthogonal electric and magnetic fields. Starting from particle-resolved (Brownian dynamics) simulations, we define the discrete states by categorizing each particle according to it's local structure. We then describe the kinetics between these states as a series of stochastic, memoryless jumps. In contrast to other works on colloidal self-assembly, our coarse-grained approach describes the simultaneous formation and evolution of multiple aggregates from single particles. Our discrete model also takes into account the changes in transition dynamics between the discrete states as the size of the largest cluster grows. We validate the coarse-grained model by comparing the predicted population fraction in each of the discrete states with those calculated directly from the particle-resolved simulations as a function of the largest cluster size. We then predict population fractions in presence of noise-averaging and in a situation where a model parameter is changed instantaneously after a certain time. Finally, we explore the validity of the detailed balance condition in the various stages of aggregation.</description>

      <title>Bending Elasticity of the reversible Freely Jointed Chain</title>

Abstract: The freely jointed chain model with reversible hinges (rFJC) is the simplest theoretical model that captures reversible transitions of the local bending stiffness along the polymer chain backbone, e.g. helix-coil-type of local conformational changes or changes due to the binding/unbinding of ligands). In this work, we analyze the bending fluctuations and the bending response of a grafted rFJC in the Gibbs (fixed-force) ensemble. We obtain a recursion relation for the partition function of the grafted rFJC under bending force, which allows, in principle, exact-numerical calculation of the behavior of a rFJC of arbitrary size. In contrast to stretching, we show that under sufficiently stiff conditions, the differential bending compliance and the mean fraction of closed hinges are non-monotonic functions of the force. We also obtain the persistence length $L_p$ of the rFJC, the moments $\langle R^2 \rangle$ (mean-square end-to-end distance), and $\langle z^2 \rangle$ (mean-square transverse deflection) for the discrete chain and take the continuum limit. The tangent vector auto-correlation decays exponentially, as in the wormlike chain model (WLC). Remarkably, the expression of $\langle R^2 \rangle$ as a function of the contour length $L$ becomes the same as that in the WLC. In the thermodynamic limit, we have calculated the exact bending response analytically. As expected, for $L\gg L_p$, the boundary conditions do not matter, and the bending becomes equivalent to stretching. In contrast, for $L_p\gg L$, we have shown the non-monotonicity of the bending response (the compliance and mean fraction of closed hinges).</description>

Abstract: Shape transformations of epithelial tissues in three dimensions, which are crucial for embryonic development or in vitro organoid growth, can result from active forces generated within the cytoskeleton of the epithelial cells. How the interplay of local differential tensions with tissue geometry and with external forces results in tissue-scale morphogenesis remains an open question. Here, we describe epithelial sheets as active viscoelastic surfaces and study their deformation under patterned internal tensions and bending moments. In addition to isotropic effects, we take into account nematic alignment in the plane of the tissue, which gives rise to shape-dependent, anisotropic active tensions and bending moments. We present phase diagrams of the mechanical equilibrium shapes of pre-patterned closed shells and explore their dynamical deformations. Our results show that a combination of nematic alignment and gradients in internal tensions and bending moments is sufficient to reproduce basic building blocks of epithelial morphogenesis, including fold formation, budding, neck formation, flattening, and tubulation.</description>
