      <title>Across-subject ensemble-learning alleviates the need for large samples for fMRI decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding cognitive states from functional magnetic resonance imaging is central to understanding the functional organization of the brain. Within-subject decoding avoids between-subject correspondence problems but requires large sample sizes to make accurate predictions; obtaining such large sample sizes is both challenging and expensive. Here, we investigate an ensemble approach to decoding that combines the classifiers trained on data from other subjects to decode cognitive states in a new subject. We compare it with the conventional decoding approach on five different datasets and cognitive tasks. We find that it outperforms the conventional approach by up to 20% in accuracy, especially for datasets with limited per-subject data. The ensemble approach is particularly advantageous when the classifier is trained in voxel space. Furthermore, a Multi-layer Perceptron turns out to be a good default choice as an ensemble method. These results show that the pre-training strategy reduces the need for large per-subject data.</description>

      <title>LiteGPT: Large Vision-Language Model for Joint Chest X-ray Localization and Classification Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models have been extensively explored across a wide range of tasks, achieving satisfactory performance; however, their application in medical imaging remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a unified framework - LiteGPT - for the medical imaging. We leverage multiple pre-trained visual encoders to enrich information and enhance the performance of vision-language models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to utilize vision-language models for the novel task of joint localization and classification in medical images. Besides, we are pioneers in providing baselines for disease localization in chest X-rays. Finally, we set new state-of-the-art performance in the image classification task on the well-benchmarked VinDr-CXR dataset. All code and models are publicly available online: https://github.com/leduckhai/LiteGPT</description>

      <title>The object detection method aids in image reconstruction evaluation and clinical interpretation of meniscal abnormalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the relationship between deep learning (DL) image reconstruction quality and anomaly detection performance, and evaluates the efficacy of an artificial intelligence (AI) assistant in enhancing radiologists' interpretation of meniscal anomalies on reconstructed images. A retrospective study was conducted using an in-house reconstruction and anomaly detection pipeline to assess knee MR images from 896 patients. The original and 14 sets of DL-reconstructed images were evaluated using standard reconstruction and object detection metrics, alongside newly developed box-based reconstruction metrics. Two clinical radiologists reviewed a subset of 50 patients' images, both original and AI-assisted reconstructed, with subsequent assessment of their accuracy and performance characteristics. Results indicated that the structural similarity index (SSIM) showed a weaker correlation with anomaly detection metrics (mAP, r=0.64, p=0.01; F1 score, r=0.38, p=0.18), while box-based SSIM had a stronger association with detection performance (mAP, r=0.81, p&lt;0.01; F1 score, r=0.65, p=0.01). Minor SSIM fluctuations did not affect detection outcomes, but significant changes reduced performance. Radiologists' AI-assisted evaluations demonstrated improved accuracy (86.0% without assistance vs. 88.3% with assistance, p&lt;0.05) and interrater agreement (Cohen's kappa, 0.39 without assistance vs. 0.57 with assistance). An additional review led to the incorporation of 17 more lesions into the dataset. The proposed anomaly detection method shows promise in evaluating reconstruction algorithms for automated tasks and aiding radiologists in interpreting DL-reconstructed MR images.</description>

      <title>Fisheye-Calib-Adapter: An Easy Tool for Fisheye Camera Model Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing necessity for fisheye cameras in fields such as robotics and autonomous driving has led to the proposal of various fisheye camera models. While the evolution of camera models has facilitated the development of diverse systems in the field, the lack of adaptation between different fisheye camera models means that recalibration is always necessary, which is cumbersome. This paper introduces a conversion tool for various previously proposed fisheye camera models. It is user-friendly, simple, yet extremely fast and accurate, offering conversion capabilities for a broader range of models compared to existing tools. We have verified that models converted using our system perform correctly in applications such as SLAM. By utilizing our system, researchers can obtain output parameters directly from input parameters without the need for an image set and any recalibration processes, thus serving as a bridge across different fisheye camera models in various research fields. We provide our system as an open source tool available at: https://github.com/eowjd0512/fisheye-calib-adapter</description>

      <title>Leveraging the Mahalanobis Distance to enhance Unsupervised Brain MRI Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) methods rely on healthy data distributions to identify anomalies as outliers. In brain MRI, a common approach is reconstruction-based UAD, where generative models reconstruct healthy brain MRIs, and anomalies are detected as deviations between input and reconstruction. However, this method is sensitive to imperfect reconstructions, leading to false positives that impede the segmentation. To address this limitation, we construct multiple reconstructions with probabilistic diffusion models. We then analyze the resulting distribution of these reconstructions using the Mahalanobis distance to identify anomalies as outliers. By leveraging information about normal variations and covariance of individual pixels within this distribution, we effectively refine anomaly scoring, leading to improved segmentation. Our experimental results demonstrate substantial performance improvements across various data sets. Specifically, compared to relying solely on single reconstructions, our approach achieves relative improvements of 15.9%, 35.4%, 48.0%, and 4.7% in terms of AUPRC for the BRATS21, ATLAS, MSLUB and WMH data sets, respectively.</description>

      <title>High Frequency Matters: Uncertainty Guided Image Compression with Wavelet Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models have recently achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality images. However, balancing high perceptual quality and low distortion remains challenging in image compression applications. To address this issue, we propose an efficient Uncertainty-Guided image compression approach with wavelet Diffusion (UGDiff). Our approach focuses on high frequency compression via the wavelet transform, since high frequency components are crucial for reconstructing image details. We introduce a wavelet conditional diffusion model for high frequency prediction, followed by a residual codec that compresses and transmits prediction residuals to the decoder. This diffusion prediction-then-residual compression paradigm effectively addresses the low fidelity issue common in direct reconstructions by existing diffusion models. Considering the uncertainty from the random sampling of the diffusion model, we further design an uncertainty-weighted rate-distortion (R-D) loss tailored for residual compression, providing a more rational trade-off between rate and distortion. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of UGDiff, surpassing state-of-the-art image compression methods in R-D performance, perceptual quality, subjective quality, and inference time.

      <title>FastSAM-3DSlicer: A 3D-Slicer Extension for 3D Volumetric Segment Anything Model with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures and pathological regions in medical images is crucial for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have demonstrated impressive interactive segmentation capabilities on image types not seen during training without the need for domain adaptation or retraining, their practical application in volumetric 3D medical imaging workflows has been hindered by the lack of a user-friendly interface. To address this challenge, we introduce FastSAM-3DSlicer, a 3D Slicer extension that integrates both 2D and 3D SAM models, including SAM-Med2D, MedSAM, SAM-Med3D, and FastSAM-3D. Building on the well-established open-source 3D Slicer platform, our extension enables efficient, real-time segmentation of 3D volumetric medical images, with seamless interaction and visualization. By automating the handling of raw image data, user prompts, and segmented masks, FastSAM-3DSlicer provides a streamlined, user-friendly interface that can be easily incorporated into medical image analysis workflows. Performance evaluations reveal that the FastSAM-3DSlicer extension running FastSAM-3D achieves low inference times of only 1.09 seconds per volume on CPU and 0.73 seconds per volume on GPU, making it well-suited for real-time interactive segmentation. Moreover, we introduce an uncertainty quantification scheme that leverages the rapid inference capabilities of FastSAM-3D for practical implementation, further enhancing its reliability and applicability in medical settings. FastSAM-3DSlicer offers an interactive platform and user interface for 2D and 3D interactive volumetric medical image segmentation, offering a powerful combination of efficiency, precision, and ease of use with SAMs. The source code and a video demonstration are publicly available at https://github.com/arcadelab/FastSAM3D_slicer.</description>

      <title>Distilling Tiny and Ultra-fast Deep Neural Networks for Autonomous Navigation on Nano-UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nano-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are ideal candidates for flying Internet-of-Things smart sensors to collect information in narrow spaces. This requires ultra-fast navigation under very tight memory/computation constraints. The PULP-Dronet convolutional neural network (CNN) enables autonomous navigation running aboard a nano-UAV at 19 frame/s, at the cost of a large memory footprint of 320 kB -- and with drone control in complex scenarios hindered by the disjoint training of collision avoidance and steering capabilities. In this work, we distill a novel family of CNNs with better capabilities than PULP-Dronet, but memory footprint reduced by up to 168x (down to 2.9 kB), achieving an inference rate of up to 139 frame/s; we collect a new open-source unified collision/steering 66 k images dataset for more robust navigation; and we perform a thorough in-field analysis of both PULP-Dronet and our tiny CNNs running on a commercially available nano-UAV. Our tiniest CNN, called Tiny-PULP-Dronet v3, navigates with a 100% success rate a challenging and never-seen-before path, composed of a narrow obstacle-populated corridor and a 180{\deg} turn, at a maximum target speed of 0.5 m/s. In the same scenario, the SoA PULP-Dronet consistently fails despite having 168x more parameters.</description>

      <title>Promptable Counterfactual Diffusion Model for Unified Brain Tumor Segmentation and Generation with MRIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain tumor analysis in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. However, the task remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of tumor appearances, as well as the scarcity of labeled data. Traditional approaches often address tumor segmentation and image generation separately, limiting their effectiveness in capturing the intricate relationships between healthy and pathological tissue structures. We introduce a novel promptable counterfactual diffusion model as a unified solution for brain tumor segmentation and generation in MRI. The key innovation lies in our mask-level prompting mechanism at the sampling stage, which enables guided generation and manipulation of specific healthy or unhealthy regions in MRI images. Specifically, the model's architecture allows for bidirectional inference, which can segment tumors in existing images and generate realistic tumor structures in healthy brain scans. Furthermore, we present a two-step approach for tumor generation and position transfer, showcasing the model's versatility in synthesizing realistic tumor structures. Experiments on the BRATS2021 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional counterfactual diffusion approaches, achieving a mean IoU of 0.653 and mean Dice score of 0.785 for tumor segmentation, outperforming the 0.344 and 0.475 of conventional counterfactual diffusion model. Our work contributes to improving brain tumor detection and segmentation accuracy, with potential implications for data augmentation and clinical decision support in neuro-oncology.

      <title>Explainable artificial intelligence in breast cancer detection and risk prediction: A systematic scoping review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advances in artificial intelligence (AI), data-driven algorithms are becoming increasingly popular in the medical domain. However, due to the nonlinear and complex behavior of many of these algorithms, decision-making by such algorithms is not trustworthy for clinicians and is considered a black-box process. Hence, the scientific community has introduced explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to remedy the problem. This systematic scoping review investigates the application of XAI in breast cancer detection and risk prediction. We conducted a comprehensive search on Scopus, IEEE Explore, PubMed, and Google Scholar (first 50 citations) using a systematic search strategy. The search spanned from January 2017 to July 2023, focusing on peer-reviewed studies implementing XAI methods in breast cancer datasets. Thirty studies met our inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. The results revealed that SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is the top model-agnostic XAI technique in breast cancer research in terms of usage, explaining the model prediction results, diagnosis and classification of biomarkers, and prognosis and survival analysis. Additionally, the SHAP model primarily explained tree-based ensemble machine learning models. The most common reason is that SHAP is model agnostic, which makes it both popular and useful for explaining any model prediction. Additionally, it is relatively easy to implement effectively and completely suits performant models, such as tree-based models. Explainable AI improves the transparency, interpretability, fairness, and trustworthiness of AI-enabled health systems and medical devices and, ultimately, the quality of care and outcomes.</description>

Abstract: Detecting retinal image analysis, particularly the geometrical features of branching points, plays an essential role in diagnosing eye diseases. However, existing methods used for this purpose often are coarse-level and lack fine-grained analysis for efficient annotation. To mitigate these issues, this paper proposes a novel method for detecting retinal branching angles using a self-configured image processing technique. Additionally, we offer an open-source annotation tool and a benchmark dataset comprising 40 images annotated with retinal branching angles. Our methodology for retinal branching angle detection and calculation is detailed, followed by a benchmark analysis comparing our method with previous approaches. The results indicate that our method is robust under various conditions with high accuracy and efficiency, which offers a valuable instrument for ophthalmic research and clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Inter-Image Similarity Prior for Low-Bitrate Remote Sensing Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based methods have garnered significant attention in remote sensing (RS) image compression due to their superior performance. Most of these methods focus on enhancing the coding capability of the compression network and improving entropy model prediction accuracy. However, they typically compress and decompress each image independently, ignoring the significant inter-image similarity prior. In this paper, we propose a codebook-based RS image compression (Code-RSIC) method with a generated discrete codebook, which is deployed at the decoding end of a compression algorithm to provide inter-image similarity prior. Specifically, we first pretrain a high-quality discrete codebook using the competitive generation model VQGAN. We then introduce a Transformer-based prediction model to align the latent features of the decoded images from an existing compression algorithm with the frozen high-quality codebook. Finally, we develop a hierarchical prior integration network (HPIN), which mainly consists of Transformer blocks and multi-head cross-attention modules (MCMs) that can query hierarchical prior from the codebook, thus enhancing the ability of the proposed method to decode texture-rich RS images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Code-RSIC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art traditional and learning-based image compression algorithms in terms of perception quality.

      <title>Virtual Gram staining of label-free bacteria using darkfield microscopy and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gram staining has been one of the most frequently used staining protocols in microbiology for over a century, utilized across various fields, including diagnostics, food safety, and environmental monitoring. Its manual procedures make it vulnerable to staining errors and artifacts due to, e.g., operator inexperience and chemical variations. Here, we introduce virtual Gram staining of label-free bacteria using a trained deep neural network that digitally transforms darkfield images of unstained bacteria into their Gram-stained equivalents matching brightfield image contrast. After a one-time training effort, the virtual Gram staining model processes an axial stack of darkfield microscopy images of label-free bacteria (never seen before) to rapidly generate Gram staining, bypassing several chemical steps involved in the conventional staining process. We demonstrated the success of the virtual Gram staining workflow on label-free bacteria samples containing Escherichia coli and Listeria innocua by quantifying the staining accuracy of the virtual Gram staining model and comparing the chromatic and morphological features of the virtually stained bacteria against their chemically stained counterparts. This virtual bacteria staining framework effectively bypasses the traditional Gram staining protocol and its challenges, including stain standardization, operator errors, and sensitivity to chemical variations.</description>

      <title>CoSIGN: Few-Step Guidance of ConSIstency Model to Solve General INverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have been demonstrated as strong priors for solving general inverse problems. Most existing Diffusion model-based Inverse Problem Solvers (DIS) employ a plug-and-play approach to guide the sampling trajectory with either projections or gradients. Though effective, these methods generally necessitate hundreds of sampling steps, posing a dilemma between inference time and reconstruction quality. In this work, we try to push the boundary of inference steps to 1-2 NFEs while still maintaining high reconstruction quality. To achieve this, we propose to leverage a pretrained distillation of diffusion model, namely consistency model, as the data prior. The key to achieving few-step guidance is to enforce two types of constraints during the sampling process of the consistency model: soft measurement constraint with ControlNet and hard measurement constraint via optimization. Supporting both single-step reconstruction and multistep refinement, the proposed framework further provides a way to trade image quality with additional computational cost. Within comparable NFEs, our method achieves new state-of-the-art in diffusion-based inverse problem solving, showcasing the significant potential of employing prior-based inverse problem solvers for real-world applications.

      <title>Hallucination Index: An Image Quality Metric for Generative Reconstruction Models</title>

Abstract: Generative image reconstruction algorithms such as measurement conditioned diffusion models are increasingly popular in the field of medical imaging. These powerful models can transform low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) inputs into outputs with the appearance of high SNR. However, the outputs can have a new type of error called hallucinations. In medical imaging, these hallucinations may not be obvious to a Radiologist but could cause diagnostic errors. Generally, hallucination refers to error in estimation of object structure caused by a machine learning model, but there is no widely accepted method to evaluate hallucination magnitude. In this work, we propose a new image quality metric called the hallucination index. Our approach is to compute the Hellinger distance from the distribution of reconstructed images to a zero hallucination reference distribution. To evaluate our approach, we conducted a numerical experiment with electron microscopy images, simulated noisy measurements, and applied diffusion based reconstructions. We sampled the measurements and the generative reconstructions repeatedly to compute the sample mean and covariance. For the zero hallucination reference, we used the forward diffusion process applied to ground truth. Our results show that higher measurement SNR leads to lower hallucination index for the same apparent image quality. We also evaluated the impact of early stopping in the reverse diffusion process and found that more modest denoising strengths can reduce hallucination. We believe this metric could be useful for evaluation of generative image reconstructions or as a warning label to inform radiologists about the degree of hallucinations in medical images.</description>

      <title>Image Denoising Using the Geodesics' Gramian of the Manifold Underlying Patch-Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.07769v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the proliferation of sophisticated cameras in modern society, the demand for accurate and visually pleasing images is increasing. However, the quality of an image captured by a camera may be degraded by noise. Thus, some processing of images is required to filter out the noise without losing vital image features. Even though the current literature offers a variety of denoising methods, the fidelity and efficacy of their denoising are sometimes uncertain. Thus, here we propose a novel and computationally efficient image denoising method that is capable of producing accurate images. To preserve image smoothness, this method inputs patches partitioned from the image rather than pixels. Then, it performs denoising on the manifold underlying the patch-space rather than that in the image domain to better preserve the features across the whole image. We validate the performance of this method against benchmark image processing methods.</description>

      <title>EGIC: Enhanced Low-Bit-Rate Generative Image Compression Guided by Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce EGIC, an enhanced generative image compression method that allows traversing the distortion-perception curve efficiently from a single model. EGIC is based on two novel building blocks: i) OASIS-C, a conditional pre-trained semantic segmentation-guided discriminator, which provides both spatially and semantically-aware gradient feedback to the generator, conditioned on the latent image distribution, and ii) Output Residual Prediction (ORP), a retrofit solution for multi-realism image compression that allows control over the synthesis process by adjusting the impact of the residual between an MSE-optimized and GAN-optimized decoder output on the GAN-based reconstruction. Together, EGIC forms a powerful codec, outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion and GAN-based methods (e.g., HiFiC, MS-ILLM, and DIRAC-100), while performing almost on par with VTM-20.0 on the distortion end. EGIC is simple to implement, very lightweight, and provides excellent interpolation characteristics, which makes it a promising candidate for practical applications targeting the low bit range.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal Cognitive Consensus guided Audio-Visual Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06259v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to extract the sounding object from a video frame, which is represented by a pixel-wise segmentation mask for application scenarios such as multi-modal video editing, augmented reality, and intelligent robot systems. The pioneering work conducts this task through dense feature-level audio-visual interaction, which ignores the dimension gap between different modalities. More specifically, the audio clip could only provide a Global semantic label in each sequence, but the video frame covers multiple semantic objects across different Local regions, which leads to mislocalization of the representationally similar but semantically different object. In this paper, we propose a Cross-modal Cognitive Consensus guided Network (C3N) to align the audio-visual semantics from the global dimension and progressively inject them into the local regions via an attention mechanism. Firstly, a Cross-modal Cognitive Consensus Inference Module (C3IM) is developed to extract a unified-modal label by integrating audio/visual classification confidence and similarities of modality-agnostic label embeddings. Then, we feed the unified-modal label back to the visual backbone as the explicit semantic-level guidance via a Cognitive Consensus guided Attention Module (CCAM), which highlights the local features corresponding to the interested object. Extensive experiments on the Single Sound Source Segmentation (S4) setting and Multiple Sound Source Segmentation (MS3) setting of the AVSBench dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance.

      <title>Semi-supervised Segmentation of Histopathology Images with Noise-Aware Topological Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In digital pathology, segmenting densely distributed objects like glands and nuclei is crucial for downstream analysis. Since detailed pixel-wise annotations are very time-consuming, we need semi-supervised segmentation methods that can learn from unlabeled images. Existing semi-supervised methods are often prone to topological errors, e.g., missing or incorrectly merged/separated glands or nuclei. To address this issue, we propose TopoSemiSeg, the first semi-supervised method that learns the topological representation from unlabeled histopathology images. The major challenge is for unlabeled images; we only have predictions carrying noisy topology. To this end, we introduce a noise-aware topological consistency loss to align the representations of a teacher and a student model. By decomposing the topology of the prediction into signal topology and noisy topology, we ensure that the models learn the true topological signals and become robust to noise. Extensive experiments on public histopathology image datasets show the superiority of our method, especially on topology-aware evaluation metrics. Code is available at https://github.com/Melon-Xu/TopoSemiSeg.</description>

      <title>How we won BraTS 2023 Adult Glioma challenge? Just faking it! Enhanced Synthetic Data Augmentation and Model Ensemble for brain tumour segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Learning is the state-of-the-art technology for segmenting brain tumours. However, this requires a lot of high-quality data, which is difficult to obtain, especially in the medical field. Therefore, our solutions address this problem by using unconventional mechanisms for data augmentation. Generative adversarial networks and registration are used to massively increase the amount of available samples for training three different deep learning models for brain tumour segmentation, the first task of the BraTS2023 challenge. The first model is the standard nnU-Net, the second is the Swin UNETR and the third is the winning solution of the BraTS 2021 Challenge. The entire pipeline is built on the nnU-Net implementation, except for the generation of the synthetic data. The use of convolutional algorithms and transformers is able to fill each other's knowledge gaps. Using the new metric, our best solution achieves the dice results 0.9005, 0.8673, 0.8509 and HD95 14.940, 14.467, 17.699 (whole tumour, tumour core and enhancing tumour) in the validation set.</description>

      <title>MedContext: Learning Contextual Cues for Efficient Volumetric Medical Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Volumetric medical segmentation is a critical component of 3D medical image analysis that delineates different semantic regions. Deep neural networks have significantly improved volumetric medical segmentation, but they generally require large-scale annotated data to achieve better performance, which can be expensive and prohibitive to obtain. To address this limitation, existing works typically perform transfer learning or design dedicated pretraining-finetuning stages to learn representative features. However, the mismatch between the source and target domain can make it challenging to learn optimal representation for volumetric data, while the multi-stage training demands higher compute as well as careful selection of stage-specific design choices. In contrast, we propose a universal training framework called MedContext that is architecture-agnostic and can be incorporated into any existing training framework for 3D medical segmentation. Our approach effectively learns self supervised contextual cues jointly with the supervised voxel segmentation task without requiring large-scale annotated volumetric medical data or dedicated pretraining-finetuning stages. The proposed approach induces contextual knowledge in the network by learning to reconstruct the missing organ or parts of an organ in the output segmentation space. The effectiveness of MedContext is validated across multiple 3D medical datasets and four state-of-the-art model architectures. Our approach demonstrates consistent gains in segmentation performance across datasets and different architectures even in few-shot data scenarios.

      <title>Towards Learning Contrast Kinetics with Multi-Condition Latent Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13890v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrast agents in dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging allow to localize tumors and observe their contrast kinetics, which is essential for cancer characterization and respective treatment decision-making. However, contrast agent administration is not only associated with adverse health risks, but also restricted for patients during pregnancy, and for those with kidney malfunction, or other adverse reactions. With contrast uptake as key biomarker for lesion malignancy, cancer recurrence risk, and treatment response, it becomes pivotal to reduce the dependency on intravenous contrast agent administration. To this end, we propose a multi-conditional latent diffusion model capable of acquisition time-conditioned image synthesis of DCE-MRI temporal sequences. To evaluate medical image synthesis, we additionally propose and validate the Fr\'echet radiomics distance as an image quality measure based on biomarker variability between synthetic and real imaging data. Our results demonstrate our method's ability to generate realistic multi-sequence fat-saturated breast DCE-MRI and uncover the emerging potential of deep learning based contrast kinetics simulation. We publicly share our accessible codebase at https://github.com/RichardObi/ccnet and provide a user-friendly library for Fr\'echet radiomics distance calculation at https://pypi.org/project/frd-score.</description>

      <title>Skeleton Recall Loss for Connectivity Conserving and Resource Efficient Segmentation of Thin Tubular Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately segmenting thin tubular structures, such as vessels, nerves, roads or concrete cracks, is a crucial task in computer vision. Standard deep learning-based segmentation loss functions, such as Dice or Cross-Entropy, focus on volumetric overlap, often at the expense of preserving structural connectivity or topology. This can lead to segmentation errors that adversely affect downstream tasks, including flow calculation, navigation, and structural inspection. Although current topology-focused losses mark an improvement, they introduce significant computational and memory overheads. This is particularly relevant for 3D data, rendering these losses infeasible for larger volumes as well as increasingly important multi-class segmentation problems. To mitigate this, we propose a novel Skeleton Recall Loss, which effectively addresses these challenges by circumventing intensive GPU-based calculations with inexpensive CPU operations. It demonstrates overall superior performance to current state-of-the-art approaches on five public datasets for topology-preserving segmentation, while substantially reducing computational overheads by more than 90%. In doing so, we introduce the first multi-class capable loss function for thin structure segmentation, excelling in both efficiency and efficacy for topology-preservation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) systems allow us to tap into all abundant solar energy, however they require regular maintenance for high efficiency and to prevent degradation. Traditional manual health check, using Electroluminescence (EL) imaging, is expensive and logistically challenging which makes automated defect detection essential. Current automation approaches require extensive manual expert labeling, which is time-consuming, expensive, and prone to errors. We propose PV-S3 (Photovoltaic-Semi Supervised Segmentation), a Semi-Supervised Learning approach for semantic segmentation of defects in EL images that reduces reliance on extensive labeling. PV-S3 is a Deep learning model trained using a few labeled images along with numerous unlabeled images. We evaluate PV-S3 on multiple datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness and adaptability. With merely 20% labeled samples, we achieve an absolute improvement of 9.7% in IoU, 13.5% in Precision, 29.15% in Recall, and 20.42% in F1-Score over prior state-of-the-art supervised method (which uses 100% labeled samples) on UCF-EL dataset (largest dataset available for semantic segmentation of EL images)showing improvement in performance while reducing the annotation costs by 80%.</description>

Abstract: Pediatric central nervous system tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children. The five-year survival rate for high-grade glioma in children is less than 20%. The development of new treatments is dependent upon multi-institutional collaborative clinical trials requiring reproducible and accurate centralized response assessment. We present the results of the BraTS-PEDs 2023 challenge, the first Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge focused on pediatric brain tumors. This challenge utilized data acquired from multiple international consortia dedicated to pediatric neuro-oncology and clinical trials. BraTS-PEDs 2023 aimed to evaluate volumetric segmentation algorithms for pediatric brain gliomas from magnetic resonance imaging using standardized quantitative performance evaluation metrics employed across the BraTS 2023 challenges. The top-performing AI approaches for pediatric tumor analysis included ensembles of nnU-Net and Swin UNETR, Auto3DSeg, or nnU-Net with a self-supervised framework. The BraTSPEDs 2023 challenge fostered collaboration between clinicians (neuro-oncologists, neuroradiologists) and AI/imaging scientists, promoting faster data sharing and the development of automated volumetric analysis techniques. These advancements could significantly benefit clinical trials and improve the care of children with brain tumors.</description>

      <title>Can Generative AI Replace Immunofluorescent Staining Processes? A Comparison Study of Synthetically Generated CellPainting Images from Brightfield</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell imaging assays utilizing fluorescence stains are essential for observing sub-cellular organelles and their responses to perturbations. Immunofluorescent staining process is routinely in labs, however the recent innovations in generative AI is challenging the idea of IF staining are required. This is especially true when the availability and cost of specific fluorescence dyes is a problem to some labs. Furthermore, staining process takes time and leads to inter-intra technician and hinders downstream image and data analysis, and the reusability of image data for other projects. Recent studies showed the use of generated synthetic immunofluorescence (IF) images from brightfield (BF) images using generative AI algorithms in the literature. Therefore, in this study, we benchmark and compare five models from three types of IF generation backbones, CNN, GAN, and diffusion models, using a publicly available dataset. This paper not only serves as a comparative study to determine the best-performing model but also proposes a comprehensive analysis pipeline for evaluating the efficacy of generators in IF image synthesis. We highlighted the potential of deep learning-based generators for IF image synthesis, while also discussed potential issues and future research directions. Although generative AI shows promise in simplifying cell phenotyping using only BF images with IF staining, further research and validations are needed to address the key challenges of model generalisability, batch effects, feature relevance and computational costs.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Self-supervised Learning for Multi-modality MRI Segmentation and Classification: A Novel Approach Avoiding Model Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide complementary information for computer-aided diagnosis. Traditional deep learning algorithms are suitable for identifying specific anatomical structures segmenting lesions and classifying diseases with magnetic resonance images. However, manual labels are limited due to high expense, which hinders further improvement of model accuracy. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can effectively learn feature representations from unlabeled data by pre-training and is demonstrated to be effective in natural image analysis. Most SSL methods ignore the similarity of multi-modality MRI, leading to model collapse. This limits the efficiency of pre-training, causing low accuracy in downstream segmentation and classification tasks. To solve this challenge, we establish and validate a multi-modality MRI masked autoencoder consisting of hybrid mask pattern (HMP) and pyramid barlow twin (PBT) module for SSL on multi-modality MRI analysis. The HMP concatenates three masking steps forcing the SSL to learn the semantic connections of multi-modality images by reconstructing the masking patches. We have proved that the proposed HMP can avoid model collapse. The PBT module exploits the pyramidal hierarchy of the network to construct barlow twin loss between masked and original views, aligning the semantic representations of image patches at different vision scales in latent space. Experiments on BraTS2023, PI-CAI, and lung gas MRI datasets further demonstrate the superiority of our framework over the state-of-the-art. The performance of the segmentation and classification is substantially enhanced, supporting the accurate detection of small lesion areas. The code is available at https://github.com/LinxuanHan/M2-MAE.</description>

Abstract: Microscopy images obtained from multiple camera lenses or sensors in biological experiments provide a comprehensive understanding of objects from diverse perspectives. However, using multiple microscope setups increases the risk of misalignment of identical target features across different modalities, making multimodal image registration crucial. In this work, we build upon previous successes in biological image translation (XAcGAN) and mono-modal image registration (RoTIR) to develop a deep learning model, Dual-Domain RoTIR (DD_RoTIR), specifically designed to address these challenges. While GAN-based translation models are often considered inadequate for multimodal image registration, we enhance registration accuracy by employing a feature-matching algorithm based on Transformers and rotation equivariant networks. Additionally, hierarchical feature matching is utilized to tackle the complexities of multimodal image registration. Our results demonstrate that the DD_RoTIR model exhibits strong applicability and robustness across multiple microscopy image datasets.</description>

      <title>An Explainable Deep Learning-Based Method For Schizophrenia Diagnosis Using Generative Data-Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we leverage a deep learning-based method for the automatic diagnosis of schizophrenia using EEG brain recordings. This approach utilizes generative data augmentation, a powerful technique that enhances the accuracy of the diagnosis. To enable the utilization of time-frequency features, spectrograms were extracted from the raw signals. After exploring several neural network architectural setups, a proper convolutional neural network (CNN) was used for the initial diagnosis. Subsequently, using Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE), two different synthetic datasets were generated in order to augment the initial dataset and address the over-fitting issue. The augmented dataset using VAE achieved a 3.0\% improvement in accuracy reaching up to 99.0\% and yielded a lower loss value as well as a faster convergence. Finally, we addressed the lack of trust in black-box models using the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm to determine the most important superpixels (frequencies) in the diagnosis process.</description>

      <title>ScribblePrompt: Fast and Flexible Interactive Segmentation for Any Biomedical Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07381v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is a crucial part of both scientific research and clinical care. With enough labelled data, deep learning models can be trained to accurately automate specific biomedical image segmentation tasks. However, manually segmenting images to create training data is highly labor intensive and requires domain expertise. We present \emph{ScribblePrompt}, a flexible neural network based interactive segmentation tool for biomedical imaging that enables human annotators to segment previously unseen structures using scribbles, clicks, and bounding boxes. Through rigorous quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that given comparable amounts of interaction, ScribblePrompt produces more accurate segmentations than previous methods on datasets unseen during training. In a user study with domain experts, ScribblePrompt reduced annotation time by 28% while improving Dice by 15% compared to the next best method. ScribblePrompt's success rests on a set of careful design decisions. These include a training strategy that incorporates both a highly diverse set of images and tasks, novel algorithms for simulated user interactions and labels, and a network that enables fast inference. We showcase ScribblePrompt in an interactive demo, provide code, and release a dataset of scribble annotations at https://scribbleprompt.csail.mit.edu</description>

      <title>Binomial Self-compensation for Motion Error in Dynamic 3D Scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase shifting profilometry (PSP) is favored in high-precision 3D scanning due to its high accuracy, robustness, and pixel-wise property. However, a fundamental assumption of PSP that the object should remain static is violated in dynamic measurement, making PSP susceptible to object moving, resulting in ripple-like errors in the point clouds. We propose a pixel-wise and frame-wise loopable binomial self-compensation (BSC) algorithm to effectively and flexibly eliminate motion error in the four-step PSP. Our mathematical model demonstrates that by summing successive motion-affected phase frames weighted by binomial coefficients, motion error exponentially diminishes as the binomial order increases, accomplishing automatic error compensation through the motion-affected phase sequence, without the assistance of any intermediate variable. Extensive experiments show that our BSC outperforms the existing methods in reducing motion error, while achieving a depth map frame rate equal to the camera's acquisition rate (90 fps), enabling high-accuracy 3D reconstruction with a quasi-single-shot frame rate.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Aided Joint Source Channel Coding For High Realism Wireless Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (deep JSCC) has been demonstrated to be an effective approach for wireless image transmission. Nevertheless, most existing work adopts an autoencoder framework to optimize conventional criteria such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) which do not suffice to maintain the perceptual quality of reconstructed images. Such an issue is more prominent under stringent bandwidth constraints or low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To tackle this challenge, we propose DiffJSCC, a novel framework that leverages the prior knowledge of the pre-trained Statble Diffusion model to produce high-realism images via the conditional diffusion denoising process. Our DiffJSCC first extracts multimodal spatial and textual features from the noisy channel symbols in the generation phase. Then, it produces an initial reconstructed image as an intermediate representation to aid robust feature extraction and a stable training process. In the following diffusion step, DiffJSCC uses the derived multimodal features, together with channel state information such as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as conditions to guide the denoising diffusion process, which converts the initial random noise to the final reconstruction. DiffJSCC employs a novel control module to fine-tune the Stable Diffusion model and adjust it to the multimodal conditions. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets reveal that our method significantly surpasses prior deep JSCC approaches on both perceptual metrics and downstream task performance, showcasing its ability to preserve the semantics of the original transmitted images. Notably, DiffJSCC can achieve highly realistic reconstructions for 768x512 pixel Kodak images with only 3072 symbols (&lt;0.008 symbols per pixel) under 1dB SNR channels.</description>

      <title>Occlusion-Aware Seamless Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Panoramic images can broaden the Field of View (FoV), occlusion-aware prediction can deepen the understanding of the scene, and domain adaptation can transfer across viewing domains. In this work, we introduce a novel task, Occlusion-Aware Seamless Segmentation (OASS), which simultaneously tackles all these three challenges. For benchmarking OASS, we establish a new human-annotated dataset for Blending Panoramic Amodal Seamless Segmentation, i.e., BlendPASS. Besides, we propose the first solution UnmaskFormer, aiming at unmasking the narrow FoV, occlusions, and domain gaps all at once. Specifically, UnmaskFormer includes the crucial designs of Unmasking Attention (UA) and Amodal-oriented Mix (AoMix). Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the BlendPASS dataset, reaching a remarkable mAPQ of 26.58% and mIoU of 43.66%. On public panoramic semantic segmentation datasets, i.e., SynPASS and DensePASS, our method outperforms previous methods and obtains 45.34% and 48.08% in mIoU, respectively. The fresh BlendPASS dataset and our source code are available at https://github.com/yihong-97/OASS.</description>

      <title>UP-Diff: Latent Diffusion Model for Remote Sensing Urban Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel Remote Sensing (RS) Urban Prediction (UP) task focused on future urban planning, which aims to forecast urban layouts by utilizing information from existing urban layouts and planned change maps. To address the proposed RS UP task, we propose UP-Diff, which leverages a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to capture positionaware embeddings of pre-change urban layouts and planned change maps. In specific, the trainable cross-attention layers within UP-Diff's iterative diffusion modules enable the model to dynamically highlight crucial regions for targeted modifications. By utilizing our UP-Diff, designers can effectively refine and adjust future urban city plans by making modifications to the change maps in a dynamic and adaptive manner. Compared with conventional RS Change Detection (CD) methods, the proposed UP-Diff for the RS UP task avoids the requirement of paired prechange and post-change images, which enhances the practical usage in city development. Experimental results on LEVIRCD and SYSU-CD datasets show UP-Diff's ability to accurately predict future urban layouts with high fidelity, demonstrating its potential for urban planning. Code and model weights are available at https://github.com/zeyuwang-zju/UP-Diff.</description>

      <title>Rate-Distortion-Cognition Controllable Versatile Neural Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the field of Image Coding for Machines (ICM) has garnered heightened interest and significant advances thanks to the rapid progress of learning-based techniques for image compression and analysis. Previous studies often require training separate codecs to support various bitrate levels, machine tasks, and networks, thus lacking both flexibility and practicality. To address these challenges, we propose a rate-distortion-cognition controllable versatile image compression, which method allows the users to adjust the bitrate (i.e., Rate), image reconstruction quality (i.e., Distortion), and machine task accuracy (i.e., Cognition) with a single neural model, achieving ultra-controllability. Specifically, we first introduce a cognition-oriented loss in the primary compression branch to train a codec for diverse machine tasks. This branch attains variable bitrate by regulating quantization degree through the latent code channels. To further enhance the quality of the reconstructed images, we employ an auxiliary branch to supplement residual information with a scalable bitstream. Ultimately, two branches use a `$\beta x + (1 - \beta) y$' interpolation strategy to achieve a balanced cognition-distortion trade-off. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method yields satisfactory ICM performance and flexible Rate-Distortion-Cognition controlling.</description>
