      <title>A curated UK rain radar data set for training and benchmarking nowcasting models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper documents a data set of UK rain radar image sequences for use in statistical modeling and machine learning methods for nowcasting. The main dataset contains 1,000 randomly sampled sequences of length 20 steps (15-minute increments) of 2D radar intensity fields of dimension 40x40 (at 5km spatial resolution). Spatially stratified sampling ensures spatial homogeneity despite removal of clear-sky cases by threshold-based truncation. For each radar sequence, additional atmospheric and geographic features are made available, including date, location, mean elevation, mean wind direction and speed and prevailing storm type. New R functions to extract data from the binary "Nimrod" radar data format are provided. A case study is presented to train and evaluate a simple convolutional neural network for radar nowcasting, including self-contained R code.</description>

      <title>HiRO-ACE: Fast and skillful AI emulation and downscaling trained on a 3 km global storm-resolving model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kilometer-scale simulations of the atmosphere are an important tool for assessing local weather extremes and climate impacts, but computational expense limits their use to small regions, short periods, and limited ensembles. Machine learning offers a pathway to efficiently emulate these high-resolution simulations. Here we introduce HiRO-ACE, a two-stage AI modeling framework combining a stochastic version of the Ai2 Climate Emulator (ACE2S) with diffusion-based downscaling (HiRO) to generate 3 km precipitation fields over arbitrary regions of the globe. Both components are trained on data derived from a decade of atmospheric simulation by X-SHiELD, a 3 km global storm-resolving model. HiRO performs a 32x downscaling--generating 3 km 6-hourly precipitation from coarse 100 km inputs by training on paired high-resolution and coarsened X-SHiELD outputs. ACE2S is a $1^\circ \times 1^\circ$ ($\sim$100 km) stochastic autoregressive global atmosphere emulator that maintains grid-scale precipitation variability consistent with coarsened X-SHiELD, enabling its outputs to be ingested by HiRO without additional tuning. HiRO-ACE reproduces the distribution of extreme precipitation rates through the 99.99th percentile, with time-mean precipitation biases below 10% almost everywhere. The framework generates plausible tropical cyclones, fronts, and convective events from poorly resolved coarse inputs. Its computational efficiency allows generation of 6-hourly high-resolution regional precipitation for decades of simulated climate within a single day using one H100 GPU, while the probabilistic design enables ensemble generation for quantifying uncertainty. This establishes an AI-enabled pathway for affordably leveraging the realism of expensive km-scale simulations to support local climate adaptation planning and extreme event risk assessment.</description>

      <title>A neural network-based observation operator for weather radar data assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3DVar) for numerical weather prediction (NWP), the observation operator $\mathcal{H}$ plays a central role by mapping model state variables to an observation equivalent. For weather radar, however, specifying $\mathcal{H}$ is particularly challenging: reflectivity is a nonlinear, microphysics-dependent diagnostic quantity that only indirectly relates to the model's prognostic variables, making traditional parameterised radar operators complex, regime-dependent and difficult to tune. In this study, we propose a neural-network (NN)-based observation operator for radar reflectivity and apply it within a 3DVar framework. Using five years (2019-2023) of radar reflectivity data from the Lisca radar and 4.4 km-resolution short-range forecasts from ALADIN model over Slovenia, we train a convolutional encoder-decoder neural network to map model temperature, humidity, horizontal wind components and surface pressure fields to radar reflectivity. Across independent test cases spanning clear-sky, stratiform, and convective regimes, the NN-based operator accurately reproduces the spatial structure and intensity of observed reflectivity, relying primarily on the model state near the observation point. In the extreme precipitation case, which caused widespread floods in Slovenia on August 4, 2023, assimilating the full radar disc reduces the domain-averaged reflectivity root-mean-square error from 5.99 dBZ to 3.47 dBZ and improves the alignment between the analysed and observed convective bands. Embedded within 3DVar, the Jacobian of the NN observation operator allows radar reflectivity observations to inform model state variables, producing corresponding analysis increments. The proposed NN radar observation operator offers a flexible alternative to traditional parameterised radar operators for improving convective-storm forecasts.</description>

      <title>A Toy Model of the Madden-Julian Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a simple three layer model of the tropical atmosphere. The rainfall variance of the model is dominated by a rainfall mode moving parallel to the equator having the approximate size and propagation speed of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). The origin of the convective aggregation in the model is the imposition of distinct length scales for the deep updraft and stratiform downdraft circulations. Subsidence induced by the deep updraft circulation suppresses convective instability on a scale of $\sim$ 1000 km, while ascent induced by the downdraft circulation promotes convective instability on a scale of $\sim$ 500 km. Within the MJO envelope, high rainfall rates are maintained both by increased column relative humidity, and increased variance in lower tropospheric vertical motion. Each of the three model layers has a prescribed target pressure thickness. Convective mass fluxes introduce a mass excess into grid cells where there is net detrainment, and a mass deficit into grid cells from which there is net entrainment. Horizontal transport in the model is based on export of mass from grid cells where there is an excess, and import of mass toward grid cells where there is a deficit. The resulting patterns of horizontal convergence and divergence generate vertical motions between model levels. The simulated MJO events propagate eastward when there is a slight preference for mass deficits in the boundary layer to be compensated by inward flow from the west. The forward propagation of the MJO is limited by the rate at which the downdraft circulation within the MJO is able to generate net upward motion and promote new convective activity in advance of the leading edge. We also offer some guidance on how convective parameterizations that are implemented in models with more realistic dynamical schemes might be designed to exhibit stronger MJO variance.</description>

      <title>Suborbital Characterization of Atmospheric Profiles and Cosmic Radiation over the Mexican Plateau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report suborbital in situ measurements of atmospheric thermodynamic variables and ionizing cosmic radiation obtained during a stratospheric balloon experiment conducted over the Mexican Plateau. The flight reached a maximum geometric altitude of 28.94 km above mean sea level, providing vertical sampling of the troposphere, tropopause, and lower stratosphere. Continuous temperature and pressure measurements acquired during ascent and descent were used to derive vertical profiles and to compute atmospheric density as a function of altitude under the hydrostatic approximation. The resulting thermal structure exhibits distinct lapse-rate regimes, allowing for a piecewise parametrization consistent with the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) within the sampled altitude range.
  Simultaneous measurements of ionizing radiation show the expected altitude dependence of secondary cosmic-ray fluxes generated by atmospheric cascades, including the formation of a Regener-Pfotzer maximum. A peak ambient dose equivalent rate of 2.96 microGy h^{-1} was measured at an altitude of 18.64 km, consistent with mid-latitude stratospheric conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this experiment constitutes the first documented stratospheric balloon mission conducted in the State of Mexico to combine near-space atmospheric profiling with direct in situ measurements of ionizing cosmic radiation at altitudes approaching 30 km.</description>

      <title>Residential structure survivability to large wildfires in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wildfire impacts on US communities have escalated in recent decades, highlighting the need to better understand factors that influence wildfire outcomes. We find that 567,000 homes were exposed to wildfires across the contiguous US during 2001-2020, two-thirds of which occurred and increased five-fold in the Western US. While residential structure survivability - the percent of structures within a wildfire perimeter that survive the fire - remained stable in the Eastern US in the past two decades, it declined by 10% in the West. Survivability was explained by structural age, surrounding fuels, and fire weather. Survivability was 87% for homes built pre-1990 compared to 92% for post-1990 homes in the West. Survivability was lowest in forests compared to grasslands and shrublands. Finally, survivability was markedly lower for fires coincident with extreme fire weather. Our results suggest that modern building codes, fuel management, and proactive planning can strengthen wildfire resilience.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Lightweight Machine Learning for Aviation Visibility Nowcasting Across Multiple Climatic Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short-term prediction (nowcasting) of low-visibility and precipitation events is critical for aviation safety and operational efficiency. Current operational approaches rely on computationally intensive numerical weather prediction guidance and human-issued TAF products, which often exhibit conservative biases and limited temporal resolution. This study presents a lightweight gradient boosting framework (XGBoost) trained exclusively on surface observation data (METAR) and enhanced through physics-guided feature engineering based on thermodynamic principles. The framework is evaluated across 11 international airports representing distinct climatic regimes (including SCEL, KJFK, KORD, KDEN, SBGR, and VIDP) using historical data from 2000 to 2024. Results suggest that the model successfully captures underlying local physical processes without manual configuration. In a blind comparative evaluation against operational TAF forecasts, the automated model achieved substantially higher detection rates at tactical horizons (3 hours), with a 2.5 to 4.0 times improvement in recall while reducing false alarms. Furthermore, SHAP analysis reveals that the model performs an implicit reconstruction of local physical drivers (advection, radiation, and subsidence), providing actionable explainability for operational situational awareness.

      <title>An energetically and thermodynamically consistent Boussinesq model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Boussinesq approximation is a cornerstone of geophysical fluid dynamics, yet its thermodynamic and energetic underpinnings have remained ambiguous. In standard formulations, the links with the fully compressible Navier--Stokes equations are obscured, internal energy is only implicit, and the representation of diffusion and irreversibility remains \textit{ad hoc}. Here we derive a new Boussinesq model in a fully traceable way from the two-component compressible Navier-Stokes equations, ensuring exact energy conservation and consistent thermodynamics. Assuming a linear equation of state, our model treats density as a proxy for specific volume, distinguishes in-situ and potential temperature explicitly, and incorporates diffusive fluxes that homogenise the correct thermodynamic potentials, ensuring consistent non-negative entropy production. The result clarifies the status of gravitational potential energy, resolves ambiguities surrounding salinity--entropy coupling, and retains the small terms carriers of key information about thermodynamics. Alongside this, we introduce an exact thermodynamically soundproof (TS) model whose weak diabatic divergence highlights the role of compressibility effects in stratified turbulence. Together, these models provide a transparent framework that reconciles classical approximations with compressible energetics, offering better-defined pathways for analysing stratified mixing, mixing efficiency, and the energy budgets of geophysical flows.</description>

      <title>Controllable Probabilistic Forecasting with Stochastic Decomposition Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI weather prediction ensembles with latent noise injection and optimized with the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) have produced both accurate and well-calibrated predictions with far less computational cost compared with diffusion-based methods. However, current CRPS ensemble approaches vary in their training strategies and noise injection mechanisms, with most injecting noise globally throughout the network via conditional normalization. This structure increases training expense and limits the physical interpretability of the stochastic perturbations. We introduce Stochastic Decomposition Layers (SDL) for converting deterministic machine learning weather models into probabilistic ensemble systems. Adapted from StyleGAN's hierarchical noise injection, SDL applies learned perturbations at three decoder scales through latent-driven modulation, per-pixel noise, and channel scaling. When applied to WXFormer via transfer learning, SDL requires less than 2\% of the computational cost needed to train the baseline model. Each ensemble member is generated from a compact latent tensor (5 MB), enabling perfect reproducibility and post-inference spread adjustment through latent rescaling. Evaluation on 2022 ERA5 reanalysis shows ensembles with spread-skill ratios approaching unity and rank histograms that progressively flatten toward uniformity through medium-range forecasts, achieving calibration competitive with operational IFS-ENS. Multi-scale experiments reveal hierarchical uncertainty: coarse layers modulate synoptic patterns while fine layers control mesoscale variability. The explicit latent parameterization provides interpretable uncertainty quantification for operational forecasting and climate applications.</description>

      <title>Nowcast3D: Reliable precipitation nowcasting via gray-box learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme-precipitation nowcasting requires high spatial and temporal resolution together with extended lead times, yet current approaches remain constrained. Numerical weather prediction systems and their deep-learning emulators operate at relatively coarse space-time resolution and struggle to capture rapidly evolving convective systems. Radar extrapolation methods, which advect recent fields using estimated motion, have difficulty capturing the complex evolution of precipitation. Purely data-driven models often produce overly smoothed reflectivity fields and underestimate intensity. Hybrid 2D radar-based methods discard crucial vertical information, preventing accurate reconstruction of height-dependent dynamics. We introduce Nowcast3D, a gray-box, fully three-dimensional nowcasting framework that operates directly on volumetric radar reflectivity and couples physically constrained neural operators with data-driven learning. The model learns three fields that govern reflectivity evolution: a three-dimensional flow field for advective transport, a spatially varying diffusion field for local dispersive spreading, and a residual source term for unresolved microphysical effects. These learned operators advance the forecast in time under explicit physical constraints, while a conditional diffusion model, conditioned on both the observations and the physics-based forecast, generates ensembles of future radar volumes that quantify forecast uncertainty. In a blind evaluation by 160 meteorologists, Nowcast3D is preferred in 57% of post-hoc and 51% of prior assessments. By explicitly embedding three-dimensional dynamics and uncertainty into a single framework, Nowcast3D offers a scalable and robust approach for reliable nowcasting of extreme precipitation.</description>
