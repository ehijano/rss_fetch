      <title>Spin refinement of moduli spaces of residueless meromorphic differentials and the BKP hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider strata of curves carrying a residueless meromorphic differential inducing a spin structure on the curve. The cohomology classes of the closures of these strata, weighted by the parity of the spin structures, form a partial cohomological field theory (CohFT) of infinite rank. After applying the DR hierarchy construction to this partial CohFT and reducing to differentials with two zeros and arbitrarily many poles, we show that the resulting system of evolutionary PDEs coincides with the BKP hierarchy up to a coordinate transformation. This is a spin refinement of an analogous result from arXiv:2110.01419. Our proof relies on a new result regarding the reconstruction of the BKP hierarchy from a limited amount of information in the Lax formalism.</description>

      <title>Unramified Brauer groups of homogeneous spaces with finite stabilisers and the Grunwald Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an algorithm for calculating the unramified Brauer group of a homogeneous space $X$ of a semi-simple simply connected group $H$ with finite geometric stabiliser over any field of characteristic 0. When $k$ is a number field, we use the obtained description of the unramified Brauer group in order to study the Brauer-Manin obstruction to weak approximation on $X$. In particular, we provide an algorithm to compute the Brauer-Manin obstruction on $X$, which guarantees effectivity of the Grunwald problem for supersolvable groups thanks to previous work of Harpaz and Wittenberg.</description>

      <title>Some computational aspects of spectral sequences in \v{C}ech cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sheaf cohomology or, more generally, higher direct images of coherent sheaves along proper morphisms are central to modern algebraic geometry. However, the computation of these objects is a non-trivial and expensive task which easily challenges the capacities of modern computers. We describe an algorithm and its implementation to compute a spectral sequence converging to the higher direct images of a bounded complex of sheaves on a product of projective spaces $\mathbb P = \mathbb P^{r_1}\times \dots \times \mathbb P^{r_m}$ over an arbitrary affine base $\mathrm{Spec} R$. We assume the ring $R$ to be computable and the complex of sheaves to be represented by an actual complex of (multi-)graded modules.</description>

      <title>Toroidal embedding of Chevalley groups over $\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of equivariant toroidal embeddings of a reductive group over an algebraically closed field is combinatorial and does not depend on the characteristic of the base field. This suggests that there should exist ``universal'' toroidal embeddings for a Chevalley group scheme over $\mathbb{Z}$ which specialize to classical toroidal embeddings via base change. In this paper, we establish the existence of ``universal'' equivariant toroidal embeddings for split reductive group schemes over $\mathbb{Z}$. We also discuss several geometric properties of these embeddings.</description>

      <title>BPS polynomials and Welschinger invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize Block-G\"ottsche polynomials, originally defined for toric del Pezzo surfaces, to arbitrary surfaces. To do this, we show that these polynomials arise as special cases of BPS polynomials, defined for any surface $S$ as Laurent polynomials in a formal variable $q$ encoding the BPS invariants of the $3$-fold $S \times \mathbb{P}^1$. We conjecture that for surfaces $S_n$ obtained by blowing up $\mathbb{P}^2$ at $n$ general points, the evaluation of BPS polynomials at $q=-1$ yields Welschinger invariants, given by signed counts of real rational curves. We prove this conjecture for all surfaces $S_n$ with $n \leq 6$.</description>

      <title>Prym varieties and projective structures on Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an \'etale double covering $\pi\, :\, \widetilde{C}\, \longrightarrow\, C$ of compact Riemannsurfaces with $C$ of genus at least two, we use the Prym variety of the cover to construct canonical projective structures on both $\widetilde C$ and $C$. This construction can be interpreted as a section of an affine bundle over the moduli space of \'etale double covers. The $\overline{\partial}$--derivative of this section is a (1,1)--form on the moduli space. We compute this derivative in terms of Thetanullwert maps. Using the Schottky--Jung identities we show that, in general, the projective structure on $C$ depends on the cover.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We approximately compute the correspondence degree (as defined by Lazarsfeld and Martin) between two unbalanced complete intersections. This is accomplished by showing that the procedure of taking a subvariety of a product $Y \times Y'$ and intersecting it with $X \times Y'$ (for $X$ a sufficiently ample smooth divisor in $Y$) induces a bijection between two sets of varieties. This may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The geometry of Frobenius on toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a geometric description of the positivity of the Frobenius-trace kernel on a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial projective toric variety. To do so, we define its Frobenius support as well as the notions of $F$-effectiveness for divisors and $1$-cycles. As it turns out, the interaction of the corresponding cone of $F$-effective curves with the Mori cone of curves reflects the type of extremal Mori contractions that the variety can undergo. As a corollary, we obtain that the Frobenius-trace kernel is ample if and only if the Picard rank is $1$.</description>

      <title>Lefschetz morphisms on singular cohomology and local cohomological dimension of toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a proper toric variety and a line bundle on it, we describe the morphism on singular cohomology given by the cup product with the Chern class of that line bundle in terms of the data of the associated fan. Using that, we relate the local cohomological dimension of an affine toric variety with the Lefschetz morphism on the singular cohomology of a projective toric variety of one dimension lower. As a corollary, we show that the local cohomological defect is not a combinatorial invariant. We also produce numerous examples of toric varieties in every dimension with any possible local cohomological defect, by showing that the local cohomological defect remains unchanged under taking a pyramid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe cohomological conditions that are necessary and sufficient for the existence of balanced dualizing dg-modules, generalizing a theorem of Van den Bergh for balanced dualizing complexes over graded algebras. As a consequence, we show that a dg-algebra satisfying certain finiteness conditions admits a balanced dualizing dg-module if and only if its zeroth cohomology algebra admits a balanced dualizing complex. Additionally, we obtain a host of new examples of dg-algebras whose associated noncommutative spaces satisfy Serre duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct explicit Eichler-Shimura morphisms for families of overconvergent Siegel modular forms of genus two. These can be viewed as $p$-adic interpolations of the Eichler-Shimura decomposition of Faltings-Chai for classical Siegel modular forms. In particular, we are able to $p$-adically interpolate the entire decomposition, extending our previous work on the $H^0$-part. The key new inputs are the higher Coleman theory of Boxer-Pilloni and a theory of pro-Kummer \'etale cohomology with supports.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Jacobians via the KP equation and via flexes and degenerate trisecants to the Kummer variety: an algebro-geometric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.14324v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is withdrawn since we found a flaw in the proof of Theorem 4, asserting that the base locus of the complete linear system of an ample line bundle on a complex abelian variety is reduced. The error is in page 7, line $ -14$, where we claim that the divisor "mathcal E" on the variety $X$ is linearly equivalent to zero. This is untrue. For instance, it would imply that, for a non-torsion point $x$ on an abelian surface $A$, letting $E_x$, $E_{-x}$, and $E_0$ the exceptional curves in the blow up of $A$ at $x$, $-x$, and $0$, then $2E_0$ is linearly equivalent to $E_x +E_{-x}$, which is easily seen to be false. Therefore Theorem 4 of our paper has to be considered unproven. We still believe that it holds true. All the other arguments of our paper are correct but unfortunately they depend on the above mentioned Theorem 4. To be precise, from Theorem 4 follows Theorem 3, asserting that the scheme $\Sigma(X,\Theta, G)$ of Definition 9 is reduced. The rest of the paper contains algebro-geometric proofs of Shiota's theorem characterizing Jacobians via the KP equation (Section 4), and of Krichever's theorems characterizing Jacobians by the existence of an inflectionary or degenerate trisecant to the Kummer variety embedded in $\mathbb P^{2^g-1}$ (Theorem 18 and Theorem 25). Also these proofs are correct but they depend on a weaker version of Theorem 3, namely on the assertion that the components of codimension two of the scheme $\Sigma(X,\Theta, G)$ are generically reduced. In turn, this weaker version of Theorem 3 would follow, by the same argument used in its proof, from a conjecture by Debarre asserting that the base locus of the complete linear system of an ample line bundle on an abelian variety is generically reduced in codimension two.</description>

      <title>On the intersection cohomology of the moduli of $\mathrm{SL}_n$-Higgs bundles on a curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.01285v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the cohomological structure for the (possibly singular) moduli of $\mathrm{SL}_n$-Higgs bundles for arbitrary degree on a genus g curve with respect to an effective divisor of degree &gt;2g-2. We prove a support theorem for the $\mathrm{SL}_n$-Hitchin fibration extending de Cataldo's support theorem in the nonsingular case, and a version of the Hausel-Thaddeus topological mirror symmetry conjecture for intersection cohomology. This implies a generalization of the Harder-Narasimhan theorem concerning semistable vector bundles for any degree.
  Our main tool is an Ng\^{o}-type support inequality established recently which works for possibly singular ambient spaces and intersection cohomology complexes.</description>

Abstract: We prove a blow-up formula for the generating series of virtual $\chi_y$-genera for moduli spaces of sheaves on projective surfaces, which is related to a conjectured formula for topological $\chi_y$-genera of G\"ottsche. Our formula is a refinement of one by Vafa-Witten relating to S-duality. We prove the formula simultaneously in the setting of Gieseker stable sheaves on polarised surfaces and also in the setting of framed sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^2$. The proof is based on the blow-up algorithm of Nakajima-Yoshioka for framed sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^2$, which has recently been extend to the setting of Gieseker $H$-stable sheaves on $H$-polarised surfaces by Kuhn-Tanaka.</description>

      <title>An equivariant compactification for adjoint reductive group schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01715v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wonderful compactifications of adjoint reductive groups over an algebraically closed field play an important role in algebraic geometry and representation theory. In this paper, we construct an equivariant compactification for adjoint reductive groups over arbitrary base schemes. Our compactifications parameterize classical wonderful compactifications of De Concini and Procesi as geometric fibers. Our construction is based on a variant of the Artin-Weil method of birational group laws. In particular, our construction gives a new intrinsic construction of wonderful compactifications. The Picard group scheme of our compactifications is computed. We also discuss several applications of our compactification in the study of torsors under reductive group schemes.</description>

      <title>Higher Gaussian maps on the hyperelliptic locus and second fundamental form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study higher even Gaussian maps of the canonical bundle on hyperelliptic curves and we determine their rank, giving explicit descriptions of their kernels. Then we use this descriptions to investigate the hyperelliptic Torelli map $j_h$ and its second fundamental form. We study isotropic subspaces of the tangent space $T_{{\mathcal H}_g, [C]}$ to the moduli space ${\mathcal H}_g$ of hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ at a point $[C]$, with respect to the second fundamental form $\rho_{HE}$ of $j_h$. In particular, for any Weierstrass point $p \in C$, we construct a subspace $V_p$ of dimension $\lfloor\frac{g}{2} \rfloor$ of $T_{{\mathcal H}_g, [C]}$ generated by higher Schiffer variations at $p$, such that the only isotropic tangent direction $\zeta \in V_p$ for the image of $\rho_{HE}$ is the standard Schiffer variation $\xi_p$ at the Weierstrass point $p \in C$.</description>

      <title>Twists of intermediate Jacobian fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the sections, Tate--Shafarevich twists, and the period for an OG10 hyperk\"ahler Lagrangian associated to a cubic fourfold. To do so, we introduce the analytic relative Jacobian sheaf for a Lagrangian fibration of a hyperk\"ahler variety. The Tate--Shafarevich group parameterizing twists is isomorphic to the first cohomology group of this sheaf and we compute it in terms of certain analytic Brauer groups associated to the cubic fourfold. We prove that the primitive Hodge lattice of the cubic fourfold is, up to a sign, isometric to a distinguished sublattice of the second cohomology group of the associated OG10 hyperk\"ahler manifold. Among the main tools we use are intersection complexes with integral coefficients, Decomposition Theorem, Hodge modules and Deligne cohomology.</description>

      <title>Cluster algebras and quantum cohomology rings: A-type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a cluster algebra structure within the quantum cohomology ring of a quiver variety associated with an $A$-type quiver. Specifically, let $Fl:=Fl(N_1,\ldots,N_{n+1})$ denote a partial flag variety of length $n$, and $QH_S^*(Fl)[t]:=QH_S^*(Fl)\otimes \mathbb C[t]$ be its equivariant quantum cohomology ring extended by a formal variable $t$, regarded as a $\mathbb Q$-algebra. We establish an injective $\mathbb Q$-algebra homomorphism from the $A_n$-type cluster algebra to the algebra $QH_S^*(Fl)[t]$. Furthermore, for a general quiver with potential, we propose a framework for constructing a homomorphism from the associated cluster algebra to the quantum cohomology ring of the corresponding quiver variety.
  The second main result addresses the conjecture of all-genus Seiberg duality for $A_n$-type quivers. For any quiver with potential mutation-equivalent to an $A_n$-type quiver, we consider the associated variety defined as the critical locus of the potential function. We prove that all-genus Gromov-Witten invariants of such a variety coincide with those of the flag variety.</description>

      <title>$PSL_2$ tropicalization and lines on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper is based on a talk given by the first author at the G\"okova Geometry \&amp; Topology conference in May 2024. The subject is an interplay between the ideas of tropical geometry and two-by-two matrices with an intention to explore new types of geometries. More concretely, the article gives a preliminary account for a non-abelian version of phase tropicalization for subvarieties of $PSL_2.$</description>

      <title>Cohomological VC-density: Bounds and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) density is pivotal across various mathematical fields, including discrete geometry, probability theory and model theory. In this paper, we introduce a topological generalization of VC-density. Let $Y$ be a topological space and $\mathcal{X}$ a family of closed subspaces of $Y$. For each $p \geq 0$, we define a number, $\mathrm{vcd}^{p}_{\mathcal{X}}$, which we refer to as the degree $p$ VC-density of the family $\mathcal{X}$. The classical notion of VC-density within this topological framework can be recovered by setting $p=0$.
  Our definition of degree $p$ VC-density extends to higher orders as well. For $p \geq 0$, $q \geq 1$, we define the degree $p$, order $q$ VC density $\mathrm{vcd}^{p,q}_{\mathcal{X}}$ of $\mathcal{X}$, which recovers Shelah's notion of higher order VC-density for $q$-dependent families when $p=0$. Our definition introduces a completely new notion when $p &gt; 0$.
  We examine the properties of $\mathrm{vcd}_{\mathcal{X}}^p$ (as well as $\mathrm{vcd}^{p,q}_{\mathcal{X}}$) when the families $\mathcal{X}$ are definable in structures with some underlying topology (for instance, the Euclidean topology for o-minimal structures over $\mathbb{R}$, the analytic topology over $\mathbb{C}$, or the \'{e}tale site for schemes over arbitrary algebraically closed fields). Our main result establishes that in any model of these theories
  \[ \mathrm{vcd}_{\mathcal{X}}^p \leq (p+1) \dim X, \] and more generally for any $q \geq 1$ \[ \mathrm{vcd}^{p,q}_{\mathcal{X}} \leq (p+q) \dim X. \] We give examples to show that our bounds are optimal. We also present combinatorial applications of our higher-degree VC-density bounds, deriving higher degree topological analogs of well-known results such as the existence of $\varepsilon$-nets and the fractional Helly theorem.</description>
