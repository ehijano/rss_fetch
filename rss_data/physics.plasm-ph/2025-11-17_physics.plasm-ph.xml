      <title>Bremsstrahlung constraints on proton-Boron 11 inertial fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton-Boron 11 (pB11) fusion is relatively safe and clean, but difficult to use for net power production, since bremsstrahlung radiation tends to radiate away power more quickly than it can be generated by fusion power, particularly once poisoning by alpha particles is taken into account. While in magnetic confinement fusion (MCF), this problem can be addressed by deconfining the alphas, in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) the alphas that heat the plasma linger for the duration of the reaction. Thus, it becomes essential to trap the bremsstrahlung radiation in the hotspot. Through burn simulations incorporating bremsstrahlung emission and reabsorption, we infer the necessary conditions to capture enough radiation to produce scientific breakeven in a pB11 ICF plasma. We find that breakeven requires a stagnation areal density roughly two orders of magnitude higher than the current state-of-the-art, at pressures three orders of magnitude higher.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of Methane Diluted with Inert Gas in an RF Discharge Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decomposition of methane using non-thermal plasmas is an attractive route for producing hydrogen-rich gases and valuable carbon nanomaterials. Understanding how plasma discharge modes influence methane decomposition in optimizing plasma-assisted chemical conversion remains unexplored. This study explores the coupling between the discharge structure and product selectivity in RF capacitively coupled discharges operating in methane/inert gas mixtures in the pressure range of 2 to 3 torr. The discharge exhibits mode transitions from uniform to striated in Ar and Kr and from diffuse to contracted in Ar and Kr with 5 percent or less CH4. The discharges in He and Ne remained uniform under our operating conditions, and their mixtures with CH4 remained diffuse. A 0-D model for Ar/CH4 discharge established a threshold for contraction while also asserting the importance of Ar metastable in the dissociation and ionization processes. The highest degree of methane decomposition, 99.7% with the main products of acetylene and graphitized solid carbon was achieved in the contracted discharge mode for both Kr or Ar with 5% or less CH4. We demonstrate that contraction can play a crucial role in the effective decomposition of methane with value-added products and that both the electronic and thermal properties of plasma gas are responsible for this effect.</description>

      <title>Studies of laser stimulated photodetachment from nanoparticles for particle charge measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining nanoparticle charge is more challenging than that for microparticles due to growth-induced size changes, substantial plasma property variations, and difficulties in visualizing individual particles, rendering conventional microparticle charge diagnostics ineffective in dusty plasma. In this work, we utilized laser-stimulated photodetachment (LSPD) to deduce the mean charge of nanoparticles. Nanoparticles were grown in an Ara and C2H2 mixture using a capacitively coupled RF discharge and the LSPD induced changes in the electron current monitored by a cylindrical Langmuir probe. LSPD signals were obtained and analyzed across different dust growth phases. The prolonged decay of electron current pulses was attributed to the presence of residual negative ions, caused by the effective electrostatic trapping of these ions and the potential post - LSPD re-formation of new ones. The charge per particle was estimated using known values of particle density obtained by laser-light extinction method. For particles with mean diameter Dp ~ 154.3 nm, the charge found to be of Qd~16 elementary charge units. The charge values appear to be lower than the values predicted by orbital motion limited (OML) theory. This deviation is commonly observed in nanodusty plasmas due to significant electron depletion. LSPD results in Ar and C2H2 nano-dusty plasma confirm the applicability of these method for estimating individual nanoparticle charges. However, it has also been demonstrated that electron detachment from residual background negative ions can influence the detachment current decay and must be carefully considered</description>

      <title>Optimization of Argon Plasma Working Pressure through Parallel PIC Simulations for Enhancement of Material Surface Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, a novel method for simulating plasma dynamics using parallel programming has been developed. The equations based on Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method were utilized and adapted for this purpose. We utilized 35 processors from Sharif High Performance Computing (HPC) center and divided the plasma volume into 35 parts, with each part's PIC equation solved on a separate processor. Once the computations were completed, the results from all processors were combined to form a complete plasma volume. The simulations revealed that there is an optimal pressure for argon, at which the ion flux onto the electrode surface is maximized. Increasing the absolute value of the electrode potential also increases this flux. Therefore, for a given potential, selecting the optimal pressure is crucial for the most effective surface modification using argon plasma. In this work, for applied voltage of -500 V, the optimum pressure was 100 mTorr.</description>

      <title>Extending the Numerical Flow Iteration to the multi-species Vlasov-Maxwell system through Hamiltonian Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Numerical Flow Iteration (NuFI) method has recently been proposed as a memory-slim solution method for the Vlasov--Poisson system. It stores the temporal evolution of the electric field, instead of the distribution functions, and reconstructs the solution in each time step by following the characteristics backwards in time and reconstructing the solution from the initial distribution. NuFI has been shown to be more accurate than other state-of-the-art Vlasov solvers given the same amount of degrees of freedom as well as interpolation order, essentially making NuFI a high-fidelity but low-memory cost scheme. In this paper, we build on the Hamiltonian structure of the full Vlasov--Maxwell system to extend NuFI to handle electro-magnetic kinetic plasma dynamics. We show that the advanced structure-preserving properties of NuFI are preserved when extending to the electro-magnetic case.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Stimulated Brillouin Scattering Driven by Broadband Lasers in High-Z Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) driven by broadband lasers in high-Z plasmas is investigated using one-dimensional collisional particle-in-cell simulations. The temporal incoherence of broadband lasers modulates the pump intensity, generating stochastic intensity pulses that intermittently drive SBS. The shortened coherence time weakens the three-wave coupling and continuously reduces the temporal growth rate, while the saturated reflectivity remains nearly unchanged until the bandwidth exceeds a critical threshold. Simulations with varying laser intensities and bandwidths reveal a consistent scaling behavior, indicating that effective suppression occurs only when the laser bandwidth exceeds the temporal growth rate of SBS by several tens of times. Comparative simulations in Au and AuB plasmas exhibit similar suppression trends, with AuB showing reduced SBS growth rate and reflectivity, and the onset of suppression occurring at a lower bandwidth. These findings elucidate the coupled dependence of SBS mitigation on bandwidth and laser intensity in high-Z plasmas, offering useful guidance for optimizing broadband laser designs in inertial confinement fusion.</description>

      <title>In situ Evidence of 5-minute Oscillations from Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sun's surface vibrates in characteristic 5-minute oscillations, known as p-modes, generated by sound waves trapped within the convection zone. Although these oscillations have long been hypothesized to reach into the solar wind, direct in situ evidence has remained elusive, even during previous close encounters by Parker Solar Probe (PSP). Here, we present the first promising in situ detection of 5-minute oscillations in the upper solar corona, based on observations from PSP's three closest perihelia. In two events at 9.9 solar radii, we identify statistically significant ($\sim$ 6 $\sigma$) 3.1-3.2 mHz peaks in the magnetic field power spectrum, each appearing as a large-amplitude, spherically polarized Alfv\'enic wave train lasting approximately 35 minutes. These results demonstrate that global solar oscillations can reach and potentially influence the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Van-der-Waals exchange-correlation functionals and their high pressure and warm dense matter applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate basic hydrogen quantities like the molecular bond length, the molecular dissociation energy and the van-der-Waals interaction in idealized situations in an effort to discern a suitable exchange-correlation functional for the molecular to metal transition in warm dense hydrogen. The best reproduction of bond length and dissociation energy is given by the r2SCAN functional, several vdW functionals and also HSE06 fair qualitatively and quantitatively no better than PBE or worse. In addition we investigate quantities like the static and dynamic ion structure factor, and the electronic DOS to determine differences between exchange-correlation functionals with and without van-der-Waals corrections in the transition region from the molecular to the metallic regime of hydrogen.</description>

      <title>Coherent synchrotron radiation by excitation of surface plasmon polariton on near-critical solid microtube surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) is crucial for the development of powerful ultrashort light sources. We present a mechanism for generating CSR in the form of generalised superradiance, based on surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), which are resonantly excited on a solid, near-critical-density inner surface of a microtube. A high-intensity, circularly polarised laser pulse, propagating along the microtube axis, efficiently couples the cylindrical SPP modes. This process creates azimuthally structured, rotating electromagnetic fields. These rotating fields subsequently confine, modulate, and directly accelerate surface electrons to emit CSR in the Vavilov-Cherenkov angle. We further demonstrate that by improving the azimuthal symmetry of these electrons, the helical modulation enables CSR emission across all azimuthal directions in the form of isolated harmonics, significantly enhancing radiation intensity even when full coherence is imperfect. Our full 3D Particle-in-Cell simulations indicate this scheme can generate X-rays with coherence enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude compared to incoherent emission. The challenges to experimentally realise this scheme are discussed, including the need for high-contrast lasers to prevent pre-plasma formation and the demanding tolerances for microtube fabrication and alignment, while these challenges are not beyond the scope of existing or near-future experimental capabilities.</description>

      <title>Multi-Machine Scaling Laws for Fuel and Impurity Puffing Rates Sufficient for Detachment Access: a Systematic Review of Magnetic Confinement Fusion Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20523v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An open-source database of 457 experimental and numerical entries representing 32 machines$-$including tokamaks, stellarators, and linear plasma devices$-$is assembled. From this dataset, we derive multi-machine scaling laws that predict the fuel and impurity puffing rates sufficient to edge plasma detachment$-$the leading reactor-relevant solution to the challenge of plasma-wall interaction. Validation against up to 40 L- and H-mode plasmas shows agreement within a factor of 1.5 in about 50\% of cases, and within a factor of 2 on average. Divertor volume alone is found to strongly correlate with the fuelling rate. Inclusion of plasma opaqueness leads to $\Gamma_{\text{D}} \propto [n_{\text{sep}}\, a\, (S_{\text{div}}/V_{\text{div}})^{-1.5}]^{1.05}$, valid across all toroidal devices. Its H-mode simplification, $\Gamma_{\text{D}}^{\text{HDL}} \propto 0.43\, a^{1.58}\, \lambda_q^{-0.89}$, avoids explicit dependence on $n_{\text{sep}}$ and carries intrinsic physical meaning through the H/L density limit and the power fall-off length. The impurity seeding rate is captured by a general non-linear law, from which the Greenwald-Eich-Scarabosio simplification, $\Gamma_{\text{Z}}^{\text{GES}} \propto a^{1.51}\, \lambda_q^{-0.27}$, is obtained. Similar relationships are defined for stellarators, consistent with tokamak trends but still awaiting validation$-$an opportunity for further study. These results have immediate relevance for reactor fuel-cycle design and edge plasma modelling. More broadly, they demonstrate that physics-based 0D laws can reliably link detachment access to engineering actuators, offering practical tools for reactor design. Our laws represent macroscopic patterns across machines rather than microscopic variations within an individual device$-$providing the basis for our forthcoming studies aimed at extending this framework to machine-specific behaviour.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Algorithm for Nonlinear Electromagnetic Fluid Dynamics via Koopman-von Neumann Linearization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To simulate plasma phenomena, large-scale computational resources have been employed in developing high-precision and high-resolution plasma simulations. One of the main obstacles in plasma simulations is the requirement of computational resources that scale polynomially with the number of spatial grids, which poses a significant challenge for large-scale modeling. To address this issue, this study presents a quantum algorithm for simulating the nonlinear electromagnetic fluid dynamics that govern space plasmas. We map it, by applying Koopman-von Neumann linearization, to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and evolve the system using Hamiltonian simulation via quantum singular value transformation. Our algorithm scales $O \left(s N_x \, \mathrm{polylog} \left( N_x \right) T \right)$ in time complexity with $s$, $N_x$, and $T$ being the spatial dimension, the number of spatial grid points per dimension, and the evolution time, respectively. Comparing the scaling $O \left( s N_x^s \left(T^{5/4}+T N_x\right) \right)$ for the classical method with the finite volume scheme, this algorithm achieves polynomial speedup in $N_x$. The space complexity of this algorithm is exponentially reduced from $O\left( s N_x^s \right)$ to $O\left( s \, \mathrm{polylog} \left( N_x \right) \right)$. Numerical experiments validate that accurate solutions are attainable with smaller $m$ than theoretically anticipated and with practical values of $m$ and $R$, underscoring the feasibility of the approach. As a practical demonstration, the method accurately reproduces the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, underscoring its capability to tackle more intricate nonlinear dynamics. These results suggest that quantum computing can offer a viable pathway to overcome the computational barriers of multiscale plasma modeling.</description>
