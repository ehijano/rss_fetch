      <title>Ideally regular categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we propose a generalisation of G. Janelidze's notion of an ideally exact category beyond the Barr exact setting. We define an ideally regular category as a regular, Bourn protomodular category with finite coproducts in which the unique morphism 0 -&gt; 1 is effective for descent. As in the ideally exact case, ideally regular categories support a notion of ideal that classifies regular quotients. Moreover, they admit a characterisation in terms of monadicity over a homological category (rather than a semi-abelian one, as in the exact setting). Examples include Bourn protomodular quasivarieties of universal algebra in which 0 -&gt; 1 is effective for descent (such as the category of torsion-free unital rings), all Bourn protomodular topological varieties with at least one constant (such as topological rings), and all semi-localisations of ideally exact categories.</description>

      <title>The Lawvere condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The original Lawvere condition asserts that every reflexive graph admits a unique natural structure of internal groupoid. This property was identified by P. T. Johnstone, following a question by A. Carboni and a suggestion by F. W. Lawvere, and it plays a central role in the characterization of naturally Mal'tsev categories. A broad and conceptually rich generalization emerges when the condition is formulated relative to a chosen class of spans. In this setting, the familiar Mal'tsev situation is recovered when the class consists of internal relations (that is, jointly monic spans) in which case the condition states that every internal reflexive relation is an equivalence relation. The purpose of this paper is to establish a comprehensive equivalence theorem that unifies the various categorical and diagrammatic formulations of the relative Lawvere condition. Furthermore, this formulation retains its significance even beyond the context of categories with finite limits, extending, for example, to categories admitting pullbacks of split epimorphisms along split epimorphisms. In addition to providing a fresh perspective on previously established results, we present a new characterization involving Janelidze-Pedicchio pseudogroupoids.</description>

      <title>Categorical Framework for Quantum-Resistant Zero-Trust AI Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid deployment of AI models necessitates robust, quantum-resistant security, particularly against adversarial threats. Here, we present a novel integration of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and zero trust architecture (ZTA), formally grounded in category theory, to secure AI model access. Our framework uniquely models cryptographic workflows as morphisms and trust policies as functors, enabling fine-grained, adaptive trust and micro-segmentation for lattice-based PQC primitives. This approach offers enhanced protection against adversarial AI threats. We demonstrate its efficacy through a concrete ESP32-based implementation, validating a crypto-agile transition with quantifiable performance and security improvements, underpinned by categorical proofs for AI security. The implementation achieves significant memory efficiency on ESP32, with the agent utilizing 91.86% and the broker 97.88% of free heap after cryptographic operations, and successfully rejects 100% of unauthorized access attempts with sub-millisecond average latency.</description>

      <title>Denotational semantics for stabiliser quantum programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stabiliser fragment of quantum theory is a foundational building block for quantum error correction and the fault-tolerant compilation of quantum programs. In this article, we develop a sound, universal and complete denotational semantics for stabiliser operations which include measurement, classically-controlled Pauli operators, and affine classical operations, in which quantum error-correcting codes are first-class objects. The operations are interpreted as certain affine relations over finite fields. This offers a conceptually motivated and computationally-tractable alternative to the standard operator-algebraic semantics of quantum programs (whose time complexity grows exponentially as the state space increases in size). We demonstrate the power of the resulting semantics by describing a small, proof-of-concept assembly language for stabiliser programs with fully-abstract denotational semantics.</description>

      <title>Homological lemmas for (non-abelian) group-like structures by diagram chasing in a self-dual context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11769v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through abelian categories, homological lemmas for modules admit a self-dual treatment, where half of the proof of a lemma is sufficient to prove the full lemma. In this paper, we show how the context of a `noetherian form', recently introduced by the second and third authors, allows a self-dual treatment of these lemmas even in the case of non-abelian categories of group-like structures. This context covers a wide range of examples: module categories, the category of groups, of graded abelian groups, the categories of Lie algebras, of cocommutative Hopf algebras, the category of Heyting semilattices, of loops, the dual of the category of pointed sets, the category of modular/distributive lattices and modular connections, the category of sets and partial bijections, and many others. More generally, it includes all semi-abelian and Grandis exact categories.</description>

      <title>All Segal objects are generalised monads in spans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend Barwick's and Haugseng's construction of the double $\infty$-category of spans in a pullback-complete $\infty$-category $\mathfrak{C}$ to more general shapes: for a large class of algebraic patterns $\mathfrak{P}$, we define a $\mathfrak{P}$-monoidal $\infty$-category of $\mathfrak{P}$-shaped spans in $\mathfrak{C}$, and we identify $\mathfrak{P}$-monads in it with Segal $\mathfrak{P}$-objects in $\mathfrak{C}$. For the cell pattern $\Theta^{\mathrm{op}}$, this recovers a homotopical reformulation of Batanin's original definition of weak $\omega$-categories, and in general can be seen as a variant of the generalised multicategories of Burroni, Hermida, Leinster and Cruttwell-Shulman.</description>

      <title>A type-theoretic definition of lax $(\infty,\infty)$-limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a purely syntactic notion of lax cones and $(\infty,\infty)$-limits on finite computads in \texttt{CaTT}, a type theory for $(\infty,\infty)$-categories due to Finster and Mimram. Conveniently, finite computads are precisely the contexts in \texttt{CaTT}. We define a cone over a context to be a context, which is obtained by induction over the list of variables of the underlying context. In the case where the underlying context is globular we give an explicit description of the cone and conjecture that an analogous description continues to hold also for general contexts. We use the cone to control the types of the term constructors for the universal cone. The implementation of the universal property follows a similar line of ideas. Starting with a cone as a context, a set of context extension rules produce a context with the shape of a transfor between cones, i.e.~a higher morphism between cones. As in the case of cones, we use this context as a template to control the types of the term constructor required for universal property.</description>

      <title>Haag-Kastler stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides an alternative implementation of the principle of general local covariance for algebraic quantum field theories (AQFTs) which is more flexible than the original one by Brunetti, Fredenhagen and Verch. This is realized by considering the $2$-functor $\mathsf{HK} : \mathbf{Loc}^\mathrm{op} \to \mathbf{CAT}$ which assigns to each Lorentzian manifold $M$ the category $\mathsf{HK}(M)$ of Haag-Kastler-style AQFTs over $M$ and to each embedding $f:M\to N$ a pullback functor $f^\ast = \mathsf{HK}(f) : \mathsf{HK}(N) \to \mathsf{HK}(M)$ restricting theories from $N$ to $M$. Locally covariant AQFTs are recovered as the points of the $2$-functor $\mathsf{HK}$. The main advantages of this new perspective are: 1.) It leads to technical simplifications, in particular with regard to the time-slice axiom, since global problems on $\mathbf{Loc}$ become families of simpler local problems on individual Lorentzian manifolds. 2.) Some aspects of the Haag-Kastler framework which previously got lost in locally covariant AQFT, such as a relative compactness condition on the open subsets in a Lorentzian manifold $M$, are reintroduced. 3.) It provides a radically new perspective on descent conditions in AQFT, i.e. local-to-global conditions which allow one to recover a global AQFT on a Lorentzian manifold $M$ from its local data in an open cover $\{U_i \subseteq M\}$.</description>

      <title>Duals of Higher Vector Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of ``$n$-dual'' to a simplicial vector space for $n\ge 0$. Coming with it, there is a canonical pairing, which we show to be non-degenerate up to homotopy for homotopy $n$-types. As a result this notion of duality is reflexive up to homotopy for $n$-types. In particular the same properties hold for $n$-groupoid objects in vector spaces, whose $n$-duals are again such $n$-groupoid objects. We study this construction in the context of the Dold-Kan correspondence and we reformulate the Eilenberg-Zilber theorem, which classically controls monoidality of the Dold-Kan functors, in terms of internal homs. We compute explicitly the 1-dual of a groupoid object and the 2-dual of a 2-groupoid object in the category of vector spaces. As the 1-dual of a groupoid object, we recover its dual as a $\mathsf{VB}$ groupoid over a point.</description>

      <title>On exact categories and their stable envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Klemenc's stable envelope of exact $\infty$-categories induces an equivalence between stable $\infty$-categories with a bounded heart structure and weakly idempotent complete exact $\infty$-categories. Moreover, we generalise the Gillet-Waldhausen theorem to the connective algebraic K-theory of exact $\infty$-categories and deduce a universal property of connective algebraic K-theory as an additive invariant on exact $\infty$-categories.
  A key tool is a generalisation of a theorem due to Keller which provides a sufficient condition for an exact functor to induce a fully faithful functor on stable envelopes.</description>
