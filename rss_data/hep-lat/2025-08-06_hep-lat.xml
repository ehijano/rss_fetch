      <title>New high-precision $b$, $c$, and $s$ masses from pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar correlators in $n_f=4$ lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend an earlier lattice QCD analysis of heavy-quark current-current correlators to obtain new values for the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ masses of the $b$, $c$, and $s$ quarks. The analysis uses gluon configurations from the MILC collaboration with vacuum polarization contributions from $u$, $d$, $s$, and $c$ quarks ($n_f=4$), and lattice spacings down to 0.032 fm. We find that $\overline{m}_b(\overline{m}_b,n_f=5) = 4.1911(62)$ GeV, $\overline{m}_c(3 \mathrm{GeV},n_f=4) = 0.9808(33)$ GeV, and $\overline{m}_s(3 \mathrm{GeV},n_f=4) = 83.34(26)$ MeV. These results are corrected for QED by including (quenched) QED in the simulations. They are among the most accurate values by any method to date. We give a detailed analysis of finite lattice-spacing errors that shows why the HISQ discretization of the quark action is particularly useful for $b$-quark simulations even for lattices where $am_b\approx1$. We also calculate QED and isospin corrections to the (fictitious) $\eta_s$-meson mass, which is used to tune $s$-quark masses in lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Lattice results for the equation of state in dense QCD-like theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent progress in Monte Carlo simulations of dense two-color QCD (QC$_2$D), focusing on the phase diagram, the equation of state, and the sound velocity in the low-temperature regime. In three-color QCD at finite density, especially at low temperatures, the notorious sign problem makes lattice Monte Carlo simulations intractable. In contrast, QC$_2$D is free from this issue due to the pseudoreality of the quark representation. Recent independent lattice studies have revealed unexpected phenomena through first-principles calculations of the phase structure and thermodynamics. A particularly notable finding is that the sound velocity exceeds the so-called conformal (holography) bound, \( c_s^2/c^2 \le 1/3 \), which had not been observed in QCD-like theories at finite temperature. In this review, we focus primarily on results from a series of works by our group~\cite{Iida:2019rah, Iida:2020emi,Iida:2022hyy, Ishiguro:2021yxr, Iida:2024irv}, along with related studies in dense QC$_2$D and three-color QCD with isospin chemical potential. We discuss the possibility and physical implications of conformal bound violation even for three-color dense QCD, together with insights from effective model analyses and recent observations of neutron stars.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice QCD calculations have been conducted using large-scale classical computers based on the Lagrangian formalism of field theory for the past 40 years. On the other hand, the advent of quantum computers has brought increasing attention to first-principles computational methods based on the Hamiltonian formalism compatible with these machines. In this talk, we discuss recent results on how to calculate hadronic properties using the Hamiltonian formalism.</description>

      <title>Theoretical framework for lattice QCD computations of $B\to K \ell^+ \ell^-$ and $\bar{B}_s\to \ell^+\ell^- \gamma$ decays rates, including contributions from "Charming Penguins"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a strategy for computing the $B\to K\ell^+\ell^-$ and $\bar{B}_s\to\gamma\ell^+\ell^-$ decay amplitudes using lattice QCD (where $\ell^\pm$ are charged leptons). We focus on those terms which contain complex contributions to the amplitude, due to on-shell intermediate states propagating between the weak operator and electromagnetic current(s). Such terms, which are generally estimated using model calculations and represent significant uncertainties in the phenomenological predictions for these decays, cannot be computed using standard lattice QCD techniques. It has recently been shown that such contributions can be computed using spectral-density methods and our proposed strategy, which we discuss in detail, is built on this approach. The complex contributions include the ``charming penguins" (matrix elements of the current-current operators $O_1^{(c)}$ and $O_2^{(c)}$ defined in Eq. (6) below), in which the charm-quark loop can propagate long distances, particularly close to the region of charmonium resonances. They also include the contributions from the chromomagnetic operator ($O_8$ in standard notation, defined in Eq. (8) below). We discuss the renormalization of the ultra-violet divergences, and in particular those which arise due to ``contact" terms, and explain how those which appear as inverse powers of the lattice spacing can be subtracted non-perturbatively. We apply the spectral density methods in an instructive exploratory computation of the charming penguin diagram in $B\to K\ell^+\ell^-$ decays in which the virtual photon is emitted from the charm-quark loop (the diagram in Fig. 1(a) below) and discuss the prospects and strategies for the reliable determination of the amplitudes in future dedicated computations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Bootstrap Approach to a Non-Relativistic Potential for Quarkonium systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum bootstrap method is applied to determine the bound-state spectrum of Quarkonium systems using a non-relativistic potential approximation. The method translates the Schr\"odinger equation into a set of algebraic recursion relations for radial moments $\langle r^m \rangle$, which are constrained by the positive semidefiniteness of their corresponding Hankel matrices. The numerical implementation is first validated by calculating the $1S$ and $1P$ mass centroids for both charmonium ($c\bar{c}$) and bottomonium ($b\bar{b}$) systems, finding deviations of less than 0.5\% from experimental data from the Particle Data Group (PDG). This analysis is then extended to the hypothetical toponium ($t\bar{t}$) system, predicting a $1S$ ground state mass of $M \approx 344.3 \text{ GeV}$. This theoretical mass is in agreement with the energy of the recently observed resonance-like enhancement in the $t\bar{t}$ cross-section by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. This result provides theoretical support for the interpretation of this experimental phenomenon as the formation of a quasi-bound toponium state and highlights the predictive power of the non-relativistic potential approach for systems of two massive quarks.</description>

      <title>Transverse-momentum-dependent pion structures from lattice QCD: Collins-Soper kernel, soft factor, TMDWF, and TMDPDF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04625v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculation of the pion valence-quark transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) within the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). Using correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge (CG), we computed the quasi-TMD beam function for a pion with a mass of 300 MeV, a fine lattice spacing of $a = 0.06$ fm and multiple large momenta up to 3 GeV. The intrinsic soft functions in the CG approach are extracted from form factors with large momentum transfer, and as a byproduct, we also obtain the corresponding Collins-Soper (CS) kernel. Our determinations of both the soft function and the CS kernel agree with perturbation theory at small transverse separations ($b_\perp$) between the quarks. At larger $b_\perp$, the CS kernel remains consistent with recent results obtained using both CG and gauge-invariant TMD correlators in the literature. By combining next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) factorization of the quasi-TMD beam function and the soft function, we obtain $x$-dependent pion valence-quark TMDPDF for transverse separations $b_\perp \gtrsim 1$ fm. Interestingly, we find that the $b_\perp$ dependence of the phenomenological parameterizations of TMDPDF for moderate values of $x$ are in reasonable agreement with our QCD determinations. In addition, we present results for the transverse-momentum-dependent wave function (TMDWF) for a heavier pion with 670 MeV mass.</description>

      <title>A geometric phase approach to quark confinement from stochastic gauge-geometry flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply a stochastic version of the geometric (Ricci) flow, complemented with the stochastic flow of the gauge Yang--Mills sector, in order to seed the chromo-magnetic and chromo-electric vortices that source the area-law for QCD confinement. The area-law is the key signature of quark confinement in Yang--Mills gauge theories with a non-trivial center symmetry. In particular, chromo-magnetic vortices enclosed within the chromo-electric Wilson loops instantiate the area-law asymptotic behaviour of the Wilson loop vacuum expectation values. The stochastic gauge-geometry flow is responsible for the topology changes that induce the appearance of the vortices. When vortices vanish, due to topology changes in the manifolds associated to the hadronic ground states, the evaluation of the Wilson loop yields a dependence on the length of the path, hence reproducing the perimeter law of the hadronic (Higgs) phase of real QCD. Confinement, instead, is naturally achieved within this context as a by-product of the topology change of the manifold over which the dynamics of the Yang--Mills fields is defined. It is then provided by the Aharonov--Bohm effect induced by the concatenation of the compact chromo-electric and chromo-magnetic fluxes originated by the topology changes. The stochastic gauge-geometry flow naturally accomplishes a treatment of the emergence of the vortices and the generation of turbulence effects. Braiding and knotting, resulting from topology changes, namely stochastic fluctuations, stabilize the chromo-magnetic vortices. Finally, we observe that dimensional transmutation for the Yang-Mills fields can be derived from the scaling property of the geometric part of the stochastic flow. Specifically, a relation that involves the infrared equilibrium limit of the Planck constant can be derived that yields the correct order of magnitude for $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$.</description>

      <title>Fully ergodic simulations using radial updates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A sensible application of the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) method is often hindered by the presence of large - or even infinite - potential barriers. These potential barriers separate the configuration space into distinct sectors and can lead to ergodicity violations that bias measurements. In this work, we address this problem by augmenting HMC with a multiplicative Metropolis-Hastings update in a so-called ''radial direction'' of the fields which enables crossing the potential barriers and ensures ergodicity of the sampling algorithm at comparably low computational cost. We demonstrate the algorithm on a simple toy model and show how it can be applied to the fermionic Hubbard model describing physics ranging from an exactly-solvable two-site system to the $C_{20}H_{12}$ perylene molecule. Our numerical results show that the radial updates successfully remove ergodicity violations, while simultaneously reducing autocorrelation times.</description>

      <title>Center-vortex semiclassics with non-minimal 't Hooft fluxes on $\mathbb{R}^2\times T^2$ and center stabilization at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the semiclassical description of confinement for $4$d $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory on small $\mathbb{R}^2\times T^2$ with non-minimal 't Hooft twist $p$ with $\gcd(N,p)=1$. For this purpose, we construct the self-dual center vortex for non-minimal 't Hooft twists from the Kraan-van Baal-Lee-Lu-Yi (KvBLLY) monopoles by using the $3$d Abelianized description of $SU(N)$ gauge fields on $\mathbb{R}^3\times S^1$ with nontrivial holonomy backgrounds. This construction shows the self-dual vortex has (1) the fractional magnetic charge $q/N$ with $pq=1$ mod $N$, (2) the fractional topological charge $1/N$, and (3) the fractional instanton action $S_{\mathrm{YM}}=8\pi^2/(Ng^2)$. The confinement vacua for $NL\Lambda\ll 1$ can be described by the dilute gas approximation of center vortices, and we give the semiclassical formula for the $\theta$ dependence and confining string tensions. We apply this result to understand the suitable choice of the twist $p$ for center stabilization at large $N$. In particular, we test the proposal using the Fibonacci sequence, $N=F_{n+2}$ and $p=F_n$, suggested in studies of the twisted Eguchi-Kawai model, from the viewpoint of the $1$-form and $0$-form center symmetries.</description>

      <title>A New State of Matter between the Hadronic Phase and the Quark-Gluon Plasma?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice-QCD simulations and theoretical arguments hint at the existence of an intermediate phase of strongly interacting matter between a confined hadron gas and a deconfined Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). We qualitatively and semi-quantitatively explore and differentiate the phase structures in the temperature window from the QCD pseudo-critical temperature $T_c\simeq 160\;\text{MeV}$ to the pure-gluonic deconfinement temperature $T_d\simeq 285\;\text{MeV}$. We propose a three-regime picture using a hadron resonance gas (HRG) description augmented with the glueball spectrum based on the analysis of a large number, $N_c$, of colors. We estimate the entropy density from our model to confirm that the lattice-QCD data are bracketed with three regimes, i.e., a hadron gas, a QGP, and a new phase for $T_c \lesssim T \lesssim T_d$. In this new phase that we name a Spaghetti of Quarks with Glueballs (SQGB), thermal degrees of freedom of quarks are deconfined, yet gluons remain confined in glueballs. Since the Hagedorn temperature, $T_H\sim 285\;\text{MeV}$, is universal in the meson and the glueball sectors, in the infinite $N_c$ limit, the phase diagram in the plane of the baryon chemical potential and the temperature is reduced to the one with the confined and deconfined phases and Quarkyonic Matter at high density. At large but finite $N_c$, an SQGB window may open between these phases. We point out that the SQGB has interesting similarities with Quarkyonic Matter and that this matter in the large $N_c$ limit is confined as measured by the interaction between heavy quarks, but behaves in other respects like a quasi-free gas of quarks. As a result of the extrapolation to $N_c=3$, we present a revised phase diagram with the SQGB phase bounded by thermal crossovers. Finally, we give a quantitative analysis of chiral symmetry restoration in the SQGB phase.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive approach to the physics of mesons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel approach for the self-consistent solution of coupled sets of Bethe-Salpeter and Schwinger-Dyson equations in QCD. This framework allows us to maintain the axial Ward-Takahashi identities of the theory within advanced approximation schemes, such as the skeleton or three-particle irreducible expansions. For this purpose we reformulate the Schwinger-Dyson equation of the axial-vector vertex such that the bulk of its quantum corrections is expressed in terms of a novel vertex. Crucially, this vertex satisfies a symmetry-induced relation of its own, which involves the full quark-gluon vertex. As a result, the Schwinger-Dyson equation reproduces the standard Ward-Takahashi identity satisfied by the axial-vector vertex. Consequently, the known relation between the quark mass function and the wave function of the pion in the chiral limit is duly fulfilled. The present approach offers valuable insights into the interplay between symmetry and dynamics, and provides a practical path towards computations of hadron physics within sophisticated approximations. In particular, the one-loop dressed truncation of the key dynamical equations, including that of the quark-gluon vertex, is shown to be completely compatible with the required symmetry relations. Further extensions and potential phenomenological applications of the developed framework are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Quark mass dependence of a QCD critical point and structure of the Columbia plot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quark-mass dependence of the QCD critical point at varying bare up/down quark masses with fixed strange quark mass. We explore the corresponding second-order critical surface in the three-dimensional Columbia plot and study the extension of the associated crossover hyperplane at real and imaginary baryon chemical potential. To this end, we employ a by now well-tested combination of lattice Yang--Mills theory and a (truncated) version of Dyson--Schwinger equations at $N_f=2+1$ quark flavours. We find evidence for a positive curvature of the second order surface at (large) real chemical potential and a crossover region for imaginary chemical potential. Our results support the notion of a tricritical point at finite chemical potential in the chiral limit.</description>
