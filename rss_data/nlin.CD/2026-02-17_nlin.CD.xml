      <title>Spike train propagation in Hybrid Artificial Neural Network (HANN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spikes train is an important step in order to the artificial neural network (ANN) give us simulations more close to the reality i.e the operation of the biological neural network. Based on in previous our work that the HANN can to produce critical and tricritical intermittencies we investigate in present work the possibility of the Spike train production from the HANN. So the operation of ANN does not would based in mathematical algorithm of machine learning but the operation of a ANN could be based in physical notions as the phenomenon of intermittency. As we have shown the real biological neurons is a Dynamical system which present the intermittent dynamic type I.</description>

      <title>Causally constrained reduced-order neural models of complex turbulent dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13847v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a flexible framework based on response theory and score matching to suppress spurious, noncausal dependencies in reduced-order neural emulators of turbulent systems, focusing on climate dynamics as a proof-of-concept. We showcase the approach using the stochastic Charney-DeVore model as a relevant prototype for low-frequency atmospheric variability. We show that the resulting causal constraints enhance neural emulators' ability to respond to both weak and strong external forcings, despite being trained exclusively on unforced data. The approach is broadly applicable to modeling complex turbulent dynamical systems in reduced spaces and can be readily integrated into general neural network architectures.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of smooth solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations from almost the same initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using clean numerical simulation (CNS) which can give very accurate spatiotemporal trajectory of Navier-Stokes turbulence in a finite but long enough interval of time, we give some numerical evidences that the Navier-Stokes equations admit distinct global solutions from almost the same initial conditions whose difference is very small, i.e. even at the order $10^{-40}$ of magnitude. Hopefully these examples could provide some enlightenments for the uniqueness and existence of Navier-Stokes equations, which are related to one Millennium Prize Problem of Clay Institute.</description>

      <title>Causally coherent structures in turbulent dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extraction of spatio-temporal coherence in high-dimensional, chaotic, non-linear dynamical systems, such as turbulent flows, remains a fundamental challenge in physics, mathematics and engineering. In this work, we employ Shannon transfer entropy (TE) to identify causally coherent motions in a zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer (TBL). This causality metric, rooted in information theory, enables the identification of sources and targets in dynamical systems using the corresponding time series. However, TE requires sophisticated tuning of various hyperparameters, such as the Markovian order of the source ($m$), which can spatially vary in wall-bounded turbulent flow. Here, we present an adaptive tuning and discuss the influence of $m$ across different TBLs. We introduce the concept of causally coherent structures (CCS), i.e. coherent structures interpreted as spatio-temporal patterns of causality. Moreover, the net transfer entropy flux is also utilised to identify boundary layer locations acting either as sources or targets. The standard viscous, logarithmic, and outer layers are characterised by information fluxes, highlighting, for example, dominant top-down interactions between the inner and outer layers, analogously to the classical energy cascade. This work extends techniques previously employed in the literature, such as correlation and spectral analysis, and presents an approach that is inherently general and applicable to a wide range of chaotic dynamical systems, with applications in cognitive sciences, systems biology and finance.</description>

      <title>A chaotic lattice field theory in two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22972v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe spatiotemporally chaotic (or turbulent) field theories discretized over d-dimensional lattices in terms of sums over their multi-periodic orbits. `Chaos theory' is here recast in the language of statistical mechanics, field theory, and solid state physics, with the traditional periodic orbits theory of low-dimensional, temporally chaotic dynamics a special, one-dimensional case.
  In the field-theoretical formulation, there is no time evolution. Instead, treating the temporal and spatial directions on equal footing, one determines the spatiotemporally periodic orbits that contribute to the partition sum of the theory, each a solution of the system's defining deterministic equations, with sums over time-periodic orbits of dynamical systems theory replaced here by sums of d-periodic orbits over d-dimensional spacetime geometries, the weight of each orbit given by the Jacobian of its spatiotemporal orbit Jacobian operator. The weights, evaluated by application of the Bloch theorem to the spectrum of periodic orbit's Jacobian operator, are multiplicative for spacetime orbit repeats, leading to a spatiotemporal zeta function formulation of the theory in terms of prime orbits.</description>

      <title>Kinetic energy in random recurrent neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional chaotic dynamics can emerge in a large random recurrent neural network when the synaptic gain crosses a threshold. Recent works showed that the kinetic energy of neural activity links the chaotic dynamics and the supporting unstable fixed points (equilibria) in the phase space. Here, we investigate the kinetic-energy-centric properties of random recurrent neural networks by combining dynamical mean-field theory with extensive numerical simulations. We find that the average kinetic energy shifts continuously from zero to a positive value at a critical value of coupling variance (synaptic gain) and exhibits a cubic scaling behavior near the critical point from above. This scaling behavior is supported by numerical simulations and provides a quantitative characterization of how fast the dynamics change during the onset of chaos. The steady-state activity distribution is further calculated by the theory and compared with simulations on finite-size systems from the kinetic-energy optimization perspective as well. The activity distribution is also analyzed in a geometric angle, establishing a relationship between the original chaotic dynamics and the gradient dynamics of the kinetic energy. The trajectory length on the chaotic manifold can be derived from the stationary kinetic energy, and the associated stationary behavior is analyzed as well. This study provides a kinetic-energy-centric route toward understanding the dynamics landscape of recurrent neural networks, which may provide insights for reservoir computing and even for internal synaptic learning.</description>

      <title>Potential-energy gating for robust state estimation in bistable stochastic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce potential-energy gating, a method for robust state estimation in systems governed by double-well stochastic dynamics. The observation noise covariance of a Bayesian filter is modulated by the local value of a known or assumed potential energy function: observations are trusted when the state is near a potential minimum and progressively discounted as it approaches the barrier separating metastable wells. This physics-based mechanism differs from statistical robust filters, which treat all state-space regions identically, and from constrained filters, which bound states rather than modulating observation trust. The approach is especially relevant in non-ergodic or data-scarce settings where only a single realization is available and statistical methods alone cannot learn the noise structure. We implement gating within Extended, Unscented, Ensemble, and Adaptive Kalman filters and particle filters, requiring only two additional hyperparameters. Monte Carlo benchmarks (100 replications) on a Ginzburg-Landau double-well with 10% outlier contamination show 57-80% RMSE improvement over the standard Extended Kalman Filter, all statistically significant (p &lt; 10^{-15}, Wilcoxon test). A naive topological baseline using only well positions achieves 57%, confirming that the continuous energy landscape adds ~21 percentage points. The method is robust to misspecification: even with 50% parameter errors, improvement never falls below 47%. Comparing externally forced and spontaneous Kramers-type transitions, gating retains 68% improvement under noise-induced transitions whereas the naive baseline degrades to 30%. As an empirical illustration, we apply the framework to Dansgaard-Oeschger events in the NGRIP delta-18O ice-core record, estimating asymmetry gamma = -0.109 (bootstrap 95% CI: [-0.220, -0.011]) and showing that outlier fraction explains 91% of the variance in filter improvement.</description>
