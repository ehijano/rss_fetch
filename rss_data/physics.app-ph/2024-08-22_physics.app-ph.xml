      <title>High quality epitaxial piezoelectric and ferroelectric wurtzite Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piezoelectric and ferroelectric wurtzite are promising to reshape modern microelectronics because they can be easily integrated with mainstream semiconductor technology. Sc doped AlN (Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N) has attracted much attention for its enhanced piezoelectric and emerging ferroelectric properties, yet the commonly used sputtering results in polycrystalline Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N films with high leakage current. Here we report the pulsed laser deposition of single crystalline epitaxial Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N thin films on sapphire and 4H-SiC substrates. Pure wurtzite phase is maintained up to $x = 0.3$ with minimal oxygen contamination. Polarization is estimated to be 140 $\mu$C/cm$^2$ via atomic scale microscopy imaging and found to be switchable via a scanning probe. The piezoelectric coefficient is found to be 5 times of undoped one when $x = 0.3$, making it desirable for high frequency radiofrequency (RF) filters and three-dimensional nonvolatile memories.</description>

      <title>Edge Conditions for the Junction of Two Resistive Half-Planes with Different Surface Impedances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an analysis of the behavior of an electromagnetic field near the common edge of two resistive half-planes with different surface impedances. Contrary to the case of a single resistive half-plane, in the case of the impedance junction, both electric and magnetic fields' transverse components simultaneously contain a logarithmic singularity. It is shown that a surface current density has a finite jump that is proportional to the difference between the inverse impedances.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of autoresonant ions oscillations in an anharmonic electrostatic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the results of modelling the ion dynamics in the ART-MS (Autoresonant Trap Mass Spectrometry) device in the quasi-static approximation. This instrument utilizes an anharmonic, purely electrostatic trap for ion confinement and a radio frequency (RF) voltage source with decrementally varying frequency for selective ion extraction. The autoresonant interaction between the oscillatory motion of the ion and the RF voltage causes an increase in the amplitude of certain confined ions, allowing their selective extraction. Numerical modelling shows that the extraction of ions with a given mass occurs not only at the fundamental frequency but also at its harmonics. This effect reduces the selective properties of devices of this type because along with the main mass component for a given frequency, it is possible to enter the detector channel of ions with another mass, for which this frequency corresponds to the second or higher harmonics, even a superposition of some of these harmonics of different ions.</description>

      <title>Substrate-induced spin-torque-like signal in spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oxide thin films and interfaces with strong spin-orbit coupling have recently shown exceptionally high charge-to-spin conversion, making them potential spin-source materials for spintronics. Epitaxial strain engineering using oxide substrates with different lattice constants and symmetries has emerged as a mean to further enhance charge-to-spin conversion. However, high relative permittivity and dielectric loss of commonly used oxide substrates, such as SrTiO3, can cause significant current shunting in substrates at high frequency, which may strongly affect spin-torque measurement and potentially result in an inaccurate estimation of charge-to-spin conversion efficiency. In this study, we systematically evaluate the influence of various oxide substrates for the widely-used spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) measurement. Surprisingly, we observed substantial spin-torque signals in samples comprising only ferromagnetic metal on oxide substrates with high relative permittivity (e.g., SrTiO3 and KTaO3), where negligible signal should be initially expected. Notably, this unexpected signal shows a strong correlation with the capacitive reactance of oxide substrates and the leakage radio frequency (RF) current within the substrate. By revising the conventional ST-FMR analysis model, we attribute this phenomenon to a 90-degree phase difference between the RF current flowing in the metal layer and in the substrate. We suggest that extra attention should be paid during the ST-FMR measurements, as this artifact could dominate over the real spin-orbit torque signal from high-resistivity spin-source materials grown on substrate with high relative permittivity.</description>

      <title>Dielectric Reliability and Interface Trap Characterization in MOCVD grown In-situ Al$_2$O$_3$ on $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the in-situ growth of Al$_2$O$_3$ on $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) at a high temperature of 800{\deg}C. The Al$_2$O$_3$ is grown within the same reactor as the $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, employing trimethylaluminum (TMAl) and O$_2$ as precursors without breaking the vacuum. We characterize the shallow and deep-level traps through stressed capacitance-voltage (C-V) and photo-assisted C-V methods. The high-temperature deposited dielectric demonstrates an impressive breakdown field of approximately 10 MV/cm. Furthermore, we evaluate the reliability and lifetime of the dielectrics using time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) measurements. By modifying the dielectric deposition process to include a high-temperature (800{\deg}C) thin interfacial layer and a low-temperature (600{\deg}C) bulk layer, we report a 10-year lifetime under a stress field of 3.5 MV/cm along a breakdown field of 7.8 MV/cm.</description>

      <title>Spin-wave assisted synchronization in 2D arrays of spin torque oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization of coupled oscillators is a fundamental phenomenon that has been observed in many natural and engineered systems, ranging from biological cells to electronic circuits. In recent years, spin torque nano-oscillators (STNOs) have emerged as a promising platform for a variety of applications in nanoscale systems such as neuromorphic computing, due to their compact size, low power consumption, and tunable properties. However, achieving synchronization in a large array of STNOs remains a challenge, for the complexity of the interactions between the oscillators. To address this challenge, we report on the achievement of synchronization across a 2D array of STNOs. We designed a honeycomb model that created a network of interactions among the oscillators that only involved nearest neighbors. Using micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our design and observed that global synchronization across the whole array. Such global synchronization can also be tuned by enable/disenable next-nearest neighbor interactions. We also found that our design enables synchronization at room temperature, which is crucial for practical applications. Our work contributes to the growing body of research on the synchronization of coupled oscillators in spintronics and could pave the way for the development of new types of spintronic devices and potential applications.</description>

      <title>Double tips for in-plane polarized near-field microscopy and spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-field optical microscopy and spectroscopy provide high-resolution imaging below the diffraction limit, crucial in physics, chemistry, and biology for studying molecules, nanoparticles, and viruses. These techniques use a sharp metallic tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM) to enhance incoming and scattered light by excited near-fields at the tip apex leading to high sensitivity and a spatial resolution of a few nanometers. However, this restricts the near-field orientation to out-of-plane polarization, limiting optical polarization choices. We introduce double tips that offer in-plane polarization for enhanced imaging and spectroscopy. These double tips provide superior enhancement over single tips, although with a slightly lower spatial resolution (~30nm). They enable advanced studies of nanotubes, graphene defects, and transition metal dichalcogenides, benefiting from polarization control. The double tips allow varied polarization in tip-enhanced Raman scattering and selective excitation of transverse-electric and -magnetic polaritons, expanding the range of nanoscale samples that can be studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we derive a Cauer network reluctivity model for soft magnetic composite materials. The Cauer network components are closed-form expressions consisting only of such parameters that have a clear physical meaning. The parameters include particle permeability, particle conductivity, insulation permeability, insulation thickness, volume fraction, mean particle diameter, variance of particle diameters, and maximal particle diameter. The particle volumes are assumed to be beta-distributed. Since the model is a network, it is immediately available in both frequency- and time domains.</description>

      <title>Imaging transverse modes in a GHz surface acoustic wave cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full characterization of surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices requires imaging the spatial distribution of the acoustic field, which is not possible with standard all-electrical measurements where an interdigital transducer (IDT) is used as a detector. Here we present a fiber-based scanning Michelson interferometer employing a strongly focused laser beam as a probe. Combined with a heterodyne circuit, this setup enables frequency- and spatially-resolved measurements of the amplitude and phase of the SAW displacement. We demonstrate this by investigating a 1 GHz SAW cavity, revealing the presence of frequency-overlapping transverse modes, which are not resolved with an all-electrical measurement. The frequency overlap of these transverse modes leads to mode superpositions, which we analyze by quadrature decomposition of the complex acoustic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Silicon microelectronics, consisting of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, have changed nearly all aspects of human life from communication to transportation, entertainment, and healthcare. Despite the widespread and mainstream use, current silicon-based devices suffer significant reliability issues at temperatures exceeding 125 C. The emergent technological frontiers of space exploration, geothermal energy harvesting, nuclear energy, unmanned avionic systems, and autonomous driving will rely on control systems, sensors, and communication devices which operate at temperatures as high as 500 C and beyond. At these extreme temperatures, active (heat exchanger, phase change cooling) or passive (fins and thermal interface materials) cooling strategies add significant mass and complication which is often infeasible. Thus, new material solutions beyond conventional silicon CMOS devices are necessary for high temperature, resilient electronic systems. Accomplishing this will require a united effort to explore development, integration, and ultimately manufacturing of non-silicon-based logic and memory technologies, non-traditional metals for interconnects, and ceramic packaging technology.</description>

      <title>Angstrom-scale ion-beam engineering of ultrathin buried oxides for quantum and neuro-inspired computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilayer nanoscale systems incorporating buried ultrathin tunnel oxides, 2D materials, and solid electrolytes are crucial for next-generation logics, memory, quantum and neuro-inspired computing. Still, an ultrathin layer control at angstrom scale is challenging for cutting-edge applications. Here we introduce a scalable approach utilizing focused ion-beam annealing for buried ultrathin oxides engineering with angstrom-scale thickness control. Our molecular dynamics simulations of Ne+ irradiation on Al/a-AlOx/Al structure confirms the pivotal role of ion generated crystal defects. We experimentally demonstrate its performance on Josephson junction tunning in the resistance range of 2 to 37% with a standard deviation of 0.86% across 25x25 mm chip. Moreover, we showcase +-17 MHz frequency control (+-0.172 A tunnel barrier thickness) for superconducting transmon qubits with coherence times up to 500 us, which is promising for useful fault-tolerant quantum computing. This work ensures ultrathin multilayer nanosystems engineering at the ultimate scale by depth-controlled crystal defects generation.</description>

      <title>Wavelength-agnostic Metasurface Design for Next Generation 2D Photodetectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a versatile technique for inverse designing 2D photonic crystal metasurfaces. These surfaces, known for their ability to manipulate light-matter interactions, can be precisely controlled to achieve specific functionalities. The key lies in efficiently optimizing the geometric patterns and dimensions of the metasurface. Through a composite method which exploits two well-established paradigms - Covariance Matrix Adaptation optimization and Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA), we demonstrate our ability to design and optimize resonances in metaelements to achieve desired optical performance such as near-perfect absorption at chosen wavelengths/optical modes, which otherwise proves to be challenging or even impossible with conventional inverse design implementations. We apply our method to design three-layered structures involving a monolayer absorber, transparent metasubstrate, and a back mirror to get near 100% absorption at one or two chosen wavelengths. For illustration, we choose black phosphorus and silicon metasurface to predict ~100% absorption in a monolayer at 1550 nm. The versatile technique can be applied to tailor reflectance and transmittance for any optical mode and wavelength. This computationally efficient design method paves the way for creating high-performance 2D metasurface-based devices with a variety of applications, including quantum technology components such as single photon sensors and biphoton sources, communication systems, and non-linear light conversion.</description>
