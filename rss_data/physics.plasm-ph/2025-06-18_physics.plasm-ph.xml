      <title>Electrically insulating materials for centrifugal mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The centrifugal mirror confinement scheme incorporates supersonic rotation into a magnetic mirror device, which stabilizes and heats the plasma. This concept is under investigation in the Centrifugal Mirror Fusion Experiment (CMFX) at the University of Maryland. Plasma rotation is driven by an axial magnetic field and a radial electric field that lead to velocity drifts in the azimuthal direction. An electrically insulating material is required to prevent the applied voltage from shorting on the grounded chamber. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a promising candidate material for plasma-facing components in future centrifugal mirrors due to its exceptional thermal and electrical properties. However, its performance under intense particle and heat fluxes characteristic of the plasma edge in fusion devices remains largely unexplored. Computational modeling for ion- and neutron-material interactions was carried out with RustBCA and OpenMC, respectively, and predicts relatively good performance in comparison to other insulating materials. Material coupons were then exposed to plasma in PISCES-A at UCSD and CMFX. A load-locked sample feedthrough was constructed and installed on CMFX to test coupons. Two erosion mechanisms were identified -- sputtering and grain ejection -- both of which were more apparent in silicon carbide than hBN.</description>

      <title>Determining the Validity of Tokamak Perturbed Equilibrium Modeling Using Nonlinear Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction of perturbed equilibrium models for tokamaks with small 3D fields is strongly dependent on which reference frame for axisymmetry is assumed - for example, the toroidal field (TF) coil vs the poloidal field (PF) coil centroid. We use fully 3D equilibria generated by VMEC to determine the correct reference frame in these models when subject to n=1 coil asymmetries. We analyze a case for SPARC and find that the appropriate frame can be well approximated by the centroid of the TF coil set. We also consider the case of NSTX-U and find that the frame can be approximated by the radial location of the TF coil inboard legs at the midplane. We determine the correct frame by analyzing the shifted magnetic axis in the nonlinear equilibria. We also analyze the magnetic field line displacement to identify where the linearized MHD theory begins to break down, and compare that to typical coil tolerances in existing tokamaks. We find that linear theory is valid for existing tolerances, validating the use of perturbative codes to set these tolerances, but with a sufficiently small margin to be of note for future devices with relative tolerances larger than approximately $1\%$ of the minor radius. This study enables engineers to confidently use 3D perturbative models for determining assembly tolerances by providing insight into the correct applications of the theory.</description>

      <title>Imaginary part of the conductivity using Kramers-Kronig relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to obtain the frequency-dependent photo-absorption in a plasma, both the real and imaginary parts of the AC conductivity are required. The real part can be deduced from the knowledge of the static conductivity (given by the Ziman-Evans formula for instance) and the Drude model. The imaginary part, required for the refraction index, can be obtained using the Kramers-Kronig relations. Usually, it is obtained by complex integration in the complex plane of the usual Kramers-Kronig relations, having $\omega'-\omega$ in the denominator. However, an alternate form of the Kramers-Kronig relation is often used in physics, especially for determining response functions. It has $\omega'^2-\omega^2$ in the denominator. We provide two determinations of the imaginary part of the conductivity for this latter form, one using a decomposition into simple elements, and the other involving a complex integration in a quarter of the complex plane.</description>

      <title>Fourier Transform Method Of A Detailed Configuration Accounting In Hot Plasma Bound-Bound Opacity Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: G.~Hazak and J.~Kurzweil discovered a method of configurational resolution of transition arrays for the Super Transition Arrays approach to the bound-bound opacity calculation. Their method is based on the representation of the photoabsorption coefficient as the Fourier transform, the linearity of the transition energy between configurations with respect to shell occupation numbers, and factorization of the probabilities of configurations on shell occupation numbers. We extend the Hazak -- Kurzweil method for the calculations with Detailed Configuration Accounting. The resulting expressions for the bound-bound opacity represent an alternative to the widely used ones and are quite convenient for numerical implementation.</description>

      <title>The Gardner equation and acoustic solitary waves in plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion-acoustic waves in a dusty plasma are investigated where it is assumed that the ions follow a Cairns distribution and the electrons are Boltzmann distributed. Two theoretical methods are applied: Sagdeev pseudopotential analysis (SPA) and reductive perturbation theory (RPT). Since SPA incorporates all nonlinearities of the model it is the most accurate but deriving soliton profiles requires numerical integration of Poisson's equation. By contrast, RPT is a perturbation method which at second order yields the Gardner equation incorporating both the quadratic nonlinearity of the KdV equation with the cubic nonlinearity of the modified KdV equation. For consistency with the perturbation scheme the coefficient of the quadratic term needs to be at least an order of magnitude smaller than the coefficient of the cubic term. Solving the Gardner equation yields an analytic expression of the soliton profile. Selecting an appropriate set of compositional parameters, the soliton solutions obtained from SPA and RPT are analyzed and compared.</description>

      <title>Helical Electron Beam Micro-Bunching by High-Order Modes in a Micro-Plasma Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron acceleration by a high-power Laguerre-Gaussian pulse in a micro-plasma waveguide is investigated. When the incident laser travels in the waveguide, electrons on the wall are extracted into the vacuum core and accelerated by the longitudinal field of the waveguide mode. Using 3D particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that high energy (~100 MeV) electron beams with extremely high charge (~10 nC), ultrashort duration (~30 fs) and small divergence (~1 deg) can be produced by a 100-TW, few-Joule class laser system. In particular, when the drive Laguerre-Gaussian pulse is circularly polarized, it excites high-order waveguide modes that exhibit helical longitudinal electric fields. The 3D profile of this accelerating field is imprinted into the high energy electron beam, leading to helical micro-bunching. This process can be controlled by the spin and orbital angular momentum of the drive pulse. This work paves the way to the generation of highcharge, relativistic electron beams with controlled helicity, which holds great potential for advances in fundamental science and a variety of applications.</description>

      <title>Laser-Driven Annular Shock Waves as Laboratory Analogues of $w$CDM Cosmologies and Cosmological Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the experimental evolution of an annular, laser-driven plasma shock wave, expanding over time and undergoing self-interaction gives rise to multiple shock structures that evolve analogously to a multicomponent cosmological universe. Different propagation trajectories along the shock surface correspond to various forms of $w$CDM cosmologies, enabling the study of scenarios ranging from simple radiation- or matter-dominated universes to those including dark energy. We further show that the dynamics of the Mach stems approximately follows a Hubble-like law. Additionally, perturbations in the shock fronts serve as experimental analogues of cosmological gravitational perturbations in a matter-dominated universe. This work opens a new experimental pathway for classically simulating complex cosmological models and gravitational waves at macroscopic scales in the laboratory.</description>

      <title>How CO Affects the Composition of Titan's Tholins Generated with ECR Plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Titan's atmosphere possesses thick haze layers, but their formation mechanisms remain poorly understood, including the influence of oxygen-containing gas components on organic matter synthesis. As the most abundant oxygen-containing gas, the presence of CO has been found to exert a significant impact on the generation of oxygen-containing organic compounds. Therefore, investigating the influence of CO on the production and composition of Tholins through laboratory simulations, holds profound scientific significance in the context of Titan. The work presented here is an experimental simulation designed to evaluate the impact of CO on the atmospheric chemistry of Titan. To this end, CO was introduced into the standard N2/CH4 mixture at varying mixing ratios from 0.2% to 9%, and exposed to Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) plasma to initiate photochemical reactions. Optical emission spectroscopy was employed for gas-phase in situ characterization, while infrared spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry were used to analyze the resulting solid products (tholins). Our results demonstrate that the addition of CO enriches the complexity of the chemical system. CO not only supplies oxygen to the system, but also enhances nitrogen's reactivity and incorporation, enhancing the number and quantity of the organic products.</description>

      <title>The Quasi-Radial Field-line Tracing (QRaFT): an Adaptive Segmentation of the Open-Flux Solar Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical observations of solar corona provide key information on its magnetic geometry. The large-scale open field of the corona plays an important role in shaping the ambient solar wind and constraining the propagation dynamics of the embedded structures, such as interplanetary coronal mass ejections. Rigorous analysis of the open-flux coronal regions based on coronagraph images can be quite challenging because of the depleted plasma density resulting in low signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we present an in-depth description of a new image segmentation methodology, the Quasi-Radial Field-line Tracing (QRaFT), enabling a detection of field-aligned optical coronal features approximating the orientation of the steady-state open magnetic field. The methodology is tested using synthetic coronagraph images generated by a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic model. The results of the numerical tests indicate that the extracted optical features are aligned within $\sim 4-7$ degrees with the local magnetic field in the underlying numerical solution. We also demonstrate the performance of the method on real-life coronal images obtained from a space-borne coronagraph and a ground-based camera. We argue that QRaFT outputs contain valuable empirical information about the global steady-state morphology of the corona which could help improving the accuracy of coronal and solar wind models and space weather forecasts.</description>

      <title>A topological approach to magnetic nulls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic nulls are locations where the magnetic field vanishes. Nulls are the location of magnetic reconnection, and they determine to a large degree the magnetic connectivity in a system. We describe a novel approach to understanding movement, appearance, and disappearance of nulls in magnetic fields. This approach is based on the concept of isotropes, or lines where the field direction is constant. These lines are streamlines of a vector field whose flux is sourced by the topological indices of nulls, and can be conceptualized as corresponding "lines of force" between nulls. We show how this topological approach can be used to generate analytical expressions for the location of nulls in the presence of external fields for dipoles and for a field defined by the Hopf fibration.</description>

      <title>Gauge-invariant variational formulations of electromagnetic gyrokinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of gyrokinetics, wherein phase-space coordinate transformations result in a phase-space dimensionality reduction as well as the removal of fast time scales, has enabled the simulation of microturbulence in fusion devices. The state-of-the-art gyrokinetic models used in practice are parallel-only models wherein the perpendicular part of the vector potential is neglected. Such models are inherently not gauge invariant. We generalise the work of [Burby, Brizard. Physics Letters A, 383(18):2172-2175] by deriving a sufficient condition on the gyrocentre coordinate transformation which ensures gauge invariance. This leads to a parametrized family of gyrokinetic models for which we motivate a specific choice of parameters that results in the smallest gyrocentre coordinate transformation for which the resulting gyrokinetic model is consistent, gyro-phase independent, gauge invariant and has an invariant magnetic moment. Due to gauge invariance this model can be expressed directly in terms of the electromagnetic fields, rather than the potentials, and the gyrokinetic model thereby results in the macroscopic Maxwell's equations. For the linearised model, it is demonstrated that the shear and compressional Alfv\'en waves are present with the correct frequencies. The fast compressional Alfv\'en wave can be removed by making use of a Darwin-like approximation. This approximation retains the gauge invariance of the proposed model.</description>

      <title>Embedding physical symmetries into machine-learned reduced plasma physics models via data augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning is offering powerful new tools for the development and discovery of reduced models of nonlinear, multiscale plasma dynamics from the data of first-principles kinetic simulations. However, ensuring the physical consistency of such models requires embedding fundamental symmetries of plasma dynamics. In this work, we explore a symmetry-embedding strategy based on data augmentation, where symmetry-preserving transformations (e.g., Lorentz and Galilean boosts) are applied to simulation data. Using both sparse regression and neural networks, we show that models trained on symmetry-augmented data more accurately infer the plasma fluid equations and pressure tensor closures from fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of magnetic reconnection. We show that this approach suppresses spurious inertial-frame-dependent correlations between dynamical variables, improves data efficiency, and significantly outperforms models trained without symmetry-augmented data, as well as commonly used theoretical pressure closure models. Our results establish symmetry-based data augmentation as a broadly applicable method for incorporating physical structure into machine-learned reduced plasma models.</description>
