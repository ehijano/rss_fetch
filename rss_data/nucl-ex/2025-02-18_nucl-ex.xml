      <title>First measurement of 87Rb({\alpha}, xn) cross sections at weak r-process energies in supernova {\nu}-driven ejecta to investigate elemental abundances in low-metallicity stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observed abundances of Z ~ 40 elements in metal-poor stars vary from star to star, indicating that the rapid and slow neutron capture processes may not contribute alone to the synthesis of elements beyond iron. The weak r-process was proposed to produce Z ~ 40 elements in a subset of old stars. Thought to occur in the {\nu}-driven ejecta of a core-collapse supernova, ({\alpha}, xn) reactions would drive the nuclear flow toward heavier masses at T = 2-5 GK. However, current comparisons between modelled and observed yields do not bring satisfactory insights into the stellar environment, mainly due to the uncertainties of the nuclear physics inputs where the dispersion in a given reaction rate often exceeds one order of magnitude. Involved rates are calculated with the statistical model where the choice of an {\alpha}-optical-model potential ({\alpha}OMP) leads to such a poor precision. The first experiment on 87Rb({\alpha}, xn) reactions at weak r-process energies is reported here. Total inclusive cross sections were assessed at Ec.m. = 8.1 - 13 MeV (3.7 - 7.6 GK) with the active target MUlti-Sampling Ionization Chamber (MUSIC). With a N = 50 seed nucleus, the measured values agree with statistical model estimates using the {\alpha}OMP Atomki-V2. A re-evaluated reaction rate was incorporated into new nucleosynthesis calculations, focusing on {\nu}-driven ejecta conditions known to be sensitive to this specific rate. These conditions were found to fail to reproduce the lighter-heavy element abundances in metal-poor stars.</description>

      <title>70 Years of Hyperon Spectroscopy: A review of strange $\Xi$, $\Omega$ baryons, and the spectrum of charmed and bottom baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first hyperon was discovered about 70 years ago, but the nature of these particles, particularly with regard to multistrange hyperons, and many of their properties can still be considered to be literally strange. A dedicated and successful global spectroscopy program in the 1960s and 1970s using $K^-$ beams revealed many multistrange candidates, but the available evidence of their existence is statistically limited. For this reason, there is still much to learn about the systematics of the spectrum of excited hyperon states and what they have in common with their non-strange companions, or how they differ from the nucleon and $\Delta$ resonances. Recent years have also seen a great deal of progress in the field of charmed and bottom baryon spectroscopy. Unprecedented data from the Large Hadron Collider in particular indicate continued rapid progress in the field of bottom baryons. On the theoretical side, baryons with one heavy quark $Q$ and a light $qq$ system serve as an ideal laboratory for studying light $qq$ (diquark) correlations and the dynamics of the light quarks in the colour environment of a heavy quark. In this review, we discuss the status of doubly and triply strange $\Xi$ as well as $\Omega$ baryons, and the properties of all the known charmed and bottom states. The comparison of the two heavy sectors reveals many similarities as predicted by heavy-quark symmetries, together with differences in mass splittings easily understood by potential models. The multi-strange hyperons bridge the under-explored gap between the light- and the heavy-flavour baryons. How do the properties of a singly charmed $Q$-$qq$ system change with decreasing mass of the heavy quark in the transition to a doubly strange $q$-$QQ$ system with a heavier quark-quark system relative to one light quark?</description>

      <title>Commissioning of a radiofrequency quadrupole cooler-buncher for collinear laser spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A RadioFrequency Quadrupole (RFQ) cooler-buncher system has been developed and implemented in a collinear laser spectroscopy setup. This system is dedicated to convert a continuous ion beam into short bunches, while enhancing beam quality and reducing energy spread. The functionality of the RFQ cooler-buncher has been verified through offline tests with stable rubidium and indium beam, delivered from a surface ion source and a laser ablation ion source, respectively. With a transmission efficiency exceeding 60%, bunched ion beams with a full width at half maximum of approximately 2{\mu}s in the time-of-flight spectrum have been successfully achieved. The implementation of RFQ cooler-buncher system has significantly improved the overall transmission efficiency of the collinear laser spectroscopy setup.</description>

      <title>Performance Characteristics of the Battery-Operated Si PIN Diode Detector with Integrated Preamplifier and Data Acquisition Module for Fusion Particle Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the performance and application of a commercial off-the shelf Si PIN diode (Hamamatsu S14605) as a charged particle detector in a compact ion beam system (IBS) capable of generating D-D and p-B fusion charged particles. This detector is inexpensive, widely available, and operates in photoconductive mode under a reverse bias voltage of 12 V, supplied by an A23 battery. A charge-sensitive preamplifier (CSP) is powered by two 3 V lithium batteries (A123), providing +/-3 V rail voltages. Both the detector and preamplifier circuits are integrated onto the same 4-layer PCB and housed on the vacuum side of the IBS, facing the fusion target. The system employs a CF-2.75 flanged DB-9 connector feedthrough to supply the signal, bias voltage, and rail voltages. To mitigate the high sensitivity of the detector to optical light, a thin aluminum foil assembly is used to block optical emissions from the ion beam and target. Charged particles generate step responses on the preamplifier output, with pulse rise times on the order of 0.2 to 0.3 us. These signals are recorded using a custom-built data acquisition unit, which features an optical fiber data link to ensure electrical isolation of the detector electronics. Subsequent digital signal processing is employed to optimally shape the pulses using a CR-RC^4 filter to produce Gaussian-shaped signals, enabling accurate extraction of energy information. Performance results show that the signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) for D-D fusion charged particles - protons, tritons, and helions - are approximately 30, 10, and 5, respectively, with a shaping time constant of 4 us.</description>

      <title>Heavy-flavor multimodal fragmentation to $S$-wave pentacharms at next-generation hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the leading-power fragmentation of fully charmed pentaquark states ($S$-wave $|c\bar{c}ccc\rangle$ pentacharms) at hadron colliders. We introduce a new set of hadron-structure-oriented, multimodal collinear fragmentation functions, named PQ5Q1.0. They rely on an enhanced calculation of the initial-scale input for the constituent heavy-quark fragmentation channel, making them well suited to describe the short-distance emission of either a compact multicharm state or a dicharm-charm-dicharm configuration. To explore phenomenological implications, we use the (sym)JETHAD multimodular interface to study NLL/NLO$^+$ semi-inclusive production rates for pentacharm-plus-jet systems at the forthcoming HL-LHC and the future FCC. Our analysis represents a further step toward bridging the domains of hadronic structure, precision QCD, and exotic matter.</description>

      <title>Resonance nuclear excitation of the $^{229}$Th nucleus via electronic bridge process in Th~II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 8.4 eV transition in the $^{229}$Th nucleus is the basis for a high-precision nuclear clock with exceptional sensitivity to new physics effects. We have identified several cases in the Th$^+$ ion where electronic excitations closely resonate with the nuclear excitation, with the smallest energy difference being $\Delta = -0.09$ cm$^{-1}$. We investigate the electronic bridge process, in which nuclear excitation is induced via electronic transitions, and demonstrate that a proper selection of laser frequencies can lead to a dramatic enhancement of this effect. Additionally, we show that the interaction with electrons significantly shortens the lifetime of the nuclear excited state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to experimentally access the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of the charged pion $\pi^+$ through the Sullivan process in electron-proton scattering. We demonstrate that the cross sections of $J/\psi$-photoproduction and $\phi$-electroproduction near the respective thresholds are dominated by the gluon GFF of the pion to next-to-leading order in perturbative QCD. We predict cross sections for the Electron-Ion Collider and the Jefferson Lab experiments.</description>

      <title>Measurement of two-neutrino double electron capture half-life of $^{124}$Xe with PandaX-4T</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detailed studies of two-neutrino double electron capture (2$\nu$DEC) is a crucial step towards searching for the neutrino-less mode to explore the Majorana nature of neutrinos. We have measured precisely the half-life of the 2$\nu$DEC process in $^{124}$Xe, utilizing a total exposure of 1.73 tonne$\cdot$year from the commissioning run and the first science run of the PandaX-4T experiment. A time-dependent background model in the $\mathcal{O}$(10 keV) energy is constructed for the first time in PandaX-4T data. With an unbinned maximum likelihood fit, we determine the half-life of the 2$\nu$DEC process to be $(1.03\pm0.15_{\rm stat}\pm0.08_{\rm sys})\times 10^{22}$$\,$yr. Furthermore, we have evaluated the branching ratio for both electrons captured from the $K$ shell ($KK$) to be $(65\pm5)\%$, which aligns with the $^{124}$Xe nuclear model calculations within 1.5$\,$$\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Creation of super-high-flux photo-neutrons and gamma-rays &gt; 8 MeV using a petawatt laser to irradiate high-Z solid targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06766v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the creation of super-high-flux gamma-rays with energy &gt;8 MeV and photo-neutrons via the (g,n) reaction near giant dipole resonance energies (8 - 20 MeV), using the ~130 J Texas Petawatt laser to irradiate high-Z (Au, Pt, Re, W) targets of mm - cm thickness, at laser intensities up to ~5x1021W/cm2. We detected up to ~ several x 1012 gamma-rays &gt; 8 MeV (~3% of incident laser energy) and ~ 1010 photo-neutrons per shot. Due to the short pulse and narrow gamma-ray cone (~17o half-width) around laser forward, the peak emergent gamma-ray flux &gt;8 MeV reached ~1027 gammas/cm2/sec, and the peak emergent neutron flux reached ~1020 neutrons/cm2/sec. Such intense gamma-ray and neutron fluxes are among the highest achieved for short-pulse laser experiments. They will facilitate the study of nuclear reactions requiring super-high-flux of gamma-rays or neutrons, such as the creation of r-process elements. These results may also have far-reaching applications for nuclear energy, such as the transmutation of nuclear waste, isotope production and inertial fusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This Letter presents a search for highly ionizing magnetic monopoles in 262$~\mu$b$^{-1}$ of ultraperipheral Pb+Pb collision data at $\sqrt{s_{_\textrm{NN}}}=5.36$ TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. A new methodology that exploits the properties of clusters of hits reconstructed in the innermost silicon detector layers is introduced to study highly ionizing particles in heavy-ion data. No significant excess above the background, which is estimated using a data-driven technique, is observed. Using a nonperturbative semiclassical model, upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the cross-section for pair production of monopoles with a single Dirac magnetic charge in the mass range of 20-150 GeV. The search significantly improves on the previous cross-section limits for production of low-mass monopoles in ultraperipheral Pb+Pb collisions.</description>

      <title>Global Extraction of the $\rm^{12}C$ Nuclear Electromagnetic Response Functions (${\cal R}_L$ and ${\cal R}_T$) and Comparisons to Nuclear Theory and Neutrino/Electron Monte Carlo Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have performed a global extraction of the ${\rm ^{12}C}$ longitudinal (${\cal R}_L$) and transverse (${\cal R}_T$) nuclear electromagnetic response functions from an analysis of all available electron scattering data on carbon. The response functions are extracted for energy transfer $\nu$, spanning the nuclear excitation, quasielastic (QE), resonance and inelastic continuum over a large range of the square of the four-momentum transfer, $Q^2.$ In addition, we perform a universal fit to all ${\rm ^{12}C}$ electron scattering data which also provides parmeterizations of ${\cal R}_L$ and ${\cal R}_T$ over a larger kinematic range. Given the nuclear physics common to both electron and neutrino scattering from nuclei, extracted response functions from electron scattering spanning a large range of $Q^2$ and $\nu$ also provide a powerful tool for validation and tuning of neutrino Monte Carlo (MC) generators. In this paper we focus on the nuclear excitation, single nucleon (QE-1p1h) and two nucleon (2p2h) final state regions and compare the measurements to theoretical predictions including ``Energy Dependent-Relativistic Mean Field'' (ED-RMF), ``Green's Function Monte Carlo'' (GFMC), "Short Time Approximation Quantum Monte Carlo" (STA-QMC), an improved superscaling model (SuSAv2), "Correlated Fermi Gas" (CFG), as well as the \nuwro{}, and \achilles~ generators. Combining the ED-RMF-QE-1p1h predictions with the SuSAv2-MEC-2p2h predictions provides a good description of ${\cal R}_L$ and ${\cal R}_T$ for both single nucleon (from QE and nuclear excitations) and two nucleon final states over the entire kinematic range.</description>

      <title>Generating a highly uniform magnetic field inside the magnetically shielded room of the n2EDM experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a coil system designed to generate a highly uniform magnetic field for the n2EDM experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute. It consists of a main $B_0$ coil and a set of auxiliary coils mounted on a cubic structure with a side length of 273 cm, inside a large magnetically shielded room (MSR). We have assembled this system and characerized its performances with a mapping robot. The apparatus is able to generate a 1 $\mu$ T vertical field with a relative root mean square deviation $\sigma$ ($B_z$)/$B_z$ = 3 $\times$ $10^{-5}$ over the volume of interest, a cylinder of radius 40 cm and height 30 cm. This level of uniformity overcomes the n2EDM requirements, allowing a measurement of the neutron Electric Dipole Moment with a sensitivity better than 1 $\times$ $10^{-27}$ ecm.</description>

      <title>Elastic Dijet Production in Electron Scattering on a Longitudinally Polarized Proton at Small $x$: A Portal to Orbital Angular Momentum Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the elastic production of dijets from electron collisions with a longitudinally polarized proton target at small values of the Bjorken $x$ variable. Building on the pioneering proposals of \cite{Hatta:2016aoc,Bhattacharya:2022vvo, Bhattacharya:2023hbq, Bhattacharya:2024sck} for measuring the quark and gluon orbital angular momentum (OAM) distributions, our focus is on both the longitudinal double spin asymmetry (DSA) and longitudinal single spin asymmetry (SSA). We compute the numerators of these asymmetries in the small-$x$ formalism of the light-cone operator treatment. Utilizing the small-$x$ expressions for the OAM distributions derived in our earlier paper, we demonstrate that the DSA provides a robust probe for both the quark and gluon OAM distributions within the proton. In contrast, we find that while the SSA is also sensitive to the OAM distributions, extraction of the latter from the SSA would require new developments in small-$x$ theory and phenomenology, and is probably not feasible at this point in time. These findings highlight the potential of DSA measurements in elastic dijet production at the future Electron-Ion Collider to provide the first-ever direct access to the quark and gluon OAM distributions at small $x$, paving the way for new insights into the proton spin puzzle.</description>

      <title>Chiral effective theory of scalar and vector diquarks revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral effective theory of light diquarks is revisited. We construct an effective Lagrangian based on the linear representation of three-flavor chiral symmetry. Here, we focus on the effect of a chiral and $U(1)_A$ symmetric term originated from an eight-point quark interaction. From this model, we obtain the mass formulas of scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and axial-vector diquarks, which also describe the dependence of diquark masses on the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the $U(1)_A$ anomaly. We regard singly heavy baryons as two-body systems composed of one heavy quark and one diquark and then predict the fate of the mass spectrum and the strong decay widths under chiral symmetry restoration.</description>
