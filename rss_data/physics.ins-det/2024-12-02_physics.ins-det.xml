      <title>Beamtest of a Large Dynamic Range SiPM Readout ASIC MPT2321-B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A front-end readout system with a large dynamic range is required for the high-granularity crystal ECAL at future Higgs factories. A new commercially available ASIC, MPT2321-B, which offers a significantly large dynamic range for the readout of the SiPM, has undergone initial tests both in the laboratory and at a beamtest facility. The fundamental performance metrics, including response linearity and single photon sensitivity, have been characterised. To quantitatively assess the dynamic range of the chip and evaluate its feasibility for SiPM readout in high-granularity crystal ECAL, a beamtest was conducted using scintillating crystals exposed to electron beams. Observations confirmed that the chip exhibits a signal-to-noise ratio sufficient for the operation of the detector and a satisfactory dynamic range, indicating significant potential for future applications.</description>

      <title>Towards a new generation of solid total-energy detectors for neutron-capture time-of-flight experiments with intense neutron beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Challenging neutron-capture cross-section measurements of small cross sections and samples with a very limited number of atoms require high-flux time-of-flight facilities. In turn, such facilities need innovative detection setups that are fast, have low sensitivity to neutrons, can quickly recover from the so-called $\gamma$-flash, and offer the highest possible detection sensitivity. In this paper, we present several steps toward such advanced systems. Specifically, we describe the performance of a high-sensitivity experimental setup at CERN n\_TOF EAR2. It consists of nine sTED detector modules in a compact cylindrical configuration, two conventional used large-volume C$_{6}$D$_{6}$ detectors, and one LaCl$_{3}$(Ce) detector. The performance of these detection systems is compared using $^{93}$Nb($n$,$\gamma$) data. We also developed a detailed \textsc{Geant4} Monte Carlo model of the experimental EAR2 setup, which allows for a better understanding of the detector features, including their efficiency determination. This Monte Carlo model has been used for further optimization, thus leading to a new conceptual design of a $\gamma$ detector array, STAR, based on a deuterated-stilbene crystal array. Finally, the suitability of deuterated-stilbene crystals for the future STAR array is investigaged experimentally utilizing a small stilbene-d12 prototype. The results suggest a similar or superior performance of STAR with respect to other setups based on liquid-scintillators, and allow for additional features such as neutron-gamma discrimination and a higher level of customization capability.</description>

      <title>Study of electron tracks in Timepix3 detector at kinetic energies of 1 and 1.5 MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on measurements of 1 and 1.5 MeV monoenergetic electrons with a Timepix3-based detector using a 0.5 mm thick silicon sensor. A $^{90}$Sr $\beta$-emitting radioisotope was used as the source of electrons, and a monochromator equipped with an adjustable magnetic field was employed to only pass electrons of desired energy into the detector. We provide experimental results of deposited-energy spectrum in the sensor and linearity of detected tracks. Alongside with the experiment, the whole system has been modelled in software and a Monte Carlo Geant4 / Allpix$^2$ simulation of the experiment has been carried out. Generally, we find a good agreement between the two.</description>

      <title>Numerical Calculation of Electric Field Enhancement in Neutron Traps with Rough Walls Coated with Superfluid Helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A film of liquid helium on the surface of material traps for ultracold neutrons protects the neutrons from being absorbed by the trap walls. By using surface roughness and an electrostatic field, it is possible to maintain a helium film of sufficient thickness throughout the height of the trap. The field distribution near the tip of such wall roughness of the trap was calculated, and the effect of this field on holding the helium film was estimated.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous two-dimensional velocity and distance measurements based on laser triangulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser triangulation sensors are widely used in industry for surface inspection due to simple setup, micron precision and low cost. Conventional laser triangulation methods only enable axial distance measurement limiting further applications, and their lateral resolution is limited by surface microstructure. For overcoming these issues, based on the geometric optics we propose novel theoretical models and methods to achieve lateral velocity measurement. Moreover, a novel axial distance measurement method using edge detection is presented, which can increase the lateral resolution by the order of one magnitude. The performance of the proposed methods are validated through simultaneous orthogonal velocity and distance measurements on a moving established metal specimen, showing the relative error and relative uncertainty can reach 10^{-4}. The versatility of this multi degree of freedom measurement method paves the way for its broad application across all laser triangulation systems. Therefore, this simultaneous two-dimensional velocity and distance sensing approach can propel advancements in dynamic behavior discipline, including but not limited to motion mechanology and fluid mechanics.</description>

      <title>Ground electron calibration of the Gamma-ray Transient Monitor onboard DRO-A Satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gamma-Ray Transient Monitor (GTM) is an all-sky monitor onboard the Distant Retrograde Orbit-A (DRO-A) satellite, with the scientific objective of detecting gamma-ray bursts in the energy range of 20 keV to 1 MeV. The GTM is equipped with five Gamma-Ray Transient Probes (GTPs), utilizing silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays coupled with NaI(Tl) scintillators for signal readout. To test the performance of the GTP in detecting electrons, we independently developed a continuous-energy-tunable, low-current, quasi-single-electron accelerator, and used this facility for ground-based electron calibration of the GTP. This paper provides a detailed description of the operational principles of the unique electron accelerator and comprehensively presents the process and results of electron calibration for the GTP. The calibration results indicate that the dead time for normal signals is less than 4 $\mu$s, while for overflow signals, it is approximately 70 $\mu$s, consistent with the design specifications. The GTP's time-recording capability is working correctly, accurately recording overflow events. The GTP responds normally to electrons in the 0.4-1.4 MeV energy range. The ground-based electron calibration validates the design of the GTP and enhances the probe's mass model, laying the foundation for payload development, in-orbit observation strategies, and scientific data analysis.</description>

      <title>Design of structured La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ films as superconducting transition-edge sensors at 4.2K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the effects of carrier-density structuration and patterning on thin films of the cuprate superconductor La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$, in order to optimize its functional characteristics as sensing material for resistive transition-edge bolometers at liquid-He temperature. We perform finite-element computations considering two major contributions to structuration: The intrinsic random nanoscale disorder associated to carrier density nonstoichiometry, plus the imposition of regular arrangements of zones with different nominal carrier densities. Using ad-hoc seek algorithms, we obtain various structuration designs that markedly improve the bolometric performance, mainly the saturation power and dynamic range. Bolometric operation becomes favorable even in the easier-to-implement constant current mode of measurement.</description>

      <title>Proton reconstruction with the TOTEM Roman pot detectors for high-$\beta^*$ LHC data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The TOTEM Roman pot detectors are used to reconstruct the transverse momentum of scattered protons and to estimate the transverse location of the primary interaction. This paper presents new methods of track reconstruction, measurements of strip-level detection efficiencies, cross-checks of the LHC beam optics, and detector alignment techniques, along with their application in the selection of signal collision events. The track reconstruction is performed by exploiting hit cluster information through a novel method using a common polygonal area in the intercept-slope plane. The technique is applied in the relative alignment of detector layers with $\mu$m precision. A tag-and-probe method is used to extract strip-level detection efficiencies. The alignment of the Roman pot system is performed through time-dependent adjustments, resulting in a position accuracy of 3 $\mu$m in the horizontal and 60 $\mu$m in the vertical directions. The goal is to provide an optimal reconstruction tool for central exclusive physics analyses based on the high-$\beta^*$ data-taking period at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV in 2018.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning based photon counting for PMT waveforms and its application to the improvement of the energy resolution in large liquid scintillator detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are widely used in particle experiments for photon detection. PMT waveform analysis is crucial for high-precision measurements of the position and energy of incident particles in liquid scintillator (LS) detectors. A key factor contributing to the energy resolution in large liquid scintillator detectors with PMTs is the charge smearing of PMTs. This paper presents a machine-learning-based photon counting method for PMT waveforms and its application to the energy reconstruction, using the JUNO experiment as an example. The results indicate that leveraging the photon counting information from the machine learning model can partially mitigate the impact of PMT charge smearing and lead to a relative 2.0% to 2.8% improvement on the energy resolution in the energy range of [1, 9] MeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB collider is preparing for an upgrade after 2027-2028 to handle higher luminosity and increased background rates. A Radio Frequency System-on-Chip (RFSoC) has been identified as a potential candidate for a common front-end upgrade for subsystems requiring high-speed waveform digitization. The RFSoC's ADC and DAC channels were tested across various magnetic field strengths and a few different field orientations. Power consumption and boot memory functionality were also assessed. Results indicate stable operation with negligible performance degradation, suggesting the RFSoC's viability for high-speed digitization tasks in high magnetic field environments.</description>

      <title>Uniform Field in Microwave Cavities Through the Use of Effective Magnetic Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wire media (WM) resonators have emerged as promising realization for plasma haloscopes -- devices designed to detect axions, a potential component of dark matter. Key factors influencing the detection probability include cavity volume, resonance quality factor, and form factor. While the form factor has been explored for resonant frequency tuning, its optimization for axion detection remains unexplored. In this work, we present a novel approach to significantly enhance the form factor of WM plasma haloscopes. By shifting the metal walls of the resonator by a quarter wavelength, we effectively convert an electric wall boundary condition into a magnetic wall one, allowing for an almost uniform mode. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations confirm that this modification improves the electric field profile and boosts the form factor. We validate these findings through experimental results from two prototype resonators: one with a standard geometry and another with a quarter-wave air gap between the WM and the walls. Additionally, our method provides a simple way to control the field profile within WM cavities, which can be explored for further applications.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we review the models and their parameters to describe the relative permittivity, bandgap, impact ionization, mobility, charge carrier recombination/effective masses and incomplete dopand ionization of 4H silicon carbide in computer simulations. We aim to lower the entrance barrier for newcomers and provide a critical evaluation of the status quo to identify shortcomings and guide future research. The review reveals a rich set of often diverging values in literature based on a variety of calculation and measurement methods. Although research for all the selected parameters is still active, we show that sometimes old values or those determined for other kinds of silicon carbide are commonly used.</description>
