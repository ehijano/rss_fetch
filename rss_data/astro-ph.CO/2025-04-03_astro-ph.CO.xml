      <title>Encyclopedia Magneticum: Scaling Relations from Cosmic Dawn to Present Day</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy and halo scaling relations, connecting a broad range of parameters, are well established from observations. The origin of many of these relations and their scatter is still a matter of debate. It remains a sizable challenge for models to simultaneously and self-consistently reproduce as many scaling relations as possible. We introduce the Magneticum Pathfinder hydrodynamical cosmological simulation suite, to date the suite that self-consistently covers the largest range in box volumes and resolutions. It is the only cosmological simulation suite that is tuned on the hot gas content of galaxy clusters instead of the stellar mass function. By assessing the successes and shortcomings of tuning to the hot gas component of galaxy clusters, we aim to further our understanding of the physical processes shaping the Universe. We analyze the importance of the hot and cold gas components for galaxy and structure evolution. We analyze 28 scaling relations, covering large-scale global parameters as well as internal properties for halos ranging from massive galaxy clusters down to galaxies, and show their predicted evolution from z=4 to z=0 in comparison with observations. These include the halo-to-stellar-mass and Kennicutt--Schmidt relations, the cosmic star formation rate density as well as the Fundamental Plane. Magneticum Pathfinder matches a remarkable number of the observed scaling relations from z=4 to z=0, including challenging relations like the number density of quiescent galaxies at cosmic dawn, the mass--size evolution, the mass--metallicity relation, the Magorrian relation, and the temperature--mass relation. We compile our data to allow for straightforward future comparisons. Galaxy properties and scaling relations arise naturally and the large scatter in observables at high redshift is crucial to distinguish the various galaxy formation models reproducing the z=0 relations.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey. The Weak-Lensing Mass Calibration and the Stellar Mass-to-Halo Mass Relation from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the weak-lensing mass calibration of 124 galaxy clusters and groups at redshift $0.1&lt;z&lt;0.8$ in the first Data Release of the $eROSITA$ All-Sky Survey ($eRASS1$) and constrain their BCG stellar-mass-to-halo-mass-and-redshift relation, using the data sets from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program. The cluster survey is conducted by the $eROSITA$ X-ray telescope aboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma space observatory. The cluster sample is X-ray-selected and optically confirmed with a negligibly low contamination rate. On a basis of individual clusters, the shear profiles of $96$ clusters are derived using the HSC Three-Year weak-lensing data, while the BCG stellar masses $M_{\star,\mathrm{BCG}}$ of $101$ clusters are estimated using the SED template fitting to the HSC five-band photometry. The count rate ($C_{\mathrm{R}}-M-z$) and BCG stellar mass ($M_{\star,\mathrm{BCG}}-M-z$) relations are simultaneously constrained in a population modelling. The $C_{\mathrm{R}}-M-z$ relation reveals a mass trend of $\propto M^{1.50^{+0.20}_{-0.30}}$, which is steeper than the self-similar prediction, and no deviation from the self-similar redshift scaling. We obtain the power-law indices of the mass ($B_{\mathrm{BCG}} = 0.25^{+0.11}_{-0.15}$) and redshift ($\gamma_{\mathrm{BCG}} = 0.87^{+0.92}_{-0.78}$) scaling for the $M_{\star,\mathrm{BCG}}-M-z$ relation, and find a strong degeneracy between them. By adopting an informative prior on $\gamma_{\mathrm{BCG}}$ to break the degeneracy, we obtain a statistically consistent $M_{\star,\mathrm{BCG}}-M-z$ relation. Our results suggest that the BCG stellar mass at a fixed halo mass has remained stable with a moderate increase since redshift $z\approx0.8$. This finding supports the picture of the ``rapid-then-slow'' BCG formation, where the majority of the stellar mass must have been assembled at much earlier cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping LSS perturbation theory beyond third order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bootstrap techniques relying on the constraints imposed by Extended Galilean Invariance (EGI), have proved to be very useful in the context of perturbation theory of the Large Scale Structure (LSS). It has been formulated in both the Eulerian as well as Lagrangian space. While the Eulerian bootstrap formalism has been successfully applied to both tracer and matter kernels, the application of bootstrap methods in Lagrangian space has so far been restricted to matter. Up to third order, it has been shown that implementing EGI constraints in Eulerian space fully reproduces the bias expansion for tracers. Previous studies have demonstrated that time non-locality affects the bias expansion in a non-trivial way starting from fifth order. Motivated by this fact, we extend the bootstrap approach upto fifth order in both Eulerian and Lagrangian space and demonstrate that it fully captures the time non-local effects. For this, we generalize the Lagrangian bootstrap for tracers, and found that it agrees with the corresponding results obtained in Eulerian space. One of the major challenges in implementing EGI constraints in Eulerian space, is to systematically find out all the "spurious poles" and make them vanish. We have proposed a method that bypasses this difficulty making the procedure tractable at higher orders. From Lagrangian perspective, we have identified coefficients in the tracer kernel whose ratios are independent of tracer properties and may serve as direct probes of the underlying cosmology.</description>

      <title>Initial Conditions from Galaxies: Machine-Learning Subgrid Correction to Standard Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hybrid method for reconstructing the primordial density from late-time halos and galaxies. Our approach involves two steps: (1) apply standard Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) reconstruction to recover the large-scale features in the primordial density field and (2) train a deep learning model to learn small-scale corrections on partitioned subgrids of the full volume. At inference, this correction is then convolved across the full survey volume, enabling scaling to large survey volumes. We train our method on both mock halo catalogs and mock galaxy catalogs in both configuration and redshift space from the Quijote $1(h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Gpc})^3$ simulation suite. When evaluated on held-out simulations, our combined approach significantly improves the reconstruction cross-correlation coefficient with the true initial density field and remains robust to moderate model misspecification. Additionally, we show that models trained on $1(h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Gpc})^3$ can be applied to larger boxes--e.g., $(3h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Gpc})^3$--without retraining. Finally, we perform a Fisher analysis on our method's recovery of the BAO peak, and find that it significantly improves the error on the acoustic scale relative to standard BAO reconstruction. Ultimately, this method robustly captures nonlinearities and bias without sacrificing large-scale accuracy, and its flexibility to handle arbitrarily large volumes without escalating computational requirements makes it especially promising for large-volume surveys like DESI.</description>

      <title>A widely applicable Galaxy Group finder Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy groups are essential for studying the distribution of matter on a large scale in redshift surveys and for deciphering the link between galaxy traits and their associated halos. In this work, we propose a widely applicable method for identifying groups through machine learning techniques in real space taking into account the impact of redshift distortion. Our methodology involves two neural networks: one is a classification model for identifying central galaxy groups, and the other is a regression model for predicting the mass of these groups. Both models input observable galaxy traits, allowing future applicability to real survey data. Testing on simulated datasets indicates our method accurately identifies over $92\%$ of groups with $\mathrm{M}_{vir} \geq 10^{11}h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot$, with $80\%$ achieving a membership completeness of at least $80\%$. The predicted group masses vary by less than 0.3 dex across different mass scales, even in the absence of a priori data. Our network adapts seamlessly to expand to sparse samples with a flux limit of $m_{r} &lt; 14$, to high redshift samples at $z=1.08$, and to galaxy samples from the TNG300 hydrodynamical simulation without further training. Furthermore, the framework can easily adjust to real surveys by training on redshift distorted samples without needing parameter changes. Careful consideration of different observational effects in redshift space makes it promising that this method will be applicable to real galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Quasar Pairs as Large--Scale Structure tracers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasars are effective tracers of the large-scale distribution of galaxies at high redshift thanks to their high luminosity and dedicated surveys. Previous studies have shown that quasars exhibit a bias similar to that of rich groups, indicating that quasar pairs may be linked to higher density environments, serving as protocluster proxies. In this work, we aim to characterize close quasar pairs within the same halo by identifying them in redshift space. We analyze pair-quasar cross correlations and CMB-derived lensing convergence profiles centered in these systems. We have identified 2777 pairs of quasars in the redshift range from 1.2 to 2.8. Quasar pairs exhibit a distribution of relative luminosities that differs from that of random pairs with the same redshift distribution, indicating that quasars in these systems are distinct from isolated ones. The cross-correlation between pairs and quasars shows a larger amplitude than the auto-correlation function of quasars, suggesting these systems are more strongly biased toward the large-scale mass distribution and reside in more massive halos. This is further supported by higher convergence CMB lensing profiles of pairs compared to isolated quasars with a similar redshift distribution. Our results indicate that quasar pairs are suitable precursors to present-day clusters of galaxies, unlike isolated quasars, which are associated with less dense environments.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated Gravitational Lensing &amp; Dynamical (GLaD) Modeling for Cosmology and Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-delay distance measurements from strongly lensed quasars provide a robust, independent method for determining the Hubble constant ($H_0$). This approach cross-checks $H_0$ estimates from the distance ladder in the late universe and the cosmic microwave background in the early universe. However, the mass-sheet degeneracy in lensing models introduces systematic uncertainty, limiting precision. Dynamical modeling complements strong lensing by constraining the mass distribution with independent observational data. We develop a methodology and software framework for joint modeling of stellar kinematics and lensing data. Using simulated data for the lensed quasar RXJ1131$-$1131, we demonstrate that high-quality kinematic data can achieve $\sim$4% precision on $H_0$. Through extensive modeling, we examine the impact of the presence of a supermassive black hole in the lens galaxy and potential systematic biases in kinematic data on $H_0$ measurements. Our results show that imposing priors on black hole mass and orbital anisotropy, or excluding central kinematic bins, mitigates biases in $H_0$ estimates. By testing on mock kinematic data with systematic biases, we highlight the need for sub-percent control of kinematic systematics, which is achievable with current technology. Additionally, we leverage GPU parallelization to accelerate Bayesian inference, reducing a previously month-long process by an order of magnitude. This pipeline offers significant potential for advancing cosmological and galaxy evolution studies with large datasets.</description>

      <title>The CosmoVerse White Paper: Addressing observational tensions in cosmology with systematics and fundamental physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard model of cosmology has provided a good phenomenological description of a wide range of observations both at astrophysical and cosmological scales for several decades. This concordance model is constructed by a universal cosmological constant and supported by a matter sector described by the standard model of particle physics and a cold dark matter contribution, as well as very early-time inflationary physics, and underpinned by gravitation through general relativity. There have always been open questions about the soundness of the foundations of the standard model. However, recent years have shown that there may also be questions from the observational sector with the emergence of differences between certain cosmological probes. In this White Paper, we identify the key objectives that need to be addressed over the coming decade together with the core science projects that aim to meet these challenges. These discordances primarily rest on the divergence in the measurement of core cosmological parameters with varying levels of statistical confidence. These possible statistical tensions may be partially accounted for by systematics in various measurements or cosmological probes but there is also a growing indication of potential new physics beyond the standard model. After reviewing the principal probes used in the measurement of cosmological parameters, as well as potential systematics, we discuss the most promising array of potential new physics that may be observable in upcoming surveys. We also discuss the growing set of novel data analysis approaches that go beyond traditional methods to test physical models. [Abridged]</description>

      <title>Singularity-free cosmology from interactions in the dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker models where a dark energy component with a quadratic equation of state (EoS) nonlinearly interacts with cold dark matter. Thus, two energy scales naturally come into play: $\rho_*$ is the scale at which the nonlinearity of the EoS becomes relevant; $\rho_i$ is the energy scale around which the interaction starts to play an important role in the dynamics. Our focus is to understand whether there are parameter ranges for this system that can produce non-singular bouncing and emergent cosmologies for any initial condition. We complete a dynamical systems analysis, and find the parameter range such that trajectories always expand from a high energy non-singular de Sitter state. For flat and negative curvature models this de Sitter state is represented by a fixed point, the asymptotic past from which the universe emerges from. We find a subset of positive curvature models that during contraction get arbitrarily close to the de Sitter state, thus having a quasi-de Sitter bounce, then emerge from the bounce and expand, evolving toward spatial flatness. We find that the dimensionless parameter $q\equiv \rho_*/\rho_i$, which measures the relative strength of the nonlinear terms in the system, plays a crucial role in the topology of the phase space. When $q &lt; 3$, some trajectories expand toward a singularity, while others evolve toward a low energy cosmological constant at late-times, with a subset going through a decelerated matter dominate era before the final acceleration. When $q &gt; 3$, all trajectories are non-singular, and evolve toward a late-time cosmological constant. We find a subclass in this case in which all trajectories have at least one decelerated matter dominated phase, and accelerate at late-times.</description>

      <title>Characterising galaxy cluster scaling relations as cosmic isotropy tracers using the FLAMINGO simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM, assumes isotropy on large cosmic scales. However, recent studies using galaxy cluster scaling relations reported an apparent $H_0$ anisotropy at $5.4\sigma$ that could be attributed to large bulk flows extending beyond $500\,\mathrm{Mpc}$, in disagreement with $\Lambda$CDM. To quantify the statistical tension of the observational galaxy cluster data used in past studies with $\Lambda$CDM, we utilise the isotropic ($2.8\,\mathrm{Gpc})^3$ run of the FLAMINGO ($\Lambda$CDM) simulations, the largest hydrodynamical cosmological simulation available to date. We create 1728 simulated lightcones and study the apparent level of anisotropy traced by X-ray and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich scaling relations in the same cluster sample selection and methodology as in Migkas et al. (2021, arXiv:2103.13904). We find the probability of such apparent anisotropies randomly emerging in cluster scaling relations within a $\Lambda$CDM universe to be $0.12\%\, (3.2\sigma)$. The discrepancy goes up to $\sim 3.6\sigma$ when modelled as a bulk flow at $z &lt; 0.1$. We find that statistical noise accounts for over $80\%$ of the anisotropy amplitude in each lightcone, with large peculiar velocities contributing less than $20\%$. We also show that anisotropy amplitudes are highly sensitive to the intrinsic scatter in the scaling relations, with tighter relations providing stronger constraints. Nevertheless, the tension between Migkas et al. (2021, arXiv:2103.13904) and $\Lambda$CDM persists, however, at a lower significance than previously reported.</description>

      <title>Probing the Distance Duality Relation with Machine Learning and Recent Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distance duality relation (DDR) relates two independent ways of measuring cosmological distances, namely the angular diameter distance and the luminosity distance. These can be measured with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), respectively. Here, we use recent DESI DR1, Pantheon+, SH0ES and DES-SN5YR data to test this fundamental relation. We employ a parametrised approach and also use model-independent Generic Algorithms (GA), which are a machine learning method where functions evolve loosely based on biological evolution. When we use DESI and Pantheon+ data without Cepheid calibration or big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), there is a $2\sigma$ violation of the DDR in the parametrised approach. Then, we add high-redshift BBN data and the low-redshift SH0ES Cepheid calibration. This reflects the Hubble tension since both data sets are in tension in the standard cosmological model $\Lambda$CDM. In this case, we find a significant violation of the DDR in the parametrised case at $6\sigma$. Replacing the Pantheon+ SNe Ia data by DES-SN5YR, we find similar results. For the model-independent approach, we find no deviation in the uncalibrated case and a small deviation with BBN and Cepheids which remains at 1$\sigma$. This shows the importance of considering model-independent approaches for the DDR.</description>

      <title>Interference with Gravitational Instability: Hot and Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave or fuzzy dark matter produced with high momenta behaves in many ways like hot particle dark matter while also possessing seemingly different phenomenology due to wave interference. We develop wave perturbation theory to show that white noise density fluctuations generated by the interference of high-momenta waves are gravitationally unstable in the usual way during matter domination above the free streaming scale and stabilize below the free streaming scale, much like the analogous effects for massive neutrinos in hot dark matter. We verify and illustrate these effects in the density power spectra of Newtonian Schr\"odinger-Poisson simulations. In the cosmological context, this would cause a gradual suppression of the initial white noise isocurvature perturbations below the free streaming scale at matter radiation equality, unlike cold dark matter isocurvature fluctuations, and virial stability of dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>Individual halo bias in models of $f(R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halo bias links the statistical properties of the spatial distribution of dark matter halos to those of the underlying dark matter field, providing insights into clustering properties in both general relativity (GR) and modified-gravity scenarios such as $f(R)$ models. While the primary halo mass-dependent bias has been studied in detailed, the secondary bias, which accounts for the additional dependencies on other internal halo properties, can offer a sensitive probe for testing gravity beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model. To quantify any potential deviations between $\Lambda$CDM and $f(R)$ gravity models in halo clustering, at both the primary and secondary level, as well as in the distributions of halo properties in the cosmic web. Using $N$-body simulations of $f(R)$ gravity models, we assess the scaling relations and the primary and secondary bias signals of halo populations on the basis of a halo-by-halo estimator of large-scale effective bias. Our analysis is performed using halo number density as the independent variable. The relative difference in the effective bias between the $f(R)$ models and $\Lambda$CDM is sensitive, albeit slightly, to the power index of modified gravity. The largest deviations from GR are measured for low-mass halos, where the average bias at fixed number density decreases by up to 5\% for fixed scaling indices. We also show that the scaling relations for some environmental properties, including neighbour statistics, Mach number and local overdensity, exhibit small but non-negligible deviations (~3-5\%) from GR for a wide range of number densities. Our results also suggests that the properties of halos in sheets and voids show the largest departures from GR (&gt; 10\% in some cases). In terms of secondary bias, we do not find any statistically significant deviations with respect to $\Lambda$CDM for any of the properties explored in this work.</description>

      <title>Shedding Infrared Light on QCD Axion and ALP Dark Matter with JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened up a new chapter in infrared astronomy. Besides the discovery and a deeper understanding of various astrophysical sources, JWST can also uncover the non-gravitational nature of dark matter (DM). If DM is QCD axion or an eV-scale Axion-like particle (ALP), it can decay into two photons in the infrared band. This will produce a distinct line signature in the spectroscopic observations made by JWST. Using the latest NIRSpec IFU spectroscopic observations from JWST, we put the strongest bound on the photon coupling for QCD axion/ ALP DM in the mass range between 0.47 and 2.55 eV. In particular, we are able to probe a new mass range for ALP DM between $\sim$ 0.47 eV to 0.78 eV beyond what can be probed by globular cluster observations. We constrain well-motivated and UV complete models of QCD axion and ALP DM, including predictions from some models derived from string theory and/ or various Grand Unification scenarios. Future JWST observations of DM-rich systems with a better understanding of the astrophysical and instrumental backgrounds can thus enable us to potentially discover QCD axion and ALP DM.

      <title>General relativistic effects on photon spectrum emitted from dark matter halos around primordial black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate general relativistic effects on the photon spectrum emitted from decaying (or annihilating) particle dark matter in the halo surrounding a primordial black hole. The spectrum undergoes significant modification due to gravitational redshifts, which induces broadening as a result of the intense gravitational field near the black hole. This characteristic alteration in the photon spectrum presents a unique observational signature. Future observations of such spectral features may provide critical evidence for a mixed dark matter scenario, involving both primordial black holes and particle dark matter.</description>

      <title>Cluster-lensed supernova yields from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through gravitational lensing, galaxy clusters can magnify supernovae (SNe) and create multiple images of the same SN. This enables measurements of cosmological parameters, which will be increasingly important in light of upcoming telescopic surveys. We study the prospects of detecting strongly lensed SNe in cluster fields with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman)'s High Latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS) and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We employed two approaches: one focusing on known multiply imaged galaxies behind clusters, along with the SN rates specific to those galaxies, and another based on the expected number of lensed SNe exploding in a given volume behind a galaxy cluster. We collected all the clusters in the literature that feature a well-constrained lens model and multiply imaged galaxies behind clusters with high-quality data for the lensed galaxies. This allowed us to determine the SN rate for each galaxy. We provide predictions for 46 clusters visible to the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, as well as for 9 observable by Roman's HLTDS, depending on whether the clusters fall within the survey's observing field. We predict that the number of multiply imaged SNe discovered by LSST in its first three years is $3.95 \pm 0.89$ from the first approach or $4.94 \pm 1.02$ from the second. For the HLTDS, the expected number of multiply imaged SNe ranges from $0.38 \pm 0.15$ to $5.2 \pm 2.2$, depending on the specific cluster observed, however, the fields to be targeted remain a matter of discussion. We conclude that LSST offers great prospects for detecting multiply imaged SNe. Our predictions are effectively lower limits, as we only considered the most massive and well-studied clusters. We provide a recommendation for HLTDS observing field selection, namely: either MACS J0553.4-3342 or Abell 1758a should be observed by the survey.</description>

      <title>Formation and Environmental Context of Giant Bulgeless Disk Galaxies in the Early Universe: Insights from Cosmological Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Giant bulgeless disk galaxies, theoretically expected to be rare in the early Universe, have been confirmed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to exist as early as 2 billion years after the Big Bang. These morphologically extreme systems offer valuable insights into the physics of disk formation and the interplay between galaxies and their dark-matter halos. Using cosmological simulations, we identify analogs of such galaxies with stellar masses around $10^{11} M_\odot$ and half-light radii up to 6 kpc at $z \sim 3$ and characterize the factors that contribute to their formation. These galaxies form in young cosmic knots, populating host halos of high spin, low concentration, and spherical shapes. They feature dynamically coherent circum-galactic medium, as well as gas-rich, coherent mergers, which preserve their disk morphology and drive their large sizes. Interestingly, all the simulated giant disks harbor a compact, aligned inner disk, marginally resolvable in JWST images with a S\'ersic index near unity. These findings highlight the environmental and structural conditions necessary for forming and sustaining giant bulgeless disks and provide a theoretical framework for interpreting JWST observations of extreme disk morphologies in the early Universe.</description>

Abstract: Steven Weinberg productive scientific life teaches us many things, one of the most important of which is the power of his example. This essay contains personal reminiscences and a speculation about gravitational wave propagation based on one of his very last papers -- as seems fitting, given his penchant for putting interesting physics into the essays he wrote for other luminaries over the years. (See arXiv:2502.10979 [physics.hist-ph] for a less personal summary of his main scientific accomplishments.)</description>

      <title>Power Spectra in Double-Field Inflation Using Renormalization-Group Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A perturbative strategy for inflation described by two-inflaton fields is developed using a mathematical analogy with the renormalization-group. Two small quantities, $\alpha$ and $\lambda$, corresponding to standard slow-roll parameters are defined and systematic expansions of all inflationary quantities in terms of powers of $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ are found. No other slow-roll parameters are needed. To illustrate this perturbative method in the multi-field context, we adopt a simple two-inflaton model with quadratic potentials in the parameter range where both fields contribute similarly to the dynamics of inflation. The model, even though it is not a viable alternative for phenomenological description of the inflationary period, nicely illustrates subtleties of the perturbative approach. In particular, this method allows us to derive two independent gauge-invariant scalar perturbations that are conserved in the superhorizon limit, overcoming typical problems that emerge in multi-field inflation. Furthermore, it is possible to perform nonperturbative resummations that allow to study the model in a true multi-field regime. We derive tensor and scalar power spectra to the next-to-next-to-leading and next-to-leading orders, respectively, as well as their spectral indices. The hierarchy between the two scalar perturbations allows us to single out the dominant entry of the scalar power-spectrum matrix. Modifications due to the second inflaton occur already at the leading order. Finally, we explain why the quadratic two-inflaton model is not compatible with the present experimental constraints even though non-trivial corrections to scalar perturbations do emerge.</description>

      <title>Impact of cosmic web on the properties of galaxies in IllustrisTNG simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the cosmic web on galaxy properties in the IllustrisTNG simulations. To disentangle the effects of galaxy groups and cosmic filaments, we classify the cosmic web environment into four categories: group, group-dominated, filament-dominated, and field. By controlling for stellar mass, we reveal evident differences in specific star formation rates (sSFR), quenched fraction, gas fractions, local density, and stellar ages among central galaxies in different cosmic web environments, particularly for lower-mass galaxies. However, these differences largely diminish when the effect of local overdensity is further accounted for, indicating its dominant role. Additionally, we observe distinct differences in these properties among satellite galaxies across environments, mainly driven by stellar mass, halo mass, and overdensity. Notably, residual differences between satellites in field and filament-dominated region persist even after controlling for these factors, suggesting a stronger susceptibility of satellite galaxies to filaments compared to centrals. Our findings highlight the importance of differentiating between central and satellite to accurately assess the environmental effects of the cosmic web. Our analysis suggests that the relationship between galaxy properties and their distance from filaments arises from a combination of factors, including stellar and halo mass, groups, overdensity, and the intrinsic influence of the cosmic web. Additionally, we find that the effect of the cosmic web on galaxy properties is reduced at $z=0.5$, compared to $z=0$. Furthermore, central galaxies near thick filaments tend to exhibit slightly to moderately lower sSFR and cold gas fractions compared to those near thin filaments.</description>

      <title>Inflation with Gauss-Bonnet correction: beyond slow-roll</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If a coupling between the inflaton and the Gauss-Bonnet term is introduced, many models of inflation that were ruled out by the most recent Planck data can be made viable again. The predictions for the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio are typically computed using the slow-roll approximation. In this paper we instead study the full equations of motion and determine the necessary initial conditions for reasonable inflation epoch. We derive the conditions under which the Friedmann equation admits positive solutions for the Hubble parameter. Then we study the possibility of the inflaton becoming trapped in a local potential minimum induced by the Gauss-Bonnet term. Finally we demonstrate the results on monomial potential models with a quadratic and a quartic potential and show that the slow-roll approximation becomes imprecise in the quartic case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of general $U(1)$ scenario, we demonstrate that the ultra high energy neutrinos recently detected by KM3NeT could originate from a decaying right handed neutrino dark matter (DM), with a mass of 440 PeV. Considering DM production via freeze-in, we delineate the parameter space that satisfies the observed relic abundance and also lies within the reach of multiple gravitational wave detectors. Our study provides a testable new physics scenario, enabled by multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Brans-Dicke scalar-tensor cosmological models are studied in both Einstein and Jordan frames, using hydrodynamical and self-interacting scalar field representations of the energy-momentum tensor, leading to the same background solutions. The main features of the corresponding cosmological scenarios are determined. In many cases, we identify a transition from decelerated to accelerated regimes. The properties of the self-interacting scalar field, including the corresponding potential, are determined. Finally, some possible realistic configurations are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Nature of Virgil: An Obscured AGN Lurking Within an Apparently Normal Lyman-{\alpha} Emitter During Cosmic Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the MIRI Extremely Red Object Virgil, a Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter at $z_{spec} = 6.6379 \pm 0.0035$ with the photometric properties of a Little Red Dot. Leveraging new JWST/MIRI imaging from the MIDIS and PAHSPECS programs, we confirm Virgil's extraordinary nature among galaxies in JADES/GOODS-South, exhibiting a strikingly red NIRCam-to-MIRI color (F444W $-$ F1500W = $2.84\pm0.04$~mag). Deep NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy from the OASIS program offers key insights into the host galaxy, revealing properties of an average star-forming galaxy during Cosmic Reionization, such as a subsolar metallicity, low-to-moderate dust content, and a relatively high ionization parameter and electron temperature. By estimating the star formation rate of Virgil from UV and H$\alpha$, we find evidence that the galaxy is either entering or fading out of a bursty episode. Although line-ratio diagnostics employed at high-$z$ would classify Virgil as an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), this classification becomes ambiguous once redshift evolution is considered. Nonetheless, Virgil occupies the same parameter space as recently confirmed AGNs at similar redshifts. The new deep MIRI data at 15~$\mu$m reinforce the AGN nature of Virgil, as inferred from multiple spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes. Virgil's rising infrared SED and UV excess resemble those of Dust-Obscured Galaxies (DOGs) studied with Spitzer at Cosmic Noon, particularly blue-excess HotDOGs. Our results highlight the need for a multi-wavelength approach incorporating MIRI to uncover such extreme sources at $z\gtrsim6$ and to shed light on the interplay between galaxy evolution and early black hole growth during Cosmic Reionization.</description>

      <title>A minimal Pati-Salam theory: from cosmic defects to gravitational waves and colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a minimal renormalizable Pati-Salam theory based on the $SU(4)_{\rm C}\,\times\,SU(2)_{\rm L}\,\times\,SU(2)_{\rm R}$ gauge group, with unification scale Higgs multiplets taken as $SU(2)_{\rm L}$ and $SU(2)_{\rm R}$ doublets, which lead to neutrino Dirac picture. Although a number of scalar particles could be light, even lying at the LHC energies, the unification scale is hopelessly out of reach in any foreseeable future. Moreover, phase transition in the early Universe leads to the production of magnetic monopoles and domain walls, both incompatible with the standard cosmological model. A small explicit breaking of the discrete left-right symmetry allows the domain walls to decay, and in the process possibly sweep away the monopoles, analogously to the previously discussed case of $SU(5)$ grand unified theory. This leaves an important imprint of gravitational waves, within the reach of next generation searches, correlated with monopole detection and new light particles at collider energies. The theory has a dark matter candidate in the form of an inert scalar doublet, with a mass below TeV, which can further trigger electroweak baryogenesis.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-based model of galaxy power spectrum: Fast full-shape galaxy power spectrum analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Neural Network based emulator for the galaxy redshift-space power spectrum that enables several orders of magnitude acceleration in the galaxy clustering parameter inference, while preserving 3$\sigma$ accuracy better than 0.5\% up to $k_{\mathrm{max}}$=0.25$h^{-1}Mpc$ within $\Lambda$CDM and around 0.5\% $w_0$-$w_a$CDM. Our surrogate model only emulates the galaxy bias-invariant terms of 1-loop perturbation theory predictions, these terms are then combined analytically with galaxy bias terms, counter-terms and stochastic terms in order to obtain the non-linear redshift space galaxy power spectrum. This allows us to avoid any galaxy bias prescription in the training of the emulator, which makes it more flexible. Moreover, we include the redshift $z \in [0,1.4]$ in the training which further avoids the need for re-training the emulator. We showcase the performance of the emulator in recovering the cosmological parameters of $\Lambda$CDM by analysing the suite of 25 AbacusSummit simulations that mimic the DESI Luminous Red Galaxies at $z=0.5$ and $z=0.8$, together as the Emission Line Galaxies at $z=0.8$. We obtain similar performance in all cases, demonstrating the reliability of the emulator for any galaxy sample at any redshift in $0 &lt; z &lt; 1.4$</description>

      <title>The mass effect -- Variations of the electron mass and their impact on cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16845v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We summarize and explain the current status of time variations of the electron mass in cosmology, showing that such variations allow for significant easing of the Hubble tension, from the current $\sim5\sigma$ significance, down to between $3.4\sigma$ and $1.0\sigma$ significance, depending on the precise model and data. Electron mass variations are preferred by Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data in combination with the latest results on baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) and type Ia supernovae at a level of significance between $2\sigma$ and $3.6\sigma$ depending on the model and the data. This preference for a model involving an electron mass variation is neither tightly constrained from light element abundances generated during big bang nucleosynthesis nor from post-recombination observations using quasars and atomic clocks, though future data is expected to give strong evidence in favor of or against this model.</description>

Abstract: We study the possibility of accommodating both early and late-time tensions using a novel reinforcement learning technique. By applying this technique, we aim to optimize the evolution of the Hubble parameter from recombination to the present epoch, addressing both tensions simultaneously. To maximize the goodness of fit, our learning technique achieves a fit that surpasses even the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our results demonstrate a tendency to weaken both early and late time tensions in a completely model-independent manner.</description>

      <title>Modeling parity-violating spectra in Galactic dust polarization with filaments and its applications to cosmic birefringence searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06214v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the dust-filament-based model presented in Herv\'ias-Caimapo &amp; Huffenberger 2022 to produce parity-violating foreground spectra by manipulating the filament orientations relative to the magnetic field. We calibrate our model to observations of the misalignment angle using cross-correlations of Planck and HI 21-cm line data, producing a fiducial model that predicts a $\mathcal{D}_{\ell}^{EB}\sim$few $\mu$K$^2$ dust signal at 353 GHz and where $\sim 56$\% of filaments have a positive misalignment angle. The main purpose of this model is to be used as dust with non-zero parity-violating emission in forecasting a measurement of cosmic birefringence by upcoming experiments. Here, we also use our fiducial model to assess the impact of dust in measurements of the isotropic cosmic birefringence angle $\beta$ with Planck data by measuring the misalignment angle as a function of scale, as well as directly using our model's $\mathcal{D}_{\ell}^{EB}$ prediction as a template. In both cases, we measure $\beta$ to be consistent within $0.83\sigma$ of the analyses that use the 353 GHz channel of Planck to constrain the filamentary misalignment or that use the commander sky model as a template for the dust $\mathcal{D}_{\ell}^{EB}$ spectrum. We attribute this consistency to the extra degrees of freedom introduced by the ad-hoc amplitude parameters for the dust parity-violating spectrum, which are capable of absorbing most of the differences between the model and data as long as a reasonable dust model is provided.</description>

      <title>Average energy of the X-ray spectrum as a model-independent proxy for the mass of galaxy clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temperature of the hot gas in galaxy clusters is known to be a reliable proxy for their total gravitating mass, allowing one to use spectroscopic X-ray observations for halo mass function measurements. Data of shallow wide area surveys, however, often precludes direct fitting of the X-ray spectra, given possible biases arising due to unresolved (multi-temperature) inner structure of the intracluster medium (ICM), projection effects and necessity of certain model assumptions to be made to allow for robust spectral fitting. We consider using a simple observable value - the average energy of the observed cluster X-ray spectrum - as a model-independent proxy for the ICM temperature, and consequently cluster's mass. We calibrate relation of this proxy to the cluster parameters using mock observations for a sample of 84 massive galaxy clusters extracted from the \textit{Magneticum} cosmological hydro simulations. We consider observational parameters corresponding to the all-sky survey observations by \textit{SRG/eROSITA}. Taking into account contributions of various background and foreground signals, average energy of the simulated X-ray spectra in the $0.4-7.0$ keV band is shown to be a stable indicator of the ICM temperature with $\sim10\%$ scatter and cluster's mass $M_{500}$ with a $\sim 20\%$ scatter. A database containing simulated X-ray images and their spectra (subtracted in several concentric rings) is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlation between the curvature perturbations and magnetic fields in pure ultra slow roll inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the aim of producing significant number of primordial black holes, over the past few years, there has been a considerable interest in examining models of inflation involving a single, canonical field, that permit a brief period of ultra slow roll. Earlier, we had examined inflationary magnetogenesis - achieved by breaking the conformal invariance of the electromagnetic action through a coupling to the inflaton - in situations involving departures from slow roll. We had found that a transition from slow roll to ultra slow roll inflation can lead to a strong blue tilt in the spectrum of the magnetic field over small scales and also considerably suppress its strength over large scales. In this work, we consider the scenario of pure ultra slow roll inflation and show that scale invariant magnetic fields can be obtained in such situations with the aid of a non-conformal coupling function that depends on the kinetic energy of the inflaton. Apart from the power spectrum, an important probe of the primordial magnetic fields are the three-point functions, specifically, the cross-correlation between the curvature perturbations and the magnetic fields. We calculate the three-point cross-correlation between the curvature perturbations and the magnetic fields in pure ultra slow roll inflation for the new choice of the non-conformal coupling function. In particular, we examine the validity of the consistency condition that is expected to govern the three-point function in the squeezed limit and comment on the wider implications of the results we obtain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.09193v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences provide a unique laboratory to test properties of compact objects. As alternatives to the ordinary black holes in general relativity, various exotic compact objects have been proposed. Some of them have largely different values of the tidal deformability and spin-induced quadrupole moment from those of black holes, and their binaries could be distinguished from the binary black hole by using gravitational waves emitted during their inspiral regime, excluding the highly model-dependent merger and ringdown regimes. We reanalyze gravitational waves from low-mass merger events in the GWTC-2, detected by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. Focusing on the influence of tidal deformability and spin-induced quadrupole moment in the inspiral waveform, we provide model-independent constraints on deviations from the standard binary black hole case. We find that all events that we have analyzed are consistent with the waveform of the binary black hole in general relativity. Bayesian model selection shows that the hypothesis that the binary is composed of exotic compact objects is disfavored by all events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08267v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain the accretion, evaporation and superradiance phase diagram of astrophysical and primordial black holes in the mass range $10^{-33}-10^{11} \, M_\odot $. This black hole mass range corresponds to production of $10^{-21} - 10^{21}$ eV particles for superradiance (bosons) and evaporation (bosons and fermions). Only accretion and superradiance processes are relevant for heavy black holes, on the other hand for light black holes of primordial origin, all three processes can be relevant. We find that superradiance instability can happen even for black hole spin values as low as $10^{-9}-10^{-2}$. Since light black holes are very unstable to these perturbations and sensitive probes of bosonic particles, a single moderately spinning BH can probe 2-9 orders of magnitude of mass parameter space depending on the nature of the perturbations that are scalar (axion), vector (dark photon and/or photon with effective mass) and spin-2. If spinning black holes are observed and superradiance is not observed, possibly due to self-interactions, we find limits on the axion/scalar decay constant and energy density. We generalize these bounds for vector and spin-2 fields.</description>

Two types of non-minimal couplings are considered: $\xi\varphi^2\cal{R}$ for both natural (referred to as NM-N) and for Coleman-Weinberg (referred to as NM-CW) inflation, and $\alpha\left(1+\cos(\frac{\varphi}{f_a})\right)$ only for natural inflation (referred to as NMP-N), where $\alpha$ and $\xi$ are dimensionless parameters and $f_a$ is an energy scale. We determine benchmark values for slow roll inflationary scenarios satisfying current bounds from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation measurement and find the mass of inflaton to be $m_\phi\sim {\cal O}\left(10^{12}\right) \text{GeV}$ for all three inflationary scenarios and tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r\sim 0.0177$ (for NM-N), $\sim 0.0097$ (for NMP-N), and $r\sim 0.0157$ (for NM-CW) which fall inside $1-\sigma$ contour on scalar spectral index versus $r$ plane of Planck2018+BICEP3+KeckArray2018 joint analysis, and can be probed by future CMN~observations e.g. Simons Observatory. We then show that dark matter particles produced from the decay of inflaton can fully match the present-day cold dark matter (CDM) yield, as well as other cosmological constraints, if the coupling value between inflaton and dark matter, $y_\chi$, and the dark matter mass, $m_\chi$, are within the range $10^{-1}\gtrsim y_\chi\gtrsim 10^{-20}$ for NM-N and NMP-N ($10^{-4}\gtrsim y_\chi\gtrsim 10^{-20}$ for NM-CW) and ${\cal O}\left(\text{keV}\right)\lesssim m_\chi\lesssim m_\phi/2$ (for NM-N, NMP-N, and NM-CW). The exact range of $y_\chi$ and $m_\chi$ varies with different benchmark values as well as parameters of inflation, like energy scale of inflation and $r$, some of which are within reach of next-generation CMB experiments.</description>

      <title>Coherent Self-Interactions of Dark Matter in the Bullet Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many models of dark matter include self-interactions beyond gravity. A variety of astrophysical observations have previously been used to place limits on the strength of such self-interactions. However, previous works have generally focused either on short-range interactions resulting in individual dark matter particles scattering from one another, or on effectively infinite-range interactions which sum over entire dark matter halos. In this work, we focus on the intermediate regime: forces with range much larger than dark matter particles' inter-particle spacing, but still shorter than the length scales of known halos. We show that gradients in the dark matter density of such halos would still lead to observable effects. We focus primarily on effects in the Bullet Cluster, where finite-range forces would lead either to a modification of the collision velocity of the cluster or to a separation of the dark matter and the galaxies of each cluster after the collision. We also consider constraints from the binding of ultrafaint dwarf galaxy halos, and from gravitational lensing of the Abell 370 cluster. Taken together, these observations allow us to set the strongest constraints on dark matter self-interactions over many orders of magnitude in range below $\sim10$ kpc, surpassing existing limits by orders of magnitude throughout.</description>

      <title>Detecting Extragalactic Axion-like Dark Matter with Polarization Measurements of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00473v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) are one of the promising dark matter (DM) candidates. A prevalent method to detect axion-like DM is to seek periodic oscillation in the polarization angles (PAs) of linearly polarized light emitted from astrophysical sources. In this work, we use the time-resolved polarization measurements of the hyperactive repeating fast radio burst, FRB 20220912A, detected by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) to search for extragalactic axion-like DM. Given a DM density profile of FRB 20220912A's host, we obtain upper limits on the ALP-photon coupling constant of $g_{a \gamma}&lt;(3.4 \times 10^{-11}-1.9\times 10^{-9})\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for the ALP masses $m_a \sim (1.4\times10^{-21}-5.2\times10^{-20})\,\mathrm{eV}$. Persistent polarimetric observations with FAST would extend the constraints to lower masses. Although the $g_{a \gamma}$ constraints derived from FRBs are less competitive than those from other methods, FRBs offer an alternative way to detect axion-like DM on extragalactic distance scales, complementary to galactic DM probes.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Long-Ranged Interactions Between Dark Matter and the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter's existence is known thanks to its gravitational interaction with Standard Model particles, but it remains unknown whether this is the only force present between them. While many searches for such new interactions with dark matter focus on short-range, contact-like interactions, it is also possible that there exist weak, long-ranged forces between dark matter and the Standard Model. In this work, we present two types of constraints on such new interactions. First, we consider constraints arising from the fact that such a force would also induce long range interactions between Standard Model particles themselves, as well as between dark matter particles themselves. Combining the constraints on these individual forces generally sets the strongest constraints available on new Standard Model-dark matter interactions. Second, we consider the possibility of constraining new long-ranged interactions between dark matter and the Standard Model using the effects of dynamical friction in ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, especially Segue I. Such new interactions would accelerate the transfer of kinetic energy from stars to their surrounding dark matter, slowly reducing their orbits; the present-day stellar half-light radius of Segue I therefore allows us to exclude new forces which would have reduced stars' orbital radii below this scale by now.</description>

      <title>BBN Constraint on Heavy Neutrino Production and Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraint on heavy neutrino that is a mixture of gauge singlet fermion and active neutrinos in the Standard Model. We work in the minimal model with only two parameters, the heavy neutrino mass $m_4$ and the mixing parameter $|U_{a4}|^2$, where $a=e$, $\mu$, or $\tau$ stands for the active neutrino flavor. We show that both the early universe production mechanism and decay products of the heavy neutrino are determined by $m_4$ and $|U_{a4}|^2$, with little room for further assumptions. This predictivity allows us to present a portrait of the entire BBN excluded parameter space. Our analysis includes various effects including temporary matter domination, energy injections in the form of charged mesons, photons and light neutrinos. The BBN constraint is complementary to terrestrial search for heavy neutrinos (heavy neutral leptons) behind the origin of neutrino masses and portal to the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of Dirac neutrino EFTs up to dimension six</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gauge-singlet right-handed neutrinos would be essential to explain tiny masses of active neutrinos. We consider the effective field theory of the Standard Model extended with these fields under the assumption that neutrinos are Dirac particles. In this framework, we provide a comprehensive study for the phenomenological consequences of various dimension six interactions employing various high and low energy observables. These include the neutrino mass itself, constraints from electroweak precision test and collider searches for lepton or jet plus missing energy, as well as decays of proton, meson, tau and top. We also study their astrophysical and cosmological implications for stellar cooling and relativistic degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>The Quest for the Origins of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made over the past decades towards unveiling the sources of the most energetic particles in nature, the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). Despite these advancements, the exact astrophysical sites capable of accelerating these particles to such extreme energies remain largely unknown. Moreover, the mechanisms by which they achieve these extreme energies are poorly understood. Here, I provide a concise overview of the theory underlying the acceleration and propagation of UHECRs. I then critically discuss three recent results that could help unveil their origins: the reported excess around Centaurus A, the correlation with starburst galaxies, and the efforts to jointly model the energy spectrum, composition, and arrival directions. Finally, I discuss strategies for advancing this field, emphasising the need for refined theoretical models, the challenges in building them, and the potential for new observatories to shed light on the mysteries of UHECRs.</description>

      <title>Scattering of wave dark matter by supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent simulations of wave dark matter around black hole binaries revealed the formation of a universal density profile that co-rotates with the binary. We derive this profile from first principles, interpreting it as the steady state of a scattering process. We find that the scattering becomes particularly efficient when the ratio of the binary separation to the dark matter's de Broglie wavelength assumes certain discrete values, which can be interpreted as bound state resonances. After estimating the amount of dark matter that undergoes this type of scattering off supermassive black hole binaries at galactic centers, we demonstrate that the process can induce an observable modification of the slope of the Pulsar Timing Array spectrum. This opens up a new possibility to gain insights on the nature of dark matter from observations of low-frequency gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>On matching galaxy number densities to reconstruct galaxy evolutionary tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cumulative number density matching approach equates number densities between adjacent redshifts to derive empirical galaxy evolution tracks from the observed galaxy stellar mass function. However, it is well known that this approach overlooks scatter in mass assembly histories and merger effects, with previous studies relying on model-based corrections, either from hydrodynamical cosmological simulations or adjustments to the evolution of cumulative number density with redshift. Here, we revisit this approach, showing that dark matter halo assembly histories imply evolving number densities that are far from constant. These exhibit an average slope of $d \log n_\text{vir} /dz \sim 0.2$ dex for progenitors at $z=0$, leading to evolutionary tracks where galaxies are $\sim2-3$ times smaller in mass at $z\sim2$ and an order of magnitude smaller by $z\sim7$ compared to the number density matching approach. We show that evolving halo number densities provide realistic evolutionary tracks without relying on model-based corrections. Accounting for random errors in stellar mass measurements is also crucial for robust track derivation. We also discuss a generalization that incorporates a galaxy's star formation activity. When additionally considering the scatter around the $M_\ast-M_\text{vir}$ relation ($\sim0.15$ dex), our evolving halo cumulative number density approach shows that some observed stellar masses, $M_{\text{obs},\ast}$, can exceed the universal baryon fraction $f_\text{bar}\sim0.16$. For instance, at $z=5$, around $2\%$ of progenitor galaxies of haloes with $M_\text{vir} \sim 3\times 10^{12}\,M_\odot$ have $M_{\text{obs},\ast}&gt;f_\text{bar} \; M_\text{vir}$, suggesting a potential ``early galaxy formation problem''. However, when deconvolving mass from random errors this tension is reduced with significant confidence at the $\sim5-6\sigma$ level.</description>
