      <title>Merton's Problem with Recursive Perturbed Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Merton investment problem predicts deterministic, state-dependent portfolio rules; however, laboratory and field evidence suggests that individuals often prefer randomized decisions leading to stochastic and noisy choices. Fudenberg et al. (2015) develop the additive perturbed utility theory to explain the preference for randomization in the static setting, which, however, becomes ill-posed or intractable in the dynamic setting. We introduce the recursive perturbed utility (RPU), a special stochastic differential utility that incorporates an entropy-based preference for randomization into a recursive aggregator. RPU endogenizes the intertemporal trade-off between utilities from randomization and bequest via a discounting term dependent on past accumulated randomization, thereby avoiding excessive randomization and yielding a well-posed problem. In a general Markovian incomplete market with CRRA preferences, we prove that the RPU-optimal portfolio policy (in terms of the risk exposure ratio) is Gaussian and can be expressed in closed form, independent of wealth. Its variance is inversely proportional to risk aversion and stock volatility, while its mean is based on the solution to a partial differential equation. Moreover, the mean is the sum of a myopic term and an intertemporal hedging term (against market incompleteness) that intertwines with policy randomization. Finally, we carry out an asymptotic expansion in terms of the perturbed utility weight to show that the optimal mean policy deviates from the classical Merton policy at first order, while the associated relative wealth loss is of a higher order, quantifying the financial cost of the preference for randomization.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Approach to Financial Market Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper treats the financial market as a communication system, using four information-theoretic assumptions to derive an idealized model with only one parameter. State variables are scalar stationary diffusions. The model minimizes the surprisal of the market and the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the benchmark-neutral pricing measure and the real-world probability measure. The state variables, their sums, and the growth optimal portfolio of the stocks evolve as squared radial Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes in respective activity times.</description>

      <title>Optimal Reinsurance under Endogenous Default and Background Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies an optimal reinsurance problem for a utility-maximizing insurer, subject to the reinsurer's endogenous default and background risk. An endogenous default occurs when the insurer's contractual indemnity exceeds the reinsurer's available reserve, which is random due to the background risk. We obtain an analytical solution to the optimal contract for two types of reinsurance contracts, differentiated by whether their indemnity functions depend on the reinsurer's background risk. The results shed light on the joint effect of the reinsurer's default and background risk on the insurer's reinsurance demand.</description>
