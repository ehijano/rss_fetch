      <title>A fast Solver for Pentadiagonal Toeplitz Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this work is to present a novel approach for the solution of Pentadiagonal Toeplitz systems of equations that is both faster and more effective than existing classical direct methods. The distinctive structure of Pentadiagonal Toeplitz matrices can be leveraged to devise an algorithm for solving upper triangle systems, rather than the original system. This approach is considerably more straightforward and expeditious than classical methods such as LU and Gauss Eliminations. A comparison with the LU and PLU methods demonstrates the efficacy of our novel algorithm. Furthermore, numerical tests substantiate this efficacy.</description>

      <title>Coupling of the Finite Element Method with Physics Informed Neural Networks for the Multi-Fluid Flow Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-fluid flows are found in various industrial processes, including metal injection molding and 3D printing. The accuracy of multi-fluid flow modeling is determined by how well interfaces and capillary forces are represented. In this paper, the multi-fluid flow problem is discretized using a combination of a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) with a finite element discretization. To determine the best PINN formulation, a comparative study is conducted using a manufactured solution. We compare interface reinitialization methods to determine the most suitable approach for our discretization strategy. We devise a neural network architecture that better handles complex free surface topologies. Finally, the coupled numerical strategy is used to model a rising bubble problem.</description>

      <title>Pressure and convection robust Finite Elements for Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze two convection quasi-robust and pressure robust finite element methods for a fully nonlinear time-dependent magnetohydrodynamics problem. The schemes make use of suitable upwind and CIP stabilizations to handle the fluid and magnetic convective terms. The developed error estimates are uniform in both diffusion parameters and optimal with respect to the diffusive norm; furthermore, for the second (more complex) method we are able to show a quicker error reduction rate in convection dominated regimes. A set of numerical tests support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>On the approximation properties of fast Leja points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Leja points on an interval are points constructed using a discrete modification of the algorithm for constructing Leja points. Not much about fast Leja points has been proven theoretically. We present an asymptotic property of a triangular interpolation array, and under the assumption that fast Leja points satisfy this property, we prove that they are good for Lagrange interpolation.</description>

      <title>Energy-superconvergent Runge-Kutta Time Discretizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the energy accuracy of explicit Runge-Kutta (RK) time discretization for antisymmetric autonomous linear systems and present a framework for constructing RK methods with an order of energy accuracy much greater than the number of stages. For an $s$-stage, $p$th-order RK method, we show that the energy accuracy can achieve superconvergence with an order up to $2s-p+1$ if $p$ is even. Several energy-superconvergent methods, including five- to seven-stage fourth-order methods with energy accuracy up to the eleventh order, together with their strong stability criteria, are derived. The proposed methods are examined using several applications, including second-order ordinary differential equations for harmonic oscillators, linear integro-differential equations for peridynamics, and one-dimensional Maxwell's equations of electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Error estimates for a bilinear optimal control problem of Maxwell's equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a control-constrained optimal control problem subject to time-harmonic Maxwell's equations; the control variable belongs to a finite-dimensional set and enters the state equation as a coefficient. We derive existence of optimal solutions, and analyze first- and second-order optimality conditions. We devise an approximation scheme based on the lowest order N\'ed\'elec finite elements to approximate optimal solutions. We analyze convergence properties of the proposed scheme and prove a priori error estimates. We also design an a posteriori error estimator that can be decomposed as the sum two contributions related to the discretization of the state and adjoint equations, and prove that the devised error estimator is reliable and locally efficient. We perform numerical tests in order to assess the performance of the devised discretization strategy and the a posteriori error estimator.</description>

      <title>An Uncertainty-aware, Mesh-free Numerical Method for Kolmogorov PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces an uncertainty-aware, mesh-free numerical method for solving Kolmogorov PDEs. In the proposed method, we use Gaussian process regression (GPR) to smoothly interpolate pointwise solutions that are obtained by Monte Carlo methods based on the Feynman-Kac formula. The proposed method has two main advantages: 1. uncertainty assessment, which is facilitated by the probabilistic nature of GPR, and 2. mesh-free computation, which allows efficient handling of high-dimensional PDEs. The quality of the solution is improved by adjusting the kernel function and incorporating noise information from the Monte Carlo samples into the GPR noise model. The performance of the method is rigorously analyzed based on a theoretical lower bound on the posterior variance, which serves as a measure of the error between the numerical and true solutions. Extensive tests on three representative PDEs demonstrate the high accuracy and robustness of the method compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic preserving finite volume method for the compressible Euler equations: analysis via dissipative measure-valued solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a new asymptotic preserving (AP) finite volume scheme for the multidimensional compressible barotropic Euler equations to simulate low Mach number flows. The proposed scheme uses a stabilized upwind numerical flux, with the stabilization term being proportional to the stiff pressure gradient, and we prove its conditional energy stability and consistency. Utilizing the concept of dissipative measure-valued (DMV) solutions, we rigorously illustrate the AP properties of the scheme for well-prepared initial data. In particular, we prove that the numerical solutions will converge weakly to a DMV solution of the compressible Euler equations as the mesh parameter vanishes, while the Mach number is fixed. The DMV solutions then converge to a classical solution of the incompressible Euler system as the Mach number goes to zero. Conversely, we show that if the mesh parameter is kept fixed, we obtain an energy stable and consistent finite-volume scheme approximating the incompressible Euler equations as the Mach number goes to zero. The numerical solutions generated by this scheme then converge weakly to a DMV solution of the incompressible Euler system as the mesh parameter vanishes. Invoking the weak-strong uniqueness principle, we conclude that the DMV solution and classical solution of the incompressible Euler system coincide, proving the AP property of the scheme. We also present an extensive numerical case study in order to illustrate the theoretical convergences, wherein we utilize the techniques of K-convergence.</description>

      <title>Role of coupled electrochemistry and stress on the Li-anode instability: A continuum approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a coupled mechanistic approach that elucidates the intricate interplay between stress and electrochemistry, enabling the prediction of the onset of instabilities in Li-metal anodes and the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in liquid-electrolyte Li-metal batteries. Our continuum theory considers a two-way coupling between stress and electrochemistry, includes Li and electron transport through SEI, incorporates effects of Li viscoplasticity, includes SEI and electrolyte interface surface energy and evaluates crucial roles of these mechanistic effects on the continuously evolving anode surface due to the viscoplastic deformation of lithium. In the model, spatial current density evolves with the stress-induced potential across the deformed anode/SEI interface. We assume SEI as a homogeneous, artificial layer on the Li-anode, which allows the investigation of the mechanical and electrochemical properties of the SEI systematically. Subsequently, we solve a set of coupled electrochemistry and displacement equations within the SEI and anode domains. The model is implemented numerically by writing a user element subroutine in Abaqus/Standard. We conduct numerical simulations under various galvanostatic conditions and SEI properties and predict conditions for anode instability. We find that Li viscoplasticity is one of the key attributes that drives instability in the Li-anode and show that applying a soft artificial SEI layer on the Li-anode to minimize viscoplastic deformation can be an effective method. We also report the role of artificial SEI elasticity and thickness on anode stability. Selected stability maps are provided as a design aid for artificial SEI.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving parametric finite element methods for simulating axisymmetric solid-state dewetting problems with anisotropic surface energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state dewetting (SSD), a widespread phenomenon in solid-solid-vapor system, could be used to describe the accumulation of solid thin films on the substrate. In this work, we consider the sharp interface model for axisymmetric SSD with anisotropic surface energy. By introducing two types of surface energy matrices from the anisotropy functions,we aim to design two structure-preserving algorithms for the axisymmetric SSD. The newly designed schemes are applicable to a broader range of anisotropy functions, and we can theoretically prove their volume conservation and energy stability. In addition, based on a novel weak formulation for the axisymmetric SSD, we further build another two numerical schemes that have good mesh properties. Finally, numerous numerical tests are reported to showcase the accuracy and efficiency of the numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Efficient numerical computation of spiral spectra with exponentially-weighted preconditioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of nonlinear waves on spatially extended domains is commonly probed by computing the spectrum of the linearization of the underlying PDE about the wave profile. It is known that convective transport, whether driven by the nonlinear pattern itself or an underlying fluid flow, can cause exponential growth of the resolvent of the linearization as a function of the domain length. In particular, sparse eigenvalue algorithms may result in inaccurate and spurious spectra in the convective regime. In this work, we focus on spiral waves, which arise in many natural processes and which exhibit convective transport. We prove that exponential weights can serve as effective, inexpensive preconditioners that result in resolvents that are uniformly bounded in the domain size and that stabilize numerical spectral computations. We also show that the optimal exponential rates can be computed reliably from a simpler asymptotic problem posed in one space dimension.</description>

      <title>On the construction of a family of well - posed approximate formulations for the stationary Stokes problem using an extended system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an exact parameterized extended system such that, under adequate data, between the components of its solution, there is the solution of the weak formulation of the homogeneous Dirichlet problem for the stationary Stokes equations. In the extended system, we introduce the momentum equation together with two other forms of this one. This allows us to reformulate, for the stationary case, the consistent pressure Poisson equation of Sani, Shen, Pironneau, Gresho [\textit{Int. J. Numer. Meth. Fluids}, \textbf{50} (2006), pp. 673-682], from the unsteady case. In this way, we can retain the information we need for the approximate pressure on the boundary. We obtain a parameterized perturbed pressure Poisson equation for the stationary Stokes problem. We prove that to solve the stationary Stokes problem is equivalent to solve a problem for the momentum equation, the parameterized equation and the equation that defines the Laplace operator acting on velocity. The approximation of this last problem give a family of well - posed approximate formulations. The solution of each element of this family approximates the solution of the stationary Stokes problem. Some necessary variants of existing results on general Banach spaces are also developed. These concern the density of subspaces related to isomorphisms and the connection between the exact and the approximate problems. First, the well - posedness of the exact extended system is proved in some dense subspaces. The well posed approximate problem does not necessitate the discrete inf-sup condition. The paper is also related to the existing discussions on the boundary conditions for the pressure and on the imposing of the incompressibility constraint on the boundary.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{H}_2$ optimal model reduction of linear systems with multiple quadratic outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the $\mathcal{H}_2$ optimal model reduction of dynamical systems that are linear in the state equation and up to quadratic nonlinearity in the output equation. As our primary theoretical contributions, we derive gradients of the squared $\mathcal{H}_2$ system error with respect to the reduced model quantities and, from the stationary points of these gradients, introduce Gramian-based first-order necessary conditions for the $\mathcal{H}_2$ optimal approximation of a linear quadratic output (LQO) system. The resulting $\mathcal{H}_2$ optimality framework neatly generalizes the analogous Gramian-based optimality framework for purely linear systems. Computationally, we show how to enforce the necessary optimality conditions using Petrov-Galerkin projection; the corresponding projection matrices are obtained from a pair of Sylvester equations. Based on this result, we propose an iteratively corrected algorithm for the $\mathcal{H}_2$ model reduction of LQO systems, which we refer to as LQO-TSIA (linear quadratic output two-sided iteration algorithm). Numerical examples are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed computational method against other existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>

Abstract: Koopman operators are infinite-dimensional operators that linearize nonlinear dynamical systems, facilitating the study of their spectral properties and enabling the prediction of the time evolution of observable quantities. Recent methods have aimed to approximate Koopman operators while preserving key structures. However, approximating Koopman operators typically requires a dictionary of observables to capture the system's behavior in a finite-dimensional subspace. The selection of these functions is often heuristic, may result in the loss of spectral information, and can severely complicate structure preservation. This paper introduces Multiplicative Dynamic Mode Decomposition (MultDMD), which enforces the multiplicative structure inherent in the Koopman operator within its finite-dimensional approximation. Leveraging this multiplicative property, we guide the selection of observables and define a constrained optimization problem for the matrix approximation, which can be efficiently solved. MultDMD presents a structured approach to finite-dimensional approximations and can more accurately reflect the spectral properties of the Koopman operator. We elaborate on the theoretical framework of MultDMD, detailing its formulation, optimization strategy, and convergence properties. The efficacy of MultDMD is demonstrated through several examples, including the nonlinear pendulum, the Lorenz system, and fluid dynamics data, where we demonstrate its remarkable robustness to noise.</description>

      <title>Distributed Least Squares in Small Space via Sketching and Bias Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix sketching is a powerful tool for reducing the size of large data matrices. Yet there are fundamental limitations to this size reduction when we want to recover an accurate estimator for a task such as least square regression. We show that these limitations can be circumvented in the distributed setting by designing sketching methods that minimize the bias of the estimator, rather than its error. In particular, we give a sparse sketching method running in optimal space and current matrix multiplication time, which recovers a nearly-unbiased least squares estimator using two passes over the data. This leads to new communication-efficient distributed averaging algorithms for least squares and related tasks, which directly improve on several prior approaches. Our key novelty is a new bias analysis for sketched least squares, giving a sharp characterization of its dependence on the sketch sparsity. The techniques include new higher-moment restricted Bai-Silverstein inequalities, which are of independent interest to the non-asymptotic analysis of deterministic equivalents for random matrices that arise from sketching.</description>

      <title>Characteristic Learning for Provable One Step Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the characteristic generator, a novel one-step generative model that combines the efficiency of sampling in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with the stable performance of flow-based models. Our model is driven by characteristics, along which the probability density transport can be described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Specifically, We estimate the velocity field through nonparametric regression and utilize Euler method to solve the probability flow ODE, generating a series of discrete approximations to the characteristics. We then use a deep neural network to fit these characteristics, ensuring a one-step mapping that effectively pushes the prior distribution towards the target distribution. In the theoretical aspect, we analyze the errors in velocity matching, Euler discretization, and characteristic fitting to establish a non-asymptotic convergence rate for the characteristic generator in 2-Wasserstein distance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first thorough analysis for simulation-free one step generative models. Additionally, our analysis refines the error analysis of flow-based generative models in prior works. We apply our method on both synthetic and real datasets, and the results demonstrate that the characteristic generator achieves high generation quality with just a single evaluation of neural network.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Finite Difference Approximation via a Double Sample-Recycling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating stochastic gradients is pivotal in fields like service systems within operations research. The classical method for this estimation is the finite difference approximation, which entails generating samples at perturbed inputs. Nonetheless, practical challenges persist in determining the perturbation and obtaining an optimal finite difference estimator in the sense of possessing the smallest mean squared error (MSE). To tackle this problem, we propose a double sample-recycling approach in this paper. Firstly, pilot samples are recycled to estimate the optimal perturbation. Secondly, recycling these pilot samples again and generating new samples at the estimated perturbation, lead to an efficient finite difference estimator. We analyze its bias, variance and MSE. Our analyses demonstrate a reduction in asymptotic variance, and in some cases, a decrease in asymptotic bias, compared to the optimal finite difference estimator. Therefore, our proposed estimator consistently coincides with, or even outperforms the optimal finite difference estimator. In numerical experiments, we apply the estimator in several examples, and numerical results demonstrate its robustness, as well as coincidence with the theory presented, especially in the case of small sample sizes.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Privacy-Preserving Matrix Completion for Trajectory Recovery</title>

Abstract: Matrix completion has important applications in trajectory recovery and mobile social networks. However, sending raw data containing personal, sensitive information to cloud computing nodes may lead to privacy exposure issue.The privacy-preserving matrix completion is a useful approach to perform matrix completion while preserving privacy. In this paper, we propose a high-performance method for privacy-preserving matrix completion. First,we use a lightweight encryption scheme to encrypt the raw data and then perform matrix completion using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Then,the complemented matrix is decrypted and compared with the original matrix to calculate the error. This method has faster speed with higher accuracy. The results of numerical experiments reveal that the proposed method is faster than other algorithms.</description>

      <title>Fine-grained Analysis and Faster Algorithms for Iteratively Solving Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While effective in practice, iterative methods for solving large systems of linear equations can be significantly affected by problem-dependent condition number quantities. This makes characterizing their time complexity challenging, particularly when we wish to make comparisons between deterministic and stochastic methods, that may or may not rely on preconditioning and/or fast matrix multiplication. In this work, we consider a fine-grained notion of complexity for iterative linear solvers which we call the spectral tail condition number, $\kappa_\ell$, defined as the ratio between the $\ell$th largest and the smallest singular value of the matrix representing the system.
  Concretely, we prove the following main algorithmic result: Given an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ and a vector $b$, we can find $\tilde{x}$ such that $\|A\tilde{x}-b\|\leq\epsilon\|b\|$ in time $\tilde{O}(\kappa_\ell\cdot n^2\log 1/\epsilon)$ for any $\ell = O(n^{\frac1{\omega-1}})=O(n^{0.729})$, where $\omega \approx 2.372$ is the current fast matrix multiplication exponent. This guarantee is achieved by Sketch-and-Project with Nesterov's acceleration. Some of the implications of our result, and of the use of $\kappa_\ell$, include direct improvement over a fine-grained analysis of the Conjugate Gradient method, suggesting a stronger separation between deterministic and stochastic iterative solvers; and relating the complexity of iterative solvers to the ongoing algorithmic advances in fast matrix multiplication, since the bound on $\ell$ improves with $\omega$.
  Our main technical contributions are new sharp characterizations for the first and second moments of the random projection matrix that commonly arises in sketching algorithms, building on a combination of techniques from combinatorial sampling via determinantal point processes and Gaussian universality results from random matrix theory.</description>

      <title>Faster Linear Systems and Matrix Norm Approximation via Multi-level Sketched Preconditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new class of preconditioned iterative methods for solving linear systems of the form $Ax = b$. Our methods are based on constructing a low-rank Nystr\"om approximation to $A$ using sparse random sketching. This approximation is used to construct a preconditioner, which itself is inverted quickly using additional levels of random sketching and preconditioning. We prove that the convergence of our methods depends on a natural average condition number of $A$, which improves as the rank of the Nystr\"om approximation increases. Concretely, this allows us to obtain faster runtimes for a number of fundamental linear algebraic problems:
  1. We show how to solve any $n\times n$ linear system that is well-conditioned except for $k$ outlying large singular values in $\tilde{O}(n^{2.065} + k^\omega)$ time, improving on a recent result of [Derezi\'nski, Yang, STOC 2024] for all $k \gtrsim n^{0.78}$.
  2. We give the first $\tilde{O}(n^2 + {d_\lambda}^{\omega}$) time algorithm for solving a regularized linear system $(A + \lambda I)x = b$, where $A$ is positive semidefinite with effective dimension $d_\lambda$. This problem arises in applications like Gaussian process regression.
  3. We give faster algorithms for approximating Schatten $p$-norms and other matrix norms. For example, for the Schatten 1 (nuclear) norm, we give an algorithm that runs in $\tilde{O}(n^{2.11})$ time, improving on an $\tilde{O}(n^{2.18})$ method of [Musco et al., ITCS 2018].
  Interestingly, previous state-of-the-art algorithms for most of the problems above relied on stochastic iterative methods, like stochastic coordinate and gradient descent. Our work takes a completely different approach, instead leveraging tools from matrix sketching.</description>

      <title>Fast, high-order numerical evaluation of volume potentials via polynomial density interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03844v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a high-order accurate numerical method for the evaluation of singular volume integral operators, with attention focused on operators associated with the Poisson and Helmholtz equations in two dimensions. Following the ideas of the density interpolation method for boundary integral operators, the proposed methodology leverages Green's third identity and a local polynomial interpolant of the density function to recast the volume potential as a sum of single- and double-layer potentials and a volume integral with a regularized (bounded or smoother) integrand. The layer potentials can be accurately and efficiently evaluated everywhere in the plane by means of existing methods (e.g. the density interpolation method), while the regularized volume integral can be accurately evaluated by applying elementary quadrature rules. Compared to straightforwardly computing corrections for every singular and nearly-singular volume target, the method significantly reduces the amount of required specialized quadrature by pushing all singular and near-singular corrections to near-singular layer-potential evaluations at target points in a small neighborhood of the domain boundary. Error estimates for the regularization and quadrature approximations are provided. The method is compatible with well-established fast algorithms, being both efficient not only in the online phase but also to set-up. Numerical examples demonstrate the high-order accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology; applications to inhomogeneous scattering are presented.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Bregman-Kaczmarz: An Approach to Solve Linear Inverse Problems with Independent Noise Exactly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the block Bregman-Kaczmarz method for finite dimensional linear inverse problems. The block Bregman-Kaczmarz method uses blocks of the linear system and performs iterative steps with these blocks only. We assume a noise model that we call independent noise, i.e. each time the method performs a step for some block, one obtains a noisy sample of the respective part of the right-hand side which is contaminated with new noise that is independent of all previous steps of the method. One can view these noise models as making a fresh noisy measurement of the respective block each time it is used. In this framework, we are able to show that a well-chosen adaptive stepsize of the block Bergman-Kaczmarz method is able to converge to the exact solution of the linear inverse problem. The plain form of this adaptive stepsize relies on unknown quantities (like the Bregman distance to the solution), but we show a way how these quantities can be estimated purely from given data. We illustrate the finding in numerical experiments and confirm that these heuristic estimates lead to effective stepsizes.</description>

      <title>Derivative based global sensitivity analysis and its entropic link</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variance-based Sobol' sensitivity is one of the most well known measures in global sensitivity analysis (GSA). However, uncertainties with certain distributions, such as highly skewed distributions or those with a heavy tail, cannot be adequately characterised using the second central moment only. Entropy-based GSA can consider the entire probability density function, but its application has been limited because it is difficult to estimate. Here we present a novel derivative-based upper bound for conditional entropies, to efficiently rank uncertain variables and to work as a proxy for entropy-based total effect indices. To overcome the non-desirable issue of negativity for differential entropies as sensitivity indices, we discuss an exponentiation of the total effect entropy and its proxy. We found that the proposed new entropy proxy is equivalent to the proxy for variance-based GSA for linear functions with Gaussian inputs, but outperforms the latter for a river flood physics model with 8 inputs of different distributions. We expect the new entropy proxy to increase the variable screening power of derivative-based GSA and to complement Sobol'-index proxy for a more diverse type of distributions.</description>

      <title>MGCNN: a learnable multigrid solver for sparse linear systems from PDEs on structured grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a learnable solver tailored to iteratively solve sparse linear systems from discretized partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike traditional approaches relying on specialized expertise, our solver streamlines the algorithm design process for a class of PDEs through training, which requires only training data of coefficient distributions. The proposed method is anchored by three core principles: (1) a multilevel hierarchy to promote rapid convergence, (2) adherence to linearity concerning the right-hand-side of equations, and (3) weights sharing across different levels to facilitate adaptability to various problem sizes. Built on these foundational principles and considering the similar computation pattern of the convolutional neural network (CNN) as multigrid components, we introduce a network adept at solving linear systems from PDEs with heterogeneous coefficients, discretized on structured grids. Notably, our proposed solver possesses the ability to generalize over right-hand-side terms, PDE coefficients, and grid sizes, thereby ensuring its training is purely offline. To evaluate its effectiveness, we train the solver on convection-diffusion equations featuring heterogeneous diffusion coefficients. The solver exhibits swift convergence to high accuracy over a range of grid sizes, extending from $31 \times 31$ to $4095 \times 4095$. Remarkably, our method outperforms the classical Geometric Multigrid (GMG) solver, demonstrating a speedup of approximately 3 to 8 times. Furthermore, our numerical investigation into the solver's capacity to generalize to untrained coefficient distributions reveals promising outcomes.</description>

      <title>Gradient Preserving Operator Inference: Data-Driven Reduced-Order Models for Equations with Gradient Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamiltonian Operator Inference has been introduced in [Sharma, H., Wang, Z., Kramer, B., Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, 431, p.133122, 2022] to learn structure-preserving reduced-order models (ROMs) for Hamiltonian systems. This approach constructs a low-dimensional model using only data and knowledge of the Hamiltonian function. Such ROMs can keep the intrinsic structure of the system, allowing them to capture the physics described by the governing equations. In this work, we extend this approach to more general systems that are either conservative or dissipative in energy, and which possess a gradient structure. We derive the optimization problems for inferring structure-preserving ROMs that preserve the gradient structure. We further derive an $a\ priori$ error estimate for the reduced-order approximation. To test the algorithms, we consider semi-discretized partial differential equations with gradient structure, such as the parameterized wave and Korteweg-de-Vries equations, and equations of three-dimensional linear elasticity in the conservative case and the one- and two-dimensional Allen-Cahn equations in the dissipative case. The numerical results illustrate the accuracy, structure-preservation properties, and predictive capabilities of the gradient-preserving Operator Inference ROMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper contributes to the study of optimal experimental design for Bayesian inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). We derive estimates for the parametric regularity of multivariate double integration problems over high-dimensional parameter and data domains arising in Bayesian optimal design problems. We provide a detailed analysis for these double integration problems using two approaches: a full tensor product and a sparse tensor product combination of quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) cubature rules over the parameter and data domains. Specifically, we show that the latter approach significantly improves the convergence rate, exhibiting performance comparable to that of QMC integration of a single high-dimensional integral. Furthermore, we numerically verify the predicted convergence rates for an elliptic PDE problem with an unknown diffusion coefficient in two spatial dimensions, offering empirical evidence supporting the theoretical results and highlighting practical applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) algorithm is a deterministic particle method for sampling. However, a mean-field analysis reveals that the gradient flow corresponding to the SVGD algorithm (i.e., the Stein Variational Gradient Flow) only provides a constant-order approximation to the Wasserstein Gradient Flow corresponding to the KL-divergence minimization. In this work, we propose the Regularized Stein Variational Gradient Flow, which interpolates between the Stein Variational Gradient Flow and the Wasserstein Gradient Flow. We establish various theoretical properties of the Regularized Stein Variational Gradient Flow (and its time-discretization) including convergence to equilibrium, existence and uniqueness of weak solutions, and stability of the solutions. We provide preliminary numerical evidence of the improved performance offered by the regularization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a system of stochastic differential equations with a stiff linear term and additive noise driven by fractional Brownian motions (fBms) with Hurst parameter H&gt;1/2, which arise e. g., from spatial approximations of stochastic partial differential equations. For their numerical approximation, we present an exponential Euler scheme and show that it converges in the strong sense with an exact rate close to the Hurst parameter H. Further, based on (E. Buckwar, M.G. Riedler, and P.E. Kloeden 2011), we conclude the existence of a unique stationary solution of the exponential Euler scheme that is pathwise asymptotically stable.</description>
