      <title>Economic effects on households of an augmentation of the cash back duration of real estate loan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines the economic effects of an increase in the duration of home loans on households, focusing on the French real estate market. It highlights trends in the property market, existing loan systems in other countries (such as bullet loans in Sweden and Japanese home loans), the current state of the property market in France, the potential effects of an increase in the amortization period of home loans, and the financial implications for households.The article points out that increasing the repayment period on home loans could reduce the amount of monthly instalments to be repaid, thereby facilitating access to credit for the most modest households. However, this measure also raises concerns about overall credit costs, financial stability and the impact on property prices. In addition, it highlights the differences between existing lending systems in other countries, such as the bullet loan in Sweden and Japanese home loans, and the current characteristics of home loans in France, notably interest rates and house price trends. The article proposes a model of the potential effects of an increase in the amortization period of home loans on housing demand, housing supply, property prices and the associated financial risks.In conclusion, the article highlights the crucial importance of household debt for individual and economic financial stability. It highlights the distortion between supply and demand for home loans as amortization periods increase, and the significant rise in overall loan costs for households. It also underlines the need to address structural issues such as the sustainable reduction in interest rates, the stabilization of banks' equity capital and the development of a regulatory framework for intergenerational lending to ensure a properly functioning market.</description>

      <title>Crisis Alpha: A High-Performance Trading Algorithm Tested in Market Downturns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forming quantitative portfolios using statistical risk models presents a significant challenge for hedge funds and portfolio managers. This research investigates three distinct statistical risk models to construct quantitative portfolios of 1,000 floating stocks in the US market. Utilizing five different investment strategies, these models are tested across four periods, encompassing the last three major financial crises: The Dot Com Bubble, Global Financial Crisis, and Covid-19 market downturn. Backtests leverage the CRSP dataset from January 1990 through December 2023. The results demonstrate that the proposed models consistently outperformed market excess returns across all periods. These findings suggest that the developed risk models can serve as valuable tools for asset managers, aiding in strategic decision-making and risk management in various economic conditions.</description>
