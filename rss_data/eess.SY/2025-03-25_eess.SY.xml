      <title>Uncertainty Quantification for Data-Driven Machine Learning Models in Nuclear Engineering Applications: Where We Are and What Do We Need?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has been leveraged to tackle a diverse range of tasks in almost all branches of nuclear engineering. Many of the successes in ML applications can be attributed to the recent performance breakthroughs in deep learning, the growing availability of computational power, data, and easy-to-use ML libraries. However, these empirical successes have often outpaced our formal understanding of the ML algorithms. An important but under-rated area is uncertainty quantification (UQ) of ML. ML-based models are subject to approximation uncertainty when they are used to make predictions, due to sources including but not limited to, data noise, data coverage, extrapolation, imperfect model architecture and the stochastic training process. The goal of this paper is to clearly explain and illustrate the importance of UQ of ML. We will elucidate the differences in the basic concepts of UQ of physics-based models and data-driven ML models. Various sources of uncertainties in physical modeling and data-driven modeling will be discussed, demonstrated, and compared. We will also present and demonstrate a few techniques to quantify the ML prediction uncertainties. Finally, we will discuss the need for building a verification, validation and UQ framework to establish ML credibility.</description>

      <title>A new graph-based surrogate model for rapid prediction of crashworthiness performance of vehicle panel components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the design cycle of safety critical vehicle components such as B-pillars, crashworthiness performance is a key metric for passenger protection assessment in vehicle accidents. Traditional finite element simulations for crashworthiness analysis involve complex modelling, leading to an increased computational demand. Although a few machine learning-based surrogate models have been developed for rapid predictions for crashworthiness analysis, they exhibit limitations in detailed representation of complex 3D components. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising solution for processing data with complex structures. However, existing GNN models often lack sufficient accuracy and computational efficiency to meet industrial demands. This paper proposes Recurrent Graph U-Net (ReGUNet), a new graph-based surrogate model for crashworthiness analysis of vehicle panel components. ReGUNet adoptes a U-Net architecture with multiple graph downsampling and upsampling layers, which improves the model's computational efficiency and accuracy; the introduction of recurrence enhances the accuracy and stability of temporal predictions over multiple time steps. ReGUNet is evaluated through a case study of side crash testing of a B-pillar component with variation in geometric design. The trained model demonstrates great accuracy in predicting the dynamic behaviour of previously unseen component designs within a relative error of 0.74% for the maximum B-pillar intrusion. Compared to the baseline models, ReGUNet can reduce the averaged mean prediction error of the component's deformation by more than 51% with significant improvement in computational efficiency. Provided enhanced accuracy and efficiency, ReGUNet shows greater potential in accurate predictions of large and complex graphs compared to existing models.</description>

      <title>CP-NCBF: A Conformal Prediction-based Approach to Synthesize Verified Neural Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are a practical approach for designing safety-critical controllers, but constructing them for arbitrary nonlinear dynamical systems remains a challenge. Recent efforts have explored learning-based methods, such as neural CBFs (NCBFs), to address this issue. However, ensuring the validity of NCBFs is difficult due to potential learning errors. In this letter, we propose a novel framework that leverages split-conformal prediction to generate formally verified neural CBFs with probabilistic guarantees based on a user-defined error rate, referred to as CP-NCBF. Unlike existing methods that impose Lipschitz constraints on neural CBF-leading to scalability limitations and overly conservative safe sets--our approach is sample-efficient, scalable, and results in less restrictive safety regions. We validate our framework through case studies on obstacle avoidance in autonomous driving and geo-fencing of aerial vehicles, demonstrating its ability to generate larger and less conservative safe sets compared to conventional techniques.</description>

      <title>Reachable Sets-based Trajectory Planning Combining Reinforcement Learning and iLQR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The driving risk field is applicable to more complex driving scenarios, providing new approaches for safety decision-making and active vehicle control in intricate environments. However, existing research often overlooks the driving risk field and fails to consider the impact of risk distribution within drivable areas on trajectory planning, which poses challenges for enhancing safety. This paper proposes a trajectory planning method for intelligent vehicles based on the risk reachable set to further improve the safety of trajectory planning. First, we construct the reachable set incorporating the driving risk field to more accurately assess and avoid potential risks in drivable areas. Then, the initial trajectory is generated based on safe reinforcement learning and projected onto the reachable set. Finally, we introduce a trajectory planning method based on a constrained iterative quadratic regulator to optimize the initial solution, ensuring that the planned trajectory achieves optimal comfort, safety, and efficiency. We conduct simulation tests of trajectory planning in high-speed lane-changing scenarios. The results indicate that the proposed method can guarantee trajectory comfort and driving efficiency, with the generated trajectory situated outside high-risk boundaries, thereby ensuring vehicle safety during operation.</description>

      <title>TamedPUMA: safe and stable imitation learning with geometric fabrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the language of dynamical systems, Imitation learning (IL) provides an intuitive and effective way of teaching stable task-space motions to robots with goal convergence. Yet, IL techniques are affected by serious limitations when it comes to ensuring safety and fulfillment of physical constraints. With this work, we solve this challenge via TamedPUMA, an IL algorithm augmented with a recent development in motion generation called geometric fabrics. As both the IL policy and geometric fabrics describe motions as artificial second-order dynamical systems, we propose two variations where IL provides a navigation policy for geometric fabrics. The result is a stable imitation learning strategy within which we can seamlessly blend geometrical constraints like collision avoidance and joint limits. Beyond providing a theoretical analysis, we demonstrate TamedPUMA with simulated and real-world tasks, including a 7-DoF manipulator.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing NMPC Approaches for Underactuated Mechanical Systems on the SE(3) Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the motion control problem for underactuated mechanical systems with full attitude control and one translational force input to manage the six degrees of freedom involved in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. These systems are often classified as second-order nonholonomic due to their completely nonintegrable acceleration constraints. To tackle this complex control problem, we propose two nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) schemes that ensure closed-loop stability and recursive feasibility without terminal conditions. The system dynamics are modeled on the SE(3) manifold for a globally and unique description of rigid body configurations. One NMPC scheme also aims to reduce mission time as an economic criterion. The controllers' effectiveness is validated through numerical experiments on a quadrotor UAV.</description>

      <title>Sharp Hybrid Zonotopes: Set Operations and the Reformulation-linearization Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed integer set representations, and specifically hybrid zonotopes, have enabled new techniques for reachability and verification of nonlinear and hybrid systems. Mixed-integer sets which have the property that their convex relaxation is equal to their convex hull are said to be sharp. This property allows the convex hull to be computed with minimal overhead, and is known to be important for improving the convergence rates of mixed-integer optimization algorithms that rely on convex relaxations. This paper examines methods for formulating sharp hybrid zonotopes and provides sharpness-preserving methods for performing several key set operations. The paper then shows how the reformulation-linearization technique can be applied to create a sharp realization of a hybrid zonotope that is initially not sharp. A numerical example applies this technique to find the convex hull of a level set of a feedforward ReLU neural network.</description>

      <title>The Impedance Space: A Look at Mechanical Impedance Ellipses in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel 3D graphical representation of mechanical impedance, named impedance space, to enhance the analysis of the dynamic behavior of compliant systems. This approach addresses the limitations of existing 2D graphical methods by associating the impedance control parameters with linear transformations to plot a parametric 3D ellipse, for a known oscillatory input. The well-known 2D impedance ellipses are shown to be particular projections of this 3D ellipse. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a unifying co-simulation framework integrating transportation demand, grid assets, land use, demographics, and emissions to optimally accelerate electric vehicle (EV) development as well as measure the impact of EV integration. 96 urban and long-haul truck charging demand simulations were developed and integrated into a combined transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) simulation, encompassing the Houston/Dallas/Fort Worth area. The T&amp;D scenarios are then used to develop cost optimization strategies to determine optimal placement and sizing of truck charging infrastructure that minimize infrastructure costs.</description>

      <title>A robust mechanical sensorless control strategy for active rectification of small wind turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a mechanical sensorless control strategy for the synchronous rectification of small wind turbines equipped with a surface-mounted Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG). By means of Lyapunov theory, the Global Asymptotic Stability (GAS) of the closed loop system is proven. It allows the use of a classical Sliding Mode Observer (SMO) to remove the mechanical sensor in the control loop despite uncertainties on the resistance and inductance parameters. The analysis of the equilibrium points have made it possible to propose an analytic model of the angular misalignment between the true and the observer rotating frames, responsible for current tracking errors. Experimental tests on a wind turbine emulator show that despite large errors on the the resistance and inductance parameters, the impact on the energy harvest is low, proving that the strategy's performance is robust to high uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Mixed-gradients Distributed Filtered Reference Least Mean Square Algorithm -- A Robust Distributed Multichannel Active Noise Control Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed multichannel active noise control (DMCANC), which utilizes multiple individual processors to achieve a global noise reduction performance comparable to conventional centralized multichannel active noise control (MCANC), has become increasingly attractive due to its high computational efficiency. However, the majority of current DMCANC algorithms disregard the impact of crosstalk across nodes and impose the assumption of an ideal network devoid of communication limitations, which is an unrealistic assumption. Therefore, this work presents a robust DMCANC algorithm that employs the compensating filter to mitigate the impact of crosstalk. The proposed solution enhances the DMCANC system's flexibility and security by utilizing local gradients instead of local control filters to convey enhanced information, resulting in a mixed-gradients distributed filtered reference least mean square (MGDFxLMS) algorithm. The performance investigation demonstrates that the proposed approach performs well with the centralized method. Furthermore, to address the issue of communication delay in the distributed network, a practical strategy that auto-shrinks the step size value in response to the delayed samples is implemented to improve the system's resilience. The numerical simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed auto-shrink step size MGDFxLMS (ASSS-MGDFxLMS) algorithm across various communication delays, highlighting its practical value.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fault Detection in CO2 Refrigeration Systems: Optimal Sensor Selection and Robustness Analysis Using Tree-Based Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the reliability and robustness of data-driven Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) models for CO2 refrigeration systems (CO2-RS) in supermarkets, focusing on optimal sensor selection and resilience against sensor noise. Using tree-based machine learning algorithms - Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM - we developed FDD models to classify six common faults in a laboratory-scale CO2-RS. The Recursive Feature Addition (RFA) approach identified optimal sensor sets, achieving a 99% F1-score with minimal sensors: four for RF, seven for XGBoost, five for CatBoost, and five for LightGBM. Condenser-side sensors consistently ranked as critical for fault detection. Robustness was assessed by injecting Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 3 dB into the most important sensor, with XGBoost showing superior resilience at 85.24%, followed by CatBoost (57.07%), LightGBM (49.1%), and RF (49.46%). Sensitivity analysis across high-SNR (10 dB), low-SNR (0 dB), and sensor failure scenarios revealed XGBoost's robustness peaking at 90.23% and retaining 79% under failure, contrasting with sharper declines in other models. These findings highlight a trade-off between sensor count, cost, and reliability, with larger ensembles enhancing noise resilience. This work bridges gaps in FDD literature by integrating sensor optimization with comprehensive robustness analysis, offering a practical framework for improving energy efficiency and fault management in CO2-RS. Future efforts could explore adaptive SNR thresholds and redundant sensor configurations to enhance real-world applicability.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Net Load Forecasting for High-Penetration RES Grids Utilizing Enhanced Conditional Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of intermittent distributed renewable energy sources (RES) in modern power systems has fundamentally compromised the reliability and accuracy of deterministic net load forecasting. Generative models, particularly diffusion models, demonstrate exceptional potential in uncertainty quantification for scenario forecasting. Nevertheless, their probabilistic predictive capabilities and conditional bootstrapping mechanisms still remain underexplored. In this paper, a day-ahead probabilistic net load forecasting framework is developed by systematically quantifying epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric variability using the feature-informed enhanced conditional diffusion model (ECDM). The ECDM architecture implements the net load distribution generation process using an imputation-based conditional diffusion model, where multi-modal conditional inputs, such as weather and calendar data, are fused via cross-attention mechanisms. Specifically, historical net load profiles are utilized to guide the reverse diffusion trajectory through non-parametric imputation operators preserving spatial-temporal integrity. To capture periodic characteristics, a novel weekly arrangement method is also introduced, while an unconditional model is integrated to ensure diversity in the generated scenarios. Subsequently, the maximum probabilistic points and probability intervals of predicted net load are obtained by the adaptive kernel density estimation under RES intermittency. Moreover, ECDM is extented to multi-energy forecast framework, attempting to increase interpretability of the net load predictions. Numerical experiments on a publicly available dataset demonstrate the superior forecasting performance of the proposed method compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>An AI-enabled dual-hormone model predictive control algorithm that delivers insulin and pramlintide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current closed-loop insulin delivery algorithms need to be informed of carbohydrate intake disturbances. This can be a burden on people using these systems. Pramlintide is a hormone that delays gastric emptying, which enables insulin kinetics to align with the kinetics of carbohydrate absorption. Integrating pramlintide into an automated insulin delivery system can be helpful in reducing the postprandial glucose excursion and may be helpful in enabling fully-closed loop whereby meals do not need to be announced. We present an AI-enabled dual-hormone model predictive control (MPC) algorithm that delivers insulin and pramlintide without requiring meal announcements that uses a neural network to automatically detect and deliver meal insulin. The MPC algorithm includes a new pramlintide pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics model that was identified using data collected from people with type 1 diabetes undergoing a meal challenge. Using a simulator, we evaluated the performance of various pramlintide delivery methods and controller models, as well as the baseline insulin-only scenario. Meals were automatically dosed using a neural network meal detection and dosing (MDD) algorithm. The primary outcome was the percent time glucose is in the target range (TIR: 70-180 mg/dL). Results show that delivering pramlintide at a fixed ratio of 6 mcg pramlintide:1 u insulin using an MPC that is aware of the pramlintide achieved the most significant improved TIR compared with an insulin-only MPC (91.6% vs. 64.1%). Delivering pramlintide as a fixed ratio was better than delivering basal pramlintide at a constant rate, indicating the benefit of the MDD algorithm. There was no advantage of independent control of insulin and pramlintide compared with insulin and pramlintide delivered as a fixed ratio. Preliminary real-world results from a human subject further indicate the benefit of pramlintide delivery.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Koopman Model Predictive Control of Simple Serial Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximating nonlinear systems as linear ones is a common workaround to apply control tools tailored for linear systems. This motivates our present work where we developed a data-driven model predictive controller (MPC) based on the Koopman operator framework, allowing the embedding of nonlinear dynamics in a higher dimensional, but linear function space. The controller, termed adaptive Koopman model predictive control (KMPC), uses online closed-loop feedback to learn and incrementally update a linear representation of nonlinear system dynamics, without the prior knowledge of a model. Adaptive KMPC differs from most other Koopman-based control frameworks that aim to identify high-validity-range models in advance and then enter closed-loop control without further model adaptations. To validate the controller, trajectory tracking experiments are conducted with 1R and 2R robots under force disturbances and changing model parameters. We compare the controller to classical linearization MPC and Koopman-based MPC without model updates, denoted static KMPC. The results show that adaptive KMPC can, opposed to static KMPC, generalize over unforeseen force disturbances and can, opposed to linearization MPC, handle varying dynamic parameters, while using a small set of basis functions to approximate the Koopman operator.</description>

      <title>Joint State-Parameter Observer-Based Robust Control of a UAV for Heavy Load Transportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a joint state-parameter observer-based controller for trajectory tracking of an octocopter unmanned aerial vehicle (OUAV), for transportation of a heavy load with unknown mass and size. The multi-body dynamic model of the OUAV with a rigidly attached load is obtained, effectively considering the effects of the load parameters into the dynamics of the system. A robust nonlinear W-infinity control strategy is designed for optimal trajectory tracking of the OUAV, with information of the states and load parameters provided by a joint estimation unscented Kalman filter. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is corroborated by numerical results.</description>

      <title>Koopman-Nemytskii Operator: A Linear Representation of Nonlinear Controlled Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Koopman operator lifts a nonlinear system into an infinite-dimensional function space and represents it as a linear dynamics, its definition is restricted to autonomous systems, i.e., does not incorporate inputs or disturbances. To the end of designing state-feedback controllers, the existing extensions of Koopman operator, which only account for the effect of open-loop values of inputs, does not involve feedback laws on closed-loop systems. Hence, in order to generically represent any nonlinear controlled dynamics linearly, this paper proposes a Koopman-Nemytskii operator, defined as a linear mapping from a product reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of states and feedback laws to an RKHS of states. Using the equivalence between RKHS and Sobolev-Hilbert spaces under certain regularity conditions on the dynamics and kernel selection, this operator is well-defined. Its data-based approximation, which follows a kernel extended dynamic mode decomposition (kernel EDMD) approach, have established errors in single-step and multi-step state predictions as well as accumulated cost under control.</description>

      <title>Transient synchronization stability analysis and assessment of DFIG system under severe faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the transient stability analysis of renewable energy grid-tied systems, although a large amount of works have devoted to the detailed electromagnetic transient simulation and the stability analyses of during-fault stage, the whole low-voltage ride through (LVRT) process and relevant transient stability mechanism remain to be uncovered. Taking the doubly fed induction generator system as the objective, this paper divides the transient processes into four different stages, including the pre-fault, during-fault, early post-fault, and late post-fault ones, establishes the full mechanism models for each stage, and studies the switching dynamics in detail. It is found that the during-fault dynamics can be determined by the phase-lock loop second-order equation within the framework of the generalized swing equation (GSE). For the early post-fault stage, it can be treated as a series of quasi-steady states and its dominant driving system dynamics can still be described by the GSE. Based on the local dynamics of unstable equilibrium point, the system transient stability can be completely determined by whether the initial state of the early post-fault stage is within or out of its basin of attraction (BOA). Based on these observations, the BOA-based and equal area criterion (EAC)-based transient stability assessment methods are developed, which are supported by broad numerical simulations and hardware-in-the-loop experiments. This work provides a clear physical picture and perfectly solves the difficult stability analysis problem when severe faults and LVRT have to be considered in most of DFIG engineering situations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cislunar space is emerging as a critical domain for human exploration, requiring robust infrastructure to support spatial users - spacecraft with navigation and communication demands. Deploying satellites at Earth-Moon libration points offers an effective solution. This paper introduces a novel Contact Plan Design (CPD) scheme that considers two classes of cislunar transponders: Reflector Links (RL) for high-volume data transfer and Phased Array Links (PL) for fast switching and navigation services.Our approach addresses the needs of both satellites and spatial users within the Earth-Moon Libration Point Communication and Navigation Constellation (EMLP-CNC). Simulations validate the proposed scheme, demonstrating its effectiveness in serving spatial users while meeting satellite ranging and communication requirements. These findings provide essential insights for developing future Cislunar Space Infrastructures.</description>

      <title>MCE-based Direct FTC Method for Dynamic Positioning of Underwater Vehicles with Thruster Redundancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an active model-based FTC (fault-tolerant control) method for the dynamic positioning of a class of underwater vehicles with thruster redundancy. Compared to the widely used state and parameter estimation methods, this proposed scheme directly utilizes the vehicle's motion control error (MCE) to construct a residual for detecting thruster faults and failures in the steady state of the control system. In the case of thruster fault identification, the most difficult aspect is that the actual control input with thruster faults is unknown. However, through a detailed and precise analyses of MCE variation trends in the case of thruster faults, highly useful information about this unknown control input can be extracted. This characteristic also serves as the foundation for the novel scheme proposed in this paper. As for control reconfiguration, it is straightforward since the thrust losses can be directly estimated as a result of the identification process. Numerical studies with the real world vehicle model are also carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Contact Plan Design for Cross-Linked GNSSs: An ILP Approach for Extended Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) employ inter-satellite links (ISLs) to reduce dependency on ground stations, enabling precise ranging and communication across satellites. Beyond their traditional role, ISLs can support extended applications, including providing navigation and communication services to external entities. However, designing effective contact plan design (CPD) schemes for these multifaceted ISLs, operating under a polling time-division duplex (PTDD) framework, remains a critical challenge. Existing CPD approaches focus solely on meeting GNSS satellites' internal ranging and communication demands, neglecting their extended applications. This paper introduces the first CPD scheme capable of supporting extended GNSS ISLs. By modeling GNSS requirements and designing a tailored service process, our approach ensures the allocation of essential resources for internal operations while accommodating external user demands. Based on the BeiDou constellation, simulation results demonstrate the proposed scheme's efficacy in maintaining core GNSS functionality while providing extended ISLs on a best-effort basis. Additionally, the results highlight the significant impact of GNSS ISLs in enhancing orbit determination and clock synchronization for the Earth-Moon libration point constellation, underscoring the importance of extended GNSS ISL applications.</description>

      <title>Dominant Groups and Asymmetric Polarization in Generalized Quasi-Structurally Balanced Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper focuses on the phenomenon of asymmetric polarization arising in the presence of a dominant group in the network. The existing works in the literature analyze polarization primarily in structurally and quasi-structurally balanced networks. In this work, we introduce generalized quasi-structurally balanced (GQSB) networks, which include both of these networks as special cases. In the presence of a dominant group, a GQSB network has a unique bipartition: the dominant group (and its allies) and the remaining agents. The dominant group's superior influence results in an asymmetry in how the inter-subset antagonistic interactions are perceived by both of the subsets. This, in turn, leads to asymmetry in the final polarized opinions. To model this behavior, we propose a generalized Laplacian flow for undirected GQSB networks with a dominant group and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving asymmetric polarization. The theoretical results presented in this paper are validated through numerical simulations on the Highland Tribes real-world dataset.</description>

      <title>Constraint Horizon in Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulation incorporating two distinct horizons: a prediction horizon and a constraint horizon. This approach enables a deeper understanding of how constraints influence key system properties such as suboptimality, without compromising recursive feasibility and constraint satisfaction. In this direction, our contributions are twofold. First, we provide a framework to estimate closed-loop optimality as a function of the number of enforced constraints. This is a generalization of existing results by considering partial constraint enforcement over the prediction horizon. Second, when adopting this general framework under the lens of safety-critical applications, our method improves conventional Control Barrier Function (CBF) based approaches. It mitigates myopic behaviour in Quadratic Programming (QP)-CBF schemes, and resolves compatibility issues between Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) and CBF constraints via the prediction horizon used in the optimization. We show the efficacy of the method via numerical simulations for a safety critical application.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on multirate time-domain simulations of power system models. It proposes a matrix pencil-based approach to evaluate the spurious numerical deformation introduced to power system dynamics by a given multirate integration scheme. Moreover, it considers the problem of multirate partitioning and discusses a strategy for allocating state and algebraic variables to fast and slow subsystems based on modal participation factors (PFs). The suitability and features of the proposed approach are illustrated through numerical simulations that assess the accuracy effects of interfacing as well as of various prediction and solution methods.</description>

      <title>EVOLVE: a Value-Added Services Platform for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A notable challenge in Electric Vehicle (EV) charging is the time required to fully charge the battery, which can range from 15 minutes to 2-3 hours. This idle period, however, presents an opportunity to offer time-consuming or data-intensive services such as vehicular software updates. ISO 15118 referred to the concept of Value-Added Services (VAS) in the charging scenario, but it remained underexplored in the literature. Our paper addresses this gap by proposing \acronym, the first EV charger compute architecture that supports secure on-charger universal applications with upstream and downstream communication. The architecture covers the end-to-end hardware/software stack, including standard API for vehicles and IT infrastructure. We demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of \acronym by employing and evaluating three suggested value-added services: vehicular software updates, security information and event management (SIEM), and secure payments. The results demonstrate significant reductions in bandwidth utilization and latency, as well as high throughput, which supports this novel concept and suggests a promising business model for Electric Vehicle charging station operation.</description>

      <title>Robust Tube-based Control Strategy for Vision-guided Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A robust control strategy for autonomous vehicles can improve system stability, enhance riding comfort, and prevent driving accidents. This paper presents a novel interpolation tube-based constrained iterative linear quadratic regulator (itube-CILQR) algorithm for autonomous computer-vision-based vehicle lane-keeping. The goal of the algorithm is to enhance robustness during high-speed cornering on tight turns. The advantages of itube-CILQR over the standard tube-approach include reduced system conservatism and increased computational speed. Numerical and vision-based experiments were conducted to examine the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. The proposed itube-CILQR algorithm is better suited to vehicle lane-keeping than variational CILQR-based methods and model predictive control (MPC) approaches using a classical interior-point solver. Specifically, in evaluation experiments, itube-CILQR achieved an average runtime of 3.16 ms to generate a control signal to guide a self-driving vehicle; itube-MPC typically required a 4.67-times longer computation time to complete the same task. Moreover, the influence of conservatism on system behavior was investigated by exploring the interpolation variable trajectories derived from the proposed itube-CILQR algorithm during lane-keeping maneuvers.</description>

      <title>Choose Wisely: Data-Enabled Predictive Control for Nonlinear Systems Using Online Data Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes Select-Data-Enabled Predictive Control (Select-DeePC), a new method for controlling nonlinear systems using output-feedback for which data are available but an explicit model is not. At each timestep, Select-DeePC employs only the most relevant data to implicitly linearize the dynamics in ``trajectory space.'' Then, taking user-defined output constraints into account, it makes control decisions using a convex optimization. This optimal control is applied in a receding-horizon manner. As the online data-selection is the core of Select-DeePC, we propose and verify both norm-based and manifold-embedding-based selection methods. We evaluate Select-DeePC on three benchmark nonlinear system simulators -- rocket-landing, a robotic arm and cart-pole inverted pendulum swing-up -- comparing them with standard DeePC and Time-Windowed DeePC, and find that Select-DeePC outperforms both methods.</description>

      <title>Inertial-Based LQG Control: A New Look at Inverted Pendulum Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control is a well-established method for optimal control through state estimation, particularly in stabilizing an inverted pendulum on a cart. In standard laboratory setups, sensor redundancy enables direct measurement of configuration variables using displacement sensors and rotary encoders. However, in outdoor environments, dynamically stable mobile platforms-such as Segways, hoverboards, and bipedal robots-often have limited sensor availability, restricting state estimation primarily to attitude stabilization. Since the tilt angle cannot be directly measured, it is typically estimated through sensor fusion, increasing reliance on inertial sensors and necessitating a lightweight, self-contained perception module. Prior research has not incorporated accelerometer data into the LQG framework for stabilizing pendulum-like systems, as jerk states are not explicitly modeled in the Newton-Euler formalism. In this paper, we address this gap by leveraging local differential flatness to incorporate higher-order dynamics into the system model. This refinement enhances state estimation, enabling a more robust LQG controller that predicts accelerations for dynamically stable mobile platforms.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Exploration-Based Precise Mapping for Mobile Robots through Stepwise and Consistent Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an autonomous exploration framework. It is designed for indoor ground mobile robots that utilize laser Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), ensuring process completeness and precise mapping results. For frontier search, the local-global sampling architecture based on multiple Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) is employed. Traversability checks during RRT expansion and global RRT pruning upon map updates eliminate unreachable frontiers, reducing potential collisions and deadlocks. Adaptive sampling density adjustments, informed by obstacle distribution, enhance exploration coverage potential. For frontier point navigation, a stepwise consistent motion strategy is adopted, wherein the robot strictly drives straight on approximately equidistant line segments in the polyline path and rotates in place at segment junctions. This simplified, decoupled motion pattern improves scan-matching stability and mitigates map drift. For process control, the framework serializes frontier point selection and navigation, avoiding oscillation caused by frequent goal changes in conventional parallelized processes. The waypoint retracing mechanism is introduced to generate repeated observations, triggering loop closure detection and backend optimization in graph-based SLAM, thereby improving map consistency and precision. Experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness of the framework. It achieves improved mapping coverage and precision in more challenging environments compared to baseline 2D exploration algorithms. It also shows robustness in supporting resource-constrained robot platforms and maintaining mapping consistency across various LiDAR field-of-view (FoV) configurations.</description>

      <title>Optimization over Trained Neural Networks: Difference-of-Convex Algorithm and Application to Data Center Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When solving decision-making problems with mathematical optimization, some constraints or objectives may lack analytic expressions but can be approximated from data. When an approximation is made by neural networks, the underlying problem becomes optimization over trained neural networks. Despite recent improvements with cutting planes, relaxations, and heuristics, the problem remains difficult to solve in practice. We propose a new solution based on a bilinear problem reformulation that penalizes ReLU constraints in the objective function. This reformulation makes the problem amenable to efficient difference-of-convex algorithms (DCA), for which we propose a principled approach to penalty selection that facilitates convergence to stationary points of the original problem. We apply the DCA to the problem of the least-cost allocation of data center electricity demand in a power grid, reporting significant savings in congested cases.</description>

      <title>A Predictive Services Architecture for Efficient Airspace Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting air traffic congestion and flow management is essential for airlines and Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP) to enhance operational efficiency. Accurate estimates of future airport capacity and airspace density are vital for better airspace management, reducing air traffic controller workload and fuel consumption, ultimately promoting sustainable aviation. While existing literature has addressed these challenges, data management and query processing remain complex due to the vast volume of high-rate air traffic data. Many analytics use cases require a common pre-processing infrastructure, as ad-hoc approaches are insufficient. Additionally, linear prediction models often fall short, necessitating more advanced techniques.
  This paper presents a data processing and predictive services architecture that ingests large, uncorrelated, and noisy streaming data to forecast future airspace system states. The system continuously collects raw data, periodically compresses it, and stores it in NoSQL databases for efficient query processing. For prediction, the system learns from historical traffic by extracting key features such as airport arrival and departure events, sector boundary crossings, weather parameters, and other air traffic data. These features are input into various regression models, including linear, non-linear, and ensemble models, with the best-performing model selected for predictions. We evaluate this infrastructure across three prediction use cases in the US National Airspace System (NAS) and a segment of European airspace, using extensive real operations data, confirming that our system can predict future system states efficiently and accurately.</description>

      <title>Extending First-order Motion Planners to Second-order Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends first-order motion planners to robots governed by second-order dynamics. Two control schemes are proposed based on the knowledge of a scalar function whose negative gradient aligns with a given first-order motion planner. When such a function is known, the first-order motion planner is combined with a damping velocity vector with a dynamic gain to extend the safety and convergence guarantees of the first-order motion planner to second-order systems. If no such function is available, we propose an alternative control scheme ensuring that the error between the robot's velocity and the first-order motion planner converges to zero. The theoretical developments are supported by simulation results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.</description>

      <title>On the Hopf-Cole Transform for Control-affine Schr\"{o}dinger Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to clarify the importance of the relation $\boldsymbol{gg}^{\top}\propto \boldsymbol{\sigma\sigma}^{\top}$ in solving control-affine Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problems via the Hopf-Cole transform, where $\boldsymbol{g},\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ are the control and noise coefficients, respectively. We show that the Hopf-Cole transform applied to the conditions of optimality for generic control-affine Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problems, i.e., without the assumption $\boldsymbol{gg}^{\top}\propto\boldsymbol{\sigma\sigma}^{\top}$, gives a pair of forward-backward PDEs that are neither linear nor equation-level decoupled. We explain how the resulting PDEs can be interpreted as nonlinear forward-backward advection-diffusion-reaction equations, where the nonlinearity stem from additional drift and reaction terms involving the gradient of the log-likelihood a.k.a. the score. These additional drift and reaction vanish when $\boldsymbol{gg}^{\top}\propto\boldsymbol{\sigma\sigma}^{\top}$, and the resulting boundary-coupled system of linear PDEs can then be solved by dynamic Sinkhorn recursions. A key takeaway of our work is that the numerical solution of the generic control-affine Schr\"{o}dinger bridge requires further algorithmic development, possibly generalizing the dynamic Sinkhorn recursion or otherwise.</description>

      <title>Tensor-based homogeneous polynomial dynamical system analysis from data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous complex real-world systems, such as those in biological, ecological, and social networks, exhibit higher-order interactions that are often modeled using polynomial dynamical systems or homogeneous polynomial dynamical systems (HPDSs). However, identifying system parameters and analyzing key system-theoretic properties remain challenging due to their inherent nonlinearity and complexity, particularly for large-scale systems. To address these challenges, we develop an innovative computational framework in this article that leverages advanced tensor decomposition techniques, namely tensor train and hierarchical Tucker decompositions, to facilitate efficient identification and analysis of HPDSs that can be equivalently represented by tensors. Specifically, we introduce memory-efficient system identification techniques for directly estimating system parameters represented through tensor decompositions from time-series data. Additionally, we develop necessary and sufficient conditions for determining controllability and observability using the tensor decomposition-based representations of HPDSs, accompanied by detailed complexity analyses that demonstrate significant reductions in computational demands. The effectiveness and efficiency of our framework are validated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Ordering and refining path-complete Lyapunov functions through composition lifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fruitful approach to study stability of switched systems is to look for multiple Lyapunov functions. However, in general, we do not yet understand the interplay between the desired stability certificate, the template of the Lyapunov functions and their mutual relationships to accommodate switching. In this work we elaborate on path-complete Lyapunov functions: a graphical framework that aims to elucidate this interplay. In particular, previously, several preorders were introduced to compare multiple Lyapunov functions. These preorders are initially algorithmically intractable due to the algebraic nature of Lyapunov inequalities, yet, lifting techniques were proposed to turn some preorders purely combinatorial and thereby eventually tractable. In this note we show that a conjecture in this area regarding the so-called composition lift, that was believed to be true, is false. This refutal, however, points us to a beneficial structural feature of the composition lift that we exploit to iteratively refine path-complete graphs, plus, it points us to a favourable adaptation of the composition lift.</description>

      <title>NMPC-based Unified Posture Manipulation and Thrust Vectoring for Fault Recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-rotors face significant risks, as actuator failures at high altitudes can easily result in a crash and the robot's destruction. Therefore, rapid fault recovery in the event of an actuator failure is necessary for the fault-tolerant and safe operation of unmanned aerial robots. In this work, we present a fault recovery approach based on the unification of posture manipulation and thrust vectoring. The key contributions of this work are: 1) Derivation of two flight dynamics models (high-fidelity and reduced-order) that capture posture control and thrust vectoring. 2) Design of a controller based on Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) and demonstration of fault recovery in simulation using a high-fidelity model of the Multi-Modal Mobility Morphobot (M4) in Simscape.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Influence Campaigns: Nudging under Bounded Confidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Influence campaigns in online social networks are often run by organizations, political parties, and nation states to influence large audiences. These campaigns are employed through the use of agents in the network that share persuasive content. Yet, their impact might be minimal if the audiences remain unswayed, often due to the bounded confidence phenomenon, where only a narrow spectrum of viewpoints can influence them. Here we show that to persuade under bounded confidence, an agent must nudge its targets to gradually shift their opinions. Using a control theory approach, we show how to construct an agent's nudging policy under the bounded confidence opinion dynamics model and also how to select targets for multiple agents in an influence campaign on a social network. Simulations on real Twitter networks show that a multi-agent nudging policy can shift the mean opinion, decrease opinion polarization, or even increase it. We find that our nudging based policies outperform other common techniques that do not consider the bounded confidence effect. Finally, we show how to craft prompts for large language models, such as ChatGPT, to generate text-based content for real nudging policies. This illustrates the practical feasibility of our approach, allowing one to go from mathematical nudging policies to real social media content.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Bounds for Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation with Arbitrary Norm Contractions and Markovian Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-time-scale Stochastic Approximation (SA) is an iterative algorithm with applications in reinforcement learning and optimization. Prior finite time analysis of such algorithms has focused on fixed point iterations with mappings contractive under Euclidean norm. Motivated by applications in reinforcement learning, we give the first mean square bound on non linear two-time-scale SA where the iterations have arbitrary norm contractive mappings and Markovian noise. We show that the mean square error decays at a rate of $O(1/n^{2/3})$ in the general case, and at a rate of $O(1/n)$ in a special case where the slower timescale is noiseless. Our analysis uses the generalized Moreau envelope to handle the arbitrary norm contractions and solutions of Poisson equation to deal with the Markovian noise. By analyzing the SSP Q-Learning algorithm, we give the first $O(1/n)$ bound for an algorithm for asynchronous control of MDPs under the average reward criterion. We also obtain a rate of $O(1/n)$ for Q-Learning with Polyak-averaging and provide an algorithm for learning Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE) for strongly monotone games which converges at a rate of $O(1/n^{2/3})$.</description>

      <title>The On-Board Computer of the AcubeSAT Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AcubeSAT is an open-source CubeSat mission aiming to explore the effects of microgravity and radiation on eukaryotic cells using a compact microfluidic lab-on-a-chip platform. It is developed by SpaceDot, a volunteer, interdisciplinary student team at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and supported by the "Fly Your Satellite! 3" program of the European Space Agency (ESA) Education Office.
  The nanosatellite features an in-house designed on-board computer subsystem responsible for telecommand execution, telemetry fetching, onboard time synchronization, in-orbit patching, and fault recovery. The subsystem is designed on one PC/104 standard compatible Printed Circuit Board (PCB) that hosts the On-board Computer (OBC) on the one side and the Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem (AOCS) on the other, and it is compatible with the LibreCube standard. The hosted subsystems are functionally isolated and feature an ARM Cortex-M7, radiation-tolerant microcontroller each.
  Before sending anything to space thorough testing is required and specifically the on-board computer board underwent vibration and thermal cycling tests to ensure nominal operation in all conditions.
  This paper aims to elucidate the decision-making process, design iterations, and development stages of the custom board and accompanying in-house software. Insights garnered from the initial partially successful environmental test campaign at the ESA CubeSat Support Facility will be shared, along with the ensuing preparations, results, and lessons learned from subsequent testing endeavors in April 2024. Furthermore, the current developmental status will be discussed alongside future electromagnetic compatibility testing, integration plan on a FlatSat, and prospects for the open-source design as a cost-effective, and modular solution that can be tailored with little effort for upcoming missions.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Simulator for Electrically Reconfigurable Electromagnetic Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel CUDA-enabled PyTorch-based framework designed for the gradient-based optimization of such reconfigurable electromagnetic structures with electrically tunable parameters. Traditional optimization techniques for these structures often rely on non-gradient-based methods, limiting efficiency and flexibility. Our framework leverages automatic differentiation, facilitating the application of gradient-based optimization methods. This approach is particularly advantageous for embedding within deep learning frameworks, enabling sophisticated optimization strategies.
  We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through comprehensive simulations involving resonant structures with tunable parameters. Key contributions include the efficient solution of the inverse problem. The framework's performance is validated using three different resonant structures: a single-loop copper wire (Unit-Cell) as well as an 8x1 and an 8x8 array of resonant unit cells with multiple inductively coupled unit cells (1d and 2d Metasurfaces). Results show precise in-silico control over the magnetic field's component normal to the surface of each resonant structure, achieving desired field strengths with minimal error. The proposed framework is compatible with existing simulation software.
  This PyTorch-based framework sets the stage for advanced electromagnetic control strategies for resonant structures with application in e.g. MRI, providing a robust platform for further exploration and innovation in the design and optimization of resonant electromagnetic structures.</description>

      <title>Learning a Class of Mixed Linear Regressions: Global Convergence under General Data Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed linear regression (MLR) has attracted increasing attention because of its great theoretical and practical importance in capturing nonlinear relationships by utilizing a mixture of linear regression sub-models. Although considerable efforts have been devoted to the learning problem of such systems, i.e., estimating data labels and identifying model parameters, most existing investigations employ the offline algorithm, impose the strict independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) or persistent excitation (PE) conditions on the regressor data, and provide local convergence results only. In this paper, we investigate the recursive estimation and data clustering problems for a class of stochastic MLRs with two components. To address this inherently nonconvex optimization problem, we propose a novel two-step recursive identification algorithm to estimate the true parameters, where the direction vector and the scaling coefficient of the unknown parameters are estimated by the least squares and the expectation-maximization (EM) principles, respectively. Under a general data condition, which is much weaker than the traditional i.i.d. and PE conditions, we establish the global convergence and the convergence rate of the proposed identification algorithm for the first time. Furthermore, we prove that, without any excitation condition on the regressor data, the data clustering performance including the cumulative mis-classification error and the within-cluster error can be optimal asymptotically. Finally, we provide a numerical example to illustrate the performance of the proposed learning algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enforcing multiple constraints based on the concept of control barrier functions (CBFs) is a remaining challenge because each of the CBFs requires a condition on the control inputs to be satisfied which may easily lead to infeasibility problems. The problem becomes even more challenging with input constraints and disturbances. In this paper, we consider enforcement of bounding box constraints for a second order system under limited control authority and input disturbances. To solve the constrained control problem, we apply multiple robust control barrier functions (RCBFs) which, in general, do not provide a feasible solution to the problem. However, we derive conditions on how to select the RCBF parameters to guarantee that a feasible solution always exists.</description>

Abstract: Precise temperature measurement at micro/nanoscale is crucial across various domains including physical sciences, chemical processes, industrial production, medical diagnosis, weather forecasting, electronics, and biology. Micro/nanoscale thermal mapping requires precise techniques such as thermocouples, resistance-based devices, infrared thermography, optical interferometry, Raman thermometry, and Time domain-thermoreflectance (TDTR) method. Each method has its advantages and limitations, emphasizing the importance of selecting the appropriate technique. Among these methods, micro-thin film thermocouples (TFTCs) offer a compelling solution due to their direct contact-based temperature measurements, minimal surface preparation requirements, lower cost, and robustness against environmental factors. Thermocouples work on the well-established Seebeck effect, where a voltage is generated proportional to the temperature difference between two points. However, at micro/nanoscale, the Seebeck coefficients of thermocouples differ from those in bulk materials, requiring experimental calibration for precise measurements. To address this, we introduce an on-chip characterization platform with a differential temperature measurement setup on a borosilicate glass substrate. This platform utilizes a microheater as a localized heat source to elevate the temperature at the hot junction of the TFTC while maintaining the cold junction at ambient conditions. Numerical simulations are employed to engineer both the microheater and TFTC junction for precise temperature control. The functionality of this platform is validated by fabricating TFTCs using standard fabrication processes and measuring the TFTC response to determine the differential Seebeck coefficient of a Platinum-Chromium TFTC Junction. The calculated sensitivity of Pt/Cr TFTCs using this calibration method is 19.23 +- 0.405 {\mu}V/C.</description>

      <title>Recursive Identification of Binary-Valued Systems under Uniform Persistent Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the control-oriented identification problem of set-valued moving average systems with uniform persistent excitations and observation noises. A stochastic approximation-based (SA-based) algorithm without projections or truncations is proposed. The algorithm overcomes the limitations of the existing empirical measurement method and the recursive projection method, where the former requires periodic inputs, and the latter requires projections to restrict the search region in a compact set.To analyze the convergence property of the algorithm, the distribution tail of the estimation error is proved to be exponentially convergent through an auxiliary stochastic process. Based on this key technique, the SA-based algorithm appears to be the first to reach the almost sure convergence rate of $ O(\sqrt{\ln\ln k/k}) $ theoretically in the non-periodic input case. Meanwhile, the mean square convergence is proved to have a rate of $ O(1/k) $, which is the best one even under accurate observations. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Distributed Safe Control Design and Probabilistic Safety Verification for Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose distributed iterative algorithms for safe control design and safety verification for networked multi-agent systems. These algorithms rely on distributing a control barrier function (CBF) related quadratic programming (QP) problem assuming the existence of CBFs. The proposed distributed algorithm addresses infeasibility issues of existing schemes via a cooperation mechanism between agents. The resulting control input is guaranteed to be optimal, and satisfies CBF constraints of all agents. Furthermore, a truncated algorithm is proposed to facilitate computational implementation. The performance of the truncated algorithm is evaluated using a distributed safety verification algorithm. The algorithm quantifies safety for multi-agent systems probabilistically by means of CBFs. Both upper and lower bounds on the probability of safety are obtained using the so called scenario approach. Both the scenario sampling and safety verification procedures are fully distributed. The efficacy of our algorithms is demonstrated by an example on multi-robot collision avoidance.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Grid-Interfacing Inverters With Current Magnitude Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grid-interfacing inverters act as the interface between renewable resources and the electric grid, and have the potential to offer fast and programmable controls compared to synchronous generators. With this flexibility there has been significant research efforts into determining the best way to control these inverters. Inverters are limited in their maximum current output in order to protect semiconductor devices, presenting a nonlinear constraint that needs to be accounted for in their control algorithms. Existing approaches either simply saturate a controller that is designed for unconstrained systems, or assume small perturbations and linearize a saturated system. These approaches can lead to stability issues or limiting the control actions to be too conservative.
  In this paper, we directly focus on a nonlinear system that explicitly accounts for the saturation of the current magnitude. We use a Lyapunov stability approach to determine a stability condition for the system, guaranteeing that a class of controllers would be stabilizing if they satisfy a simple SDP condition. With this condition we fit a linear-feedback controller by sampling the output (offline) model predictive control problems. This learned controller has improved performances with existing designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a physics-informed machine learning-based control method for nonlinear dynamic systems with highly noisy measurements. Existing data-driven control methods that use machine learning for system identification cannot effectively cope with highly noisy measurements, resulting in unstable control performance. To address this challenge, the present study extends current physics-informed machine learning capabilities for modeling nonlinear dynamics with control and integrates them into a model predictive control framework. To demonstrate the capability of the proposed method we test and validate with two noisy nonlinear dynamic systems: the chaotic Lorenz 3 system, and turning machine tool. Analysis of the results illustrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks as measured by both modeling accuracy and control performance for nonlinear dynamic systems under high-noise conditions.</description>

      <title>Signal-Comparison-Based Distributed Estimation Under Decaying Average Data Rate Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper investigates the distributed estimation problem under low bit rate communications. Based on the signal-comparison (SC) consensus protocol under binary-valued communications, a new consensus+innovations type distributed estimation algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the high-dimensional estimates are compressed into binary-valued messages by using a periodic compressive strategy, dithered noises and a sign function. Next, based on the dithered noises and expanding triggering thresholds, a new stochastic event-triggered mechanism is proposed to reduce the communication frequency. Then, a modified SC consensus protocol is applied to fuse the neighborhood information. Finally, a stochastic approximation estimation algorithm is used to process innovations. The proposed SC-based algorithm has the advantages of high effectiveness and low communication cost. For the effectiveness, the estimates of the SC-based algorithm converge to the true value in the almost sure and mean square sense. A polynomial almost sure convergence rate is also obtained. For the communication cost, the local and global average bit rates for communications decay to zero at a polynomial rate. The trade-off between the convergence rate and the communication cost is established through event-triggered coefficients. A better convergence rate can be achieved by decreasing event-triggered coefficients, while lower communication cost can be achieved by increasing event-triggered coefficients. A simulation example is given to demonstrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Generative AI as a Service in 6G Edge-Cloud: Generation Task Offloading by In-context Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is a promising technique towards 6G networks, and generative foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) have attracted considerable interest from academia and telecom industry. This work considers a novel edge-cloud deployment of foundation models in 6G networks. Specifically, it aims to minimize the service delay of foundation models by radio resource allocation and task offloading, i.e., offloading diverse content generation tasks to proper LLMs at the network edge or cloud. In particular, we first introduce the communication system model, i.e., allocating radio resources and calculating link capacity to support generated content transmission, and then we present the LLM inference model to calculate the delay of content generation. After that, we propose a novel in-context learning method to optimize the task offloading decisions. It utilizes LLM's inference capabilities, and avoids the difficulty of dedicated model training or fine-tuning as in conventional machine learning algorithms. Finally, the simulations demonstrate that the proposed edge-cloud deployment and in-context learning task offloading method can achieve satisfactory generation service quality without dedicated model training or fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Safe Control of Grid-Interfacing Inverters with Current Magnitude Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grid-interfacing inverters allow renewable resources to be connected to the electric grid and offer fast and programmable control responses. However, inverters are subject to significant physical constraints. One such constraint is a current magnitude limit required to protect semiconductor devices. While many current limiting methods are available, they can often unpredictably alter the behavior of the inverter control during overcurrent events leading to instability or poor performance.
  In this paper, we present a safety filter approach to limit the current magnitude of inverters controlled as voltage sources. The safety filter problem is formulated with a control barrier function constraint that encodes the current magnitude limit. To ensure feasibility of the problem, we prove the existence of a safe linear controller for a specified reference. This approach allows for the desired voltage source behavior to be minimally altered while safely limiting the current output.</description>

      <title>A Control Barrier Function Candidate for Quadrotors with Limited Field of View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of control based on vision measurements (bearings) has been amply studied in the literature; however, the problem of addressing the limits of the field of view of physical sensors has received relatively less attention (especially for agents with non-trivial dynamics). The technical challenge is that, as in most vision-based control approaches, a standard approach to the problem requires knowing the distance between cameras and observed features in the scene, which is not directly available. Instead, we present a solution based on a Control Barrier Function (CBF) approach that uses a splitting of the original differential constraint to effectively remove the dependence on the unknown measurement error. Compared to the current literature, our approach gives strong robustness guarantees against bounded distance estimation errors. We showcase the proposed solution with the numerical simulations of a double integrator and a quadrotor tracking a trajectory while keeping the corners of a rectangular gate in the camera field of view.</description>

      <title>Sensor-Based Safety-Critical Control Using an Incremental Control Barrier Function Formulation via Reduced-Order Approximate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existing control barrier function literature generally relies on precise mathematical models to guarantee system safety, limiting their applicability in scenarios with parametric uncertainties. While incremental control techniques have shown promise in addressing model uncertainties in flight control applications, translating these approaches to safety-critical control presents significant challenges. This paper bridges this gap by introducing measurement-robust incremental control barrier functions (MRICBFs), which leverage sensor-based reduced-order models to provide formal safety guarantees for uncertain systems. By carefully addressing the challenges of sensor accuracy and approximation errors in the incremental formulation, our approach enables substituting specific model components with real-time sensor measurements while maintaining rigorous safety guarantees. This formulation overcomes the limitations of traditional adaptive control methods that adjust system parameters over time, enabling immediate and reliable safety measures for a class of model uncertainties. The efficacy of MRICBFs is demonstrated in two simulation case studies: a simple first-order system with time-varying sensor biases and a more complex overactuated hypersonic glide vehicle with multiple state constraints.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reinforcement Learning-Based Two-Stage Unit Commitment Framework for Enhanced Power Systems Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21240v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unit commitment (UC) optimizes the start-up and shutdown schedules of generating units to meet load demand while minimizing costs. However, the increasing integration of renewable energy introduces uncertainties for real-time scheduling. Existing solutions face limitations both in modeling and algorithmic design. At the modeling level, they fail to incorporate widely adopted virtual power plants (VPPs) as flexibility resources, missing the opportunity to proactively mitigate potential real-time imbalances or ramping constraints through foresight-seeing decision-making. At the algorithmic level, existing probabilistic optimization, multi-stage approaches, and machine learning, face challenges in computational complexity and adaptability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel two-stage UC framework that incorporates foresight-seeing sequential decision-making in both day-ahead and real-time scheduling, leveraging VPPs as flexibility resources to proactively reserve capacity and ramping flexibility for upcoming renewable energy uncertainties over several hours. In particular, we develop quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) algorithms that integrate the foresight-seeing sequential decision-making and scalable computation advantages of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with the parallel and high-efficiency search capabilities of quantum computing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed QRL-based approach outperforms in computational efficiency, real-time responsiveness, and solution quality.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Robust Optimal Operation of Distribution Networks Considering Renewable Energy and Demand Asymmetric Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a confidence level-based distributionally information gap decision theory (CL-DIGDT) framework for the two-stage robust optimal operation of distribution networks, aiming at deriving an optimal operational scheme capable of addressing asymmetric uncertainties related to renewable energy and load demands. Building on conventional IGDT, the proposed framework utilizes the confidence level to capture the asymmetric characteristics of uncertainties and maximize the risk-averse capability of the solution in a probabilistic manner. To account for the probabilistic consideration, the imprecise Dirichlet model is employed to construct the ambiguity sets of uncertainties, reducing reliance on precise probability distributions. Consequently, a two-stage robust optimal operation model for distribution networks using CL-DIGDT is developed. An iterative method is proposed to solve the model and determine the upper and lower bounds of the objective function. Case study demonstrates that the proposed approach yields a more robust and statistically optimized solution with required accuracy compared to existing method, contributing to a reduction in first-stage cost by 0.84%, second-stage average cost by 6.7%, and significantly increasing the reliability of the solution by 8%.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Coverage in Convex Quadrilateral Regions with a Single UAV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into next-generation wireless networks is a promising solution for providing flexible, efficient coverage. This paper explores the optimal deployment of a single UAV to cover an arbitrary convex quadrilateral region, utilizing a directional antenna with a tiltable beam that produces an elliptical coverage footprint. We examine two distinct coverage scenarios: (i) the largest inscribed ellipse, which maximizes coverage within the quadrilateral while excluding the boundary, and (ii) the smallest circumscribed ellipse, ensuring complete coverage of the entire area. The study formulates an optimization framework that accounts for path loss, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and energy consumption to determine the optimal altitude of the UAV. By employing a simplified path loss model, we derive the altitude that minimizes maximum path loss, while also analyzing the impact of antenna directivity on maximizing the minimum SNR at the coverage boundary. Additionally, the UAV's energy consumption is evaluated, considering the power demands during hovering, forward flight, and vertical takeoff. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the trade-offs between coverage effectiveness, communication performance, and energy efficiency across various environmental conditions and antenna configurations.</description>

      <title>Robust Optimal Safe and Stability Guaranteeing Reinforcement Learning Control for Quadcopter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have provided new data-driven ways of controller design to replace the traditional manual synthesis and certification approaches. Employing neural network (NN) as controllers however, presents its own challenge: that of certifying stability due to their inherent complex nonlinearity, and while NN controllers have demonstrated high performance in complex systems, they often lack formal stability guarantees. This issue is further accentuated for critical nonlinear applications such as of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), complicating their stability guarantees, whereas a lack of stability assurance raises the risk of critical damage or even complete failure under a loss of control. In this study, we improve a Robust, Optimal, Safe and Stability Guaranteed Training (ROSS-GT) method of [1] to design an NN controller for a quadcopter flight control. The approach ensures closed-loop system stability by finding a Lyapunov function, and providing a safe initial state domain that remains invariant under the control and guarantees stability to an equilibrium within it. Stability guaranteeing constraints are derived from the sector bound of the system nonlinearity and of its parameters and disturbance variations, in the form of a Lipschitz bound for a NN control. The control performance is further optimized by searching over the class of stability-guaranteeing controllers to minimize the reference tracking error and the control costs.</description>

      <title>Emergency-Brake Simplex: Toward A Verifiably Safe Control-CPS Architecture for Abrupt Runtime Reachability Constraint Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a system's constraints change abruptly, the system's reachability safety does no longer sustain. Thus, the system can reach a forbidden/dangerous value. Conventional remedy practically involves online controller redesign (OCR) to re-establish the reachability's compliance with the new constraints, which, however, is usually too slow. There is a need for an online strategy capable of managing runtime changes in reachability constraints. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this topic has not been addressed in the existing literature. In this paper, we propose a fast fault tolerance strategy to recover the system's reachability safety in runtime. Instead of redesigning the system's controller, we propose to change the system's reference state to modify the system's reachability to comply with the new constraints. We frame the reference state search as an optimization problem and employ the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) method as well as the Interior Point Method (IPM) based Newton's method (as a fallback for the KKT method) for fast solution derivation. The optimization also allows more future fault tolerance. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our method outperforms the conventional OCR method in terms of computational efficiency and success rate. Specifically, the results show that the proposed method finds a solution $10^{2}$ (with the IPM based Newton's method) $\sim 10^{4}$ (with the KKT method) times faster than the OCR method. Additionally, the improvement rate of the success rate of our method over the OCR method is $40.81\%$ without considering the deadline of run time. The success rate remains at $49.44\%$ for the proposed method, while it becomes $0\%$ for the OCR method when a deadline of $1.5 \; seconds$ is imposed.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna Enabled Wireless Communication System with Visual Recognition: A Prototype Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) is an emerging technology that has great potential to exploit additional spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) by flexibly altering the three-dimensional (3D) orientation/boresight of each antenna. In this demonstration, we present a prototype of the RA-enabled wireless communication system with a visual recognition module to evaluate the performance gains provided by the RA in practical environments. In particular, a mechanically-driven RA is developed by integrating a digital servo motor, a directional antenna, and a microcontroller, which enables the dynamic adjustment of the RA orientation. Moreover, the orientation adjustment of the RA is guided by the user's direction information provided by the visual recognition module, thereby significantly enhancing system response speed and self-orientation accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that the RA-enabled communication system achieves significant improvement in communication coverage performance compared to the conventional fixed antenna system.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Multi-Robot Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The networked nature of multi-robot systems presents challenges in the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Centralized control policies do not scale with increasing numbers of robots, whereas independent control policies do not exploit the information provided by other robots, exhibiting poor performance in cooperative-competitive tasks. In this work we propose a physics-informed reinforcement learning approach able to learn distributed multi-robot control policies that are both scalable and make use of all the available information to each robot. Our approach has three key characteristics. First, it imposes a port-Hamiltonian structure on the policy representation, respecting energy conservation properties of physical robot systems and the networked nature of robot team interactions. Second, it uses self-attention to ensure a sparse policy representation able to handle time-varying information at each robot from the interaction graph. Third, we present a soft actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm parameterized by our self-attention port-Hamiltonian control policy, which accounts for the correlation among robots during training while overcoming the need of value function factorization. Extensive simulations in different multi-robot scenarios demonstrate the success of the proposed approach, surpassing previous multi-robot reinforcement learning solutions in scalability, while achieving similar or superior performance (with averaged cumulative reward up to x2 greater than the state-of-the-art with robot teams x6 larger than the number of robots at training time). We also validate our approach on multiple real robots in the Georgia Tech Robotarium under imperfect communication, demonstrating zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and scalability across number of robots.</description>

      <title>A Greedy Quantum Route-Generation Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Routing and scheduling problems with time windows have long been important optimization problems for logistics and planning. Many classical heuristics and exact methods exist for such problems. However, there are no satisfactory methods for generating routes using quantum computing (QC), for mainly two reasons: inequality constraints, and the trade-off of feasibility and solution quality. Inequality constraints are typically handled using slack variables; and feasible solutions are found by filtering samples. These challenges are amplified in the presence of noise inherent in QC. Here, we propose a greedy algorithm that generates routes by using information from all samples obtained from the quantum computer. By noticing the relationship between qubits in our formulation as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), we designed an algorithm that adaptively constructs a feasible solution.
  We prove its convergence to a feasible solution, and illustrate its efficacy by solving the Fleet Sizing Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (FSVRPTW). Our computational results show that this method obtains a lower objective value than the current state-of-the-art annealing approaches, both classical and hybrid, for the same amount of time using D-Wave Hybrid Solvers. We also show its robustness to noise on D-Wave Advantage2 through computational results as compared to the filtering approach on DWaveSampler, even when the filtering approach is given a longer annealing time, and a larger sample size.</description>

      <title>Non-overshooting continuous in convergence sliding mode control of second-order systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14000v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel nonlinear sliding mode state feedback controller for perturbed second-order systems. In analogy to a linear proportional-derivative (PD) feedback control, the proposed nonlinear scheme uses the output of interest and its time derivative. The control has only one free design parameter, and the closed-loop system is shown to possess uniform boundedness and finite-time convergence of trajectories in the presence of matched disturbances. We derive a strict Lyapunov function for the closed-loop control system with a bounded exogenous perturbation, and use it for both, the control parameter tuning and analysis of the finite-time convergence. The essential features of the proposed new control law is non-overshooting despite the unknown dynamic disturbances and the continuous control action during the convergence to zero equilibrium. Apart from the numerical results, a revealing experimental example is also shown in favor of the proposed control and in comparison with PD and sub-optimal nonlinear damping regulators.</description>

      <title>Certifiably Robust Policies for Uncertain Parametric Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03093v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a data-driven approach for producing policies that are provably robust across unknown stochastic environments. Existing approaches can learn models of a single environment as an interval Markov decision processes (IMDP) and produce a robust policy with a probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantee on its performance. However these are unable to reason about the impact of environmental parameters underlying the uncertainty. We propose a framework based on parametric Markov decision processes (MDPs) with unknown distributions over parameters. We learn and analyse IMDPs for a set of unknown sample environments induced by parameters. The key challenge is then to produce meaningful performance guarantees that combine the two layers of uncertainty: (1) multiple environments induced by parameters with an unknown distribution; (2) unknown induced environments which are approximated by IMDPs. We present a novel approach based on scenario optimisation that yields a single PAC guarantee quantifying the risk level for which a specified performance level can be assured in unseen environments, plus a means to trade-off risk and performance. We implement and evaluate our framework using multiple robust policy generation methods on a range of benchmarks. We show that our approach produces tight bounds on a policy's performance with high confidence.</description>

      <title>Control Strategies for Pursuit-Evasion Under Occlusion Using Visibility and Safety Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a control strategy for pursuit-evasion problems in environments with occlusions. We address the challenge of a mobile pursuer keeping a mobile evader within its field of view (FoV) despite line-of-sight obstructions. The signed distance function (SDF) of the FoV is used to formulate visibility as a control barrier function (CBF) constraint on the pursuer's control inputs. Similarly, obstacle avoidance is formulated as a CBF constraint based on the SDF of the obstacle set. While the visibility and safety CBFs are Lipschitz continuous, they are not differentiable everywhere, necessitating the use of generalized gradients. To achieve non-myopic pursuit, we generate reference control trajectories leading to evader visibility using a sampling-based kinodynamic planner. The pursuer then tracks this reference via convex optimization under the CBF constraints. We validate our approach in CARLA simulations and real-world robot experiments, demonstrating successful visibility maintenance using only onboard sensing, even under severe occlusions and dynamic evader movements.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic Clutches Enable Simultaneous Mechanical Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Actuating robotic systems with multiple degrees of freedom (DoF) traditionally requires numerous motors, leading to increased size, weight, cost, and power consumption. Mechanical multiplexing offers a solution by enabling a single actuator to control multiple DoF. However, existing multiplexers have either been limited to electrically controlled time-based multiplexing that control one DoF at a time or have relied on mechanical switching to control multiple DoF simultaneously. There is a strong need for a system that can perform electrically controlled multiplexing for both time-based and simultaneous control of multiple DoF. This study introduces a novel electrostatic capstan clutch-based mechanical multiplexer that enables high-force, single-motor control of multiple DoF. Here, we show that our system achieves both single-input-single-output (SISO) and single-input-multipleoutput (SIMO) actuation, allowing bidirectional control and position holding with minimal power consumption. Each output can actuate a 22.24 N load, limited by clutch performance, up to 5 cm. The number of outputs and actuation length is currently limited by the length of the drive shaft. We demonstrate the integration of our system into a 4-DoF commercial robotic hand using a single motor. These findings show that electrostatic clutchbased multiplexing provides a scalable and energy-efficient design solution for high-DoF robotic platforms, opening new possibilities for lightweight and power-efficient actuation in robotics.</description>

      <title>Safe Gradient Flow for Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization is a key framework in hierarchical decision-making, where one problem is embedded within the constraints of another. In this work, we propose a control-theoretic approach to solving bilevel optimization problems. Our method consists of two components: a gradient flow mechanism to minimize the upper-level objective and a safety filter to enforce the constraints imposed by the lower-level problem. Together, these components form a safe gradient flow that solves the bilevel problem in a single loop. To improve scalability with respect to the lower-level problem's dimensions, we introduce a relaxed formulation and design a compact variant of the safe gradient flow. This variant minimizes the upper-level objective while ensuring the lower-level decision variable remains within a user-defined suboptimality. Using Lyapunov analysis, we establish convergence guarantees for the dynamics, proving that they converge to a neighborhood of the optimal solution. Numerical experiments further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Our contributions provide both theoretical insights and practical tools for efficiently solving bilevel optimization problems.</description>
