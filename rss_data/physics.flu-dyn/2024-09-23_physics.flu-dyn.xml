      <title>Metamorphosis of transition to periodic oscillations in a turbulent reactive flow system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of periodic oscillations is observed in various complex systems in nature and engineering. Thermoacoustic oscillations in systems comprising turbulent reactive flow exemplify such complexity in the engineering context, where the emergence of oscillatory dynamics is often undesirable. In this work, we experimentally study the transition to periodic oscillations within a turbulent flow reactive system, with varying fuel-to-air ratio, represented by equivalence ratio as a bifurcation parameter. Further, we explore the change in the nature of the transition by varying a secondary parameter. In our system, we vary the thermal power input and the location of the flame stabilizer position individually as a secondary parameter. Our findings reveal five qualitatively distinct types of transitions to periodic oscillations. Two types of these transitions exhibit a continuous nature. Another two types of transitions involve multiple shifts in the dynamical states consisting of both continuous and discontinuous bifurcations. The last type of transition is characterized by an abrupt bifurcation to high-amplitude periodic oscillations. Understanding this metamorphosis of the transition - from continuous to discontinuous nature - is critical for advancing our comprehension of the dynamic behavior in turbulent reactive flow systems. The insights gained from this study have the potential to inform the design and control of similar engineering systems where managing oscillatory behavior is crucial.</description>

      <title>Twisting vortex lines regularize Navier-Stokes turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid flows are intrinsically characterized via the topology and dynamics of underlying vortex lines. Turbulence in common fluids like water and air, mathematically described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (INSE), engenders spontaneous self-stretching and twisting of vortex lines, generating a complex hierarchy of structures. While the INSE are routinely used to describe turbulence, their regularity remains unproven; the implicit assumption being that the self-stretching is ultimately regularized by viscosity, preventing any singularities. Here, we uncover an inviscid regularizing mechanism stemming from self-stretching itself, by analyzing the flow topology as perceived by an observer aligned with the vorticity vector undergoing amplification. While, initially, vorticity amplification occurs via increasing twisting of vortex lines, a regularizing anti-twist spontaneously emerges to prevent unbounded growth. By isolating a vortex, we additionally demonstrate the genericity of this self-regularizing anti-twist. Our work, directly linking dynamics of vortices to turbulence statistics, reveals how the Navier-Stokes dynamics avoids the development of singularities even without the aid of viscosity.</description>

      <title>Physical model of serum supplemented medium flow in organ-on-a-chip systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating a physiologically relevant shear stress in organ-on-a-chip (OOC) devices requires careful tailoring of microfluidic flow parameters. It is currently fairly common to use a simple approximation assuming a constant viscosity, even for serum-based media. Here, we show that a popular nutrient solution (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with Fetal Bovine Serum) requires a more complex treatment (i.e., is a non-Newtonian fluid), with observed shear stress values significantly greater than reported in literature. We measure the rheology of the solutions and combine it with a 3-dimensional flow field measurement to derive shear stress at the channel surface. We verify the experiments with numerical simulations, finding good agreement and deriving flow properties. Finally, we provide relevant expressions for shear stress approximation, suitable for development of OOC devices with various geometries.</description>

      <title>Universal cascade and relaxation of strong anisotropic turbulence in fusion plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the governing equations, exact relations have been derived for three-dimensional reduced magnetohydrodynamic turbulence corresponding to the inertial range cascade of energy and cross-helicity. Justifications are provided for not attempting to recover the said exact relations as a limit of the exact relations previously derived for incompressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. Assuming axial symmetry, anisotropic energy spectrum has been predicted from the exact relation and is found to be consistent with the critical balance thus leading to a -5/3 perpendicular energy spectrum. In the case of a strong alignment between the velocity and the magnetic field fluctuations, the derived exact relation implies a generalized anisotropic spectrum with a -3/2 power-law dependence in the direction of alignment. Using the alternative form of the exact relations, it is shown that the flow naturally relaxes towards a state of dynamic alignment in the limit of negligible kinetic and magnetic pressure. Finally, despite having different equations of dynamics, the exact relations for energy and cross-helicity and the relaxed states of a two-dimensional MHD are found to be identical to those in reduced magnetohydrodynamic flow.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Statistical Solutions of the Incompressible Euler Equations and Landau-Lifshitz Fluctuating Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study rigorously the infinite Reynolds limit of the solutions of the Landau-Lifschitz equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics for an incompressible fluid on a $d$-dimensional torus for $d\geq 2.$ These equations, which model the effects of thermal fluctuations in fluids, are given a standard physical interpretation as a low-wavenumber ``effective field theory'', rather than as stochastic partial differential equations. We study in particular solutions which enjoy some a priori Besov regularity in space, as expected for initial data chosen from a driven, turbulent steady-state ensemble. The empirical basis for this regularity hypothesis, uniform in Reynolds number, is carefully discussed, including evidence from numerical simulations of turbulent flows that incorporate thermal fluctuations. Considering the initial-value problem for the Landau-Lifschitz equations, our main result is that the infinite Reynolds number limit is a space-time statistical solution of the incompressible Euler equations in the sense of Vishik \&amp; Fursikov. Such solutions are described by a probability measure on space-time velocity fields whose realizations are weak or distributional solutions of the incompressible Euler equations, each with the same prescribed initial data. In conjunction with recent numerical evidence that these probability measures are non-trivial, our theorem shows that the mathematical non-uniqueness of the solutions of the Cauchy problem for Euler, as revealed by convex integration studies, may be physically realized. In support of the theory of spontaneous stochasticity, any persistent randomness in the infinite-Reynolds limit is associated to a nontrivial probability distribution over non-unique solutions of the ideal Euler equations.</description>

      <title>DiffFluid: Plain Diffusion Models are Effective Predictors of Flow Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We showcase the plain diffusion models with Transformers are effective predictors of fluid dynamics under various working conditions, e.g., Darcy flow and high Reynolds number. Unlike traditional fluid dynamical solvers that depend on complex architectures to extract intricate correlations and learn underlying physical states, our approach formulates the prediction of flow dynamics as the image translation problem and accordingly leverage the plain diffusion model to tackle the problem. This reduction in model design complexity does not compromise its ability to capture complex physical states and geometric features of fluid dynamical equations, leading to high-precision solutions. In preliminary tests on various fluid-related benchmarks, our DiffFluid achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance, particularly in solving the Navier-Stokes equations in fluid dynamics, with a relative precision improvement of +44.8%. In addition, we achieved relative improvements of +14.0% and +11.3% in the Darcy flow equation and the airfoil problem with Euler's equation, respectively. Code will be released at https://github.com/DongyuLUO/DiffFluid upon acceptance.</description>

Abstract: Ocean dynamics play a crucial role in global climate, ecosystems, and human activities, necessitating accurate and efficient methods to characterize ocean currents and waves. This paper presents the development of a novel bio-inspired hydrofoil system for detecting and characterizing ocean currents and waves based on a dolphin's flipper foil design. The prototype's performance was assessed through controlled experiments, demonstrating the system's ability to quickly and accurately orientate itself in the direction of flow. Wave mechanics and a geometric proof were applied to estimate wave parameters such as wave height and current from the hydrofoil's positioning. The proposed hydrofoil system shows potential for use in various marine applications, including oceanographic research, environmental monitoring, and navigation. The bio-inspired hydrofoil system offers a promising approach to ocean current and wave characterization, with the potential to significantly impact our understanding and monitoring of ocean dynamics without greatly impacting vehicle performance or increasing power utilization in operation.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-driven flows in a non-linear stratified fluid layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion-driven flow is a boundary layer flow arising from the interplay of gravity and diffusion in density-stratified fluids when a gravitational field is non-parallel to an impermeable solid boundary. This study investigates diffusion-driven flow within a nonlinearly density-stratified fluid confined between two tilted parallel walls. We introduce an asymptotic expansion inspired by the center manifold theory, where quantities are expanded in terms of derivatives of the cross-sectional averaged stratified scalar (such as salinity or temperature). This technique provides accurate approximations for velocity, density, and pressure fields. Furthermore, we derive an evolution equation describing the cross-sectional averaged stratified scalar. This equation takes the form of the traditional diffusion equation but replaces the constant diffusion coefficient with a positive-definite function dependent on the solution's derivative. Numerical simulations validate the accuracy of our approximations. Our investigation of the effective equation reveals that the density profile depends on a non-dimensional parameter denoted as $\gamma$ representing the flow strength. In the large $\gamma$ limit, the system is approximated by a diffusion process with an augmented diffusion coefficient of $1+\cot^{2}\theta$, where $\theta$ signifies the inclination angle of the channel domain. This parameter regime is where diffusion-driven flow exhibits its strongest mixing ability. Conversely, in the small $\gamma$ regime, the density field behaves like pure diffusion with distorted isopycnals. Lastly, we show that the classical thin film equation aligns with the results obtained using the proposed expansion in the small $\gamma$ regime but fails to accurately describe the dynamics of the density field for large $\gamma$.</description>

      <title>The interplay of shape and catalyst distribution in the yield of compressible flow microreactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03944v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a semi-analytical model for transport in structured catalytic microreactors, where both reactant and product are compressible fluids. Making use of the lubrication and Fick-Jacobs approximations, we reduce the three-dimensional governing equations to an effective one-dimensional set of equations. Our model captures the effect of compressibility, of corrugations in the shape of the reactor, as well as of an inhomogeneous catalytic coating of the reactor walls. We show that in the weakly compressible limit (e.g., liquid-phase reactors), the distribution of catalyst does not influence the reactor yield, which we verify experimentally. Beyond this limit, we show that introducing inhomogeneities in the catalytic coating and corrugations to the reactor walls can improve the yield.</description>

      <title>Exact and approximate solutions for elastic interactions in a nematic liquid crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic fluids appear in a diverse array of systems, from liquid-crystal displays to bacterial swarms, and are characterized by orientational order. Large colloidal particles immersed in such environments disturb the medium's orientational order, however, resulting in a stored elastic energy within the bulk. As a consequence, multiple immersed bodies interact at equilibrium through fluid-mediated forces and torques, which depend on the bodies' positions, orientations, and shapes. We provide the equilibrium configuration of a model nematic liquid crystal with multiple immersed bodies or inclusions in two-dimensions, as well as the associated body forces, torques, and surface tractions. A complex variables approach is taken which leans on previous work by Crowdy (2020) for describing solutions with multiply-connected domains. Free periods of a complex director field, which correspond to topological defect positioning and net topological charge, are determined numerically to minimize a global stored elastic energy, including a contribution of a weak (finite) anchoring strength on the body surfaces. Finally, a general, analytical description of two-body far-field interactions is provided, along with examples using two cylindrical inclusions of arbitrary position and size, and two triangles of arbitrary position and orientation.</description>

      <title>Fluid Implicit Particles on Coadjoint Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Coadjoint Orbit FLIP (CO-FLIP), a high order accurate, structure preserving fluid simulation method in the hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian framework. We start with a Hamiltonian formulation of the incompressible Euler Equations, and then, using a local, explicit, and high order divergence free interpolation, construct a modified Hamiltonian system that governs our discrete Euler flow. The resulting discretization, when paired with a geometric time integration scheme, is energy and circulation preserving (formally the flow evolves on a coadjoint orbit) and is similar to the Fluid Implicit Particle (FLIP) method. CO-FLIP enjoys multiple additional properties including that the pressure projection is exact in the weak sense, and the particle-to-grid transfer is an exact inverse of the grid-to-particle interpolation. The method is demonstrated numerically with outstanding stability, energy, and Casimir preservation. We show that the method produces benchmarks and turbulent visual effects even at low grid resolutions.</description>
