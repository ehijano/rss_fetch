      <title>Theoretical Analysis of Doping Concentration Gradients on Solar Cell Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar cells are crucial for addressing global energy issues, with research focused on improving their efficiency. This study examines the impact of doping concentration gradients on solar cell performance. Doping involves adding impurities to a semiconductor, affecting charge carrier mobility and recombination rates. The spatial distribution of these dopants, known as the doping concentration gradient, is essential for optimizing solar cell characteristics. This research theoretically analyzes the effects of doping gradients on potential differences, electric fields, and recombination rates in semiconductors. We explore how doping creates potential differences and electric fields that guide charge carriers and enhance mobility. Additionally, we study how doping gradients can control recombination mechanisms, thereby improving the electrical performance of solar cells. Using modeling and simulation techniques, we derive the optimal doping gradient to maximize efficiency. Our findings suggest that an optimal doping gradient minimizes recombination rates and enhances charge carrier mobility, significantly improving solar cell performance. The study proposes that graded doping concentrations could particularly benefit multi-junction solar cells by allowing better absorption and conversion of various light spectra. However, precise fabrication control and long-term stability assessments are needed. This study highlights the potential of doping concentration gradients to advance solar cell technology, paving the way for more sustainable and cost-effective solar energy solutions.</description>

      <title>Elastic Lattices Inspired by Ulam-Warburton Cellular Automaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic lattices have been predominantly explored for decades, owing to their peculiar vibrational behavior. On the other hand, certain types of aperiodic lattices have enabled new phenomena that may not be otherwise attainable in periodic ones. In this paper, a new class of aperiodic lattices inspired by cellular automaton is introduced. Cellular automaton was originally developed as a machine replication algorithm and it has been intensively explored in computer science. These algorithms yield structures that are not necessarily periodic, yet follow well-defined rules that lead to interesting aperiodic patterns. The concept is utilized here to build elastic lattices following such rules, and Ulam-Warburton Cellular Automaton (UWCA) is demonstrated as an example. Resulted UWCA lattices are shown to exhibit unique dynamical properties, including symmetric eigenfrequency spectra, repeated natural frequencies of large multiplicity, and the emergence of strongly localized corner modes. It is envisioned that computer-algorithm-inspired lattices may unlock new wave phenomena that could outperform existing lattice designs.</description>

      <title>Finite Element-based Nonlinear Dynamic Optimization of Nanomechanical Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamic simulations of mechanical resonators have been facilitated by the advent of computational techniques that generate nonlinear reduced order models (ROMs) using the finite element (FE) method. However, designing devices with specific nonlinear characteristics remains inefficient since it requires manual adjustment of the design parameters and can result in suboptimal designs. Here, we integrate an FE-based nonlinear ROM technique with a derivative-free optimization algorithm to enable the design of nonlinear mechanical resonators. The resulting methodology is used to optimize the support design of high-stress nanomechanical Si3N4 string resonators, in the presence of conflicting objectives such as simultaneous enhancement of Q-factor and nonlinear Duffing constant. To that end, we generate Pareto frontiers that highlight the trade-offs between optimization objectives and validate the results both numerically and experimentally. To further demonstrate the capability of multi-objective optimization for practical design challenges, we simultaneously optimize the design of nanoresonators for three key figure-of-merits in resonant sensing: power consumption, sensitivity and response time. The presented methodology can facilitate and accelerate designing (nano)mechanical resonators with optimized performance for a wide variety of applications.</description>

      <title>Platonic quasi-normal modes expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elastic wave manipulation using large arrays of resonators is driving the need for advanced simulation and optimization methods. To address this we introduce and explore a robust framework for wave control: Quasi-normal modes (QNMs). Specifically we consider the problem for thin elastic plates, where the Green's function formalism is well known and readily exploited to solve multiple scattering problems. By studying the associated nonlinear eigenvalue problem we derive a dispersive QNM expansion, providing a reduced-order model for efficient forced response computations which reveals physical insight into the resonant mode excitation. Furthermore, we derive eigenvalue sensitivities with respect to resonator parameters and apply a gradient-based optimization to design quasi-bound states in the continuum and position eigenfrequencies precisely in the complex plane. Scattering simulations validate our approach in structures such as graded line arrays and quasi-crystals. Drawing on QNM concepts from electromagnetism we demonstrate significant advances in elastic metamaterials, highlighting their potential for tailored wave manipulation.</description>

      <title>Acoustic modulation of individual nanowire quantum dots integrated into a hybrid thin-film lithium niobate photonic platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) are a powerful tool for controlling a wide range of quantum systems, particularly quantum dots (QDs) via their oscillating strain fields. The resulting energy modulation of these single photon sources can be harnessed to achieve spectral overlap between two QDs otherwise emitting at different wavelengths. In this study, we integrate InAsP/InP nanowire quantum dots onto a thin-film lithium niobate platform, a strong piezoelectric material, and embed them within Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$-loaded waveguides. We demonstrate emission wavelength modulation of 0.70 nm at 13 dBm with a single focused interdigital transducer (FIDT) operating at 400 MHz, and achieve twice this modulation by using two FIDTs as an acoustic cavity. Additionally, we bring two QDs with an initial wavelength difference of 0.5 nm into resonance using SAWs. This scalable strain-tuning approach represents a significant step towards producing indistinguishable single photons from remote emitters heterogeneously integrated on a single photonic chip, and paves the way for large scale on-chip quantum information processing using photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Efficient condensation on spiked surfaces with superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Steam condensation on the surface of a solid is a widely observed mode of energy transfer in nature and various industrial applications. The condensation efficiency is closely related to the material properties and geometric morphology of the solid surface, as well as the method of liquid removal. Despite many surface modification strategies at the micro and nano levels having been employed to enhance steam condensation, understanding how to regulate steam condensation and liquid removal on complex surface morphologies remains incomplete. Here, we report a method that uses superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic coatings as well as spiked surfaces to achieve efficient steam condensation and rapid removal of the liquid. We reveal that on a copper plate with millimeter-scale spikes, hydrophobic spiked surfaces facilitate the dropwise condensation, while hydrophilic bottom grooves promote liquid spreading, and the suction in capillary gaps can promptly remove the condensate liquid. This method achieves a high condensation efficiency without relying on gravity. Additionally, we demonstrate that the condensation on spiked surfaces has a significant suction effect, as it continuously attracts the steam flow, thereby altering the flow direction. This finding provides a new approach for efficient steam condensation technology and opens up a promising pathway for providing circulation power and improving condensation efficiency in phase-change heat transfer devices such as heat pipes.</description>

      <title>Voltage-Controlled Magnetoelectric Devices for Neuromorphic Diffusion Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic diffusion processes are pervasive in nature, from the seemingly erratic Brownian motion to the complex interactions of synaptically-coupled spiking neurons. Recently, drawing inspiration from Langevin dynamics, neuromorphic diffusion models were proposed and have become one of the major breakthroughs in the field of generative artificial intelligence. Unlike discriminative models that have been well developed to tackle classification or regression tasks, diffusion models as well as other generative models such as ChatGPT aim at creating content based upon contexts learned. However, the more complex algorithms of these models result in high computational costs using today's technologies, creating a bottleneck in their efficiency, and impeding further development. Here, we develop a spintronic voltage-controlled magnetoelectric memory hardware for the neuromorphic diffusion process. The in-memory computing capability of our spintronic devices goes beyond current Von Neumann architecture, where memory and computing units are separated. Together with the non-volatility of magnetic memory, we can achieve high-speed and low-cost computing, which is desirable for the increasing scale of generative models in the current era. We experimentally demonstrate that the hardware-based true random diffusion process can be implemented for image generation and achieve comparable image quality to software-based training as measured by the Frechet inception distance (FID) score, achieving ~10^3 better energy-per-bit-per-area over traditional hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Levitated optomechanics, a rapidly expanding field that employs light to monitor and manipulate the mechanical motion of levitated objects, is increasingly relevant across physics, engineering, and other fields. This technique, which involves levitating micro- and nano-scale objects in a vacuum where they exhibit high-quality motion, provides an essential platform for precision measurements. Noted for their ultra-high sensitivity, levitated particles hold potential for a wide range of real-world applications. This perspective article briefly introduces the principle of optical levitation and the dynamics of levitated particles. It then reviews the emerging applications of levitated particles in ultrasensitive force and torque measurements, acceleration and rotation sensing, electric and magnetic field detection, scanning probe microscopy, localized vacuum pressure gauging, acoustic transduction, and chemical and biological sensing. Moreover, we discuss the present challenges and explore opportunities to minimize and integrate levitation systems for broader applications. We also briefly review optomechanics with ion traps and magnetic traps which can levitate particles in high vacuum without laser heating.</description>

      <title>Energy Filtering in Doping Modulated Nanoengineered Thermoelectric Materials: A Monte Carlo Simulation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Monte Carlo electronic transport simulations, coupled self-consistently with the Poisson equation for electrostatics, we explore the thermoelectric power factor of nanoengineered materials. These materials consist of alternating highly doped and intrinsic regions on the scale of several nanometers. This structure enables the creation of potential wells and barriers, implementing a mechanism for filtering carrier energy. Our study demonstrates that by carefully designing the nanostructure, we can significantly enhance its thermoelectric power factor compared to the original pristine material. Importantly, these enhancements stem not only from the energy filtering effect that boosts the Seebeck coefficient but also from the utilization of high-energy carriers within the wells and intrinsic barrier regions to maintain relatively high electronic conductivity. These findings can offer guidance for the design and optimization of new-generation thermoelectric materials through improvements in the power factor.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale ferroelectric programming of van der Waals heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to create superlattices in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures via moir\'e interference heralded a new era in the science and technology of two-dimensional materials. Through precise control of the twist angle, flat bands and strongly correlated phases have been engineered. The precise twisting of vdW layers is in some sense a bottom-up approach--a single parameter can dial in a wide range of periodic structures. Here, we describe a top-down approach to engineering nanoscale potentials in vdW layers using a buried programmable ferroelectric layer. Ultra-low-voltage electron beam lithography (ULV-EBL) is used to program ferroelectric domains in a ferroelectric Al_{1-x}B_{x}N thin film through a graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) heterostructure that is transferred on top. We demonstrate ferroelectric field effects by creating a lateral p-n junction, and demonstrate spatial resolution down to 35 nm, limited by the resolution of our scanned probe characterization methods. This innovative, resist-free patterning method is predicted to achieve 10 nm resolution and enable arbitrary programming of vdW layers, opening a pathway to create new phases that are inaccessible by moir\'e techniques. The ability to "paint" different phases of matter on a single vdW "canvas" provides a wealth of new electronic and photonic functionalities.</description>

      <title>A Computational Framework Integrating Physics-based Model and Equivalent Circuit Network Model to Simulate Li-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09838v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Battery models generally fall into two categories: physics-based models and ECM models. Physics-based Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) models can accurately simulate the battery internal electrochemical processes, but to properly account for thermal effects requires a strong coupling between a DFN model and a 3D thermal model, which is computationally unaffordable. Distributed Equivalent Circuit Network (ECN) models can perform simulations with high speed and reasonable accuracy. However, these models rely heavily on the characterisation experiments for ECN parameter identification, which is resource-intensive and can lead to inaccurate parametrisation outcomes due to internal thermal inhomogeneity. To harness the strengths of both models, we propose a computational framework to integrate electrochemical DFN model and 3D distributed ECN model together. Using this framework, we simulate constant current discharge experiments of Kokam 7.5 Ah pouch cell (Model SLPB75106100) and compare the simulations with the commonly-used lumped DFN-thermal model. The computational model outperforms the lumped DFN model at low-temperature and/or high C-rate scenarios significantly. The largest predicting error of the framework at 3 C-rate &amp;Tam = 25oC and at 1 C-rate &amp;Tam = 0 oC is approximately 1/3 of that for DFN model. At 3 C-rate &amp;Tam = 5oC, the difference between these two can rise to 377 mV. By integrating DFN and 3D-distributed ECN together, the computational framework can simulate the complicated interplay between electrochemistry, thermal process, and electricity within a cell fast and accurately. We anticipate this computational framework to be a valuable toolset to assist researchers and engineers in the design and control of Li-ion batteries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Besides major advantages for telecommunication applications, VCSELs have attracted interest for their potential for neuro-inspired computing, frequency comb generation or high-frequency spin oscillations. In the meantime, strain applied to the laser structure has been shown to have a significant impact on the laser emission properties such as the polarization dynamics or birefringence. In this work, we further explore the influence of strain on VCSELs and how this effect could be used to fine tune the laser wavelength. Through a comprehensive investigation, we demonstrate consistent wavelength shift up to 1 nm and report a sensitivity between 0.12 to 0.18 nm / millistrain. We also record birefringence values up to 292 GHz. Our results show that controlled strain level could be considered for fine wavelength tuning and possibly alleviate the selection of VCSEL for precise wavelength requirements.</description>

      <title>Engineering Nonreciprocal Responses in Travelling-Wave Spacetime Crystals via Clausius-Mossotti Homogenization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, we investigate the effective response of three-dimensional spacetime crystals formed by spherical scatterers under a travelling-wave modulation. We develop an analytical formalism to homogenize the spacetime crystals that extends the renowned Clausius-Mossotti formula to time-varying platforms. Our formalism shows that travelling-wave spacetime crystals can be used to engineer a wide range of classes of nonreciprocal bianisotropic couplings in the long wavelength limit. In particular, our theory reveals the possibility of realizing a purely isotropic Tellegen response in crystals formed by interlaced sub-lattices of scatterers subjected to different modulation velocities. Furthermore, we introduce a class of generalized Minkowskian crystals that displays invariance under arbitrary Lorentz boosts aligned with a fixed spatial direction. We prove that such systems are formed by pseudo-uniaxial materials with the principal axis aligned parallel to the modulation velocity. The electromagnetic response of such generalized Minkowskian crystals is indistinguishable from that of moving photonic crystals.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Based Prediction of Proton Conductivity in Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have demonstrated their potential as solid-state electrolytes in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. However, the number of MOFs reported to exhibit proton conductivity remains limited, and the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not fully elucidated, complicating the design of proton-conductive MOFs. In response, we developed a comprehensive database of proton-conductive MOFs and applied machine learning techniques to predict their proton conductivity. Our approach included the construction of both descriptor-based and transformer-based models. Notably, the transformer-based transfer learning (Freeze) model performed the best with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.91, suggesting that the proton conductivity of MOFs can be estimated within one order of magnitude using this model. Additionally, we employed feature importance and principal component analysis to explore the factors influencing proton conductivity. The insights gained from our database and machine learning model are expected to facilitate the targeted design of proton-conductive MOFs.</description>
