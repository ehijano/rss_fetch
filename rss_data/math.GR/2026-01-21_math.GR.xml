      <title>Classification of connected proper pairs in the affine transformation group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(L, H)$ be closed subgroups of a locally compact group $G$. The pair $(L, H)$ is said to be proper if the action of $L$ on the homogeneous space $G/H$ is proper.
  We give a complete list of connected closed proper pairs in the affine transformation group of $\mathbb{R}^2$. This result extends Kobayashi's classification (1992) of connected closed subgroups of the affine transformation group of $\mathbb{R}^2$acting properly on $\mathbb{R}^2$.</description>

      <title>The small cancellation flat torus theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish Flat Torus Theorem type results for groups acting on small cancellation complexes satisfying C(6), C(4)-T(4) and C(3)-T(6) conditions. For C(3)-T(6) complexes the result closely parallels the CAT(0) setting. For C(6) complexes we prove an analogous theorem using a refined notion of flat, exploiting the relationship between C(6) complexes and their duals. In the C(4)-T(4) case we demonstrate that genuine flats do not necessarily exist, providing an explicit example of a C(4)-T(4) complex with an action of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ without invariant flat, and hence not admitting any CAT(0) metric. We introduce the notion of quasi-flats and prove a Flat Torus Theorem for quasi-flats by passing to quadric complexes via quadrization and invoking the Quadric Flat Torus Theorem of Hoda-Munro.</description>

      <title>One-variable equations over the lamplighter group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study one-variable equations over the lamplighter group $\MZ_2 \wr \MZ$. While the decidability of arbitrary equations over $L_2$ remains open, we prove that the Diophantine problem for single equations in one variable is decidable. Our approach reduces the problem to a divisibility question for families of parametric Laurent polynomials over $\MZ_2$, whose coefficients depend linearly on an integer parameter. We develop an automaton-theoretic framework to analyze divisibility of such polynomials, exploiting eventual periodicity phenomena arising from polynomial division over finite fields. This yields an explicit decision procedure, which is super-exponential in the worst case. On the other hand, we show that for a generic class of equations, solvability can be decided in nearly quadratic time. These results establish a sharp contrast between worst-case and typical computational behavior and provide new tools for the study of equations over wreath products.</description>

      <title>Skew brace extensions, second cohomology and complements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study extensions and second cohomology of skew left braces via the natural semi-direct products associated with the skew left braces. Let $0 \to I \to E \to H \to 0$ be a skew brace extension and $\Lambda_H$ denote the natural semi-direct products associated with the skew left brace $H$. We establish a group homomorphism from ${\rm H}_{Sb}^2(H, I)$ into ${\rm H}_{Gp}^2(\Lambda_H, I \times I)$, which turns out to be an embedding when $I \le {\rm Soc}(E)$. In particular the Schur multiplier of a skew left braces $H$ embeds into the Schur multiplier of the group $\Lambda_H$. Analog of the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem is established for skew left braces in several specific cases. We introduce a concept called minimal extensions (which stay at the extreme end of split extensions) of skew left braces and derive many fundamental results. Several reduction results for split extensions of finite skew left braces by abelian groups (viewed as trivial left braces) are obtained.</description>

      <title>Quasigeodesic languages are not context-free in some non-hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the full language of quasigeodesics in Cayley graphs, with fixed error constants. We show that, given a non-virtually-cyclic nilpotent group or Baumslag--Solitar group, and any finite generating set, such languages fail to be context-free for sufficiently large error constants. In fact, this conclusion holds for any finitely generated group which contains one of these groups as an undistorted subgroup. This strengthens a recent theorem of Hughes, Nairne, and Spriano, who showed that such languages fail to be regular in any non-hyperbolic group, for sufficiently large error constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Mackey functors for a t.d.l.c. group and define the cohomological dimension of this group over the Mackey category. We then compare this dimension to the rational discrete cohomological dimension defined by Castellano and Weigel, as well as to the Bredon cohomological dimension of that t.d.l.c. group with respect to the family of compact open subgroups. We also extend results about the geometric dimension of a t.d.l.c. group.</description>

Abstract: We study period growth in co-context-free groups, giving general results and looking at specific examples such as Thompson groups $T$ and $V$ and the Houghton groups $H_m$. Along the way, we give a refined upper bound on the word metric in Thompson $V$, as well as efficient algorithms to determine if elements of $V$ are torsion, and compute their order. We also adapt our algorithm to compute the rotation number of elements of $T$ and answer a question of D. Calegari.</description>

      <title>Dynamical boundaries of affine buildings: C*-simplicity and Poisson boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a class of groups acting on possibly exotic affine buildings $X$ and possessing good proximal properties. Such groups are termed of general type, and their dynamics is analyzed through their flag limit sets in the space of chambers at infinity of $X$. For a group $G$ of general type, we prove C*-simplicity by showing that its flag limit set $\Lambda_{\mathcal F}(G)$ is topologically free, minimal, and strongly proximal. When $\Lambda_{\mathcal F}(G)$ intersects all Schubert cells relative to a limit chamber, then it is a mean proximal space, in the sense that it carries a unique proximal stationary measure for any admissible probability measure on the acting group. Lattices are established as examples of groups of general type, and their Poisson boundaries are identified. The arguments rely on constructing an equivariant barycenter map from triples of chambers in generic position to the affine building.</description>

      <title>On constructing topology from algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis we explore natural procedures through which topological structure can be constructed from specific semigroups. We will do this in two ways: 1) we equip the semigroup object itself with a topological structure, and 2) we find a topological space for the semigroup to act on continuously.
  We discuss various minimum/maximum topologies which one can define on an arbitrary semigroup (given some topological restrictions). We give explicit descriptions of each these topologies for the monoids of binary relations, partial transformations, transformations, and partial bijections on a countable set. Using similar methods we determine whether or not each of these semigroups admits a unique Polish semigroup topology. We also do this for the various other semigroups, provide a proof of Rubin's theorem, and give a description of the automorphism groups of the Brin-Thompson groups.
  The thesis also contains many background results.</description>

      <title>Locally involutive semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce locally involutive semigroups and embed them into the category of ordered groupoids. This embedding restricts to a correspondence between quasi-involutive semigroups and ordered groupoids with mediator, extending the classical ESN-correspondence between inverse semigroups and inductive groupoids. An important subcategory of locally involutive semigroups is formed by left involutive semigroups because the classifying topos of an inverse semigroup S is equivalent to the category of left involutive semigroups \'etale over S [4]. We recover this equivalence from a general adjointness and use the latter to determine when a left involutive semigroup \'etale over S is actually an involutive semigroup. Any left involutive semigroup \'etale over S embeds into an involutive S-algebra as we call it. The underlying semigroup of this algebra is involutive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the space of embeddings of finitely many circles that bound disks in non-positively curved surfaces. We index the connected components of this space with finite rooted trees and show that the connected components are classifying spaces of the ``braided" automorphism groups of the associated trees. An intermediate step to proving these results is to construct a strong deformation retract onto the subspace of geometric circles; moreover, this strong deformation retraction is equivariant with respect to transformations of the surface.</description>

      <title>On the second homology of the genus 3 hyperelliptic Torelli group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $s$ be a fixed hyperelliptic involution of the closed, oriented genus $g$ surface $\Sigma_g$. The hyperelliptic Torelli group $\mathcal{SI}_g$ is the subgroup of the mapping class group $\mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma_g)$ consisting of elements that act trivially on $\mathrm{H}_1(\Sigma_g;\mathbb{Z})$ and commute with $s$. It is generated by Dehn twists about $s$-invariant separating curves, and its cohomological dimension is $g-1$. In this paper we study the top homology group $\mathrm{H}_2(\mathcal{SI}_3;\mathbb{Z})$. For each pair of disjoint $s$-invariant separating curves there is a naturally associated abelian cycle in $\mathrm{H}_2(\mathcal{SI}_3;\mathbb{Z})$; we call such cycles \emph{simple}. We show that simple abelian cycles are in bijection with orthogonal (with respect to the intersection form) splittings of $\mathrm{H}_1(\Sigma_3;\mathbb{Z})$ satisfying a simple algebraic condition, and prove that these abelian cycles are linearly independent in $\mathrm{H}_2(\mathcal{SI}_3;\mathbb{Z})$.</description>

      <title>An Eventown Result for Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A family of permutations $\mathcal{F} \subseteq S_n$ is even-cycle-intersecting if $\sigma \pi^{-1}$ has an even cycle for all $\sigma,\pi \in \mathcal{F}$. We show that if $\mathcal{F} \subseteq S_n$ is an even-cycle-intersecting family of permutations, then $|\mathcal{F}| \leq 2^{n-1}$, and that equality holds when $n$ is a power of 2 and $\mathcal{F}$ is a double-translate of a Sylow 2-subgroup of $S_n$. This result can be seen as an analogue of the classical eventown problem for subsets and it confirms a conjecture of J\'anos K\"orner on maximum reversing families of the symmetric group. Along the way, we show that the canonically intersecting families of $S_n$ are also the extremal odd-cycle-intersecting families of $S_n$ for all even $n$. While the latter result has less combinatorial significance, its proof uses an interesting new character-theoretic identity that might be of independent interest in algebraic combinatorics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop some tools, of an algebraic and combinatorial nature, which enable us to obtain a detailed description of certain quadratic subgroups of the (outer) reduced Weyl group of the Cuntz algebra ${\mathcal O}_n$. In particular, for $n=4$ our findings give a self-contained theoretical interpretation of the groups tabulated in [AJS18], which were obtained with the help of a computer. For each of these groups we provide a set of generators. A prominent role in our analysis is played by a certain family of subgroups of the symmetric group of a discrete square which we call bicompatible.</description>

Abstract: We find anti-isomorphic submonoids $\mathscr{C}_{+}(a,b)$ and $\mathscr{C}_{-}(a,b)$ of the bicyclic monoid $\mathscr{C}(a,b)$ with the following properties: every Hausdorff left-continuous (right-continuous) topology on $\mathscr{C}_{+}(a,b)$ ($\mathscr{C}_{-}(a,b)$) is discrete and there exists a compact Hausdorff topological monoid $S$ which contains $\mathscr{C}_{+}(a,b)$ ($\mathscr{C}_{-}(a,b)$) as a submonoid. Also, we construct a non-discrete right-continuous (left-continuous) topology $\tau_p^+$ ($\tau_p^-$) on the semigroup $\mathscr{C}_{+}(a,b)$ ($\mathscr{C}_{-}(a,b)$) which is not left-continuous (right-continuous).</description>

      <title>Homogeneity in Coxeter groups and split crystallographic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that affine Coxeter groups, even hyperbolic Coxeter groups and one-ended hyperbolic Coxeter groups are homogeneous in the sense of model theory. More generally, we prove that many (Gromov) hyperbolic groups generated by torsion elements are homogeneous. In contrast, we construct split crystallographic groups that are not homogeneous, and hyperbolic (in fact, virtually free) Coxeter groups that are not homogeneous (or, to be more precise, not $\mathrm{EAE}$-homogeneous). We also prove that, on the other hand, irreducible split crystallographic groups and torsion-generated hyperbolic groups are almost homogeneous. We also prove that finitely generated abelian-by-finite groups are homogeneous if and only if they are profinitely homogeneous, i.e., any tuple of words from the group is profinitely rigid. We use this to deduce that affine Coxeter groups are profinitely homogeneous, a result of independent interest in the profinite context.</description>

      <title>On groups with EDT0L word problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the word problem for the infinite cyclic group is not EDT0L, and obtain as a corollary that a finitely generated group with EDT0L word problem must be torsion. In addition, we show that the property of having an EDT0L word problem is invariant under change of generating set and passing to finitely generated subgroups. This represents significant progress towards the conjecture that all groups with EDT0L word problem are finite (i.e. precisely the groups with regular word problem).</description>

      <title>Elementary equivalence and diffeomorphism groups of smooth manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07427v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ and $N$ be smooth manifolds, with $M$ closed and connected. If the $C^r$--diffeomorphism group of $M$ is elementarily equivalent to the $C^s$--diffeomorphism group of $N$ for some $r,s\in[1,\infty)\cup\{0,\infty\}$, then $r=s$ and $M$ and $N$ are $C^r$--diffeomorphic. This strengthens a previously known result by Takens and Filipkiewicz, which asserts that for integer regularities, a group isomorphism between diffeomorphism groups of closed manifolds necessarily arises from a diffeomorphism of the underlying manifolds. We prove an analogous result for groups of diffeomorphisms preserving smooth volume forms, in dimension at least two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relations and interactions between the theorems of Ash, Herwig-Lascar and Ribes-Zalesskii are discussed and it is shown that these three theorems are equivalent in the sense that each of them can be derived from each other one. Some strengthening of these theorems that can be obtained by use of the groups provided by the third author's construction are also considered.</description>

      <title>Finite generation of abelianizations of the genus 3 Johnson kernel and the commutator subgroup of the Torelli group for $\mathrm{Out}(F_3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma_g^b$ be a compact oriented surface of genus $g$ with $b$ boundary components, where $b\in\{0,1\}$. The Johnson kernel $\mathcal{K}_g^b$ is the subgroup of the mapping class group $\mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma_g^b)$ generated by Dehn twists about separating simple closed curves. Let $F_n$ be a free group with $n$ generators. The Torelli group for $\mathrm{Out}(F_n)$ is the subgroup $\mathrm{IO}_n\subset\mathrm{Out}(F_n)$ consisting of all outer automorphisms that act trivially on the abelianization of $F_n$. Long standing questions are whether the groups $\mathcal{K}_g^b$ and $[\mathrm{IO}_n,\mathrm{IO}_n]$ or their abelianizations $(\mathcal{K}_g^b)^{\mathrm{ab}}$ and $[\mathrm{IO}_n,\mathrm{IO}_n]^{\mathrm{ab}}$ are finitely generated for $g\ge3$ (respectively, $n\ge3$). During the last 15 years, these questions were answered positively for $g\ge4$ and $n\ge4$, respectively. Nevertheless, the cases of $g=3$ and $n=3$ remained completely unsettled. In this paper, we prove that the abelianizations $(\mathcal{K}_3^b)^{\mathrm{ab}}$ and $[\mathrm{IO}_3,\mathrm{IO}_3]^{\mathrm{ab}}$ are finitely generated. Our approach is based on a new general sufficient condition for a module over a Laurent polynomial ring to be finitely generated as an abelian group.</description>

      <title>Higher property T and below-rank phenomena of lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is twofold. We explore higher property T as an abstract group-theoretic property. In particular, we provide new operator-algebraic characterizations of higher property T. Then we turn to lattices in semisimple Lie groups. We relate higher property T to other cohomological, rigidity and geometric phenomena below the real rank. The second part outlines a conjectural framework that unifies these aspects and reviews recent advances.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity via Geodesic Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06863</link>
      <description>arXiv:1504.06863v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A geodesic $g$ is Morse, for every $L \geq 1, A \geq 0$ there exists a $C=C_g(L,A)$ such that any $(L,A)$-quasi-geodesic connecting two points on $g$ stays $C$-close to $g$. The Morse lemma implies that in a hyperbolic space every geodesic is Morse. Here we prove the converse: If a homogeneous proper geodesic space is such that for every geodesic $g$ and every $L\geq 1, A \geq 0$ there exists a constant $C=C_g(L,A)$ such that any $(L,A)$-quasi-geodesic between any two points on $g$ stays $C$-close, then the space is hyperbolic. This applies in particular to infinite groups in which all geodesics are Morse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the separability complex, a one-complex associated to a finite regular cover of the rose and show that it is connected if and only if the fundamental group of the associated cover is generated by its intersection with the set of elements in proper free factors of $\mathbf{F}_n$. The separability complex admits an action of $\mathrm{Out}(\mathbf{F}_n)$ by isometries if the associated cover corresponds to a characteristic subgroup of $\mathbf{F}_n$. We prove that the separability complex of the rose has infinite diameter and is nonhyperbolic, implying it is not quasi-isometric to the free splitting complex or the free factor complex. As a consequence, we obtain that the Cayley graph of $\mathbf{F}_n$ with generating set consisting of all primitive elements of $\mathbf{F}_n$ is nonhyperbolic.</description>

      <title>Homeomorphism groups of basilica, rabbit and airplane Julia sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The airplane, the basilica and the Douady rabbit (and, more generally, rabbits with more than two ears) are well-known Julia sets of complex quadratic polynomials.
  In this paper we study the groups of all homeomorphisms of such fractals and of all automorphisms of their laminations.
  In particular, we identify them with some kaleidoscopic group or universal groups and thus realize them as Polish permutation groups.
  From these identifications, we deduce algebraic, topological and geometric properties of these groups.</description>
