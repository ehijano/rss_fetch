      <title>Ping-pong in the projective plane over a nonarchimedean field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any lattice in $\mathrm{SL}_3(k)$, where $k$ is a nonarchimedean local field, contains an undistorted subgroup isomorphic to the free product $\mathbb{Z}^2*\mathbb{Z}$. To our knowledge, the subgroups we construct give the first examples in the literature of finitely generated Zariski-dense infinite-covolume discrete subgroups of an almost simple group over a nonarchimedean local field that are not virtually free. Our result is in contrast to the case of $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$, in which the existence of a $\mathbb{Z}^2*\mathbb{Z}$ subgroup remains open.</description>

      <title>The Saxl hypergraph of a permutation group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a permutation group $G \le \mathrm{Sym}(\Omega)$, a subset $B$ of $\Omega$ is said to be a base if its pointwise stabiliser in $G$ is trivial, and the base size $b(G)$ is the minimum size of a base. In the notable case $b(G) = 2$, Burness and Giudici define the Saxl graph of $G$ to be the graph on $\Omega$ with bases of size 2 as edges. Later work of Freedman et al. extends this notion to any group for which $b(G) \ge 2$, taking the pairs of points contained in bases of size $b(G)$ for edges. We study an alternative generalisation, the Saxl hypergraph, where bases of size $b(G)$ are themselves the edges. In particular, we consider groups with complete Saxl hypergraphs, primitive groups whose Saxl hypergraphs have flag-spanning tours, and appropriate generalisations of Burness and Giudici's Common Neighbour Conjecture.</description>

      <title>The Lamplighter Group is Not Semistable at Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of whether or not all finitely presented groups are semistable at infinity has been studied for over 40 years. In 1986, we defined what it means for a finitely generated group to be semistable at infinity - in analogy with the definition for finitely presented groups. At that time we suggest that the Lamplighter group may not be semistable at infinity, but until now there was no confirmed example of a finitely generated group that is not semistable at infinity. We prove the Lamplighter group is not semistable at infinity. Finitely generated non-semistable groups may be important in finding non-semistable finitely presented groups via ascending HNN extensions. There is an ascending HNN extension E of the Lamplighter group (called the Extended Lamplighter group) that is finitely presented. It would seem that E is a candidate to be a finitely presented non-semistable at infinity group, but a result of N. Silkin, shows that E is in fact simply connected at infinity.</description>

      <title>Subshifts on groups and computable analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of subshifts on groups different from $\mathbb{Z}$, such as $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 2$, has been a subject of intense research in recent years. These investigations have unveiled aremarkable connection between dynamics and recursion theory. Different questions about the dynamics of these systems have been answered in recursion-theoretical terms. In this work we further explore this connection. We use the framework of computable analysis to explore the class of effective dynamical systems on metric spaces, and relate these systems to subshifts of finite type (SFTs) on groups. We prove that every effective dynamical system on a general metric space is the topological factor of an effective dynamical system with topological dimension zero. We combine this result with existing simulation results to obtain new examples of systems that are factors of SFTsWe also study a conjugacy invariant for subshifts on groups called Medvedev degree. This invariant is a complexity measure of algorithmic nature. We develop the basic theory of these degrees for subshifts on arbitrary finitely generated groups. Using these tools we are able to classify the values that this invariant attains for SFTs and other classes of subshifts on several groups. Furthermore, we establish a connection between these degrees and the distribution of isolated points in the space of all subshifts. Motivated by the study of Medvedev degrees of subshifts, we also consider translation-like actions of groups on graphs. We prove that every connected, locally finite, and infinite graph admits a translation by $\mathbb{Z}$, and that this action can be chosen transitive exactly when the graph has one or two ends. This generalizes a result of Seward about translation-like actions of $\mathbb{Z}$ on finitely generated groups.</description>

      <title>On pyramidal groups whose number of involutions is a prime power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Kirkman Triple System $\Gamma$ is called $m$-pyramidal if there exists a subgroup $G$ of the automorphism group of $\Gamma$ that fixes $m$ points and acts regularly on the other points. Such group $G$ admits a unique conjugacy class $C$ of involutions (elements of order $2$) and $|C|=m$. We call groups with this property $m$-pyramidal. We prove that, if $m$ is an odd prime power $p^k$, with $p \neq 7$, then every $m$-pyramidal group is solvable if and only if either $m=9$ or $k$ is odd. The primitive permutation groups play an important role in the proof. We also determine the orders of the $m$-pyramidal groups when $m$ is a prime number.</description>

Abstract: For natural numbers $n$ and $k$, the concepts of $n$-modularly embedded subgroup, $k$-submodular subgroup and $k$-$\mathrm{LM}$-group are given, which generalize, respectively, the concepts of modular subgroup, submodular subgroup and $\mathrm{LM}$-group. Classes of groups with given systems of $k$-submodular subgroups are investigated.</description>

      <title>On dynamical skew braces and skew bracoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical skew braces are known to produce solutions to the quiver-theoretic Yang--Baxter equation. Under a technical hypothesis, we prove that these solutions are braided groupoids (and hence skew bracoids in the sense of Sheng, Tang and Zhu). Conversely, every connected braided groupoid can be parallelised, making it isomorphic to a dynamical skew brace. We study the combinatorics of these objects, depending on some strings of integer invariants.</description>

      <title>A character approach to the ISR property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a character approach to study the invariant von Neumann subalgebras rigidity property (abbreviated as the ISR property) introduced in Amrutam-Jiang's work. First, we introduce the non-factorizable regular character property for groups and show that this implies the ISR property for any infinite ICC groups with trivial amenable radical.Various examples are shown to have this property. Second, we apply known classification results on indecomposable characters to show approximately finite groups have the ISR property. Based on this approach, we also construct non-amenable groups with the ISR property while having non-trivial amenable radical or without the non-factorizable regular character property.</description>

      <title>Counting totally real units and eigenvalue patterns in $\rm{SL}_n(\mathbb Z)$ and $\rm{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb Z)$ along thin tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fix a vector $(v=(v_1,\dots ,v_n)$ with $v_1&gt;\cdots&gt;v_n$ and $\sum v_i=0$, and let $B_\varepsilon(Tv)$ be the $\varepsilon$-ball around $Tv$ for $T&gt;1$. As $T\to\infty$, (1) the number of degree-$n$ totally real units whose logarithmic embeddings lie in $B_\varepsilon(Tv)$, and (2) the number of eigenvalue patterns of $\rm{SL}_n(\mathbb Z)$ whose logarithmic embeddings lie in $B_\varepsilon(Tv)$, both grow like $$\exp\left(\rho_{\rm{SL}_n}(v)\,T\right)$$ where $ \rho_{\rm{SL}_n}(v)=\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}(n-i)\,v_i$ is the half-sum of positive roots of $\rm{SL}_n(\mathbb R)$. Hence the two arithmetic problems share the same "directional entropy". Because each eigenvalue pattern determines an $\rm{SL}_n(\mathbb R)$-conjugacy class, this yields a lower bound of order $\exp\left(\rho_{\rm{SL}_n}(v)T\right)$ for the number of $\rm{SL}_n(\mathbb Z)$-conjugacy classes with a prescribed eigenvalue pattern; we also obtain an upper bound of order $\exp \left(2\rho_{\rm{SL}_n}(v)T\right)$. A parallel argument for the symplectic lattice $\rm{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb Z)$ and $v=(v_1,\dots ,v_n,-v_n,\dots ,-v_1), v_1&gt;\cdots&gt;v_n&gt;0,$ gives growth $\exp\left(\rho_{\rm{Sp}_{2n}}(v)T\right)$ with $\rho_{\rm{Sp}_{2n}}(v)=\sum_{i=1}^n(n+1-i)v_i$, the half-sum of positive roots of $\rm{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb R)$.</description>
