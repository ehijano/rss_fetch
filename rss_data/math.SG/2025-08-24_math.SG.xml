      <title>Moduli spaces of Delzant polytopes and symplectic toric manifolds</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces modern geometric combinatorial technology from the theory of triangulations in order to derive results in toric symplectic geometry. In the main part of the paper we prove a number of properties of the space $\mathcal{D}(n)$ of $n$-dimensional Delzant polytopes. Two highlights are the construction of examples showing that, in contrast with the classical work of Oda in dimension $2$, no classification of combinatorially minimal Delzant polytopes can be expected in dimension $3$ or higher, and a proof that the space of $n$-dimensional Delzant polytopes is path-connected. Our proof of the latter is based on the fact that every rational fan can be refined to a unimodular fan, which is a standard technique used for resolution of singularities of toric varieties. In the last part of the paper, using the Delzant correspondence, these results allow us to answer several open questions concerning the moduli space $\mathcal{M}(n)$ of symplectic toric manifolds of dimension $2n$, since this space is isometric to the space of Delzant polytopes. Our results imply that no classification of minimal models of symplectic toric manifolds is plausible in dimension $6$ or higher, which answers in the negative a long-standing folklore question originating in Oda's work (1978).</description>

      <title>Quantitative contact Hamiltonian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic quantitative study of contact rigidity phenomena based on the contact Hamiltonian Floer theory established by Merry-Uljarevi\'c. Our quantitative approach applies to arbitrary admissible contact Hamiltonian functions on the contact boundary $M = \partial W$ of a ${\rm weakly}^{+}$-monotone symplectic manifold $W$. From a theoretical standpoint, we develop a comprehensive contact spectral invariant theory. As applications, the properties of these invariants enable us to establish several fundamental results: the contact big fiber theorem, sufficient conditions for orderability, and the existence results of translated points. Furthermore, we uncover a non-traditional filtration structure on contact Hamiltonian Floer groups, which we formalize through the introduction of a novel type of persistence modules, called gapped modules, that are only parametrized by a partially ordered set. Among the various properties of contact spectral invariants, we highlight that the triangle inequality is derived through an innovative analysis of a pair-of-pants construction in the contact-geometric framework.</description>
