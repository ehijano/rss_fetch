      <title>A Comparative Study of Transformer-Based Models for Multi-Horizon Blood Glucose Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate blood glucose prediction can enable novel interventions for type 1 diabetes treatment, including personalized insulin and dietary adjustments. Although recent advances in transformer-based architectures have demonstrated the power of attention mechanisms in complex multivariate time series prediction, their potential for blood glucose (BG) prediction remains underexplored. We present a comparative analysis of transformer models for multi-horizon BG prediction, examining forecasts up to 4 hours and input history up to 1 week. The publicly available DCLP3 dataset (n=112) was split (80%-10%-10%) for training, validation, and testing, and the OhioT1DM dataset (n=12) served as an external test set. We trained networks with point-wise, patch-wise, series-wise, and hybrid embeddings, using CGM, insulin, and meal data. For short-term blood glucose prediction, Crossformer, a patch-wise transformer architecture, achieved a superior 30-minute prediction of RMSE (15.6 mg / dL on OhioT1DM). For longer-term predictions (1h, 2h, and 4h), PatchTST, another path-wise transformer, prevailed with the lowest RMSE (24.6 mg/dL, 36.1 mg/dL, and 46.5 mg/dL on OhioT1DM). In general, models that used tokenization through patches demonstrated improved accuracy with larger input sizes, with the best results obtained with a one-week history. These findings highlight the promise of transformer-based architectures for BG prediction by capturing and leveraging seasonal patterns in multivariate time-series data to improve accuracy.</description>

      <title>RDA-PSO: A computational method to quantify the diffusive dispersal of insects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a computational method, called "Recapture of Diffusive Agents &amp; Particle Swarm Optimization" (RDA-PSO), designed to estimate the dispersal parameter of diffusive insects in mark-release-recapture (MRR) field experiments. In addition to describing the method, its properties are discussed, with particular focus on robustness in estimating the observed diffusion coefficient. It is shown that RDA-PSO provides a simple and reliable approach to quantify mosquito dispersal that outperforms other techniques based on the solution of the diffusion equation, three of which are also introduced in this work. Examples of application to both synthetic and real field data for the yellow fever mosquito are provided.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Modeling of Ultradian Rhythms Using the Hankel Alternative View of Koopman (HAVOK) Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultradian rhythms - quasi-rhythmic fluctuations in behavior and physiology with periods shorter than 24 hours - are observed across various organisms, including humans. Despite their role in key biological processes such as sleep architecture and hormone regulation, their underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we leveraged wearable sensor technology for continuous monitoring of physiological signals in 16 healthy participants over two weeks. By systematically removing circadian and longer-scale rhythms, we isolated ultradian dynamics and modeled them using the Hankel Alternative View of Koopman (HAVOK) framework,a data-driven approach based on Takens' embedding theorem and Koopman operator theory. This allowed us to characterize ultradian rhythms as an intermittently forced linear system and distinguish between regular oscillatory behavior and more complex dynamics. Across participants, ultradian fluctuations were well-described by the HAVOK model, with intermittent forcing consistently observed. The model demonstrated strong forecasting accuracy, with root mean squared error (RMSE) of $0.0315 \pm 0.02$, $0.0306 \pm 0.02$, and $0.0218 \pm 0.02$ in the leading time-delay coordinates. Notably, a significant sex difference in model rank (z = -2.06, p = 0.0396) suggests that sex hormones may play a key role in ultradian dynamics. These findings provide evidence for intermittently forced linear systems as a useful framework for understanding ultradian rhythms and their regulation.</description>

      <title>Validation of Conformal Prediction in Cervical Atypia Classification</title>

Abstract: Deep learning based cervical cancer classification can potentially increase access to screening in low-resource regions. However, deep learning models are often overconfident and do not reliably reflect diagnostic uncertainty. Moreover, they are typically optimized to generate maximum-likelihood predictions, which fail to convey uncertainty or ambiguity in their results. Such challenges can be addressed using conformal prediction, a model-agnostic framework for generating prediction sets that contain likely classes for trained deep-learning models. The size of these prediction sets indicates model uncertainty, contracting as model confidence increases. However, existing conformal prediction evaluation primarily focuses on whether the prediction set includes or covers the true class, often overlooking the presence of extraneous classes. We argue that prediction sets should be truthful and valuable to end users, ensuring that the listed likely classes align with human expectations rather than being overly relaxed and including false positives or unlikely classes. In this study, we comprehensively validate conformal prediction sets using expert annotation sets collected from multiple annotators. We evaluate three conformal prediction approaches applied to three deep-learning models trained for cervical atypia classification. Our expert annotation-based analysis reveals that conventional coverage-based evaluations overestimate performance and that current conformal prediction methods often produce prediction sets that are not well aligned with human labels. Additionally, we explore the capabilities of the conformal prediction methods in identifying ambiguous and out-of-distribution data.</description>

      <title>Deep Signature: Characterization of Large-Scale Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding protein dynamics are essential for deciphering protein functional mechanisms and developing molecular therapies. However, the complex high-dimensional dynamics and interatomic interactions of biological processes pose significant challenge for existing computational techniques. In this paper, we approach this problem for the first time by introducing Deep Signature, a novel computationally tractable framework that characterizes complex dynamics and interatomic interactions based on their evolving trajectories. Specifically, our approach incorporates soft spectral clustering that locally aggregates cooperative dynamics to reduce the size of the system, as well as signature transform that collects iterated integrals to provide a global characterization of the non-smooth interactive dynamics. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that Deep Signature exhibits several desirable properties, including invariance to translation, near invariance to rotation, equivariance to permutation of atomic coordinates, and invariance under time reparameterization. Furthermore, experimental results on three benchmarks of biological processes verify that our approach can achieve superior performance compared to baseline methods.</description>
