      <title>Refining Calculus Pedagogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There have been several modifications of how basic calculus has been taught, but very few of these modifications have considered the computational tools available at our disposal. Here, we present a few tools that are easy to develop and use. Doing so also addresses a different way to view calculus, and attempts to fill the gaps in students' understanding of both differentiation and integration. We will describe the basics of both these topics in a way that might be much more useful and relevant to students, and hence possible ways in refining calculus pedagogy to make calculus more accessible to them. For integration, an elementary development of Gaussian quadrature using basic linear algebra is presented. This numerical method can be extended to integrate functions over various domains in higher dimensions, a subject that is not currently well covered in multivariable calculus or other Mathematics courses. We also briefly discuss series that may be more useful than some of those taught in current calculus courses.</description>

      <title>Proof of the Goldbach's Strong Conjecture by Using Semi-Continuous Model of Even Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.13230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an explicit and analytic proof for still unproven Goldbach's strong conjecture. To derive this proof, we first define a heuristic model for representing even numbers called Semi-continuous Model for Even Numbers or briefly S.C.E Model, and then we employ this model along with using the inequality
  \begin{center}
  $\dfrac{x}{\ln x}\leq_{x\geq 17}\pi(x)\leq_{x&gt;1}1.2251\dfrac{x}{\ln x}$,
  \end{center}
  where $\pi(x)$ denotes the number of all primes smaller than and equal to $x$, and is presented by Pierre Dusart in his paper [P. Dusart, \textit{Explicit estimates of some functions over primes},
  Ramanujan J. \textbf{45} (2016), No. 1, 227--251].
  On the one hand, this proof is given for all even numbers $E\geq22864$. On the other hand, since the assertion of Goldbach's strong conjecture is easy to verify for all even numbers $4\leq E&lt;22864$, we turn this conjecture into a theorem.</description>
