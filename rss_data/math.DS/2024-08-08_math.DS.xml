      <title>Equidistribution of continuous low-lying pairs of horocycles via Ratner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We record an alternative proof of a recent joint equidistribution result of Blomer and Michel, based on Ratner's topological rigidity theorem. This approach has the advantage of extending to general cofinite Fuchsian groups.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of subshifts and infinite words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the complexity functions of subshifts up to asymptotic equivalence. The complexity function of every aperiodic function is non-decreasing, submultiplicative and grows at least linearly. We prove that conversely, every function satisfying these conditions is asymptotically equivalent to the complexity function of a recurrent subshift, equivalently, a recurrent infinite word. Our construction is explicit, algorithmic in nature and is philosophically based on constructing certain 'Cantor sets of integers', whose 'gaps' correspond to blocks of zeros. We also prove that every non-decreasing submultiplicative function is asymptotically equivalent, up a linear error term, to the complexity function of a minimal subshift.</description>

      <title>Learning Global Linear Representations of Truly Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While linear systems are well-understood, no explicit solution exists for general nonlinear systems. Thus, it is desirable to make the understanding of linear system available in the nonlinear setting. This motivates the search for linearization techniques which are able to represent the nonlinear system by an equivalent, linear system. While much progress has been made extending various linearization techniques to larger domains and more delicate attractor geometries, the limitations of such techniques for truly nonlinear dynamics, such as dynamics with coexisting attractors, have been pointed out recently. In this work, we show that genuinely nonlinear dynamics can be globally linearized. To this end, we investigate systems with a continuous spectrum, a limit cycle, and coexisting solutions and explicitly construct linear systems mimicking these nonlinear behaviors as close as possible. We approximate the transformations between linear and nonlinear system with deep neural networks. The obtained linearizations are finite dimensional exceeding the phase space dimension of the underlying linear system by one at most.</description>

      <title>Random dynamical systems of polynomial automorphisms on $\Bbb{C}^{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with random dynamical systems of polynomial automorphisms (complex generalized H\'{e}non maps and their conjugate maps) of $\Bbb{C}^{2}.$ We show that a generic random dynamical system of polynomial automorphisms has ``mean stablity'' on $\Bbb{C}^{2}$. Further, we show that if a system has mean stability, then (1) for each $z\in \Bbb{C}^{2}$ and for almost every sequence $\gamma =(\gamma _{n})_{n=1}^{\infty }$ of maps, the Lyapunov exponents of $\gamma $ at $z$ are negative, (2) there are only finitely many minimal sets of the system, (3) each minimal set is attracting, and (4) for each $z\in \Bbb{C}^{2}$ and for almost every sequence $\gamma $ of maps, the orbit $\{ \gamma _{n}\cdots \gamma _{1}(z) \} _{n=1}^{\infty }$ tends to one of the minimal sets of the system. Note that (1)--(4) cannot hold for any deterministic iteration dynamical system of a single complex generalized H\'{e}non map. We observe many new phenomena in random dynamical systems of polynomial automorphisms of $\Bbb{C}^{2}$ and observe the mechanisms. We provide new strategies and methods to study higher-dimensional random holomorphic dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Tangent Space of the Stable And Unstable Manifold of Anosov Diffeomorphism on 2-Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the tangent vectors of the stable and unstable manifold of a class of Anosov diffeomorphisms on the torus $\mathbb{T}^2$ using the method of formal series and derivative trees. We start with linear automorphism that is hyperbolic and whose eigenvectors are orthogonal. Then we study the perturbation of such maps by trigonometric polynomial. It is known that there exist a (continuous) map $H$ which acts as a change of coordinate between the perturbed and unperturbed system, but such a map is in general, not differentiable. By "re-scaling" the parametrization $H$, we will be able to obtain the explicit formula for the tangent vectors of these maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a class of non uniformly expanding random dynamical system with additive noise and we prove a BV estimate between the stationary measure and the quasistationary measure of the system. Furthermore, we use these bounds to give precise estimates for the Lyapunov exponent of the system.</description>

      <title>Permutations of periodic points of Weierstrass Prym eigenforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Weierstrass Prym eigenform is an Abelian differential with a single zero on a Riemann surface possessing some special kinds of symmetries. Such surfaces come equipped with an involution, known as a Prym involution. They were originally discovered by McMullen and only arise in genus 2, 3 and 4. Moreover, they are classified by two invariants: discriminant and spin.
  We study how the fixed points for the Prym involution of Weierstrass Prym eigenforms are permuted. In previous work, the authors computed the permutation group induced by affine transformations in the case of genus 2, showing that they are dihedral groups depending only on the residue class modulo 8 of the discriminant $D$. In this work, we complete this classification by settling the case of genus 3, showing that the permutation group induced by the affine group on the set of its three (regular) fixed points is isomorphic to $\mathrm{Sym}_2$ when $D$ is even and a quadratic residue modulo 16, and to $\mathrm{Sym}_3$ otherwise. The case of genus 4 is trivial as the Pyrm involution fixes a single (regular) point. In both cases, these same groups arise when considering only parabolic elements of the affine group.
  By recent work of Freedman, when the Teichm\"uller curve induced by Weierstrass Prym eigenform is not arithmetic, the fixed points of the Prym involution coincide with the periodic points of the surface. Hence, in this case, our result also classifies how periodic points are permuted.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct examples of continuous $\mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{R})$-cocycles which are not uniformly hyperbolic despite having the same non-zero Lyapunov exponents with respect to all invariant measures. The base dynamics can be any non-trivial subshift of finite type. According to a theorem of DeWitt--Gogolev and Guysinsky, such cocycles cannot be H\"older-continuous. Our construction uses the nonuniformly hyperbolic cocycles discovered by Walters in 1984.</description>

      <title>Mixed Hegselmann-Krause Dynamics on infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mixed Hegselmann-Krause (HK) model covers the synchronous Hegselmann-Krause model, the asynchronous Hegselmann-Krause model and the Deffuant model. Previous study~\cite{mHK, mHK2} deals with the mixed HK model on finite graphs. In the study, we discuss the mixed HK model on infinite graphs which also covers the HK model and the Deffuant model on infinite graphs. We investigate conditions under which asymptotic stability holds or any two vertices in the same component approaches each other after some finite time.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic foliations tangent to Rolle-pfaffian hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study germs of holomorphic foliations, at the origin of the complex plane, tangent to Pfaffian hypersurfaces - integral hypersurfaces of real analytic 1-forms - satisfying the Rolle-Khovanskii condition. This hypothesis leads us to conclude that such a foliation is defined by a closed meromorphic 1-form, also allowing the classification of the simple models in its reduction of singularities.</description>

      <title>Early Warning Signals for Bifurcations Embedded in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the utility of methods for early warning signal detection in dynamic systems approaching critical tipping thresholds. Often these tipping points resemble local bifurcations, whose low dimensional dynamics can play out on a manifold embedded in a much higher dimensional state space. In many cases of practical relevance, the form of this embedding is poorly understood or entirely unknown. This paper explores how measurement of the critical phenomena that generically precede such bifurcations can be used to make inferences about the properties of their embeddings, and, conversely, how prior knowledge about the mechanism of bifurcation can robustify predictions of an oncoming tipping event. These modes of analysis are first demonstrated on a simple fluid flow system undergoing a Hopf bifurcation. The same approach is then applied to data associated with the West African monsoon shift, with results corroborated by existing models of the same system. This example highlights the effectiveness of the methodology even when applied to complex climate data, and demonstrates how a well-resolved spatial structure associated with the onset of atmospheric instability can be inferred purely from time series measurements.</description>

      <title>Recovering the state and dynamics of autonomous system with partial states solution using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the performance of deep hidden physics model (M. Raissi 2018) for autonomous systems. These systems are described by set of ordinary differential equations which do not explicitly depend on time. Such systems can be found in nature and have applications in modeling chemical concentrations, population dynamics, n-body problems in physics etc. In this work we consider dynamics of states, which explain how the states will evolve are unknown to us. We approximate state and dynamics both using neural networks. We have considered examples of 2D linear/nonlinear and Lorenz systems. We observe that even without knowing all the states information, we can estimate dynamics of certain states whose state information are known.</description>
