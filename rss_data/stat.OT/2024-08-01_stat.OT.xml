      <title>Computational methods to simultaneously compare the predictive values of two diagnostic tests with missing data: EM-SEM algorithms and multiple imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive values are measures of the clinical accuracy of a binary diagnostic test, and depend on the sensitivity and the specificity of the diagnostic test and on the disease prevalence among the population being studied. This article studies hypothesis tests to simultaneously compare the predictive values of two binary diagnostic tests in the presence of missing data. The hypothesis tests were solved applying two computational methods: the expectation maximization and the supplemented expectation maximization algorithms, and multiple imputation. Simulation experiments were carried out to study the sizes and the powers of the hypothesis tests, giving some general rules of application. Two R programmes were written to apply each method, and they are available as supplementary material for the manuscript. The results were applied to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the likelihood ratios of two diagnostic tests subject to a paired design: confidence intervals and sample size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positive and negative likelihood ratios are parameters which are used to assess and compare the effectiveness of binary diagnostic tests. Both parameters only depend on the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test and are equivalent to a relative risk. This article studies the comparison of the likelihood ratios of two binary diagnostic tests subject to a paired design through confidence intervals. Six approximate confidence intervals are presented for the ratio of the likelihood ratios, and simulation experiments are carried out to study the coverage probabilities and the average lengths of the intervals considered, and some general rules of application are proposed. A method is also proposed to determine the sample size necessary to estimate the ratio between the likelihood ratios with a determined precision. The results were applied to the diagnosis of coronary artery disease.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic confidence intervals for the difference and the ratio of the weighted kappa coefficients of two diagnostic tests subject to a paired design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weighted kappa coefficient of a binary diagnostic test is a measure of the beyond-chance agreement between the diagnostic test and the gold standard, and depends on the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test, on the disease prevalence and on the relative importance between the false positives and the false negatives. This article studies the comparison of the weighted kappa coefficients of two binary diagnostic tests subject to a paired design through confidence intervals. Three asymptotic confidence intervals are studied for the difference between the parameters and five other intervals for the ratio. Simulation experiments were carried out to study the coverage probabilities and the average lengths of the intervals, giving some general rules for application. A method is also proposed to calculate the sample size necessary to compare the two weighted kappa coefficients through a confidence interval. A program in R has been written to solve the problem studied and it is available as supplementary material. The results were applied to a real example of the diagnosis of malaria.</description>
