      <title>High-energy polarized electron beams from the ionization of isolated spin polarized hydrogen atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a laser-based method for the preparation of high-energy, highly-polarized electrons, from the ionization of isolated spin-polarized hydrogen (SPH) atoms. The SPH atoms are prepared from the photodissociation of HBr, using two consecutive shaped UV pulses of ps duration. By appropriately timing and focusing the pulses, we can spatially separate the highly polarized SPH from other unwanted photoproducts, which then act as the target for the ion-acceleration lasers. The density of SPH can surpass $\approx$10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$, allowing the production of GeV electrons with polarization larger than 90%.</description>

      <title>Dynamic polarizabilities and triple magic trapping conditions for $5s^2~^1S_0\rightarrow 5s5p~^3P_{0,2}$ transitions of Cd atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic electric dipole polarizabilities of the $5s^2~^1S_0$, $5s5p~^3P_{0}$, and $5s5p~^3P_2$ states for Cd atoms are calculated using the relativistic configuration interaction plus many-body perturbation theory method. The magic wavelengths for the $5s^2~^1S_0\rightarrow 5s5p~^3P_{0}$ and $5s^2~^1S_0\rightarrow 5s5p~^3P_2$ transitions within a range of 300-500 nm are identified. The possibility of achieving triple magic trapping for the transitions $5s^2~^1S_0\rightarrow5s5p~^3P_{0}$ and $5s^2~^1S_0\rightarrow5s5p~^3P_2$ is investigated. It is found that no common magic wavelength could be identified for achieving triple magic trapping with the linearly polarized light. However, if the degree of ellipticity is between $0.358$ and $1$, the triple magic trapping can be achieved at 419.88 nm for the $5s^2 ~ ^1S_0\rightarrow 5s5p~^3P_2$ ($M_{i}=\pm2$) and $5s^2~^1S_0\rightarrow5s5p~^3P_{0}$ transitions.</description>

      <title>Precision Spectroscopy and Nuclear Structure Parameters in 7Li+ ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical Ramsey technique is used to obtain precise measurements of the hyperfine splittings in the $2\,^3\!S_1$ and $2\,^3\!P_J$ states of $^7$Li$^+$. Together with bound-state quantum electrodynamic theory, the Zemach radius and quadrupole moment of the $^7$Li nucleus are determined to be $3.35(1)$~fm and $-3.86(5)$~fm$^2$ respectively, with the quadrupole moment deviating from the recommended value of $-4.00(3)$~fm$^2$ by $1.75\sigma$. Furthermore, we determine the quadrupole moment ratio of $^6$Li to $^7$Li as $0.101(13)$, exhibiting a $6\sigma$ deviation from the previous measured value of $0.020161(13)$ by LiF molecular spectroscopy. The results taken together provide a sensitive test of nuclear structure models.</description>

      <title>Nuclear magnetic shielding in heliumlike ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ab initio QED calculations of the nuclear magnetic shielding constant in helium-like ions are presented. We combine the nonrelativistic QED approach based on an expansion in powers of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and the so-called ``all-order'' QED approach which includes all orders in the parameter $Z\alpha$ but uses a perturbation expansion in the parameter $1/Z$ (where $Z$ is the nuclear charge number). The combination of the two complementary methods makes our treatment applicable both to low-$Z$ and high-$Z$ ions. Our calculations confirm the presence of a rare antiscreening effect for the relativistic shielding correction and demonstrate the importance of the inclusion of the negative-energy part of the Dirac spectrum.</description>

      <title>Extracting Kinetic Information from Short-Time Trajectories: Relaxation and Disorder of Lossy Cavity Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emerging field of molecular cavity polaritons has stimulated a surge of experimental and theoretical activities and presents a unique opportunity to develop the many-body simulation methodology. This paper presents a numerical scheme for the extraction of key kinetic information of lossy cavity polaritons based on the transfer tensor method (TTM). Steady state, relaxation timescales and oscillatory phenomena can all be deduced directly from a set of transfer tensors without the need for long-time simulation. Moreover, we generalize TTM to disordered systems by sampling dynamical maps and achieve fast convergence to disordered-averaged dynamics using a small set of realizations. Together, these techniques provide a toolbox for characterizing the interplay of cavity loss, disorder, and cooperativity in polariton relaxation and allow us to predict unusual dependences on the initial excitation state, photon decay rate, strength of disorder, and the type of cavity models. Thus, we have demonstrated significant potential in the use of the TTM towards both the efficient computation of long-time polariton dynamics and the extraction of crucial kinetic information about polariton relaxation from a small set of short-time trajectories.</description>

      <title>Manifestation of the Normal Intensity Distribution Law (NIDL) in the rovibrational emission spectrum of hydroxyl radical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latest experimental [Noll et al. Atmos. Chem. Phys. 20(2020)5269] and theoretical [Brooke et al. J. Quant. Spectr. Rad. Transfer 168(2016)142] data on the OH emission intensities are analyzed with use of the NIDL. It is found that the calculated intensities of the $\Delta v&gt;6$ transitions should not be trusted.
  The analysis of the OH data revealed that the NIDL theory is not applicable to the satellite bands. The effect of small reduced mass previously discovered in H$_2$ [Ushakov et al. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 399(2024)111863], causing the NIDL straight-line slope to be larger than the one associated with the repulsive branch of the potential, is demonstrated, and the same should be true of all the diatomic hydrides. We performed ab initio calculations of the OH repulsive branch and compared it with the one of Brooke et al. and the other due to Varandas and Voronin [Chem. Phys. 194(1995)91]. We found that the ab initio PEF closely follows the Varandas-Voronin potential in the repulsive region important for calculating the overtone intensities [Medvedev, J. Chem. Phys. 137(2012)174307]. Assumption is made that different potentials can be used to calculate transition frequencies and intensities for spectroscopic databases.</description>

      <title>Confinement of $N$-body systems and non-integer dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The squeezing process of a three-dimensional quantum system by use of an external deformed one-body oscillator potential can also be described by the $d$-method, without external field and where the dimension can take non-integer values. In this work we first generalize both methods to $N$ particles and any transition between dimensions below $3$. Once this is done, the use of harmonic oscillator interactions between the particles allows complete analytic solutions of both methods, and a direct comparison between them is possible. Assuming that both methods describe the same process, leading to the same ground state energy and wave function, an analytic equivalence between the methods arises. The equivalence between both methods and the validity of the derived analytic relation between them is first tested for two identical bosons and for squeezing transitions from 3 to 2 and 1 dimensions, as well as from 2 to 1 dimension. We also investigate the symmetric squeezing from 3 to 1 dimensions of a system made of three identical bosons. We have in all the cases found that the derived analytic relations between the two methods work very well. This fact permits to relate both methods also for large squeezing scenarios, where the brute force numerical calculation with the external field is too much demanding from the numerical point of view, especially for systems with more than two particles.</description>

      <title>Bond-Order Density Wave Phases in Dimerized Extended Bose-Hubbard Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bose-Hubbard model (BHM) has been widely explored to develop a profound understanding of the strongly correlated behavior of interacting bosons. Quantum simulators not only allow the exploration of the BHM but also extend it to models with interesting phenomena such as gapped phases with multiple orders and topological phases. In this work, an extended Bose-Hubbard model involving a dimerized one-dimensional model of long-range interacting hard-core bosons is studied. Bond-order density wave phases (BODW) are characterized in terms of their symmetry breaking and topological properties. At certain fillings, interactions combined with dimerized hoppings give rise to an emergent symmetry-breaking leading to BODW phases, which differs from the case of non-interacting models that require an explicit breaking of the symmetry. Specifically, the BODW phase at filling $\rho=1/3$ possesses no analogue in the non-interacting model in terms of its symmetry-breaking properties and the unit cell structure. Upon changing the dimerization pattern, the system realizes topologically trivial BODW phases. At filling $\rho=1/4$, on-site density modulations are shown to stabilize the topological BODW phase. Our work provides the bridge between interacting and non-interacting BODW phases and highlights the significance of long-range interactions in a dimerized lattice by showing unique BODW phases that do not exist in the non-interacting model.</description>

      <title>Reshaped Three-Body Interactions and the Observation of an Efimov State in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efimov trimers are exotic three-body quantum states that emerge from the different types of three-body continua in the vicinity of two-atom Feshbach resonances. In particular, as the strength of the interaction is decreased to a critical point, an Efimov state merges into the atom-dimer threshold and eventually dissociates into an unbound atom-dimer pair. Here we explore the Efimov state in the vicinity of this critical point using coherent few-body spectroscopy in $^7$Li atoms using a narrow two-body Feshbach resonance. Contrary to the expectation, we find that the $^7$Li Efimov trimer does not immediately dissociate when passing the threshold, and survives as a metastable state embedded in the atom-dimer continuum. We identify this behavior with a universal phenomenon related to the emergence of a repulsive interaction in the atom-dimer channel which reshapes the three-body interactions in any system characterized by a narrow Feshbach resonance. Specifically, our results shed light on the nature of $^7$Li Efimov states and provide a path to understand various puzzling phenomena associated with them.</description>

      <title>Sphractal: Estimating the Fractal Dimension of Surfaces Computed from Precise Atomic Coordinates via Box-Counting Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fractal dimension of a surface allows its degree of roughness to be characterized quantitatively. However, limited effort is attempted to calculate the fractal dimension of surfaces computed from precisely known atomic coordinates from computational biomolecular and nanomaterial studies. This work proposes methods to estimate the fractal dimension of the surface of any 3D object composed of spheres, by representing the surface as either a voxelized point cloud or a mathematically exact surface, and computing its box-counting dimension. Sphractal is published as a Python package that provides these functionalities, and its utility is demonstrated on a set of simulated palladium nanoparticle data.</description>

Abstract: The goal of quantum metrology is to improve measurements' sensitivities by harnessing quantum resources. Metrologists often aim to maximize the quantum Fisher information, which bounds the measurement setup's sensitivity. In studies of fundamental limits on metrology, a paradigmatic setup features a qubit (spin-half system) subject to an unknown rotation. One obtains the maximal quantum Fisher information about the rotation if the spin begins in a state that maximizes the variance of the rotation-inducing operator. If the rotation axis is unknown, however, no optimal single-qubit sensor can be prepared. Inspired by simulations of closed timelike curves, we circumvent this limitation. We obtain the maximum quantum Fisher information about a rotation angle, regardless of the unknown rotation axis. To achieve this result, we initially entangle the probe qubit with an ancilla qubit. Then, we measure the pair in an entangled basis, obtaining more information about the rotation angle than any single-qubit sensor can achieve. We demonstrate this metrological advantage using a two-qubit superconducting quantum processor. Our measurement approach achieves a quantum advantage, outperforming every entanglement-free strategy.</description>

      <title>Signature of reentrant localization in collisional inhomogeneous spin-orbit coupled condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the localization transition in a spin-orbit (SO) coupled binary Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with collisional inhomogeneous interaction trapped in a one-dimensional quasiperiodic potential. Our numerical analysis shows that the competition between the quasiperiodic disorder and inhomogeneous interaction leads to a reentrant localization transition as the interaction strength is tuned from attractive to repulsive in nature. Further, we analyse the combined effect of the SO and Rabi coupling strengths on the localization transition for different interaction strengths and obtain signatures of reentrant localization transition as function of SO coupling in the regime of weak interactions. We complement our numerical observation with the analytical model using the variational approach. At the end we show how the reentrant localization is manifested in the quench dynamics of the condensate. Our study provides an indirect approach to achieve localization transition without tuning the quasiperiodic potential strength, rather by tuning the inhomogeneous interaction.</description>
