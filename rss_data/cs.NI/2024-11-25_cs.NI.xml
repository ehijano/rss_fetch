      <title>Performance Analysis of Traditional and Network Coded Transmission in Infrastructure-less Multi-hop Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrastructure-less Multi-hop Wireless Networks are the backbone for mission critical communications such as in disaster and battlefield scenarios. However, interference signals in the wireless channel cause losses to transmission in wireless networks resulting in a reduced network throughput and making efficient transmission very challenging. Therefore, techniques to overcome interference and increase transmission efficiency have been a hot area of research for decades. In this paper two methods for transmitting data through infrastructure-less multi hop wireless networks, Traditional (TR) and Network Coded (NC) transmission are thoroughly examined for scenarios having one or two communication streams in a network. The study has developed network models in MATLAB for each transmission technique and scenario. The simulation results showed that the NC transmission method yielded a better throughput under the same network settings and physical interference. Furthermore, the impact of increasing numbers of hops between source and destination on the network capacity and the communications latency was also observed and conclusions were drawn.</description>

      <title>GeMID: Generalizable Models for IoT Device Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, ensuring their security has become paramount. Device identification (DI), which distinguishes IoT devices based on their traffic patterns, plays a crucial role in both differentiating devices and identifying vulnerable ones, closing a serious security gap. However, existing approaches to DI that build machine learning models often overlook the challenge of model generalizability across diverse network environments. In this study, we propose a novel framework to address this limitation and evaluate the generalizability of DI models across datasets collected within different network environments. Our approach involves a two-step process: first, we develop a feature and model selection method that is more robust to generalization issues by using a genetic algorithm with external feedback and datasets from distinct environments to refine the selections. Second, the resulting DI models are then tested on further independent datasets in order to robustly assess their generalizability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by empirically comparing it to alternatives, highlighting how fundamental limitations of commonly employed techniques such as sliding window and flow statistics limit their generalizability. Our findings advance research in IoT security and device identification, offering insights into improving model effectiveness and mitigating risks in IoT networks.</description>

      <title>Initial Evidence of Elevated Reconnaissance Attacks Against Nodes in P2P Overlay Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We hypothesize that peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay network nodes can be attractive to attackers due to their visibility, sustained uptime, and resource potential. Towards validating this hypothesis, we investigate the state of active reconnaissance attacks on Ethereum P2P network nodes by deploying a series of honeypots alongside actual Ethereum nodes across globally distributed vantage points. We find that Ethereum nodes experience not only increased attacks, but also specific types of attacks targeting particular ports and services. Furthermore, we find evidence that the threat assessment on our nodes is applicable to the wider P2P network by having performed port scans on other reachable peers. Our findings provide insights into potential mitigation strategies to improve the security of the P2P networking layer.</description>

      <title>Elevating the future of mobility: UAV-enabled Intelligent Transportation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.09934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) increasingly rely on connectivity for efficient traffic management and enhanced user experience. The existing ITS solutions operate mainly within a 2D domain, thus missing the potential benefits of aerial platforms. This paper envisions 3D ITS by integrating aerial platforms, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), to simultaneously improve network coverage and support multi-modal transportation, including Advanced Air Mobility (AAM). Using stochastic models, we investigate how UAV-based Aerial Base Stations (ABSs) can address the limitations of traditional Terrestrial Base Stations (TBSs) by offering superior coverage, particularly in urban environments. Our results demonstrate that ABSs have 106.67% more coverage area than TBS, higher Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) distribution, and are suitable for high-throughput ITS applications.</description>

      <title>PandORA: Automated Design and Comprehensive Evaluation of Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents for Open RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The highly heterogeneous ecosystem of NextG wireless communication systems calls for novel networking paradigms where functionalities and operations can be dynamically and optimally reconfigured in real time to adapt to changing traffic conditions and satisfy stringent and diverse QoS demands. Open RAN technologies, and specifically those being standardized by the O-RAN Alliance, make it possible to integrate network intelligence into the once monolithic RAN via intelligent applications, namely, xApps and rApps. These applications enable flexible control of the network resources and functionalities, network management, and orchestration through data-driven intelligent control loops. Recent work has showed how DRL is effective in dynamically controlling O-RAN systems. However, how to design these solutions in a way that manages heterogeneous optimization goals and prevents unfair resource allocation is still an open challenge, with the logic within DRL agents often considered as a black box. In this paper, we introduce PandORA, a framework to automatically design and train DRL agents for Open RAN applications, package them as xApps and evaluate them in the Colosseum wireless network emulator. We benchmark $23$ xApps that embed DRL agents trained using different architectures, reward design, action spaces, and decision-making timescales, and with the ability to hierarchically control different network parameters. We test these agents on the Colosseum testbed under diverse traffic and channel conditions, in static and mobile setups. Our experimental results indicate how suitable fine-tuning of the RAN control timers, as well as proper selection of reward designs and DRL architectures can boost network performance according to the network conditions and demand. Notably, finer decision-making granularities can improve mMTC's performance by ~56% and even increase eMBB Throughput by ~99%.</description>

      <title>Prioritized Information Bottleneck Theoretic Framework with Distributed Online Learning for Edge Video Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collaborative perception systems leverage multiple edge devices, such surveillance cameras or autonomous cars, to enhance sensing quality and eliminate blind spots. Despite their advantages, challenges such as limited channel capacity and data redundancy impede their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce the Prioritized Information Bottleneck (PIB) framework for edge video analytics. This framework prioritizes the shared data based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and camera coverage of the region of interest (RoI), reducing spatial-temporal data redundancy to transmit only essential information. This strategy avoids the need for video reconstruction at edge servers and maintains low latency. It leverages a deterministic information bottleneck method to extract compact, relevant features, balancing informativeness and communication costs. For high-dimensional data, we apply variational approximations for practical optimization. To reduce communication costs in fluctuating connections, we propose a gate mechanism based on distributed online learning (DOL) to filter out less informative messages and efficiently select edge servers. Moreover, we establish the asymptotic optimality of DOL by proving the sublinearity of their regrets. To validate the effectiveness of the PIB framework, we conduct real-world experiments on three types of edge devices with varied computing capabilities. Compared to five coding methods for image and video compression, PIB improves mean object detection accuracy (MODA) while reducing 17.8% and reduces communication costs by 82.65% under poor channel conditions.</description>
