      <title>Practical Evaluation of Copula-based Survival Metrics: Beyond the Independent Censoring Assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional survival metrics, such as Harrell's concordance index and the Brier Score, rely on the independent censoring assumption for valid inference in the presence of right-censored data. However, when instances are censored for reasons related to the event of interest, this assumption no longer holds, as this kind of dependent censoring biases the marginal survival estimates of popular nonparametric estimators. In this paper, we propose three copula-based metrics to evaluate survival models in the presence of dependent censoring, and design a framework to create realistic, semi-synthetic datasets with dependent censoring to facilitate the evaluation of the metrics. Our empirical analyses in synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets show that our metrics can give error estimates that are closer to the true error, mainly in terms of predictive accuracy.</description>

      <title>Advancing calibration for stochastic agent-based models in epidemiology with Stein variational inference and Gaussian process surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate calibration of stochastic agent-based models (ABMs) in epidemiology is crucial to make them useful in public health policy decisions and interventions. Traditional calibration methods, e.g., Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), that yield a probability density function for the parameters being calibrated, are often computationally expensive. When applied to ABMs which are highly parametrized, the calibration process becomes computationally infeasible. This paper investigates the utility of Stein Variational Inference (SVI) as an alternative calibration technique for stochastic epidemiological ABMs approximated by Gaussian process (GP) surrogates. SVI leverages gradient information to iteratively update a set of particles in the space of parameters being calibrated, offering potential advantages in scalability and efficiency for high-dimensional ABMs. The ensemble of particles yields a joint probability density function for the parameters and serves as the calibration. We compare the performance of SVI and MCMC in calibrating CityCOVID, a stochastic epidemiological ABM, focusing on predictive accuracy and calibration effectiveness. Our results demonstrate that SVI maintains predictive accuracy and calibration effectiveness comparable to MCMC, making it a viable alternative for complex epidemiological models. We also present the practical challenges of using a gradient-based calibration such as SVI which include careful tuning of hyperparameters and monitoring of the particle dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fast Debiasing of the LASSO Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-dimensional sparse regression, the \textsc{Lasso} estimator offers excellent theoretical guarantees but is well-known to produce biased estimates. To address this, \cite{Javanmard2014} introduced a method to ``debias" the \textsc{Lasso} estimates for a random sub-Gaussian sensing matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$. Their approach relies on computing an ``approximate inverse" $\boldsymbol{M}$ of the matrix $\boldsymbol{A}^\top \boldsymbol{A}/n$ by solving a convex optimization problem. This matrix $\boldsymbol{M}$ plays a critical role in mitigating bias and allowing for construction of confidence intervals using the debiased \textsc{Lasso} estimates. However the computation of $\boldsymbol{M}$ is expensive in practice as it requires iterative optimization. In the presented work, we re-parameterize the optimization problem to compute a ``debiasing matrix" $\boldsymbol{W} := \boldsymbol{AM}^{\top}$ directly, rather than the approximate inverse $\boldsymbol{M}$. This reformulation retains the theoretical guarantees of the debiased \textsc{Lasso} estimates, as they depend on the \emph{product} $\boldsymbol{AM}^{\top}$ rather than on $\boldsymbol{M}$ alone. Notably, we provide a simple, computationally efficient, closed-form solution for $\boldsymbol{W}$ under similar conditions for the sensing matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ used in the original debiasing formulation, with an additional condition that the elements of every row of $\boldsymbol{A}$ have uncorrelated entries. Also, the optimization problem based on $\boldsymbol{W}$ guarantees a unique optimal solution, unlike the original formulation based on $\boldsymbol{M}$. We verify our main result with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Non-Convex Generalized Linear Models in High-Dimensions: A proof of the replica formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analytic characterization of the high-dimensional behavior of optimization for Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) with Gaussian data has been a central focus in statistics and probability in recent years. While convex cases, such as the LASSO, ridge regression, and logistic regression, have been extensively studied using a variety of techniques, the non-convex case remains far less understood despite its significance. A non-rigorous statistical physics framework has provided remarkable predictions for the behavior of high-dimensional optimization problems, but rigorously establishing their validity for non-convex problems has remained a fundamental challenge. In this work, we address this challenge by developing a systematic framework that rigorously proves replica-symmetric formulas for non-convex GLMs and precisely determines the conditions under which these formulas are valid. Remarkably, the rigorous replica-symmetric predictions align exactly with the conjectures made by physicists, and the so-called replicon condition. The originality of our approach lies in connecting two powerful theoretical tools: the Gaussian Min-Max Theorem, which we use to provide precise lower bounds, and Approximate Message Passing (AMP), which is shown to achieve these bounds algorithmically. We demonstrate the utility of this framework through significant applications: (i) by proving the optimality of the Tukey loss over the more commonly used Huber loss under a $\varepsilon$ contaminated data model, (ii) establishing the optimality of negative regularization in high-dimensional non-convex regression and (iii) characterizing the performance limits of linearized AMP algorithms. By rigorously validating statistical physics predictions in non-convex settings, we aim to open new pathways for analyzing increasingly complex optimization landscapes beyond the convex regime.</description>

      <title>Multiple Linked Tensor Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In biomedical research and other fields, it is now common to generate high content data that are both multi-source and multi-way. Multi-source data are collected from different high-throughput technologies while multi-way data are collected over multiple dimensions, yielding multiple tensor arrays. Integrative analysis of these data sets is needed, e.g., to capture and synthesize different facets of complex biological systems. However, despite growing interest in multi-source and multi-way factorization techniques, methods that can handle data that are both multi-source and multi-way are limited. In this work, we propose a Multiple Linked Tensors Factorization (MULTIFAC) method extending the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition to simultaneously reduce the dimension of multiple multi-way arrays and approximate underlying signal. We first introduce a version of the CP factorization with L2 penalties on the latent factors, leading to rank sparsity. When extended to multiple linked tensors, the method automatically reveals latent components that are shared across data sources or individual to each data source. We also extend the decomposition algorithm to its expectation-maximization (EM) version to handle incomplete data with imputation. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate MULTIFAC's ability to (i) approximate underlying signal, (ii) identify shared and unshared structures, and (iii) impute missing data. The approach yields an interpretable decomposition on multi-way multi-omics data for a study on early-life iron deficiency.</description>

      <title>Fast $\ell_1$-Regularized EEG Source Localization Using Variable Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalograms (EEG) are invaluable for treating neurological disorders, however, mapping EEG electrode readings to brain activity requires solving a challenging inverse problem. Due to the time series data, the use of $\ell_1$ regularization quickly becomes intractable for many solvers, and, despite the reconstruction advantages of $\ell_1$ regularization, $\ell_2$-based approaches such as sLORETA are used in practice. In this work, we formulate EEG source localization as a graphical generalized elastic net inverse problem and present a variable projected algorithm (VPAL) suitable for fast EEG source localization. We prove convergence of this solver for a broad class of separable convex, potentially non-smooth functions subject to linear constraints and include a modification of VPAL that reconstructs time points in sequence, suitable for real-time reconstruction. Our proposed methods are compared to state-of-the-art approaches including sLORETA and other methods for $\ell_1$-regularized inverse problems.</description>

      <title>On the Interpolation Effect of Score Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in various domains with the ability to generate new data samples that do not exist in the training set. In this work, we examine the hypothesis that their generalization ability arises from an interpolation effect caused by a smoothing of the empirical score function. Focusing on settings where the training set lies uniformly in a one-dimensional linear subspace, we study the interplay between score smoothing and the denoising dynamics with mathematically solvable models. In particular, we demonstrate how a smoothed score function can lead to the generation of samples that interpolate among the training data within their subspace while avoiding full memorization. We also present evidence that learning score functions with regularized neural networks can have a similar effect on the denoising dynamics as score smoothing.</description>

      <title>Extremely Greedy Equivalence Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of causal discovery is to learn a directed acyclic graph from data. One of the most well-known methods for this problem is Greedy Equivalence Search (GES). GES searches for the graph by incrementally and greedily adding or removing edges to maximize a model selection criterion. It has strong theoretical guarantees on infinite data but can fail in practice on finite data. In this paper, we first identify some of the causes of GES's failure, finding that it can get blocked in local optima, especially in denser graphs. We then propose eXtremely Greedy Equivalent Search (XGES), which involves a new heuristic to improve the search strategy of GES while retaining its theoretical guarantees. In particular, XGES favors deleting edges early in the search over inserting edges, which reduces the possibility of the search ending in local optima. A further contribution of this work is an efficient algorithmic formulation of XGES (and GES). We benchmark XGES on simulated datasets with known ground truth. We find that XGES consistently outperforms GES in recovering the correct graphs, and it is 10 times faster. XGES implementations in Python and C++ are available at https://github.com/ANazaret/XGES.</description>

      <title>LORENZA: Enhancing Generalization in Low-Rank Gradient LLM Training via Efficient Zeroth-Order Adaptive SAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study robust parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques designed to improve accuracy and generalization while operating within strict computational and memory hardware constraints, specifically focusing on large-language models (LLMs). Existing PEFT methods often lack robustness and fail to generalize effectively across diverse tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world scenarios. To address this, we present a new highly computationally efficient framework called AdaZo-SAM, combining Adam and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) while requiring only a single-gradient computation in every iteration. This is achieved using a stochastic zeroth-order estimation to find SAM's ascent perturbation. We provide a convergence guarantee for AdaZo-SAM and show that it improves the generalization ability of state-of-the-art PEFT methods. Additionally, we design a low-rank gradient optimization method named LORENZA, which is a memory-efficient version of AdaZo-SAM. LORENZA utilizes a randomized SVD scheme to efficiently compute the subspace projection matrix and apply optimization steps onto the selected subspace. This technique enables full-parameter fine-tuning with adaptive low-rank gradient updates, achieving the same reduced memory consumption as gradient-low-rank-projection methods. We provide a convergence analysis of LORENZA and demonstrate its merits for pre-training and fine-tuning LLMs.</description>

      <title>Mixture models for data with unknown distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe and analyze a broad class of mixture models for real-valued multivariate data in which the probability density of observations within each component of the model is represented as an arbitrary combination of basis functions. Fits to these models give us a way to cluster data with distributions of unknown form, including strongly non-Gaussian or multimodal distributions, and return both a division of the data and an estimate of the distributions, effectively performing clustering and density estimation within each cluster at the same time. We describe two fitting methods, one using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and the other a Bayesian non-parametric method using a collapsed Gibbs sampler. The former is numerically efficient, but gives only point estimates of the probability densities. The latter is more computationally demanding but returns a full Bayesian posterior and also an estimate of the number of components. We demonstrate our methods with a selection of illustrative applications and give code implementing both algorithms.</description>

      <title>Variation Matters: from Mitigating to Embracing Zero-Shot NAS Ranking Function Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a powerful automatic alternative to manual design of a neural network. In the zero-shot version, a fast ranking function is used to compare architectures without training them. The outputs of the ranking functions often vary significantly due to different sources of randomness, including the evaluated architecture's weights' initialization or the batch of data used for calculations. A common approach to addressing the variation is to average a ranking function output over several evaluations. We propose taking into account the variation in a different manner, by viewing the ranking function output as a random variable representing a proxy performance metric. During the search process, we strive to construct a stochastic ordering of the performance metrics to determine the best architecture. Our experiments show that the proposed stochastic ordering can effectively boost performance of a search on standard benchmark search spaces.</description>

      <title>Training Robust Graph Neural Networks by Modeling Noise Dependencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In real-world applications, node features in graphs often contain noise from various sources, leading to significant performance degradation in GNNs. Although several methods have been developed to enhance robustness, they rely on the unrealistic assumption that noise in node features is independent of the graph structure and node labels, thereby limiting their applicability. To this end, we introduce a more realistic noise scenario, dependency-aware noise on graphs (DANG), where noise in node features create a chain of noise dependencies that propagates to the graph structure and node labels. We propose a novel robust GNN, DA-GNN, which captures the causal relationships among variables in the data generating process (DGP) of DANG using variational inference. In addition, we present new benchmark datasets that simulate DANG in real-world applications, enabling more practical research on robust GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DA-GNN consistently outperforms existing baselines across various noise scenarios, including both DANG and conventional noise models commonly considered in this field.</description>

      <title>Can a calibration metric be both testable and actionable?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecast probabilities often serve as critical inputs for binary decision making. In such settings, calibration$\unicode{x2014}$ensuring forecasted probabilities match empirical frequencies$\unicode{x2014}$is essential. Although the common notion of Expected Calibration Error (ECE) provides actionable insights for decision making, it is not testable: it cannot be empirically estimated in many practical cases. Conversely, the recently proposed Distance from Calibration (dCE) is testable but is not actionable since it lacks decision-theoretic guarantees needed for high-stakes applications. We introduce Cutoff Calibration Error, a calibration measure that bridges this gap by assessing calibration over intervals of forecasted probabilities. We show that Cutoff Calibration Error is both testable and actionable and examine its implications for popular post-hoc calibration methods, such as isotonic regression and Platt scaling.</description>

      <title>Qini curve estimation under clustered network interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Qini curves are a widely used tool for assessing treatment policies under allocation constraints as they visualize the incremental gain of a new treatment policy versus the cost of its implementation. Standard Qini curve estimation assumes no interference between units: that is, that treating one unit does not influence the outcome of any other unit. In many real-life applications such as public policy or marketing, however, the presence of interference is common. Ignoring interference in these scenarios can lead to systematically biased Qini curves that over- or under-estimate a treatment policy's cost-effectiveness. In this paper, we address the problem of Qini curve estimation under clustered network interference, where interfering units form independent clusters. We propose a formal description of the problem setting with an experimental study design under which we can account for clustered network interference. Within this framework, we introduce three different estimation strategies suited for different conditions. Moreover, we introduce a marketplace simulator that emulates clustered network interference in a typical e-commerce setting. From both theoretical and empirical insights, we provide recommendations in choosing the best estimation strategy by identifying an inherent bias-variance trade-off among the estimation strategies.</description>

      <title>Identifiable Multi-View Causal Discovery Without Non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to linear causal discovery in the framework of multi-view Structural Equation Models (SEM). Our proposed model relaxes the well-known assumption of non-Gaussian disturbances by alternatively assuming diversity of variances over views, making it more broadly applicable. We prove the identifiability of all the parameters of the model without any further assumptions on the structure of the SEM other than it being acyclic. We further propose an estimation algorithm based on recent advances in multi-view Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The proposed methodology is validated through simulations and application on real neuroimaging data, where it enables the estimation of causal graphs between brain regions.</description>

      <title>Stein's unbiased risk estimate and Hyv\"arinen's score matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two G-modeling strategies for estimating the signal distribution (the empirical Bayesian's prior) from observations corrupted with normal noise. First, we choose the signal distribution by minimizing Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE) of the implied Eddington/Tweedie Bayes denoiser, an approach motivated by optimal empirical Bayesian shrinkage estimation of the signals. Second, we select the signal distribution by minimizing Hyv\"arinen's score matching objective for the implied score (derivative of log-marginal density), targeting minimal Fisher divergence between estimated and true marginal densities. While these strategies appear distinct, they are known to be mathematically equivalent. We provide a unified analysis of SURE and score matching under both well-specified signal distribution classes and misspecification. In the classical well-specified setting with homoscedastic noise and compactly supported signal distribution, we establish nearly parametric rates of convergence of the empirical Bayes regret and the Fisher divergence. In a commonly studied misspecified model, we establish fast rates of convergence to the oracle denoiser and corresponding oracle inequalities. Our empirical results demonstrate competitiveness with nonparametric maximum likelihood in well-specified settings, while showing superior performance under misspecification, particularly in settings involving heteroscedasticity and side information.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with State-Space World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful approach for robot learning. However, model-free RL (MFRL) requires a large number of environment interactions to learn successful control policies. This is due to the noisy RL training updates and the complexity of robotic systems, which typically involve highly non-linear dynamics and noisy sensor signals. In contrast, model-based RL (MBRL) not only trains a policy but simultaneously learns a world model that captures the environment's dynamics and rewards. The world model can either be used for planning, for data collection, or to provide first-order policy gradients for training. Leveraging a world model significantly improves sample efficiency compared to model-free RL. However, training a world model alongside the policy increases the computational complexity, leading to longer training times that are often intractable for complex real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a new method for accelerating model-based RL using state-space world models. Our approach leverages state-space models (SSMs) to parallelize the training of the dynamics model, which is typically the main computational bottleneck. Additionally, we propose an architecture that provides privileged information to the world model during training, which is particularly relevant for partially observable environments. We evaluate our method in several real-world agile quadrotor flight tasks, involving complex dynamics, for both fully and partially observable environments. We demonstrate a significant speedup, reducing the world model training time by up to 10 times, and the overall MBRL training time by up to 4 times. This benefit comes without compromising performance, as our method achieves similar sample efficiency and task rewards to state-of-the-art MBRL methods.</description>

      <title>Re-evaluating Open-ended Evaluation of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluation has traditionally focused on ranking candidates for a specific skill. Modern generalist models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), decidedly outpace this paradigm. Open-ended evaluation systems, where candidate models are compared on user-submitted prompts, have emerged as a popular solution. Despite their many advantages, we show that the current Elo-based rating systems can be susceptible to and even reinforce biases in data, intentional or accidental, due to their sensitivity to redundancies. To address this issue, we propose evaluation as a 3-player game, and introduce novel game-theoretic solution concepts to ensure robustness to redundancy. We show that our method leads to intuitive ratings and provide insights into the competitive landscape of LLM development.</description>

      <title>Conformal Tail Risk Control for Large Language Model Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have led to their widespread usage for various tasks. The prevalence of LLMs in society implores the assurance on the reliability of their performance. In particular, risk-sensitive applications demand meticulous attention to unexpectedly poor outcomes, i.e., tail events, for instance, toxic answers, humiliating language, and offensive outputs. Due to the costly nature of acquiring human annotations, general-purpose scoring models have been created to automate the process of quantifying these tail events. This phenomenon introduces potential human-machine misalignment between the respective scoring mechanisms. In this work, we present a lightweight calibration framework for blackbox models that ensures the alignment of humans and machines with provable guarantees. Our framework provides a rigorous approach to controlling any distortion risk measure that is characterized by a weighted average of quantiles of the loss incurred by the LLM with high confidence. The theoretical foundation of our method relies on the connection between conformal risk control and a traditional family of statistics, i.e., L-statistics. To demonstrate the utility of our framework, we conduct comprehensive experiments that address the issue of human-machine misalignment.</description>

      <title>To Switch or Not to Switch? Balanced Policy Switching in Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) -- finding the optimal behaviour (also referred to as policy) maximizing the collected long-term cumulative reward -- is among the most influential approaches in machine learning with a large number of successful applications. In several decision problems, however, one faces the possibility of policy switching -- changing from the current policy to a new one -- which incurs a non-negligible cost, and in the decision one is limited to using historical data without the availability for further online interaction. Despite the inevitable importance of this offline learning scenario, to our best knowledge, very little effort has been made to tackle the key problem of balancing between the gain and the cost of switching in a flexible and principled way. Leveraging ideas from the area of optimal transport, we initialize the systematic study of policy switching in offline RL. We establish fundamental properties and design a Net Actor-Critic algorithm for the proposed novel switching formulation. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on multiple robot control benchmarks of the Gymnasium and traffic light control from SUMO-RL.</description>

      <title>Persistent Sampling: Enhancing the Efficiency of Sequential Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers are powerful tools for Bayesian inference but suffer from high computational costs due to their reliance on large particle ensembles for accurate estimates. We introduce persistent sampling (PS), an extension of SMC that systematically retains and reuses particles from all prior iterations to construct a growing, weighted ensemble. By leveraging multiple importance sampling and resampling from a mixture of historical distributions, PS mitigates the need for excessively large particle counts, directly addressing key limitations of SMC such as particle impoverishment and mode collapse. Crucially, PS achieves this without additional likelihood evaluations-weights for persistent particles are computed using cached likelihood values. This framework not only yields more accurate posterior approximations but also produces marginal likelihood estimates with significantly lower variance, enhancing reliability in model comparison. Furthermore, the persistent ensemble enables efficient adaptation of transition kernels by leveraging a larger, decorrelated particle pool. Experiments on high-dimensional Gaussian mixtures, hierarchical models, and non-convex targets demonstrate that PS consistently outperforms standard SMC and related variants, including recycled and waste-free SMC, achieving substantial reductions in mean squared error for posterior expectations and evidence estimates, all at reduced computational cost. PS thus establishes itself as a robust, scalable, and efficient alternative for complex Bayesian inference tasks.</description>

      <title>Transformers Handle Endogeneity in In-Context Linear Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the capability of transformers to address endogeneity in in-context linear regression. Our main finding is that transformers inherently possess a mechanism to handle endogeneity effectively using instrumental variables (IV). First, we demonstrate that the transformer architecture can emulate a gradient-based bi-level optimization procedure that converges to the widely used two-stage least squares $(\textsf{2SLS})$ solution at an exponential rate. Next, we propose an in-context pretraining scheme and provide theoretical guarantees showing that the global minimizer of the pre-training loss achieves a small excess loss. Our extensive experiments validate these theoretical findings, showing that the trained transformer provides more robust and reliable in-context predictions and coefficient estimates than the $\textsf{2SLS}$ method, in the presence of endogeneity.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional Analysis of Knowledge Distillation: Weak-to-Strong Generalization and Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A growing number of machine learning scenarios rely on knowledge distillation where one uses the output of a surrogate model as labels to supervise the training of a target model. In this work, we provide a sharp characterization of this process for ridgeless, high-dimensional regression, under two settings: (i) model shift, where the surrogate model is arbitrary, and (ii) distribution shift, where the surrogate model is the solution of empirical risk minimization with out-of-distribution data. In both cases, we characterize the precise risk of the target model through non-asymptotic bounds in terms of sample size and data distribution under mild conditions. As a consequence, we identify the form of the optimal surrogate model, which reveals the benefits and limitations of discarding weak features in a data-dependent fashion. In the context of weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization, this has the interpretation that (i) W2S training, with the surrogate as the weak model, can provably outperform training with strong labels under the same data budget, but (ii) it is unable to improve the data scaling law. We validate our results on numerical experiments both on ridgeless regression and on neural network architectures.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Multi-Task Learning on ReLU Neural Network Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21696v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the properties of solutions to multi-task shallow ReLU neural network learning problems, wherein the network is trained to fit a dataset with minimal sum of squared weights. Remarkably, the solutions learned for each individual task resemble those obtained by solving a kernel regression problem, revealing a novel connection between neural networks and kernel methods. It is known that single-task neural network learning problems are equivalent to a minimum norm interpolation problem in a non-Hilbertian Banach space, and that the solutions of such problems are generally non-unique. In contrast, we prove that the solutions to univariate-input, multi-task neural network interpolation problems are almost always unique, and coincide with the solution to a minimum-norm interpolation problem in a Sobolev (Reproducing Kernel) Hilbert Space. We also demonstrate a similar phenomenon in the multivariate-input case; specifically, we show that neural network learning problems with large numbers of tasks are approximately equivalent to an $\ell^2$ (Hilbert space) minimization problem over a fixed kernel determined by the optimal neurons.</description>

      <title>Forecasting intermittent time series with Gaussian Processes and Tweedie likelihood</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the use of Gaussian Processes (GPs) for the probabilistic forecasting of intermittent time series. The model is trained in a Bayesian framework that accounts for the uncertainty about the latent function and marginalizes it out when making predictions. We couple the latent GP variable with two types of forecast distributions: the negative binomial (NegBinGP) and the Tweedie distribution (TweedieGP). While the negative binomial has already been used in forecasting intermittent time series, this is the first time in which a fully parameterized Tweedie density is used for intermittent time series. We properly evaluate the Tweedie density, which is both zero-inflated and heavy tailed, avoiding simplifying assumptions made in existing models. We test our models on thousands of intermittent count time series. Results show that our models provide consistently better probabilistic forecasts than the competitors. In particular, TweedieGP obtains the best estimates of the highest quantiles, thus showing that it is more flexible than NegBinGP.</description>

Abstract: We present four new mathematical methods, two exact and two approximate, along with open-source software, to compute the cdf, pdf and inverse cdf of the generalized chi-square distribution. Some methods are geared for speed, while others are designed to be accurate far into the tails, using which we can also measure large values of the discriminability index $d'$ between multivariate normal distributions. We compare the accuracy and speed of these and previous methods, characterize their advantages and limitations, and identify the best methods to use in different cases.</description>

Abstract: A novel approach is given to overcome the computational challenges of the full-matrix Adaptive Gradient algorithm (Full AdaGrad) in stochastic optimization. By developing a recursive method that estimates the inverse of the square root of the covariance of the gradient, alongside a streaming variant for parameter updates, the study offers efficient and practical algorithms for large-scale applications. This innovative strategy significantly reduces the complexity and resource demands typically associated with full-matrix methods, enabling more effective optimization processes. Moreover, the convergence rates of the proposed estimators and their asymptotic efficiency are given. Their effectiveness is demonstrated through numerical studies.</description>

      <title>On Conformal Isometry of Grid Cells: Learning Distance-Preserving Position Embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16865v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the conformal isometry hypothesis as a potential explanation for the hexagonal periodic patterns in grid cell response maps. We posit that grid cell activities form a high-dimensional vector in neural space, encoding the agent's position in 2D physical space. As the agent moves, this vector rotates within a 2D manifold in the neural space, driven by a recurrent neural network. The conformal hypothesis proposes that this neural manifold is a conformal isometric embedding of 2D physical space, where local physical distance is preserved by the embedding up to a scaling factor (or unit of metric). Such distance-preserving position embedding is indispensable for path planning in navigation, especially planning local straight path segments. We conduct numerical experiments to show that this hypothesis leads to the hexagonal grid firing patterns by learning maximally distance-preserving position embedding, agnostic to the choice of the recurrent neural network. Furthermore, we present a theoretical explanation of why hexagon periodic patterns emerge by minimizing our loss function by showing that hexagon flat torus is maximally distance preserving.</description>

      <title>Bilevel reinforcement learning via the development of hyper-gradient without lower-level convexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bilevel reinforcement learning (RL), which features intertwined two-level problems, has attracted growing interest recently. The inherent non-convexity of the lower-level RL problem is, however, to be an impediment to developing bilevel optimization methods. By employing the fixed point equation associated with the regularized RL, we characterize the hyper-gradient via fully first-order information, thus circumventing the assumption of lower-level convexity. This, remarkably, distinguishes our development of hyper-gradient from the general AID-based bilevel frameworks since we take advantage of the specific structure of RL problems. Moreover, we design both model-based and model-free bilevel reinforcement learning algorithms, facilitated by access to the fully first-order hyper-gradient. Both algorithms enjoy the convergence rate $O(\epsilon^{-1})$. To extend the applicability, a stochastic version of the model-free algorithm is proposed, along with results on its iteration and sample complexity. In addition, numerical experiments demonstrate that the hyper-gradient indeed serves as an integration of exploitation and exploration.</description>

      <title>Energy-based Epistemic Uncertainty for Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In domains with interdependent data, such as graphs, quantifying the epistemic uncertainty of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) is challenging as uncertainty can arise at different structural scales. Existing techniques neglect this issue or only distinguish between structure-aware and structure-agnostic uncertainty without combining them into a single measure. We propose GEBM, an energy-based model (EBM) that provides high-quality uncertainty estimates by aggregating energy at different structural levels that naturally arise from graph diffusion. In contrast to logit-based EBMs, we provably induce an integrable density in the data space by regularizing the energy function. We introduce an evidential interpretation of our EBM that significantly improves the predictive robustness of the GNN. Our framework is a simple and effective post hoc method applicable to any pre-trained GNN that is sensitive to various distribution shifts. It consistently achieves the best separation of in-distribution and out-of-distribution data on 6 out of 7 anomaly types while having the best average rank over shifts on \emph{all} datasets.</description>

      <title>Remove Symmetries to Control Model Expressivity and Improve Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When symmetry is present in the loss function, the model is likely to be trapped in a low-capacity state that is sometimes known as a "collapse". Being trapped in these low-capacity states can be a major obstacle to training across many scenarios where deep learning technology is applied. We first prove two concrete mechanisms through which symmetries lead to reduced capacities and ignored features during training and inference. We then propose a simple and theoretically justified algorithm, syre, to remove almost all symmetry-induced low-capacity states in neural networks. When this type of entrapment is especially a concern, removing symmetries with the proposed method is shown to correlate well with improved optimization or performance. A remarkable merit of the proposed method is that it is model-agnostic and does not require any knowledge of the symmetry.</description>

      <title>Solving Video Inverse Problems Using Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02574v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, diffusion model-based inverse problem solvers (DIS) have emerged as state-of-the-art approaches for addressing inverse problems, including image super-resolution, deblurring, inpainting, etc. However, their application to video inverse problems arising from spatio-temporal degradation remains largely unexplored due to the challenges in training video diffusion models. To address this issue, here we introduce an innovative video inverse solver that leverages only image diffusion models. Specifically, by drawing inspiration from the success of the recent decomposed diffusion sampler (DDS), our method treats the time dimension of a video as the batch dimension of image diffusion models and solves spatio-temporal optimization problems within denoised spatio-temporal batches derived from each image diffusion model. Moreover, we introduce a batch-consistent diffusion sampling strategy that encourages consistency across batches by synchronizing the stochastic noise components in image diffusion models. Our approach synergistically combines batch-consistent sampling with simultaneous optimization of denoised spatio-temporal batches at each reverse diffusion step, resulting in a novel and efficient diffusion sampling strategy for video inverse problems. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively addresses various spatio-temporal degradations in video inverse problems, achieving state-of-the-art reconstructions.

      <title>Training-free Diffusion Model Alignment with Sampling Demons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aligning diffusion models with user preferences has been a key challenge. Existing methods for aligning diffusion models either require retraining or are limited to differentiable reward functions. To address these limitations, we propose a stochastic optimization approach, dubbed Demon, to guide the denoising process at inference time without backpropagation through reward functions or model retraining. Our approach works by controlling noise distribution in denoising steps to concentrate density on regions corresponding to high rewards through stochastic optimization. We provide comprehensive theoretical and empirical evidence to support and validate our approach, including experiments that use non-differentiable sources of rewards such as Visual-Language Model (VLM) APIs and human judgements. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed approach is the first inference-time, backpropagation-free preference alignment method for diffusion models. Our method can be easily integrated with existing diffusion models without further training. Our experiments show that the proposed approach significantly improves the average aesthetics scores for text-to-image generation. Implementation is available at https://github.com/aiiu-lab/DemonSampling.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of Sample-averaged Q-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a key approach for training agents in complex and uncertain environments. Incorporating statistical inference in RL algorithms is essential for understanding and managing uncertainty in model performance. This paper introduces a generalized framework for time-varying batch-averaged Q-learning, termed sample-averaged Q-learning (SA-QL), which extends traditional single-sample Q-learning by aggregating samples of rewards and next states to better account for data variability and uncertainty. We leverage the functional central limit theorem (FCLT) to establish a novel framework that provides insights into the asymptotic normality of the sample-averaged algorithm under mild conditions. Additionally, we develop a random scaling method for interval estimation, enabling the construction of confidence intervals without requiring extra hyperparameters. Extensive numerical experiments across classic stochastic OpenAI Gym environments, including windy gridworld and slippery frozenlake, demonstrate how different batch scheduling strategies affect learning efficiency, coverage rates, and confidence interval widths. This work establishes a unified theoretical foundation for sample-averaged Q-learning, providing insights into effective batch scheduling and statistical inference for RL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Theoretical characterisation of the Gauss-Newton conditioning in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gauss-Newton (GN) matrix plays an important role in machine learning, most evident in its use as a preconditioning matrix for a wide family of popular adaptive methods to speed up optimization. Besides, it can also provide key insights into the optimization landscape of neural networks. In the context of deep neural networks, understanding the GN matrix involves studying the interaction between different weight matrices as well as the dependencies introduced by the data, thus rendering its analysis challenging. In this work, we take a first step towards theoretically characterizing the conditioning of the GN matrix in neural networks. We establish tight bounds on the condition number of the GN in deep linear networks of arbitrary depth and width, which we also extend to two-layer ReLU networks. We expand the analysis to further architectural components, such as residual connections and convolutional layers. Finally, we empirically validate the bounds and uncover valuable insights into the influence of the analyzed architectural components.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Herding: One Active Learning Method for All Label Budgets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most active learning research has focused on methods which perform well when many labels are available, but can be dramatically worse than random selection when label budgets are small. Other methods have focused on the low-budget regime, but do poorly as label budgets increase. As the line between "low" and "high" budgets varies by problem, this is a serious issue in practice. We propose uncertainty coverage, an objective which generalizes a variety of low- and high-budget objectives, as well as natural, hyperparameter-light methods to smoothly interpolate between low- and high-budget regimes. We call greedy optimization of the estimate Uncertainty Herding; this simple method is computationally fast, and we prove that it nearly optimizes the distribution-level coverage. In experimental validation across a variety of active learning tasks, our proposal matches or beats state-of-the-art performance in essentially all cases; it is the only method of which we are aware that reliably works well in both low- and high-budget settings.</description>

      <title>Detection Augmented Bandit Procedures for Piecewise Stationary MABs: A Modular Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms are designed for stationary environments, where the reward distributions associated with the arms do not change with time. In many applications, however, the environment is more accurately modeled as being nonstationary. In this work, piecewise stationary MAB (PS-MAB) environments are investigated, in which the reward distributions associated with a subset of the arms change at some change-points and remain stationary between change-points. Our focus is on the asymptotic analysis of PS-MABs, for which practical algorithms based on change detection (CD) have been previously proposed. Our goal is to modularize the design and analysis of such CD-based Bandit (CDB) procedures. To this end, we identify the requirements for stationary bandit algorithms and change detectors in a CDB procedure that are needed for the modularization. We assume that the rewards are sub-Gaussian. Under this assumption and a condition on the separation of the change-points, we show that the analysis of CDB procedures can indeed be modularized, so that regret bounds can be obtained in a unified manner for various combinations of change detectors and bandit algorithms. Through this analysis, we develop new modular CDB procedures that are order-optimal. We compare the performance of our modular CDB procedures with various other methods in simulations.</description>
