      <title>Heaven &amp; Hell II: Scale Laws and Robustness in One-Step Heaven-Hell Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Heaven-Hell dynamics, a model for network consensus. A known result establishes an exact one-step convergence threshold for systems with a single uniform hub: the per-node inbound hub weight W suffices if and only if W &gt;= maxrest, the maximum non-hub inbound mass. We develop scale laws and operational refinements that make this threshold robust to tie-breaking policies, node-specific tolerances, targeted seeding, multiple hubs, and asynchronous updates. Our contributions include a conservation-law perspective, parameterized tie policies, tighter pointwise bounds improving on classical worst-case guarantees, one-pass fairness for asynchronous updates, and sufficient conditions for seeded convergence. All proofs are mechanized in Coq, with experiments on rings, grids, scale-free graphs, and heterogeneous weighted graphs validating tightness and gap closures</description>

      <title>From Social Division to Cohesion with AI Message Suggestions in Online Chat Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social cohesion is difficult to sustain in societies marked by opinion diversity, particularly in online communication. As large language model (LLM)-driven messaging assistance becomes increasingly embedded in these contexts, it raises critical questions about its societal impact. We present an online experiment with 557 participants who engaged in multi-round discussions on politically controversial topics while freely reconfiguring their discussion groups. In some conditions, participants received real-time message suggestions generated by an LLM, either personalized to the individual or adapted to their group context. We find that subtle shifts in linguistic style during communication, mediated by AI assistance, can scale up to reshape collective structures. While individual-focused assistance leads users to segregate into like-minded groups, relational assistance that incorporates group members' stances enhances cohesion through more receptive exchanges. These findings demonstrate that AI-mediated communication can support social cohesion in diverse groups, but outcomes critically depend on how personalization is designed.</description>

      <title>Cross-Platform Short-Video Diplomacy: Topic and Sentiment Analysis of China-US Relations on Douyin and TikTok</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine discussions surrounding China-U.S. relations on the Chinese and American social media platforms \textit{Douyin} and \textit{TikTok}. Both platforms, owned by \textit{ByteDance}, operate under different regulatory and cultural environments, providing a unique perspective for analyzing China-U.S. public discourse. This study analyzed 4,040 videos and 338,209 user comments to assess the public discussions and sentiments on social media regarding China-U.S. relations. Through topic clustering and sentiment analysis, we identified key themes, including economic strength, technological and industrial interdependence, cultural cognition and value pursuits, and responses to global challenges. There are significant emotional differences between China and the US on various themes. Since April 2022, the Chinese government has implemented a new regulation requiring all social media accounts to disclose their provincial-level geolocation information. Utilizing this publicly available data, along with factors such as GDP per capita, minority index, and internet penetration rate, we investigate the changes in sentiment towards the U.S. in mainland China. This study links socioeconomic indicators with online discussions, deeply analyzing how regional and economic factors influence Chinese comments on their views of the US, providing important insights for China-U.S. relationship research and policy making.</description>

      <title>A Novel Discrete-time Model of Information Diffusion on Social Networks Considering Users Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the SDIR (Susceptible-Delayable-Infected-Recovered) model, an extension of the classical SIR epidemic framework, to provide a more explicit characterization of user behavior in online social networks. The newly merged state D (delayable) represents users who have received the information but delayed its spreading and may eventually choose not to share it at all. Based on the mean-field approximation method, we derive the dynamical equations of the model and investigate its convergence and stability conditions. Under these conditions, we further propose an approximation algorithm for the edge-deletion problem, aiming to minimize the influence of information diffusion by identifying approximate solutions.</description>

      <title>Influence of Network Topology and Vaccination Strategies on HPV Dynamics: A Simulation Study Using the SeCoNet Growth Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines how contact network topology influences the effectiveness of vaccination programs in the context of human papillomavirus (HPV) transmission. Using the SeCoNet sexual contact network growth model, we evaluate age based, ring based, and several centrality based vaccination strategies across the overall, male, and female cohorts, focusing on peak incidence, timing of peak prevalence, and cumulative incidence. The simulations show that degree, betweenness, and percolation centrality based strategies are generally the most effective, while ring vaccination achieves the greatest reduction in cumulative incidence among females. Network topology also plays a critical role: higher average degree reduces vaccination effectiveness, whereas higher power-law exponent, longer average shortest path length, and stronger clustering improve vaccination outcomes. The results highlight the importance of incorporating network structure into the design of HPV vaccination programs.</description>

      <title>Community Search in Attributed Networks using Dominance Relationships and Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community search in attributed networks poses a dual challenge: balancing structural connectivity -- the network's topological properties -- and attribute similarity -- the shared characteristics of nodes. This paper introduces a novel algorithm that integrates hop-based and random-walk-based methods to identify high-quality communities, effectively addressing this balance. Our approach employs the concept of the domination score to quantify the influence of nodes based on their attributes, followed by $k$-core extraction to ensure strong structural cohesion within the communities. By considering both the network structure and node attributes, the algorithm identifies communities that are not only well-connected, but also share meaningful attribute similarities. We evaluated the algorithm on large real-world datasets, demonstrating its ability to efficiently identify cohesive communities, making it suitable for applications such as social network analysis and recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling Political Discourse with Sentence-BERT and BERTopic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media has reshaped political discourse, offering politicians a platform for direct engagement while reinforcing polarization and ideological divides. This study introduces a novel topic evolution framework that integrates BERTopic-based topic modeling with Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) to analyze the longevity and moral dimensions of political topics in Twitter activity during the 117th U.S. Congress. We propose a methodology for tracking dynamic topic shifts over time and measuring their association with moral values and quantifying topic persistence. Our findings reveal that while overarching themes remain stable, granular topics tend to dissolve rapidly, limiting their long-term influence. Moreover, moral foundations play a critical role in topic longevity, with Care and Loyalty dominating durable topics, while partisan differences manifest in distinct moral framing strategies. This work contributes to the field of social network analysis and computational political discourse by offering a scalable, interpretable approach to understanding moral-driven topic evolution on social media.</description>

      <title>Do You Trust the Process?: Modeling Institutional Trust for Community Adoption of Reinforcement Learning Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many governmental bodies are adopting AI policies for decision-making. In particular, Reinforcement Learning has been used to design policies that citizens would be expected to follow if implemented. Much RL work assumes that citizens follow these policies, and evaluate them with this in mind. However, we know from prior work that without institutional trust, citizens will not follow policies put in place by governments. In this work, we develop a trust-aware RL algorithm for resource allocation in communities. We consider the case of humanitarian engineering, where the organization is aiming to distribute some technology or resource to community members. We use a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient approach to learn a resource allocation that fits the needs of the organization. Then, we simulate resource allocation according to the learned policy, and model the changes in institutional trust of community members. We investigate how this incorporation of institutional trust affects outcomes, and ask how effectively an organization can learn policies if trust values are private. We find that incorporating trust into RL algorithms can lead to more successful policies, specifically when the organization's goals are less certain. We find more conservative trust estimates lead to increased fairness and average community trust, though organization success suffers. Finally, we explore a strategy to prevent unfair outcomes to communities. We implement a quota system by an external entity which decreases the organization's utility when it does not serve enough community members. We find this intervention can improve fairness and trust among communities in some cases, while decreasing the success of the organization. This work underscores the importance of institutional trust in algorithm design and implementation, and identifies a tension between organization success and community well-being.</description>

      <title>Larger holes as narrower degree distributions in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the analysis of loops is not so much because of the complications, it has already been found that heuristically enhancing loops decreases the variance of degree distributions for improving the robustness of connectivity. While many real scale-free networks are known to contain shorter loops such as triangles, it remains to investigate the distributions of longer loops in more wide class of networks. We find a relation between narrower degree distributions and longer loops in investigating the lengths of the shortest loops in various networks with continuously changing degree distributions, including three typical types of scale-free networks, classical Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs, and regular networks. In particular, we show that narrower degree distributions contain longer shortest loops, as a universal property in a wide class of random networks. We suggest that the robustness of connectivity is enhanced by constructing long loops of O(log N).</description>

      <title>Grassmanian Interpolation of Low-Pass Graph Filters: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-pass graph filters are fundamental for signal processing on graphs and other non-Euclidean domains. However, the computation of such filters for parametric graph families can be prohibitively expensive as computation of the corresponding low-frequency subspaces, requires the repeated solution of an eigenvalue problem. We suggest a novel algorithm of low-pass graph filter interpolation based on Riemannian interpolation in normal coordinates on the Grassmann manifold. We derive an error bound estimate for the subspace interpolation and suggest two possible applications for induced parametric graph families. First, we argue that the temporal evolution of the node features may be translated to the evolving graph topology via a similarity correction to adjust the homophily degree of the network. Second, we suggest a dot product graph family induced by a given static graph which allows to infer improved message passing scheme for node classification facilitated by the filter interpolation.</description>

      <title>Stronger together? The homophily trap in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While homophily -- the tendency to link with similar others -- may nurture a sense of belonging and shared values, it can also hinder diversity and widen inequalities. Here, we unravel this trade-off analytically, revealing homophily traps for minority groups: scenarios where increased homophilic interaction among minorities negatively affects their structural opportunities within a network. We demonstrate that homophily traps arise when minority size falls below 25% of a network, at which point homophily comes at the expense of lower structural visibility for the minority group. Our work reveals that social groups require a critical size to benefit from homophily without incurring structural costs, providing insights into core processes underlying the emergence of group inequality in networks.</description>

      <title>Opinion Dynamics on Signed Graphs and Graphons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we make use of graphon theory to study opinion dynamics on large undirected networks. The opinion dynamics models that we take into consideration allow for negative interactions between the individuals, whose opinions can thus grow apart. We consider both the repelling and the opposing models of negative interactions, which have been studied in the literature. We define the repelling and the opposing dynamics on signed graphons and we show that their initial value problem solutions exist and are unique. We then show that, in a suitable sense, the graphon dynamics is a good approximation of the dynamics on large graphs that converge to a graphon. This result applies to large random graphs that are sampled according to a graphon (W-random graphs), for which we provide a new convergence result under very general assumptions.</description>

      <title>Measuring Research Interest Similarity with Transition Probabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of paper and author similarity measures based on the concept that papers are more similar if they are more likely to be retrieved during a literature search following backward and forward citations. Since this browsing process resembles a walk in a citation network, we operationalize the concept using the transition probability (TP) of random walkers. The proposed measures are continuous, symmetric, and can be implemented on any citation network. We conduct validation tests of the TP concept and other extant alternatives to gauge which metric can classify papers and predict future co-authors most consistently across different scales of analysis (co-authorships, journals, and disciplines). Our results show that the proposed basic TP measure outperforms alternative metrics such as personalized PageRank and the Node2vec machine-learning technique in classification tasks at various scales. Additionally, we discuss how publication-level data can be leveraged to approximate the research interest similarity of individual scientists. This paper is accompanied by a Python package that implements all the tested metrics.</description>

      <title>An Approximate-Master-Equation Formulation of the Watts Threshold Model on Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In traditional models of behavioral or opinion dynamics on social networks, researchers suppose that all interactions occur between pairs of individuals. However, in reality, social interactions also occur in groups of three or more individuals. A common way to incorporate such polyadic interactions is to study dynamical processes on hypergraphs. In a hypergraph, interactions can occur between any number of the individuals in a network. The Watts threshold model (WTM) is a well-known model of a simplistic social spreading process. Very recently, Chen et al. extended the WTM from dyadic networks (i.e., graphs) to polyadic networks (i.e., hypergraphs). In the present paper, we extend their discrete-time model to continuous time using approximate master equations (AMEs). By using AMEs, we are able to model the system with very high accuracy. We then reduce the high-dimensional AME system to a system of three coupled differential equations without any detectable loss of accuracy. This much lower-dimensional system is more computationally efficient to solve numerically and is also easier to interpret. We linearize the reduced AME system and calculate a cascade condition, which allows us to determine when a large spreading event occurs. We then apply our model to a social contact network of a French primary school and to a hypergraph of computer-science coauthorships. We find that the AME system is accurate in modelling the polyadic WTM on these empirical networks; however, we expect that future work that incorporates structural correlations between nearby nodes and groups into the model for the dynamics will lead to more accurate theory for real-world networks.</description>

      <title>MOSAIC: Modeling Social AI for Content Dissemination and Regulation in Multi-Agent Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel, open-source social network simulation framework, MOSAIC, where generative language agents predict user behaviors such as liking, sharing, and flagging content. This simulation combines LLM agents with a directed social graph to analyze emergent deception behaviors and gain a better understanding of how users determine the veracity of online social content. By constructing user representations from diverse fine-grained personas, our system enables multi-agent simulations that model content dissemination and engagement dynamics at scale. Within this framework, we evaluate three different content moderation strategies with simulated misinformation dissemination, and we find that they not only mitigate the spread of non-factual content but also increase user engagement. In addition, we analyze the trajectories of popular content in our simulations, and explore whether simulation agents' articulated reasoning for their social interactions truly aligns with their collective engagement patterns. We open-source our simulation software to encourage further research within AI and social sciences.</description>

      <title>Larger cities, more commuters, more crime? The role of inter-city commuting in the scaling of urban crime</title>

Abstract: Cities attract a daily influx of non-resident commuters, reflecting their roles within wider urban networks -- not as isolated places. However, it remains unclear how this interconnectivity shapes the way crime scales with population, given that larger cities tend to receive more commuters and experience more crime. In this work, we investigate how inter-city commuting relates to the population--crime relationship. We find that larger cities receive proportionately more commuters, which in turn is associated with higher levels of burglary, drug possession, robbery, shoplifting, and theft. For example, each 1% increase in inbound commuters corresponds to a 0.32% rise in theft and 0.20% rise in burglary, holding population size constant. We demonstrate that models incorporating both population size and commuter inflows explain variation in these offenses better than population-only models. Our findings underscore the importance of considering how cities are connected -- not just their population size -- in disentangling the population--crime relationship.</description>
