      <title>Graph Neural Network-Based Track Finding in the LHCb Vertex Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next decade will see an order of magnitude increase in data collected by high-energy physics experiments, driven by the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The reconstruction of charged particle trajectories (tracks) has always been a critical part of offline data processing pipelines. The complexity of HL-LHC data will however increasingly mandate track finding in all stages of an experiment's real-time processing. This paper presents a GNN-based track-finding pipeline tailored for the Run 3 LHCb experiment's vertex detector and benchmarks its physics performance and computational cost against existing classical algorithms on GPU architectures. A novelty of our work compared to existing GNN tracking pipelines is batched execution, in which the GPU evaluates the pipeline on hundreds of events in parallel. We evaluate the impact of neural-network quantisation on physics and computational performance, and comment on the outlook for GNN tracking algorithms for other parts of the LHCb track-finding pipeline.</description>

      <title>Accurate estimation of the normalized mutual information of multidimensional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the linear Pearson correlation coefficient represents a well-established normalized measure to quantify the interrelation of two stochastic variables $X$ and $Y$, it fails for multidimensional variables such as Cartesian coordinates. Avoiding any assumption about the underlying data, the mutual information $I(X, Y)$ does account for multidimensional correlations. However, unlike the normalized Pearson correlation, it has no upper bound ($I \in [0, \infty)$), i.e., it is not clear if say, $I = 0.4$ corresponds to a low or a high correlation. Moreover, the mutual information (MI) involves the estimation of high-dimensional probability densities (e.g., six-dimensional for Cartesian coordinates), which requires a k-nearest neighbor algorithm, such as the estimator by Kraskov et al. [Phys. Rev. E 69, 066138 (2004)]. As existing methods to normalize the MI cannot be used in connection with this estimator, a new approach is presented, which uses an entropy estimation method that is invariant under variable transformations. The algorithm is numerically efficient and does not require more effort than the calculation of the (un-normalized) MI. After validating the method by applying it to various toy models, the normalized MI between the $C_{\alpha}$ -coordinates of T4 lysozyme is considered and compared to a correlation analysis of inter-residue contacts.</description>
