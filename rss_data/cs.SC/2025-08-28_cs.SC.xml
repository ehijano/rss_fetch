      <title>Refined bit complexity for the computation of at least onepoint per connected component of a smooth completeintersection real algebraic set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We refine the bit complexity analysis of an algorithm for the computation of at least one point per connected component of a smooth real algebraic set, yielding exponential speedup (with respect to the number of variables) compared to prior works. The algorithm which is analyzed is based on the critical point method, reducing the problem to computations of critical points associated to the restriction of generic projections on lines to the studied variety. Our refinement, and the subsequent improved complexity statement, comes from a better utilization of the multi-affine structure of polynomial systems encoding these sets of critical points. The bit-size estimates on the size of the output produced by this algorithm are also improved by this refinement.</description>

      <title>Efficient Neuro-Symbolic Learning of Constraints and Objective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets, there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.
  Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.
  Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact inference gives access to maximum accuracy.
  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.</description>
