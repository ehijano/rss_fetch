      <title>The Formation of Trust in Autonomous Vehicles after Interacting with Robotaxis on Public Roads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how pedestrian trust, receptivity, and behavior evolve during interactions with Level-4 autonomous vehicles (AVs) at uncontrolled urban intersections in a naturalistic setting. While public acceptance is critical for AV adoption, most prior studies relied on simplified simulations or field tests. We conducted a real-world experiment in a commercial Robotaxi operation zone, where 33 participants repeatedly crossed an uncontrolled intersection with frequent Level-4 Robotaxi traffic. Participants completed the Pedestrian Behavior Questionnaire (PBQ), Pedestrian Receptivity Questionnaire for Fully AVs (PRQF), pre- and post-experiment Trust in AVs Scale, and Personal Innovativeness Scale (PIS). Results showed that trust in AVs significantly increased post-experiment, with the increase positively associated with the Interaction component of PRQF. Additionally, both the Positive and Error subscales of the PBQ significantly influenced trust change. This study reveals how trust forms in real-world pedestrian-AV encounters, offering insights beyond lab-based research by accounting for population heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Perceived Weight of Mediated Reality Sticks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mediated reality, where augmented reality (AR) and diminished reality (DR) meet, enables visual modifications to real-world objects. A physical object with a mediated reality visual change retains its original physical properties. However, it is perceived differently from the original when interacted with. We present such a mediated reality object, a stick with different lengths or a stick with a missing portion in the middle, to investigate how users perceive its weight and center of gravity. We conducted two user studies (N=10), each of which consisted of two substudies. We found that the length of mediated reality sticks influences the perceived weight. A longer stick is perceived as lighter, and vice versa. The stick with a missing portion tends to be recognized as one continuous stick. Thus, its weight and center of gravity (COG) remain the same. We formulated the relationship between inertia based on the reported COG and perceived weight in the context of dynamic touch.</description>

      <title>Data Melodification FM: Where Musical Rhetoric Meets Sonification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a design space for data melodification, where standard visualization idioms and fundamental data characteristics map to rhetorical devices of music for a more affective experience of data. Traditional data sonification transforms data into sound by mapping it to different parameters such as pitch, volume, and duration. Often and regrettably, this mapping leaves behind melody, harmony, rhythm and other musical devices that compose the centuries-long persuasive and expressive power of music. What results is the occasional, unintentional sense of tinnitus and horror film-like impending doom caused by a disconnect between the semantics of data and sound. Through this work we ask, can the aestheticization of sonification through (classical) music theory make data simultaneously accessible, meaningful, and pleasing to one's ears?</description>

      <title>Can AI agents understand spoken conversations about data visualizations in online meetings?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short paper, we present work evaluating an AI agent's understanding of spoken conversations about data visualizations in an online meeting scenario. There is growing interest in the development of AI-assistants that support meetings, such as by providing assistance with tasks or summarizing a discussion. The quality of this support depends on a model that understands the conversational dialogue. To evaluate this understanding, we introduce a dual-axis testing framework for diagnosing the AI agent's comprehension of spoken conversations about data. Using this framework, we designed a series of tests to evaluate understanding of a novel corpus of 72 spoken conversational dialogues about data visualizations. We examine diverse pipelines and model architectures, LLM vs VLM, and diverse input formats for visualizations (the chart image, its underlying source code, or a hybrid of both) to see how this affects model performance on our tests. Using our evaluation methods, we found that text-only input modalities achieved the best performance (96%) in understanding discussions of visualizations in online meetings.</description>

      <title>Visualization Was Here: Reorienting Research When Visualizations Fade into the Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visualization research often centers on how visual representations generate insight, guide interpretation, or support decision-making. But in many real-world domains, visualizations do not stand out--they recede into the background, stabilized and trusted as part of the everyday infrastructure of work. This paper explores what it means to take such quiet roles seriously. Drawing on theoretical traditions from joint cognitive systems, naturalistic decision making, and infrastructure studies, I examine how visualization can become embedded in the rhythms of expert practice--less a site of intervention than a scaffold for attention, coordination, and judgment. I illustrate this reorientation with examples from mission control operations at NASA, where visualizations are deeply integrated but rarely interrogated. Rather than treat invisibility as a failure of design or innovation, I argue that visualization's infrastructural presence demands new concepts, methods, and critical sensibilities. The goal is not to diminish visualization's importance, but to broaden the field's theoretical repertoire--to recognize and support visualization-in-use even when it fades from view.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Synchrony-Stability Frontier in Adaptive Chatbots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive chatbots that mimic a user's linguistic style can build rapport and engagement, yet unconstrained mimicry risks an agent that feels unstable or sycophantic. We present a computational evaluation framework that makes the core design tension explicit: balancing moment-to-moment linguistic synchrony against long-term persona stability. Using an 8-dimensional style vector and a closed-loop "base+delta" prompting architecture, we simulate and compare explicit adaptation policies - Uncapped, Cap, Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Dead-Band, and Hybrids - on a human-log dataset. Our analysis maps a clear Pareto frontier: bounded policies achieve substantial gains in stability at a modest cost to synchrony. For example, a Hybrid (EMA+Cap) raises stability from 0.542 to 0.878 (+62%) while reducing synchrony by only 17%. We confirm this trade-off through large-scale replications on three public corpora (DailyDialog, Persona-Chat, EmpatheticDialogues) and LLM-in-the-loop validation across two model families. Furthermore, we quantify "prompt legibility," showing that frontier policies reduce instruction churn and cut jarring register flips (major tone changes) from 0.254 to 0.092, yielding systems that are easier to reason about and maintain. Taken together, our framework provides a general evaluation harness for style adaptation; a systematic ablation that identifies Pareto-efficient policies; robust validation across diverse datasets and models; and novel legibility metrics linking policy choices to system maintainability.</description>

      <title>The Feng Shui of Visualization: Design the Path to SUCCESS and GOOD FORTUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superstition and religious belief system have historically shaped human behavior, offering powerful psychological motivations and persuasive frameworks to guide actions. Inspired by Feng Shui -- an ancient Chinese superstition -- this paper proposes a pseudo-theoretical framework that integrates superstition-like heuristics into visualization design. Rather than seeking empirical truth, this framework leverages culturally resonant (superstitious) narratives and symbolic metaphors as persuasive tools to encourage desirable design practices, such as clarity, accessibility, and audience-centered thinking. We articulate a set of visualization designs into a Feng Shui compass, reframing empirical design principles and guidelines within an engaing mythology. We present how visualization design principles can be intepreted in Feng Shui narratives, discussing the potential of these metaphorical principles in reducing designer anxiety, fostering community norms, and enhancing the memorability and internalization of visualization design guidelines. Finally, we discuss Feng Shui visualization theory as a set of cognitive shortcuts that can exert persuasive power through playful, belief-like activities.</description>

      <title>Attribution Gradients: Incrementally Unfolding Citations for Critical Examination of Attributed AI Answers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI question answering systems increasingly generate responses with attributions to sources. However, the task of verifying the actual content of these attributions is in most cases impractical. In this paper, we present attribution gradients as a solution. Attribution gradients provide integrated, incremental affordances for diving into an attributed passage. A user can decompose a sentence of an answer into its claims. For each claim, the user can view supporting and contradictory excerpts mined from sources. Those excerpts serve as clickable conduits into the source (in our application, scientific papers). When evidence itself contains more citations, the UI unpacks the evidence into excerpts from the cited sources. These features of attribution gradients facilitate concurrent interconnections among answer, claim, excerpt, and context. In a usability study, we observed greater engagement with sources and richer revision in a task where participants revised an attributed AI answer with attribution gradients and a baseline.</description>

      <title>Investigating Encoding and Perspective for Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) offers promising opportunities to support movement-based activities, such as personal training or physical therapy, with real-time, spatially-situated visual cues. While many approaches leverage AR to guide motion, existing design guidelines focus on simple, upper-body movements within the user's field of view. We lack evidence-based design recommendations for guiding more diverse scenarios involving movements with varying levels of visibility and direction. We conducted an experiment to investigate how different visual encodings and perspectives affect motion guidance performance and usability, using three exercises that varied in visibility and planes of motion. Our findings reveal significant differences in preference and performance across designs. Notably, the best perspective varied depending on motion visibility and showing more information about the overall motion did not necessarily improve motion execution. We provide empirically-grounded guidelines for designing immersive, interactive visualizations for motion guidance to support more effective AR systems.</description>

      <title>RELATE-Sim: Leveraging Turning Point Theory and LLM Agents to Predict and Understand Long-Term Relationship Dynamics through Interactive Narrative Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most dating technologies optimize for getting together, not staying together. We present RELATE-Sim, a theory-grounded simulator that models how couples behave at consequential turning points-exclusivity talks, conflict-and-repair episodes, relocations-rather than static traits. Two persona-aligned LLM agents (one per partner) interact under a centralized Scene Master that frames each turning point as a compact set of realistic options, advances the narrative, and infers interpretable state changes and an auditable commitment estimate after each scene. On a longitudinal dataset of 71 couples with two-year follow-ups, simulation-aware predictions outperform a personas-only baseline while surfacing actionable markers (e.g., repair attempts acknowledged, clarity shifts) that explain why trajectories diverge. RELATE-Sim pushes the relationship research's focus from matchmaking to maintenance, providing a transparent, extensible platform for understanding and forecasting long-term relationship dynamics.</description>

      <title>Face2Feel: Emotion-Aware Adaptive User Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Face2Feel, a novel user interface (UI) model that dynamically adapts to user emotions and preferences captured through computer vision. This adaptive UI framework addresses the limitations of traditional static interfaces by integrating digital image processing, face recognition, and emotion detection techniques. Face2Feel analyzes user expressions utilizing a webcam or pre-installed camera as the primary data source to personalize the UI in real-time. Although dynamically changing user interfaces based on emotional states are not yet widely implemented, their advantages and the demand for such systems are evident. This research contributes to the development of emotion-aware applications, particularly in recommendation systems and feedback mechanisms. A case study, "Shresta: Emotion-Based Book Recommendation System," demonstrates the practical implementation of this framework, the technologies employed, and the system's usefulness. Furthermore, a user survey conducted after presenting the working model reveals a strong demand for such adaptive interfaces, emphasizing the importance of user satisfaction and comfort in human-computer interaction. The results showed that nearly 85.7\% of the users found these systems to be very engaging and user-friendly. This study underscores the potential for emotion-driven UI adaptation to improve user experiences across various applications.</description>

      <title>PromptPilot: Improving Human-AI Collaboration Through LLM-Enhanced Prompt Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective prompt engineering is critical to realizing the promised productivity gains of large language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive tasks. Yet, many users struggle to craft prompts that yield high-quality outputs, limiting the practical benefits of LLMs. Existing approaches, such as prompt handbooks or automated optimization pipelines, either require substantial effort, expert knowledge, or lack interactive guidance. To address this gap, we design and evaluate PromptPilot, an interactive prompting assistant grounded in four empirically derived design objectives for LLM-enhanced prompt engineering. We conducted a randomized controlled experiment with 80 participants completing three realistic, work-related writing tasks. Participants supported by PromptPilot achieved significantly higher performance (median: 78.3 vs. 61.7; p = .045, d = 0.56), and reported enhanced efficiency, ease-of-use, and autonomy during interaction. These findings empirically validate the effectiveness of our proposed design objectives, establishing LLM-enhanced prompt engineering as a viable technique for improving human-AI collaboration.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Wine Tasting for Chinese Consumers: A Service Design Approach Enhanced by Multimodal Personalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wine tasting is a multimodal and culturally embedded activity that presents unique challenges when adapted to non-Western contexts. This paper proposes a service design approach rooted in contextual co-creation to reimagine wine tasting experiences for Chinese consumers. Drawing on 26 in-situ interviews and follow-up validation sessions, we identify three distinct user archetypes: Curious Tasters, Experience Seekers, and Knowledge Builders, each exhibiting different needs in vocabulary, interaction, and emotional pacing. Our findings reveal that traditional wine descriptors lack cultural resonance and that cross-modal metaphors grounded in local gastronomy (e.g., green mango for acidity) significantly improve cognitive and emotional engagement. These insights informed a partially implemented prototype, featuring AI-driven metaphor-to-flavour mappings and real-time affective feedback visualisation. A small-scale usability evaluation confirmed improvements in engagement and comprehension. Our comparative analysis shows alignment with and differentiation from prior multimodal and affect-aware tasting systems. This research contributes to CBMI by demonstrating how culturally adaptive interaction systems can enhance embodied consumption experiences in physical tourism and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the design of inclusive wine-tasting experiences by examining the roles of human diversity and personal food memory. Through field studies conducted in various wine regions, we explored how Chinese visitors engage with wine-tasting activities during winery tours, highlighting the cross-cultural challenges they face. Our findings underscore the importance of experiencers' abilities, necessities, and aspirations (ANAs), the authenticity of wine tasting within the context of winery tours, and the use of personal food memories as a wine-tasting tool accessible to all. These insights lay the groundwork for developing more inclusive and engaging wine-tasting services, offering new perspectives for cultural exchange and sustainable wine business practices in China.</description>

      <title>Datasets for Valence and Arousal Inference: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding human affect can be used in robotics, marketing, education, human-computer interaction, healthcare, entertainment, autonomous driving, and psychology to enhance decision-making, personalize experiences, and improve emotional well-being. This work presents a comprehensive overview of affect inference datasets that utilize continuous valence and arousal labels. We reviewed 25 datasets published between 2008 and 2024, examining key factors such as dataset size, subject distribution, sensor configurations, annotation scales, and data formats for valence and arousal values. While camera-based datasets dominate the field, we also identified several widely used multimodal combinations. Additionally, we explored the most common approaches to affect detection applied to these datasets, providing insights into the prevailing methodologies in the field. Our overview of sensor fusion approaches shows promising advancements in model improvement for valence and arousal inference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) introduces sensory perturbations that may impact perception and action. The current study was designed to investigate how immersive VR presented through a head-mounted display (HMD) affects perceived functional body size using a passable aperture paradigm. Participants (n=60) performed an action task (sidle through apertures) and a perception task (adjust aperture width until passable without contact) in both physical, unmediated reality (UR) and VR. Results revealed significantly higher action and perceptual thresholds in VR compared to UR. Affordance ratios (perceptual threshold over action threshold) were also higher in VR, indicating that the increase in perceptual thresholds in VR was driven partly by sensorimotor uncertainty, as reflected in the increase in the action thresholds, and partly by perceptual distortions imposed by VR. This perceptual overestimation in VR also persisted as an aftereffect in UR following VR exposure. Geometrical modelling attributed the disproportionate increase in the perceptual threshold in VR primarily to depth compression. This compression, stemming from the vergence-accommodation conflict (VAC), caused the virtual aperture to be perceived as narrower than depicted, thus requiring a wider adjusted aperture. Critically, after mathematically correcting for the VAC's impact on perceived aperture width, the affordance ratios in VR became equivalent to those in UR. These outcomes demonstrate a recovered invariant geometrical scaling, suggesting that perception remained functionally attuned to action capabilities once VAC-induced distortions were accounted for. These findings highlight that VR-induced depth compression systematically alters perceived body-environment relationships, leading to an altered sense of one's functional body size.</description>

      <title>"We are not Future-ready": Understanding AI Privacy Risks and Existing Mitigation Strategies from the Perspective of AI Developers in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of AI has sparked privacy concerns related to training data, model interfaces, downstream applications, and more. We interviewed 25 AI developers based in Europe to understand which privacy threats they believe pose the greatest risk to users, developers, and businesses and what protective strategies, if any, would help to mitigate them. We find that there is little consensus among AI developers on the relative ranking of privacy risks. These differences stem from salient reasoning patterns that often relate to human rather than purely technical factors. Furthermore, while AI developers are aware of proposed mitigation strategies for addressing these risks, they reported minimal real-world adoption. Our findings highlight both gaps and opportunities for empowering AI developers to better address privacy risks in AI.</description>

      <title>Social Photo-Elicitation: The Use of Communal Production of Meaning to Hear a Vulnerable Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on an initial ethnographic exploration of the situation of sex-trafficking survivors in Nepal. In the course of studying trafficking survivors in a protected-living situation created by a non-governmental organization in Nepal, we adapted photo-elicitation to hear the voices of the survivors by making the technique more communal. Bringing sociality to the forefront of the method reduced the pressure on survivors to assert voices as individuals, allowing them to speak. We make three contributions to research. First, we propose a communal form of photo-elicitation as a method to elicit values in sensitive settings. Second, we present the complex circumstances of the survivors as they undergo rehabilitation and move towards life with a ``new normal''. Third, our work adds to HCI and CSCW literature on understanding specific concerns of trafficking survivors and aims to inform designs that can support reintegration of survivors in society. The values that the survivors hold and their notion of future opportunities suggest possession of limited but important social capital in some domains that could be leveraged to aid reintegration.</description>

      <title>Intelligent 5S Audit: Application of Artificial Intelligence for Continuous Improvement in the Automotive Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of the 5S methodology with the support of artificial intelligence techniques represents a significant opportunity to improve industrial organization audits in the automotive chain, making them more objective, efficient and aligned with Industry 4.0 standards. This work developed an automated 5S audit system based on large-scale language models (LLM), capable of assessing the five senses (Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu, Shitsuke) in a standardized way through intelligent image analysis. The system's reliability was validated using Cohen's concordance coefficient (kappa = 0.75), showing strong alignment between the automated assessments and the corresponding human audits. The results indicate that the proposed solution contributes significantly to continuous improvement in automotive manufacturing environments, speeding up the audit process by 50% of the traditional time and maintaining the consistency of the assessments, with a 99.8% reduction in operating costs compared to traditional manual audits. The methodology presented establishes a new paradigm for integrating lean systems with emerging AI technologies, offering scalability for implementation in automotive plants of different sizes.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Bayesian Active Machine Learning of Working Memory Task Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While adaptive experimental design has outgrown one-dimensional, staircase-based adaptations, most cognitive experiments still control a single factor and summarize performance with a scalar. We show a validation of a Bayesian, two-axis, active-classification approach, carried out in an immersive virtual testing environment for a 5-by-5 working-memory reconstruction task. Two variables are controlled: spatial load L (number of occupied tiles) and feature-binding load K (number of distinct colors) of items. Stimulus acquisition is guided by posterior uncertainty of a nonparametric Gaussian Process (GP) probabilistic classifier, which outputs a surface over (L, K) rather than a single threshold or max span value. In a young adult population, we compare GP-driven Adaptive Mode (AM) with a traditional adaptive staircase Classic Mode (CM), which varies L only at K = 3. Parity between the methods is achieved for this cohort, with an intraclass coefficient of 0.755 at K = 3. Additionally, AM reveals individual differences in interactions between spatial load and feature binding. AM estimates converge more quickly than other sampling strategies, demonstrating that only about 30 samples are required for accurate fitting of the full model.</description>

      <title>Make a Video Call with LLM: A Measurement Campaign over Five Mainstream Apps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2025, Large Language Model (LLM) services have launched a new feature -- AI video chat -- allowing users to interact with AI agents via real-time video communication (RTC), just like chatting with real people. Despite its significance, no systematic study has characterized the performance of existing AI video chat systems. To address this gap, this paper proposes a comprehensive benchmark with carefully designed metrics across four dimensions: quality, latency, internal mechanisms, and system overhead. Using custom testbeds, we further evaluate five mainstream AI video chatbots with this benchmark. This work provides the research community a baseline of real-world performance and identifies unique system bottlenecks. In the meantime, our benchmarking results also open up several research questions for future optimizations of AI video chatbots.</description>

      <title>Data Quality Challenges in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organizations increasingly adopt Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance Large Language Models with enterprise-specific knowledge. However, current data quality (DQ) frameworks have been primarily developed for static datasets, and only inadequately address the dynamic, multi-stage nature of RAG systems. This study aims to develop DQ dimensions for this new type of AI-based systems. We conduct 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of leading IT service companies. Through a qualitative content analysis, we inductively derive 15 distinct DQ dimensions across the four processing stages of RAG systems: data extraction, data transformation, prompt &amp; search, and generation. Our findings reveal that (1) new dimensions have to be added to traditional DQ frameworks to also cover RAG contexts; (2) these new dimensions are concentrated in early RAG steps, suggesting the need for front-loaded quality management strategies, and (3) DQ issues transform and propagate through the RAG pipeline, necessitating a dynamic, step-aware approach to quality management.</description>

      <title>AI Where It Matters: Where, Why, and How Developers Want AI Support in Daily Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping software work, yet we lack clear guidance on where developers most need and want support, and how to design it responsibly. We report a large-scale, mixed-methods study of N=860 developers that examines where, why, and how they seek or limit AI help, providing the first task-aware, empirically validated mapping from developers' perceptions of their tasks to AI adoption patterns and responsible AI priorities. Using cognitive appraisal theory, we show that task evaluations predict openness to and use of AI, revealing distinct patterns: strong current use and a desire for improvement in core work (e.g., coding, testing); high demand to reduce toil (e.g., documentation, operations); and clear limits for identity- and relationship-centric work (e.g., mentoring). Priorities for responsible AI support vary by context: reliability and security for systems-facing tasks; transparency, alignment, and steerability to maintain control; and fairness and inclusiveness for human-facing work. Our results offer concrete, contextual guidance for delivering AI where it matters to developers and their work.</description>

      <title>A Visual Diagnostics Framework for District Heating Data: Enhancing Data Quality for AI-Driven Heat Consumption Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality data is a prerequisite for training reliable Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in the energy domain. In district heating networks, sensor and metering data often suffer from noise, missing values, and temporal inconsistencies, which can significantly degrade model performance. This paper presents a systematic approach for evaluating and improving data quality using visual diagnostics, implemented through an interactive web-based dashboard. The dashboard employs Python-based visualization techniques, including time series plots, heatmaps, box plots, histograms, correlation matrices, and anomaly-sensitive KPIs such as skewness and anomaly detection based on the modified z-scores. These tools al-low human experts to inspect and interpret data anomalies, enabling a human-in-the-loop strategy for data quality assessment. The methodology is demonstrated on a real-world dataset from a Danish district heating provider, covering over four years of hourly data from nearly 7000 meters. The findings show how visual analytics can uncover systemic data issues and, in the future, guide data cleaning strategies that enhance the accuracy, stability, and generalizability of Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit models for heat demand forecasting. The study contributes to a scalable, generalizable framework for visual data inspection and underlines the critical role of data quality in AI-driven energy management systems.</description>

      <title>A Technique Based on Trade-off Maps to Visualise and Analyse Relationships Between Objectives in Optimisation Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the relationships between objectives in a multiobjective optimisation problem is important for developing tailored and efficient solving techniques. In particular, when tackling combinatorial optimisation problems with many objectives, that arise in real-world logistic scenarios, better support for the decision maker can be achieved through better understanding of the often complex fitness landscape. This paper makes a contribution in this direction by presenting a technique that allows a visualisation and analysis of the local and global relationships between objectives in optimisation problems with many objectives. The proposed technique uses four steps: First, the global pairwise relationships are analysed using the Kendall correlation method; then, the ranges of the values found on the given Pareto front are estimated and assessed; next, these ranges are used to plot a map using Gray code, similar to Karnaugh maps, that has the ability to highlight the trade-offs between multiple objectives; and finally, local relationships are identified using scatter plots. Experiments are presented for three combinatorial optimisation problems: multiobjective multidimensional knapsack problem, multiobjective nurse scheduling problem, and multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time windows . Results show that the proposed technique helps in the gaining of insights into the problem difficulty arising from the relationships between objectives.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Quantum Circuits: State Vector Difference Highlighting and the Half-Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing graphical user interfaces for circuit simulators often show small visual summaries of the reduced state of each qubit, showing the probability, phase, purity, and/or Bloch sphere coordinates associated with each qubit. These necessarily provide an incomplete picture of the quantum state of the qubits, and can sometimes be confusing for students or newcomers to quantum computing. We contribute two novel visual approaches to provide more complete information about small circuits. First, to complement information about each qubit, we show the complete state vector, and illustrate the way that amplitudes change from layer-to-layer under the effect of different gates, by using a small set of colors, arrows, and symbols. We call this ``state vector difference highlighting'', and show how it elucidates the effect of Hadamard, X, Y, Z, S, T, Phase, and SWAP gates, where each gate may have an arbitrary combination of control and anticontrol qubits. Second, we display pairwise information about qubits (such as concurrence and correlation) in a triangular ``half-matrix'' visualization. Our open source software implementation, called MuqcsCraft, is available as a live online demonstration that runs in a web browser without installing any additional software, allowing a user to define a circuit through drag-and-drop actions, and then simulate and visualize it.</description>

      <title>Intuitions of Machine Learning Researchers about Transfer Learning for Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning is crucial for medical imaging, yet the selection of source datasets - which can impact the generalizability of algorithms, and thus patient outcomes - often relies on researchers' intuition rather than systematic principles. This study investigates these decisions through a task-based survey with machine learning practitioners. Unlike prior work that benchmarks models and experimental setups, we take a human-centered HCI perspective on how practitioners select source datasets. Our findings indicate that choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset properties, and computational (data embedding), or perceived visual or semantic similarity. However, similarity ratings and expected performance are not always aligned, challenging a traditional "more similar is better" view. Participants often used ambiguous terminology, which suggests a need for clearer definitions and HCI tools to make them explicit and usable. By clarifying these heuristics, this work provides practical insights for more systematic source selection in transfer learning.</description>

Abstract: The study of art evolution has provided valuable insights into societal change, often revealing long-term patterns of simplification and transformation. Album covers represent a distinctive yet understudied form of visual art that has both shaped and been shaped by cultural, technological, and commercial dynamics over the past century. As highly visible artifacts at the intersection of art and commerce, they offer a unique lens through which to study cultural evolution. In this work, we examine the visual complexity of album covers spanning 75 years and 11 popular musical genres. Using a diverse set of computational measures that capture multiple dimensions of visual complexity, our analysis reveals a broad shift toward minimalism across most genres, with notable exceptions that highlight the heterogeneity of aesthetic trends. At the same time, we observe growing variance over time, with many covers continuing to display high levels of abstraction and intricacy. Together, these findings position album covers as a rich, quantifiable archive of cultural history and underscore the value of computational approaches in the systematic study of the arts, bridging quantitative analysis with aesthetic and cultural inquiry.</description>

      <title>Social Welfare Function Leaderboard: When LLM Agents Allocate Social Welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly entrusted with high-stakes decisions that affect human welfare. However, the principles and values that guide these models when distributing scarce societal resources remain largely unexamined. To address this, we introduce the Social Welfare Function (SWF) Benchmark, a dynamic simulation environment where an LLM acts as a sovereign allocator, distributing tasks to a heterogeneous community of recipients. The benchmark is designed to create a persistent trade-off between maximizing collective efficiency (measured by Return on Investment) and ensuring distributive fairness (measured by the Gini coefficient). We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art LLMs and present the first leaderboard for social welfare allocation. Our findings reveal three key insights: (i) A model's general conversational ability, as measured by popular leaderboards, is a poor predictor of its allocation skill. (ii) Most LLMs exhibit a strong default utilitarian orientation, prioritizing group productivity at the expense of severe inequality. (iii) Allocation strategies are highly vulnerable, easily perturbed by output-length constraints and social-influence framing. These results highlight the risks of deploying current LLMs as societal decision-makers and underscore the need for specialized benchmarks and targeted alignment for AI governance.</description>

      <title>Code2Video: A Code-centric Paradigm for Educational Video Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions, limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g., code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency; and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced, discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos. Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable, interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials.

      <title>DISCOVER: Data-driven Identification of Sub-activities via Clustering and Visualization for Enhanced Activity Recognition in Smart Homes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using ambient sensors has great potential for practical applications, particularly in elder care and independent living. However, deploying HAR systems in real-world settings remains challenging due to the high cost of labeled data, the need for pre-segmented sensor streams, and the lack of flexibility in activity granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce DISCOVER, a method designed to discover fine-grained human sub-activities from unlabeled sensor data without relying on pre-segmentation. DISCOVER combines unsupervised feature extraction and clustering with a user-friendly visualization tool to streamline the labeling process. DISCOVER enables domain experts to efficiently annotate only a minimal set of representative cluster centroids, reducing the annotation workload to a small number of samples (0.05% of our dataset). We demonstrate DISCOVER's effectiveness through a re-annotation exercise on widely used HAR datasets, showing that it uncovers finer-grained activities and produces more nuanced annotations than traditional coarse labels. DISCOVER represents a step toward practical, deployable HAR systems that adapt to diverse real environments.</description>

      <title>Stop Misusing t-SNE and UMAP for Visual Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Misuses of t-SNE and UMAP in visual analytics have become increasingly common. For example, although t-SNE and UMAP projections often do not faithfully reflect the original distances between clusters, practitioners frequently use them to investigate inter-cluster relationships. We investigate why this misuse occurs, and discuss methods to prevent it. To that end, we first review 136 papers to verify the prevalence of the misuse. We then interview researchers who have used dimensionality reduction (DR) to understand why such misuse occurs. Finally, we interview DR experts to examine why previous efforts failed to address the misuse. We find that the misuse of t-SNE and UMAP stems primarily from limited DR literacy among practitioners, and that existing attempts to address this issue have been ineffective. Based on these insights, we discuss potential paths forward, including the controversial but pragmatic option of automating the selection of optimal DR projections to prevent misleading analyses.</description>

      <title>Designing Psychometric Bias Measures for ChatBots: An Application to Racial Bias Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the form of large language models (LLMs) or chatbots, has become increasingly integrated into our daily lives. In the past five years, several LLMs have been introduced, including ChatGPT by OpenAI, Claude by Anthropic, and Llama by Meta, among others. These models have the potential to be employed across a wide range of human-machine interaction applications, such as chatbots for information retrieval, assistance in corporate hiring decisions, college admissions, financial loan approvals, parole determinations, and even in medical fields like psychotherapy delivered through chatbots. The key question is whether these chatbots will interact with humans in a bias-free manner or if they will further reinforce the existing pathological biases present in human-to-human interactions. If the latter is true, then how can we rigorously measure these biases?
  We address this challenge by introducing STAMP-LLM (Standardized Test and Assessment Measurement Protocol for LLMs), a psychometric-based principled two-phase framework for designing psychometric measures to evaluate chatbot biases: (i) a Definitional phase for construct mapping, item development, and expert review; and (ii) a Data/Analysis phase for protocol control (prompts/decoding), automated sampling, pre-specified scoring, and basic reliability/validity checks. We illustrate STAMP-LLM on racial bias using one explicit and two implicit measures.</description>

      <title>Confirmation Bias as a Cognitive Resource in LLM-Supported Deliberation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in group decision-making, but their influence risks fostering conformity and reducing epistemic vigilance. Drawing on the Argumentative Theory of Reasoning, we argue that confirmation bias, often seen as detrimental, can be harnessed as a resource when paired with critical evaluation. We propose a three-step process in which individuals first generate ideas independently, then use LLMs to refine and articulate them, and finally engage with LLMs as epistemic provocateurs to anticipate group critique. This framing positions LLMs as tools for scaffolding disagreement, helping individuals prepare for more productive group discussions.</description>

      <title>"Having Lunch Now": Understanding How Users Engage with a Proactive Agent for Daily Planning and Self-Reflection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conversational agents have been studied as tools to scaffold planning and self-reflection for productivity and well-being. While prior work has demonstrated positive outcomes, we still lack a clear understanding of what drives these results and how users behave and communicate with agents that act as coaches rather than assistants. Such understanding is critical for designing interactions in which agents foster meaningful behavioral change. We conducted a 14-day longitudinal study with 12 participants using a proactive agent that initiated regular check-ins to support daily planning and reflection. Our findings reveal diverse interaction patterns: participants accepted or negotiated suggestions, developed shared mental models, reported progress, and at times resisted or disengaged. We also identified problematic aspects of the agent's behavior, including rigidity, premature turn-taking, and overpromising. Our work contributes to understanding how people interact with a proactive, coach-like agent and offers design considerations for facilitating effective behavioral change.</description>

      <title>Grounded GUI Understanding for Vision-Based Spatial Intelligent Agent: Exemplified by Extended Reality Apps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10811v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, spatial computing a.k.a. Extended Reality (XR) has emerged as a transformative technology, offering users immersive and interactive experiences across diversified virtual environments. Users can interact with XR apps through interactable GUI elements (IGEs) on the stereoscopic three-dimensional (3D) graphical user interface (GUI). The accurate recognition of these IGEs is instrumental, serving as the foundation of many software engineering tasks, including automated testing and effective GUI search. The most recent IGE detection approaches for 2D mobile apps typically train a supervised object detection model based on a large-scale manually-labeled GUI dataset, usually with a pre-defined set of clickable GUI element categories like buttons and spinners. Such approaches can hardly be applied to IGE detection in XR apps, due to a multitude of challenges including complexities posed by open-vocabulary and heterogeneous IGE categories, intricacies of context-sensitive interactability, and the necessities of precise spatial perception and visual-semantic alignment for accurate IGE detection results. Thus, it is necessary to embark on the IGE research tailored to XR apps. In this paper, we propose the first zero-shot cOntext-sensitive inteRactable GUI ElemeNT dEtection framework for virtual Reality apps, named Orienter. By imitating human behaviors, Orienter observes and understands the semantic contexts of XR app scenes first, before performing the detection. The detection process is iterated within a feedback-directed validation and reflection loop. Specifically, Orienter contains three components, including (1) Semantic context comprehension, (2) Reflection-directed IGE candidate detection, and (3) Context-sensitive interactability classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Orienter is more effective than the state-of-the-art GUI element detection approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Extended Reality (XR, encompassing AR, MR, and VR) and spatial computing technologies forms a foundational layer for the emerging Metaverse, enabling innovative applications across healthcare, education, manufacturing, and entertainment. However, research in this area is often limited by the lack of large, representative, and highquality application datasets that can support empirical studies and the development of new approaches benefiting XR software processes. In this paper, we introduce XRZoo, a comprehensive and curated dataset of XR applications designed to bridge this gap. XRZoo contains 12,528 free XR applications, spanning nine app stores, across all XR techniques (i.e., AR, MR, and VR) and use cases, with detailed metadata on key aspects such as application descriptions, application categories, release dates, user review numbers, and hardware specifications, etc. By making XRZoo publicly available, we aim to foster reproducible XR software engineering and security research, enable cross-disciplinary investigations, and also support the development of advanced XR systems by providing examples to developers. Our dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in improving the scalability, usability, and effectiveness of XR applications. XRZoo will be released and actively maintained.</description>

      <title>OmniThink: Expanding Knowledge Boundaries in Machine Writing through Thinking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09751v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine writing with large language models often relies on retrieval-augmented generation. However, these approaches remain confined within the boundaries of the model's predefined scope, limiting the generation of content with rich information. Specifically, vanilla-retrieved information tends to lack depth, novelty, and suffers from redundancy, which negatively impacts the quality of generated articles, leading to shallow, unoriginal, and repetitive outputs. To address these issues, we propose OmniThink, a slow-thinking machine writing framework that emulates the human-like process of iterative expansion and reflection. The core idea behind OmniThink is to simulate the cognitive behavior of learners as they slowly deepen their knowledge of the topics. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniThink improves the knowledge density of generated articles without compromising metrics such as coherence and depth. Human evaluations and expert feedback further highlight the potential of OmniThink to address real-world challenges in the generation of long-form articles. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/OmniThink.</description>

      <title>GUI-R1 : A Generalist R1-Style Vision-Language Action Model For GUI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10458v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing efforts in building Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents largely rely on the training paradigm of supervised fine-tuning on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, this approach not only demands extensive amounts of training data but also struggles to effectively understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces. The issue significantly limits its application in real-world scenarios, especially for high-level tasks. Inspired by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) in large reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), which efficiently enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models in real-world settings, we propose \name, the first reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the GUI capabilities of LVLMs in high-level real-world task scenarios, through unified action space rule modeling. By leveraging a small amount of carefully curated high-quality data across multiple platforms (including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and Web) and employing policy optimization algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update the model, \name achieves superior performance using only 0.02\% of the data (3K vs. 13M) compared to previous state-of-the-art methods like OS-Atlas across eight benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web). These results demonstrate the immense potential of reinforcement learning based on unified action space rule modeling in improving the execution capabilities of LVLMs for real-world GUI agent tasks.</description>

      <title>From latent factors to language: a user study on LLM-generated explanations for an inherently interpretable matrix-based recommender system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can generate effective, user-facing explanations from a mathematically interpretable recommendation model. The model is based on constrained matrix factorization, where user types are explicitly represented and predicted item scores share the same scale as observed ratings, making the model's internal representations and predicted scores directly interpretable. This structure is translated into natural language explanations using carefully designed LLM prompts. Many works in explainable AI rely on automatic evaluation metrics, which often fail to capture users' actual needs and perceptions. In contrast, we adopt a user-centered approach: we conduct a study with 326 participants who assessed the quality of the explanations across five key dimensions-transparency, effectiveness, persuasion, trust, and satisfaction-as well as the recommendations themselves. To evaluate how different explanation strategies are perceived, we generate multiple explanation types from the same underlying model, varying the input information provided to the LLM. Our analysis reveals that all explanation types are generally well received, with moderate statistical differences between strategies. User comments further underscore how participants react to each type of explanation, offering complementary insights beyond the quantitative results.</description>

      <title>Interactive Recommendation Agent with Active User Commands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback mechanisms that limit users to simple choices such as like and dislike. However, these coarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and intentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific item attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in inaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a persistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately undermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness.
  To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation Feed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within mainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users to passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control over recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support this paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly policy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ simulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and long-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both user satisfaction and business outcomes.</description>

      <title>Editing Physiological Signals in Videos Using Latent Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Camera-based physiological signal estimation provides a non-contact and convenient means to monitor Heart Rate (HR). However, the presence of vital signals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can reveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional states of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First, we encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational Autoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen text encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the degradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate physiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show that our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and SSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation error of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator. Our design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as anonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos with desired vital signs.</description>
