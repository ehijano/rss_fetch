      <title>Freeze-in leptogenesis without the need for right-handed neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimentally testable leptogenesis mechanism based on the standard type-I seesaw model that successfully operates at right-handed-neutrino (RHN) masses around the GeV scale. The mechanism takes place in a cosmological background with an asymmetry between right-handed electrons and left-handed positrons generated at high temperatures, and does not require oscillations between RHNs or any CP violation in the RHN sector. In contrast to standard leptogenesis via freeze-in, our mechanism works even in the presence of a single RHN around the GeV scale. The mechanism is illustrated for the minimal type-I seesaw with two RHNs, where we show that successful baryogenesis via leptogenesis is viable in large regions of parameter space even without a small mass splitting between the RHNs.</description>

      <title>Braking protons at the EIC: from invisible meson decay to new physics searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) to invisible final states in coherent exclusive electroproduction. The characteristic signal is a forward proton with reduced energy and little additional detector activity. Using the excellent particle detection capabilities and kinematics reconstruction at the EIC, we argue that backgrounds can be strongly suppressed. While our analysis applies to various states, we specifically focus on pseudoscalar particles: (i) neutral mesons ($\pi^0,\eta^{(\prime)}$), whose invisible Standard Model decays are extremely suppressed, and (ii) gluon-coupled axion-like particles (ALPs) decaying invisibly to a dark sector. Depending on the meson species and the achievable background rejection, the EIC could strengthen existing bounds on invisible decays of pseudoscalar mesons by up to four orders of magnitude, probing branching ratios as small as ${\rm BR}(\eta^{(\prime)}\to{\rm inv})\sim 10^{-8}$. In addition, the EIC would directly probe invisibly decaying ALPs with the couplings up to $f_a\sim 10^5\,\text{GeV}$ and masses in the range $0.1$-$2\,\text{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Can the FCC-hh prove the B-L gauge symmetry?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a phenomenological study of the discovery potential at the FCC-hh for a new heavy neutral vector boson, Z', predicted by the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry. Focusing on the parameter space currently not excluded by Large Hadron Collider data, we analyze the dilepton production channel $p p \rightarrow Z^{\prime} \rightarrow l^{+} l^{-}$ ($l^{\pm} = e^{\pm}, \mu^{\pm}$) at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 100$ TeV. Full Monte Carlo simulations was performed for different ($M_{Z'}$, $g_{B-L}$) BSM scenarios and relevant Standard Model backgrounds (including irreducible Drell-Yan, diboson, single top-quark and top-quark pair productions) identifying optimal kinematic and angular selection cuts to guide future searches for this type resonance. We estimate the FCC-hh reach for an integrated luminosity of $\mathcal{L}_{int}$ = 3~$ab^{-1}$. Our results demonstrate that the FCC-hh can exclude Z' masses up to $\sim 40$ TeV with 95\% C.L. for couplings of $g_{B-L} \sim 1$, and up to $\sim 15$ TeV for $g_{B-L} \sim 0.1$. We find the kinematic and angular cuts that optimize the signal over background ratio and achieve a $5\sigma$ signal up to Z' masses of $\sim 30$ TeV. These findings highlight the FCC-hh potential to uncover new physics signals in the high-mass regime.</description>

      <title>Search for a Doubly Charged Scalar at the LHC and FCC-hh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doubly charged scalars frequently emerge in many well-motivated extensions of the Standard Model, particularly in frameworks that aim to explain the origin of neutrino masses. Their distinct electric charge and clean leptonic signatures make them especially compelling from the standpoint of experimental searches. In this work, we explore the sensitivity of the LHC full run II, including photon-photon fusion, and Future Circular Collider in its hadron-hadron configuration (FCC-hh) to such states, assuming they decay promptly and exclusively into charged leptons either conserving or violating lepton flavor. We find that the FCC-hh, operating at 100 TeV, is uniquely positioned to probe doubly charged scalars with masses up to 7 TeV and possibly establish the mechanism behind neutrino masses.</description>

      <title>Prospects for studying the $WH\gamma$ process in $pp$ collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics, though remarkably successful, leaves open several major questions that continue to motivate searches for new phenomena. Multiboson interactions involving the Higgs boson are of special interest as probes of the electroweak Lagrangian where potential new physics may be hiding. In this work, we present a study of the simultaneous production of a W boson, a Higgs bosons and a photon in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Monte Carlo simulation is performed to model both the signal and the background processes, and detector effects are included according to CMS specifications. Boosted decision trees are employed to optimize the event selection and enhance signal-background discrimination. We estimate that with an integrated luminosity of 440~$\rm fb^{-1}$, the expected significance for the $WH\gamma$ process is 0.63$\sigma$, projected to reach 1.64$\sigma$ at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC).</description>

      <title>Seesaw-I and II Hybrid $T^{\prime}$ Symmetric Neutrino Masses with Mass Selection Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present manuscript studies a recently proposed new neutrino mixing scheme with a neutrino mass selection rule, $m_{\nu}^{13} + m_{\nu}^{22} + m_{\nu}^{31} = 0$, among a neutrino mass matrix elements. The neutrino mass matrix texture is achieved by means of $T^{\prime}$ flavor discrete symmetry extension of the Standard Model gauge group. The model realizing the neutrino mixing pattern consists of a combination of type-I and II seesaw mechanisms in the minimal possible extension of the Standard Model. Stringent predictions are obtained for normal and inverted neutrino mass orderings. Some important predictions include $\alpha_2 \approx 2\pi$ (best fit), $m_{\text{lightest}} \approx 3 - 4 \times 10^{-4}\,\text{eV}$, and $m_{ee}^{0\nu\beta\beta} \approx 3 \times 10^{-3}\,\text{eV}$ for normal neutrino mass ordering; $110^\circ &lt; \alpha_1 &lt; 170^\circ$, $40(220)^\circ &lt; \alpha_2 &lt; 60(240)^\circ$, $240^\circ &lt; \delta_{\text{Dirac}} &lt; 310^\circ$, and $m_{\text{lightest}} \approx 2 \times 10^{-5} - 7 \times 10^{-3}\,\text{eV}$ for inverted neutrino mass ordering.</description>

      <title>High Frequency Spectrum of Primordial Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During inflation gravitational waves are produced in the superhorizon regime, which form stochastic background in the present universe with very wide range of frequencies. Higher frequency gravitational waves never experience superhorizon regime, but they are also amplified after inflation due to the inflaton oscillation. Taking account of the inflaton dynamics after inflation, the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves may extend to much higher frequencies than previously thought. In this paper we calculate the spectrum of high frequency gravitational waves produced during and after inflation in detail, in particular focusing on the connection between the low and high frequency regime, and show that the detailed spectrum can distinguish inflation models.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of RHN DM relic in the vanilla scotogenic neutrino mass model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scotogeneic neutrino mass models are very popular choices to generate light neutrino masses via radiative mechanism. In these models, the particles running in the loop are distinguished from the standard model due to an imposed $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry under which the loop particles are odd. Therefore, the lightest particle running in the loop can be a viable dark matter candidate. In this paper, we revisit the minimal scotogenic neutrino mass model and study the anatomy of right handed neutrino (RHN) DM relic, taking into account contributions from self-annihilation, co-annihilation, conversion-driven processes, as well as production via the freeze-in mechanism. We impose the constraints from direct detection and collider searches of DM including anomalous magnetic moment of muon, charged lepton flavor violation and low-energy neutrino oscillation data to show that the lightest RHN can be a viable DM in the mass range: $M_{h}/2\lesssim M_{\rm DM}\lesssim2000 {\rm GeV}$ (thermal DM) and $0.1 ~{\rm GeV}\lesssim M_{\rm DM}\lesssim 1000 {\rm GeV}$ (non-thermal DM), where $M_h$ denotes the Standard Model Higgs mass and $M_{\rm DM}$ is the RHN dark matter mass. We also find the displaced vertex signatures of long lived particles which can be probed at future colliders.</description>

      <title>Study the property of $W^{\prime}$ at future $e^-p$ collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a strong candidate for new physics beyond the Standard Model, the exotic charged gauge boson $W^{\prime}$ has attracted extensive research interest. In this work we investigate the interactions of the $W^{\prime}$ boson at the electron-proton colliders. The process $e^- u \to \nu_e d$ and $e^- u \to e^\pm jjj$ with $t$-channel $W^{\prime}$ exchange are studied. The polarization of the initial-state electrons has a significant impact on the cross section of the studied process, while the angular distribution of the final-state leptons serves as an important observable for the interactions of the $W^{\prime}$ boson. In some specific regions of the parameter space, the detectable mass range for the $W^{\prime}$ boson can reach around 10 TeV, and the coupling strength can achieve a precision of approximately 1\% relative to the interaction strength of the Standard Model. Especially, $e^- u \to e^+ jjj$ process is forbidden within the Standard Model, which would constitute important evidence in the search for the Left-Right Symmetric Model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-leptonic decays of $\Omega_{b}\rightarrow \Omega_{c} P (V)$ with eight pseudoscalar and vector mesons using the QCD factorization approach. We analyze all relevant topologies (the tree-level, color-suppressed, and penguin) of these decays and calculate the decay amplitude for each separately. We determine the decay rates, branching ratios and compare our results with those from other theoretical predictions. The results obtained may be useful for the analysis of the related data in both ongoing and future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, are genuine quantum machines, so, in line with Richard Feynman's original motivation for Quantum Computing, the scattering processes that take place there are natural candidates to be simulated on a quantum system. Potential applications range from quantum machine learning methods for collider data analysis, to faster and more precise evaluations of intricate multiloop Feynman diagrams, more efficient jet clustering, improved simulations of parton showers, and many other tasks. In this work, the focus will be on two specific applications: first, the identification of the causal structure of multiloop vacuum amplitudes, a key ingredient of the Loop-Tree Duality and an area with deep connections to graph theory; and second, the integration and sampling of high-dimensional functions. The latter constitutes a first step toward the realization of a fully fledged quantum event generator operating at high perturbative orders.</description>

      <title>Dark Dimension Right-handed Neutrinos Confronted with Long-Baseline Oscillation Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Right-handed neutrinos are naturally induced by dark extra dimension models and play an essential role in neutrino oscillations. The model parameters can be examined by the long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. In this work, we compute the predicted neutrino oscillation spectra within/without extra dimension models and compare them with the experimental data. We find that the neutrino data in the T2K and NOvA experiments are compatible with the standard neutrino oscillation hypothesis. The results set the stringent exclusion limit on the extra dimension model parameters at a high confidence level. The derived constraints on dark dimension right-handed neutrinos are complementary to those results from the collider experiments and cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Anomalous (3+1)d Fermionic Topological Quantum Field Theories via Symmetry Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete finite-group global symmetries may suffer from nonperturbative 't-Hooft anomalies. Such global anomalies can be canceled by anomalous symmetry-preserving topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), which contain no local point operators but only extended excitations such as line and surface operators. In this work, we study mixed gauge-gravitational nonperturbative global anomalies of Weyl fermions (or Weyl semimetals in condensed matter) charged under discrete Abelian internal symmetries in four-dimensional spacetime, with spacetime-internal fermionic symmetry $G=$Spin$\times_{\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}}\mathbb{Z}_{2m}^{\rm F}$ or Spin$\times\mathbb{Z}_n$ that contains fermion parity $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\rm F}$. We determine the minimal finite gauge group $K$ of anomalous $G$-symmetric TQFTs that can match the fermionic anomaly via the symmetry-extension construction $1 \to K \to G_{\rm Tot} \to G \to 1$, where the anomaly in $G$ is trivialized upon pullback to $G_{\rm Tot}$, computed by Atiyah-Patodi-Singer eta invariant. This allows one to replace a $G$-symmetric four-dimensional Weyl fermion by an anomalous $G$-symmetric discrete-$K$-gauge TQFT as an alternative low-energy theory in the same deformation class. As an application, we show that the four-dimensional Standard Model with 15 Weyl fermions per family, in the absence of a sterile right-handed neutrino $\nu_R$, exhibits mixed gauge-gravitational global anomalies between baryon and lepton number symmetries $({\bf B \pm L})$ and spacetime diffeomorphisms. We identify the corresponding minimal $K$-gauge fermionic TQFT that cancels these anomalies and can be interpreted as a gapped, topologically ordered dark sector replacing missing Weyl fermions via symmetry extension, without invoking conventional Anderson-Higgs symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>The Maximal Entanglement Limit in Statistical and High Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lectures advocate the idea that quantum entanglement provides a unifying foundation for both statistical physics and high-energy interactions. I argue that, at sufficiently long times or high energies, most quantum systems approach a Maximal Entanglement Limit (MEL) in which phases of quantum states become unobservable, reduced density matrices acquire a thermal form, and probabilistic descriptions emerge without invoking ergodicity or classical randomness. Within this framework, the emergence of probabilistic parton model, thermalization in the break-up of confining strings and in high-energy collisions, and the universal small $x$ behavior of structure functions arise as direct consequences of entanglement and geometry of high-dimensional Hilbert space.</description>

Abstract: Assuming that Dark Matter is an ultralight scalar field which is coupled to electromagnetism via a gauge-kinetic function and which at the time of recombination is oscillating coherently over a Hubble patch, we show that there is a tachyonic instability for the gauge field modes which leads to the generation of magnetic fields on cosmological scales of sufficient amplitude to explain observations.</description>

      <title>One loop renormalization of 5D gauge-Yukawa theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The common lore dictates that extra dimensional theories loose predictive power at energies just above the compatification scale, due to the power-law running of bulk coupling. We show that five-dimensional gauge-Yukawa theories can be valid up to arbitrarily high scales, provided: 1) A finite number of terms are required to absorb power-law divergences; 2) All power-law running couplings flow to UV fixed points. By explicitly computing bulk and localized divergences for a gauge-Yukawa theory on $\mathcal{S}^1/\mathbb{Z}_2$, we prove the one-loop renormalization properties of Lagrangians containing only interactions that would be renormalizable in four dimensions. The existence of UV fixed points imposes further constraints on the content of the model. Our results provide a consistency check for the high-energy behavior of any 5D theory, and provide a discrimination between UV consistent models and those that can describe only a handful of Kaluza-Klein modes. Hence, we offer the first concrete step towards an all-order proof of `renormalizability' for gauge-Yukawa theories in five dimensions.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory for dissipative photons from higher-form symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in generalized symmetries have provided new insights into quantum field theories. Within this framework, photons can be understood as Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with a spontaneously broken higher-form symmetry. In this work, we develop an effective field theory that builds on this symmetry structure to describe the real-time dynamics of photons in insulating media at finite temperature. Combining the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism with the generalized coset construction, we formulate a symmetry-based effective action that incorporates both conservative and dissipative effects. The effective theory implements the dynamical Kubo-Martin-Schwinger symmetry, ensuring consistency with the fluctuation-dissipation relation and Onsager's reciprocal relations. Within this framework, we derive the entropy current associated with dissipative photon dynamics and demonstrate the non-negativity of its divergence, in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics. We also clarify the symmetry origin of the gauge redundancy in the unbroken phase within the Schwinger-Keldysh framework, relating it to strong and weak realizations of higher-form symmetries. Our results provide a model-independent effective description of photon dynamics in insulating media at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Global charge conservation in the symmetric phase of the early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Standard Model at high temperatures, anomalous effects contribute to the violation of baryon number ($B$) and lepton number ($L$), separately, while $B-L$ remains conserved. There are also corresponding changes in the helicity of the hypermagnetic field ($h_B$) and the Chern-Simons numbers of the non-Abelian gauge fields ($N_{\rm CS,w}$ and $N_{\rm CS,s}$). In this study, we investigate a baryogenesis process in the symmetric phase of the early Universe by taking into account the Abelian and non-Abelian anomalous effects as well as the perturbative chirality-flip processes of all fermions. We calculate the time evolution of all relevant physical quantities, including the asymmetries of all fermions and the Higgs, as well as $h_B$ and $N_{\rm CS,w}$. We present a method to compute the latter, for which it is crucial to consider the minute departure from equilibrium of the sphaleron processes. We then verify explicitly the conservation of a global charge, involving the total matter-antimatter asymmetry $B+L$, the hypermagnetic helicity $h_B$ and $N_{\rm CS,w}$, the existence of which had been inferred earlier. In particular we show that, in the scenario that we study, an initial $h_B$ decays mostly to $N_{\rm CS,w}$, with only $10^{-3}$ conversion ratio into $B+L$ asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Positive definiteness constraints of effective scalar potential in Georgi-Machacek Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Georgi-Machacek (GM) Model extends the Higgs sector of the Standard Model by introducing additional triplets, preserving custodial symmetry at tree level and allowing large triplet vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of order $\cal{O}$(10) GeV. Theoretical constraints on the model's parameters include bounded-from-below (BFB) conditions for the tree-level scalar potential. This study goes beyond the BFB constraints by examining the positive definiteness of the effective potential in the GM model to ensure the absence of deeper vacua in regions with large field values. Using a one-loop renormalization group-improved (RG-improved) effective potential and new criteria for positive definiteness of homogeneous polynomials with multiple variables (necessary due to custodial symmetry breaking effects from loops), we numerically analyze these constraints. Our results reveal that the parameter ranges allowed by positive definiteness differ significantly from those derived from tree-level BFB conditions. Notably, some regions previously excluded by tree-level BFB constraints remain viable under the one-loop RG-improved scalar potential. Besides, certain parameter spaces that satisfy tree-level BFB constraints with electroweak (EW) scale couplings should be excluded due to violations of positive definiteness in large field-value regions. Our numerical analysis, based on the new criteria for positive definiteness of homogeneous polynomials with multiple variables, not only revises the GM model's viability map but also provides a methodological template for stability studies in other extended Higgs models.</description>

      <title>Current Status of Inert Higgs Dark Matter with Dark Fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precision measurements of the muon magnetic moment and the $W$ boson mass have sparked interest in the potential deviations from standard model (SM) predictions. While it may be premature to attribute any excesses in these precision measurements to new physics, they do offer a valuable indication of potential directions for physics beyond the SM. Additionally, the particle nature of dark matter (DM) remains a crucial enigma. Despite the absence of any definitive DM signal in direct detection and collider experiments, the Galactic Center GeV $\gamma$-ray excess and the AMS-02 antiproton ($\overline{p}$) excess could potentially offer hints related to the evidence of DM. Motivated by these observations, we propose a simple DM model that addresses all these issues. This model extends the SM by incorporating singlet and doublet Dirac fermion fields, along with a doublet complex scalar field. For the viable parameter regions in this model, we find that future upgrades of the Large Hadron Collider and DM direct detection experiments can only partially probe them, while future high-energy muon colliders hold promise for exploring the unexplored parameter space.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of the standard HVM and 95.4 GeV excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the collider phenomenology of the standard Hierarchical VEVs Model by proposing a new version, which avoids large flavor changing neutral current interactions, thus, rendering the scale of new physics as low as the electroweak scale. The resulting collider signatures are distinctive and testable at the High-Luminosity LHC, the High-Energy LHC, and future 100\,TeV hadron colliders. Remarkably, one of the pseudoscalars in the model can account for the 95.4\,GeV di-photon excess observed by ATLAS and CMS. In addition, the model naturally accommodates a new class of neutrino-philic dark matter candidate, \emph{neutrinic dark matter}, that interacts exclusively with neutrino pairs.</description>

      <title>Excitation of the Glashow resonance without neutrino beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $s$-channel process $\bar\nu_ee^-\rightarrow W^-$ (on-shell) is now referred to as the Glashow resonance and being searched for at kilometer-scale neutrino ice/water detectors like IceCube, Baikal-GVD or KM3NeT. After over a decade of observations, IceCube has recorded only a few neutrino events with energies of interest such that an independent confirmation of the existence of this resonant interaction would be of great importance for testing the Standard Model. One might therefore ask: are there reactions with the Glashow resonance that would not necessitate having initial (anti)neutrino beams? This article suggests a surprisingly affirmative answer to the question $-$ namely, that the process may proceed in electron-positron collisions at accelerator energies, occurring as $e^+e^-\rightarrow W^-\rho(770)^+$. Although the resonance appears somewhat disguised, the underlying physics is transparent, quite resembling the well known radiative return: emission of $\rho^+$ from the initial state converts the incident $e^+$ into $\bar\nu_e$. Likewise, the CP conjugate channel, $\nu_e e^+\rightarrow W^+$, takes the form $e^+e^-\rightarrow W^+\rho(770)^-$. Similar reactions with muons and other hadrons are also possible. From this viewpoint, future high-luminosity lepton colliders seem to be promising for excitation of the Glashow resonance in laboratory conditions.</description>

      <title>Searching for elusive dark Higgs boson in spin-1/2 inelastic dark matter models at Belle II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-1/2 inelastic dark matter (DM) models are popular among sub-GeV to GeV thermal DM scenarios due to the dominant role of co-annihilation in determining the DM relic abundance. In these models, the dark Higgs boson plays a crucial role in generating the mass of the new gauge boson, the dark photon ($A'$), and in establishing the mass splitting between the excited ($\chi_2$) and ground ($\chi_1$) states of DM. In particular, the Compton scattering $\chi_1 A' \rightarrow \chi_2^* \rightarrow \chi_1 A'$ and its $t$-channel crossed process, $\chi_1 \chi_1 \rightarrow A' A'$, remain unitary for high energy longitudunal dark photon, only if the contribution of the dark Higgs boson is included. However, experimental searches for the dark Higgs boson have received relatively little attention. In particular, when the dark Higgs boson mass exceeds twice that of the DM excited state, its decay signatures become semi-visible or invisible, making detection challenging with current light scalar search strategies. In this work, we explore the prospects for detecting the elusive dark Higgs boson in spin-1/2 inelastic DM models at Belle II via dark Higgs-strahlung and rare $B$ meson decay processes. Our analysis indicates that both the inclusive signature of two displaced dilepton vertices and the additional missing energy from dark Higgs boson decays serve as robust indicators of its presence. Furthermore, we assess the future potential for detecting the dark Higgs boson with the proposed far detector related to Belle II, GAZELLE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Curvature perturbations with short wavelengths exit the Hubble horizon when the universe may contain a thermal plasma in addition to an inflaton field that drives its expansion. We solve the corresponding fluctuation-dissipation dynamics at linear order, building upon a previously established set of gauge-invariant evolution equations. The properties of the noise autocorrelator are constrained via a matching of equilibrium correlators to quantum-statistical physics deep inside the Hubble horizon. The curvature power spectrum is determined numerically, without slow-roll approximations or assumptions about the equilibration of the inflaton field. As applications, we scrutinize two issues from recent literature: the model dependence of the thermally modified power spectrum as a function of freeze-out parameters, and the viability of embedding warm inflation within the Standard Model (we offer support for the latter proposal). The role of pre-horizon-exit acoustic oscillations is illustrated.</description>

Abstract: The Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation offers a tractable description of the high-energy growth of gauge-theory scattering amplitudes and the nonlinear saturation effects that eventually tame it. Motivated by the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), whose extended kinematic reach promises more decisive tests of saturation at high energies, we present a framework based on the spacelike-timelike correspondence that streamlines the computation of multi-loop corrections to the BK equation. We explicitly verify the correspondence at three loops in the large-flavor limit and predict the full nonconformal component of the three-loop BK Hamiltonian in the planar limit of a generic gauge theory, treating the numbers of fermions and scalars as free parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two general $U(1)$ extensions of the Standard Model (SM) those generate tiny neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism after general $U(1)$ breaking. These models predict a new neutral gauge boson ($Z'$) and right-handed neutrinos (RHNs), the latter introduced for anomaly cancellation and neutrino mass generation. In both scenarios, left- and right-handed fermions couple differently to the $Z'$, and RHNs mix with light neutrinos, enabling variety of decay modes. Focusing on the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) and the future FASER2 experiment, we explore RHN pair production from $Z'$ decays in two cases: (i) long-lived $Z'$ decays to visible modes and long-lived RHNs, and (ii) short-lived $Z'$ decays to long-lived RHNs, which further decay visibly inside FASER2. We estimate projected limits on the general $U(1)$ gauge coupling, $Z'$ mass, RHN mass, and light-heavy neutrino mixing for various $U(1)$ charge assignments, and compare them with current experimental bounds.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Calibration of the Crossterms Eigenvolume HRG Model: Integrating Lattice QCD and Experimental Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a Bayesian calibration of the Cross--term Excluded-Volume Hadron Resonance Gas (Cross EV--HRG) model, which incorporates flavor-dependent repulsive interactions within a thermodynamically consistent framework. For the first time, the thermal model is simultaneously constrained using lattice QCD (LQCD) thermodynamic observables and centrality-resolved hadron yield data from Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=2.76~\mathrm{TeV}$ measured by the ALICE Collaboration. We also find that the calibration outcome is strongly data-dependent in terms of constraining power and uncertainty structure. In particular, LQCD observables alone provide only weak constraints on the eigenvolume parameters, while the inclusion of hadron yield data substantially enhances the constraining power and induces a nontrivial reshaping of the posterior distributions. We further investigate the impact of correlated experimental systematic uncertainties by constructing a phenomenological covariance matrix and systematically varying its strength, demonstrating that a careful and consistent treatment of systematic correlations is essential for reliable parameter estimation. Across all calibration scenarios, the parameters associated with multi-strange hadrons remain only moderately constrained, which may reflect limitations of the currently established hadron resonance spectrum. No clear monotonic hierarchy of strange-hadron eigenvolume radii emerges within the present uncertainties, indicating that further dedicated studies are required.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Composite asymmetric dark matter (ADM) models provide a well-motivated paradigm that simultaneously explains dark matter (DM) relic density and matter-antimatter asymmetry. In these models, the mass of the DM candidate (the lightest dark baryon) is generated through the dark confinement scale dynamics. Although the leptophilic composite ADM model offers a viable framework, comprehensive studies of its collider phenomenology are absent. This work systematically explores novel signatures from the leptophilic composite asymmetric dark sector at both low-energy and high-energy $e^+e^-$ colliders as well as other existing collider constraints. We demonstrate detectability of TeV-scale mediators along with sub-GeV to GeV-scale lightest dark mesons at Belle II and its proposed far detector, GAZELLE, as well as Circular Electron Positron Collider/Future Circular Collider-electron-positron experiments. Moreover, these experiments exhibit complementary coverage of the model parameter space.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we construct the color $\bar{\mathbf{3}}\bar{\mathbf{3}}\bar{\mathbf{3}}$ type local five-quark currents with the light quarks $qss$ in the flavor octet, and study the $qssc\bar{c}$ pentaquark states via the QCD sum rules in a comprehensive way, and we emphasize that we achieve two light-flavor octets. We obtain the mass spectrum of the hidden-charm-doubly-strange pentaquark states with the isospin-spin-parity $IJ^{P}=\frac{1}{2}{\frac{1}{2}}^-$, $\frac{1}{2}{\frac{3}{2}}^-$ and $\frac{1}{2}{\frac{5}{2}}^-$, which can be confronted to the experimental data in the future, especially the process $\Xi_b^- \to P_{css}^-\phi \to J/\psi \Xi^- \phi $. As a byproduct, we observe that the lowest hidden-charm pentaquark states are not of the scalar-diquark-scalar-diquark-antiquark type, it is wrong to refer the scalar and axialvector diquarks as the "good" and "bad" diquarks, respectively.</description>

Abstract: Current dark matter direct detection experiments have low sensitivity to sub-GeV dark matter. In this work, we demonstrate that rare $B$ and $K$ meson decays with missing energy in the final state can serve as efficient probes in this mass range. We analyze a generic $Z^{\prime}$ portal dark matter model and derive upper limits on its parameters from experimental bounds on the rare $B$ and $K$ meson decays. Our results show that such meson decay processes provide complementary constraints to current direct detection experiments for sub-GeV dark matter, particularly for interaction forms mediated by dark matter momentum-dependent operators.</description>

      <title>Coupled-channel scattering of $DD, DD^*$ and $D^* D^*$ in isospin-$1$ from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first coupled-channel determination of two-body $D$ and $D^*$ scattering amplitudes in isospin-$1$ from lattice quantum chromodynamics is presented. Using three lattice volumes at $m_\pi \approx 391~\mathrm{MeV}$, finite-volume energies relevant for the channels of interest are determined. Through the L\"uscher formalism, these energies are used to constrain amplitudes of coupled $J^P=0^+$ $DD - DD^*$, $J^P=1^+$ $DD^*- D^*D^*$ and $J^P=2^+$ $DD - DD^* - D^* D^*$ scattering. All channels feature weakly repulsive interactions in $S$ wave, except for a weak $D^* D^*$ attraction in $J^P=0^+$. No amplitude singularities corresponding to physical states are found. Some of these amplitudes will be a necessary component of future lattice QCD analyses of $DD\pi$ and $DD^*$ scattering taking into account three-body and left-hand cut effects.</description>

      <title>Single-Point Search for eV-scale Axion-like particles with Variable-Angle Three-Beam Stimulated Resonant Photon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a laboratory search for axion-like particles (ALPs) in the eV-mass range using a variable-angle three-beam stimulated resonant photon collider. The scheme independently focuses and collides three laser beams, providing a cosmology- and astrophysics-independent test. By varying the angles of incidence, the center-of-mass energy can be scanned continuously across the eV range. In this work, we operated the collider in a vacuum chamber at a large-angle configuration, verified the spacetime overlap of the three short pulses, and performed a first search centered at $m_a\simeq 2.27~\mathrm{eV}$. No excess was observed. We thus set a $95\%$ C.L.\ upper limit on the pseudoscalar two-photon coupling, with a minimum sensitivity of $g/M\simeq 4.2\times 10^{-10}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ at $m_a=2.27~\mathrm{eV}$. This provides the first model-independent upper limit on the coupling that reaches the KSVZ benchmark in the eV regime and demonstrates the feasibility of eV-scale mass scans in the near future.</description>

      <title>Physical Effects of Gravitational Waves at Second Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is currently no rigorous definition of gravitational wave strain at second order in cosmological perturbation theory. The usual association of gravitational waves with transverse and traceless fluctuations of the metric on spatial hypersurfaces becomes ambiguous at second order, as it inherently depends on the spacetime slicing. While this poses no practical issues in linearized gravity, it presents a fundamental problem for secondary gravitational waves, especially notorious for gravitational waves induced by primordial fluctuations. We compute, for the first time, the physical effects of gravitational waves at second order, as measured by geodesic observers that emit and receive electromagnetic signals, thereby settling the debate on gauge ambiguities. We find that the measured gravitational wave strain coincides with the transverse-traceless components in the Newton gauge.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy models in light of the latest observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study several models and parameterizations of dynamical dark energy (DE) that have been studied already in the past, in conjunction with the recently proposed model $w$XCDM, the running vacuum model (RVM) with and without a threshold at $z=1$ and two variants of it, the RRVM and the ``flipped RVM'', and compare them all with the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model and the popular $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization. We use two standard sets of cosmological data, one including distant supernovae from Pantheon$+$ and the other from DES-Y5. The rest of the data (BAO from DESI DR2 and CMB from Planck PR4) are shared by the two sets. They are analyzed with the help of \texttt{CLASS}. No structure formation data are utilized for this analysis and no use is made of the SH0ES calibration of $H_0$. Even so, we find that the flipped RVM and to a lesser extent the $w$XCDM and the RVM with threshold, point to significant evidence of dynamical DE, at a level comparable to $w_0w_a$CDM, more conspicuously for the dataset that involves DES-Y5 observations. We also find that while more traditional models studied in the past, in which there is an exchange between vacuum energy and cold dark matter (through e.g. an interactive source proportional either to the density of dark matter or to that of vacuum) still hint at dynamical DE, the strength of the statistical signal (which we assess through information criteria and other estimators) is nevertheless less pronounced. Finally, we discuss the ability of the various models to explain the data by performing an analysis of their effective equation-of-state parameters and corresponding evolution of their dark energy densities.</description>
