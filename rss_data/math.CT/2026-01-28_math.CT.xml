      <title>Characterizations of higher derivations and higher differential torsion theories in Eilenberg-Moore categories of monads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a monad on a category $\mathscr{C}$. In this paper, we introduce the notion of higher derivations on the monad $T$ and characterize them in terms of ordinary derivations on $T$. We also define higher derivations on modules over the monad $T$ in the Eilenberg-Moore category $EM_T$ and establish their characterization in a similar manner. We provide several examples that illustrate and support our results. Furthermore, we examine the conditions under which a torsion theory on $EM_T$ is higher differential, and show that this holds if and only if every higher derivation on a module $M \in EM_T$ extends uniquely to its module of quotients $Q_{\tau}(M)$.</description>

      <title>For Generalised Algebraic Theories, Two Sorts Are Enough</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalised algebraic theories (GATs) allow multiple sorts indexed over each other. For example, the theories of categories or Martin-L{\"o}f type theories form GATs. Categories have two sorts, objects and morphisms, and the latter are double-indexed over the former. Martin-L{\"o}f type theory has four sorts: contexts, substitutions, types and terms. For example, types are indexed over contexts, and terms are indexed over both contexts and types. In this paper we show that any GAT can be reduced to a GAT with only two sorts, and there is a section-retraction correspondence (formally, a strict coreflection) between models of the original and the reduced GAT. In particular, any model of the original GAT can be turned into a model of the reduced (two-sorted) GAT and back, and this roundtrip is the identity.
  The reduced GAT is simpler than the original GAT in the following aspects: it does not have sort equalities; it does not have interleaved sorts and operations; if the original GAT did not have interleaved sorts and operations, then the reduced GAT won't have operations interleaved between different sorts. In a type-theoretic metatheory, the initial algebra of a GAT is called a quotient inductive-inductive type (QIIT). Our reduction provides a way to implement QIITs with sort equalities or interleaved constructors which are not allowed by Cubical Agda. An instance of our reduction is the well-known method of reducing mutual inductive types to a single indexed family. Our approach is semantic in that it does not rely on a syntactic description of GATs, but instead, on Uemura's bi-initial characterisation of the category of (finite) GATs in the 2-category of finitely complete categories with a chosen exponentiable morphism.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We record a folklore theorem that says a partial group embeds in a group if and only if each word has at most one possible multiplication, regardless of choice of parenthesization. We further investigate the partial groups which are exemplars of non-embeddability. Finally we show that a partial groupoid embeds in a groupoid if and only if its reduction embeds in a group.</description>

      <title>Involutive Markov categories and the quantum de Finetti theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09666v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markov categories have recently emerged as a powerful high-level framework for probability theory and theoretical statistics. Here we study a quantum version of this concept, called involutive Markov categories. These are equivalent to Parzygnat's quantum Markov categories, but we argue that they offer a simpler and more practical approach. Our main examples of involutive Markov categories have pre-C*-algebras, including infinite-dimensional ones, as objects, together with completely positive unital maps as morphisms in the picture of interest. In this context, we prove a quantum de Finetti theorem for both the minimal and the maximal C*-tensor norms, and we develop a categorical description of such quantum de Finetti theorems which amounts to a universal property of state spaces.</description>

Abstract: Solid abelian groups, as introduced by Dustin Clausen and Peter Scholze, form a subcategory of all condensed abelian groups satisfying some ''completeness'' conditions and having favourable categorical properties. Given a profinite ring $R$, there is an associated condensed ring $\underline{R}$ which is solid. We show that the natural embedding of profinite $R$-modules into solid $\underline{R}$-modules preserves $\mathrm{Ext}$ and tensor products, as well as the fact that profinite rings are analytic.</description>

      <title>Integration of a categorical operad</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a Grothendieck construction for non-symmetric operads with values in categories, and hence in groupoids and posets. The construction produces a 2-category which is operadically fibered over the category D of finite non-empty ordinals and surjections. We describe an inverse for the construction, yielding an equivalence of constant-free non-symmetric categorical operads and operadic 2-categories (split-)fibered over D, which resembles the correspondence of categorical presheaves and fibered categories. The result provides a new characterization of non-symmetric categorical operads and tools to study them.</description>

      <title>Categories of abstract and noncommutative measurable spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gelfand duality is a fundamental result that justifies thinking of general unital $C^*$-algebras as noncommutative versions of compact Hausdorff spaces. Inspired by this perspective, we investigate what noncommutative measurable spaces should be. This leads us to consider categories of monotone $\sigma$-complete $C^*$-algebras as well as categories of Boolean $\sigma$-algebras, which can be thought of as abstract measurable spaces. Motivated by the search for a good notion of noncommutative measurable space, we provide a unified overview of these categories, alongside those of measurable spaces, and formalize their relationships through functors, adjunctions and equivalences. This includes an equivalence between Boolean $\sigma$-algebras and commutative monotone $\sigma$-complete $C^*$-algebras, as well as a Gelfand-type duality adjunction between the latter category and the category of measurable spaces. This duality restricts to two equivalences: one involving standard Borel spaces, which are widely used in probability theory, and another involving the more general Baire measurable spaces. Moreover, this result admits a probabilistic version, where the morphisms are $\sigma$-normal cpu maps and Markov kernels, respectively. We hope that these developments can also contribute to the ongoing search for a well-behaved Markov category for measure-theoretic probability beyond the standard Borel setting - an open problem in the current state of the art.</description>

      <title>Metric completions of triangulated categories from hereditary rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The focus of this article is on metric completions of triangulated categories arising in the representation theory of hereditary finite dimensional algebras and commutative rings. We explicitly describe all completions of bounded derived categories with respect to additive good metrics for two classes of rings - hereditary commutative noetherian rings and hereditary algebras of tame representation type over an algebraically closed field. To that end, we develop and study the lattice theory of metrics on triangulated categories. Moreover, we establish a link between metric completions of bounded derived categories of a ring and the ring's universal localisations.</description>

      <title>Quantum graphs of homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a category $\mathsf{qGph}$ of quantum graphs, whose definition is motivated entirely from noncommutative geometry. For all quantum graphs $G$ and $H$ in $\mathsf{qGph}$, we then construct a quantum graph $[G,H]$ of homomorphisms from $G$ to $H$, making $\mathsf{qGph}$ a closed symmetric monoidal category. We prove that for all finite graphs $G$ and $H$, the quantum graph $[G,H]$ is nonempty iff the $(G,H)$-homomorphism game has a winning quantum strategy, directly generalizing the classical case.
  The finite quantum graphs in $\mathsf{qGph}$ are tracial, real, and self-adjoint, and the morphisms between them are CP morphisms that are adjoint to a unital $*$-homomorphism. We prove that Weaver's two notions of a CP morphism coincide in this context. We also include a short proof that every finite reflexive quantum graph is the confusability quantum graph of a quantum channel.</description>
