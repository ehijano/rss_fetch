      <title>The formal theory of tangentads PART II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tangent category theory is a well-established categorical framework for differential geometry. A long list of fundamental geometric constructions, such as the tangent bundle functor, vector fields, Euclidean spaces, and vector bundles have been successfully generalized and internalized within tangent categories. Over the past decade, the theory has also been extended in several directions, yielding concepts such as tangent monads, tangent fibrations, tangent restriction categories, and reverse tangent categories. It is natural to wonder how these new flavours of the theory interact with the geometric constructions. How does a tangent monad or a tangent fibration lift to the tangent category of differential bundles of a tangent category? What is the correct notion of connections for a tangent restriction category? In previous work, we introduced tangentads, a unifying framework that generalizes many tangent-like notions, and developed a formal theory of vector fields for tangentads. In this paper, we extend this formal theory to three further fundamental constructions. These are differential objects, which generalize Euclidean spaces, differential bundles, which represent vector bundles in tangent category theory, and connections on differential bundles, which are the analogue of Koszul connections. These notions are introduced in the general theory of tangentads via appropriate universal properties. We then extend some of the main results of tangent category theory, including the equivalence between differential objects and differential bundles over the terminal object, and show that connections admit well-defined notions of covariant derivative, curvature, and torsion. Finally, we construct connections using PIE limits and apply our framework to several concrete instances of tangentads.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherence Spaces Revisited: A von Neumann (Co)Algebraic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a categorical model of MALL (Multiplicative Additive Linear Logic) inspired by the Heisenberg-Schr\"odinger duality of finite-dimensional quantum theory. Proofs of formulas with positive logical polarity correspond to CPTP (completely positive trace-preserving) maps in our model, i.e. the quantum operations in the Schr\"odinger picture, whereas proofs of formulas with negative logical polarity correspond to CPU (completely positive unital) maps, i.e. the quantum operations in the Heisenberg picture. The mathematical development is based on noncommutative geometry and finite-dimensional von Neumann (co)algebras, which can be defined as special kinds of (co)monoid objects internal to the category of finite-dimensional operator spaces.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Differential Jet Bundles are Reduced</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have previously observed that the theory of solutions of partial differential equations, regarded as diffieties inside jet bundles, acquires a powerful comonadic formulation after passage from the category of Fr\'echet smooth manifolds to the Cahiers topos of formal smooth sets (a well-adapted model for Synthetic Differential Geometry). However, the tacit assumption that this passage preserves the projective limits that define infinite jet bundles had remained unproven. Here we provide a detailed proof.</description>

      <title>Monoidal adjunctions and abelian envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how monoidal adjunctions can be used to prove the existence of monoidal abelian envelopes of pseudo-tensor categories, in particular, those admitting a combinatorial description with certain properties. We derive concrete general criteria that we demonstrate by giving relatively simple combinatorial proofs of the existence of new abelian envelopes for interpolation categories of the hyperoctahedral and of the modified symmetric groups.</description>

      <title>Categorical Diffusion of Weighted Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a categorical framework for diffusion on network-structured data valued in weighted lattices, extending the Laplacian paradigm beyond the category of Hilbert spaces. Central to our approach is the Lawvere Laplacian, an endofunctor on the category of cochains of a cellular sheaf enriched in a commutative unital quantale. We establish the Tarski-Lawvere Fixed Point Theorem, generalizing Tarski's classical result to show that the suffix and prefix points of a quantale-enriched endofunctor form complete weighted lattices. Leveraging this, we prove the Hodge-Lawvere Theorem, which identifies the suffix points of the Laplacian with weighted global sections, providing a geometric characterization of equilibria. Finally, we derive a discrete-time harmonic flow that evolves data toward these sections, offering a constructive method for information aggregation in systems ranging from discrete event processes to preference dynamics.</description>

      <title>On rationality for $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.01898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ be an $\mathbb{N}$-graded, simple, self-contragredient, $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra. We show that if the $S$-transformation of the character of $V$ is a linear combination of characters of $V$-modules, then the category $\mathcal{C}$ of grading-restricted generalized $V$-modules is a rigid tensor category. We further show, without any assumption on the character of $V$ but assuming that $\mathcal{C}$ is rigid, that $\mathcal{C}$ is a factorizable finite ribbon category, that is, a not-necessarily-semisimple modular tensor category. As a consequence, we show that if the Zhu algebra of $V$ is semisimple, then $\mathcal{C}$ is semisimple and thus $V$ is rational. The proofs of these theorems use techniques and results from tensor categories together with the method of Moore-Seiberg and Huang for deriving identities of two-point genus-one correlation functions associated to $V$. We give two main applications. First, we prove the conjecture of Kac-Wakimoto and Arakawa that $C_2$-cofinite affine $W$-algebras obtained via quantum Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction of admissible-level affine vertex algebras are strongly rational. The proof uses the recent result of Arakawa and van Ekeren that such $W$-algebras have semisimple (Ramond twisted) Zhu algebras. Second, we use our rigidity results to reduce the "coset rationality problem" to the problem of $C_2$-cofiniteness for the coset. That is, given a vertex operator algebra inclusion $U\otimes V\hookrightarrow A$ with $A$, $U$ strongly rational and $U$, $V$ a pair of mutual commutant subalgebras in $A$, we show that $V$ is also strongly rational provided it is $C_2$-cofinite.</description>

      <title>Fibrantly-transferred model structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop new techniques for constructing model structures from a given class of cofibrations, together with a class of fibrant objects and a choice of weak equivalences between them. As a special case, we obtain a more flexible version of the classical right-transfer theorem in the presence of an adjunction. Namely, instead of lifting the classes of fibrations and weak equivalences through the right adjoint, we now only do so between fibrant objects, which allows for a wider class of applications.</description>

      <title>Hopf 2-algebras and Braided Monoidal 2-Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07398v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the theory of principal $\infty$-bundles of Niklaus-Schreiber-Steveson, we develop a homotopy categorification of Hopf algebras, which model quantum groups. We study their higher-representation theory in the setting of $\mathsf{2Vect}^{hBC}$, which is a homotopy refinement of the notion of 2-vector spaces due to Baez-Crans that allows for higher coherence data. We construct in particular the 2-quantum double as a homotopy double crossed product, and prove its duality and factorization properties. We also define and characterize "2-$R$-matrices", which can be seen as an extension of the usual notion of $R$-matrix in an ordinary Hopf algebra. We found that the 2-Yang-Baxter equations describe the braiding of extended defects in 4d, distinct from but not unlike the Zamolodchikov tetrahedron equations. The main results we prove in this paper is that the 2-representation 2-category of a weak 2-bialgebra is braided monoidal if it is equipped with a universal 2-$R$-matrix, and that our homotopy quantization admits the theory of Lie 2-bialgebras as a semiclassical limit.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries From Fusion Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13063v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a condensable algebra in a modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$. We define an action of the fusion category $\mathcal{C}_A$ of $A$-modules in $\mathcal{C}$ on the morphism space $\mbox{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(x,A)$ for any $x$ in $\mathcal{C}$, whose characters are generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. This fusion action can be considered on $A$, and we prove a categorical generalization of the Schur-Weyl duality for this action. For any fusion subcategory $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{C}_A$ containing all the local $A$-modules, we prove the invariant subobject $B=A^\mathcal{B}$ is a condensable subalgebra of $A$. The assignment of $\mathcal{B}$ to $A^\mathcal{B}$ defines a Galois correspondence between this kind of fusion subcategories of $\mathcal{C}_A$ and the condensable subalgebras of $A$. In the context of VOAs, we prove for any nice VOAs $U \subset A$, $U=A^{\mathcal{C}_A}$ where $\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{M}_U$ is the category of $U$-modules. In particular, if $U = A^G$ for some finite automorphism group $G$ of $A,$ the fusion action of $\mathcal{C}_A$ on $A$ is equivalent to the $G$-action on $A.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These are lecture notes for a course in Winter 2022/23, updated and completed in October 2025.
  The goal of the lectures is to present some recent developments around six-functor formalisms, in particular: the abstract theory of 6-functor formalisms; the 2-category of cohomological correspondences, and resulting simplifications in the proofs of Poincar\'e--Verdier duality results; the relation between 6-functor formalisms and ``geometric rings''; many examples of 6-functor formalisms, both old and new.</description>
