      <title>Program of Thoughts for Financial Reasoning: Leveraging Dynamic In-Context Examples and Generative Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite continuous advancements in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), numerical reasoning remains a challenging area. Techniques like chain-of-thought prompting, tree-of-thought prompting, and program-of-thought prompting guide LLMs through intermediate reasoning steps. Although in-context learning with few-shot prompting has improved performance, LLMs still lag behind state-of-the-art models on financial numerical reasoning datasets such as FinQA and ConvFinQA. In this work, we introduce FINDER, a novel two-step framework, to enhance LLMs' capabilities in financial numerical reasoning. The first step utilizes a generative retriever to extract relevant facts from unstructured data, including both text and tables. This is followed by context-aware Program of Thought prompting with dynamic selection of in-context examples. Our model FINDER achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on both the FinQA and ConvFinQA datasets, surpassing previous benchmarks with execution accuracy improvements of 5.98% and 4.05%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Constitutive Model Discovery from Sparse and Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, unsupervised constitutive model discovery has gained attention through frameworks based on the Virtual Fields Method (VFM), most prominently the EUCLID approach. However, the performance of VFM-based approaches, including EUCLID, is affected by measurement noise and data sparsity, which are unavoidable in practice. The statistical finite element method (statFEM) offers a complementary perspective by providing a Bayesian framework for assimilating noisy and sparse measurements to reconstruct the full-field displacement response, together with quantified uncertainty. While statFEM recovers displacement fields under uncertainty, it does not strictly enforce consistency with constitutive relations or aim to yield interpretable constitutive models. In this work, we couple statFEM with unsupervised constitutive model discovery in the EUCLID framework, yielding statFEM--EUCLID. The framework is demonstrated for isotropic hyperelastic materials. The results show that this integration reduces sensitivity to noise and data sparsity, while ensuring that the reconstructed fields remain consistent with both equilibrium and constitutive laws.</description>

      <title>FaStFACT: Faster, Stronger Long-Form Factuality Evaluations in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the factuality of long-form generations from Large Language Models (LLMs) remains challenging due to accuracy issues and costly human assessment. Prior efforts attempt this by decomposing text into claims, searching for evidence, and verifying claims, but suffer from critical drawbacks: (1) inefficiency due to complex pipeline components unsuitable for long LLM outputs, and (2) ineffectiveness stemming from inaccurate claim sets and insufficient evidence collection of one-line snippets.
  To address these limitations, we propose \name, a fast and strong evaluation framework that achieves the highest alignment with human evaluation and efficiency among existing baselines. \name first employs chunk-level claim extraction integrated with confidence-based pre-verification, significantly reducing the cost of web searching and inference calling while ensuring reliability. For searching and verification, it collects document-level evidence from crawled webpages and selectively retrieves it during verification, addressing the evidence insufficiency problem in previous pipelines.
  Extensive experiments based on an aggregated and manually annotated benchmark demonstrate the reliability of \name in both efficiently and effectively evaluating the factuality of long-form LLM generations. Code and benchmark data is available at https://github.com/Yingjia-Wan/FastFact.</description>

      <title>Addressing the alignment problem in transportation policy making: an LLM approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in transportation planning is that the collective preferences of heterogeneous travelers often diverge from the policies produced by model-driven decision tools. This misalignment frequently results in implementation delays or failures. Here, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs), noted for their capabilities in reasoning and simulating human decision-making, can help inform and address this alignment problem. We develop a multi-agent simulation in which LLMs, acting as agents representing residents from different communities in a city, participate in a referendum on a set of transit policy proposals. Using chain-of-thought reasoning, LLM agents provide ranked-choice or approval-based preferences, which are aggregated using instant-runoff voting (IRV) to model democratic consensus. We implement this simulation framework with both GPT-4o and Claude-3.5, and apply it for Chicago and Houston. Our findings suggest that LLM agents are capable of approximating plausible collective preferences and responding to local context, while also displaying model-specific behavioral biases and modest divergences from optimization-based benchmarks. These capabilities underscore both the promise and limitations of LLMs as tools for solving the alignment problem in transportation decision-making.</description>

      <title>GO-Diff: Data-free and amortized global structure optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce GO-Diff, a diffusion-based method for global structure optimization that learns to directly sample low-energy atomic configurations without requiring prior data or explicit relaxation. GO-Diff is trained from scratch using a Boltzmann-weighted score-matching loss, leveraging only the known energy function to guide generation toward thermodynamically favorable regions. The method operates in a two-stage loop of self-sampling and model refinement, progressively improving its ability to target low-energy structures. Compared to traditional optimization pipelines, GO-Diff achieves competitive results with significantly fewer energy evaluations. Moreover, by reusing pretrained models across related systems, GO-Diff supports amortized optimization - enabling faster convergence on new tasks without retraining from scratch.</description>

      <title>Mobile Coverage Analysis using Crowdsourced Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective assessment of mobile network coverage and the precise identification of service weak spots are paramount for network operators striving to enhance user Quality of Experience (QoE). This paper presents a novel framework for mobile coverage and weak spot analysis utilising crowdsourced QoE data. The core of our methodology involves coverage analysis at the individual cell (antenna) level, subsequently aggregated to the site level, using empirical geolocation data. A key contribution of this research is the application of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) algorithm for calculating mobile network coverage. This approach models the decision hyperplane as the effective coverage contour, facilitating robust calculation of coverage areas for individual cells and entire sites. The same methodology is extended to analyse crowdsourced service loss reports, thereby identifying and quantifying geographically localised weak spots. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of this novel framework in accurately mapping mobile coverage and, crucially, in highlighting granular areas of signal deficiency, particularly within complex urban environments.</description>

      <title>Multifractality and its sources in the digital currency market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multifractality in time series analysis characterizes the presence of multiple scaling exponents, indicating heterogeneous temporal structures and complex dynamical behaviors beyond simple monofractal models. In the context of digital currency markets, multifractal properties arise due to the interplay of long-range temporal correlations and heavy-tailed distributions of returns, reflecting intricate market microstructure and trader interactions. Incorporating multifractal analysis into the modeling of cryptocurrency price dynamics enhances the understanding of market inefficiencies, may improve volatility forecasting and facilitate the detection of critical transitions or regime shifts. Based on the multifractal cross-correlation analysis (MFCCA) whose spacial case is the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA), as the most commonly used practical tools for quantifying multifractality, in the present contribution a recently proposed method of disentangling sources of multifractality in time series was applied to the most representative instruments from the digital market. They include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), decentralized exchanges (DEX) and non-fungible tokens (NFT). The results indicate the significant role of heavy tails in generating a broad multifractal spectrum. However, they also clearly demonstrate that the primary source of multifractality are temporal correlations in the series, and without them, multifractality fades out. It appears characteristic that these temporal correlations, to a large extent, do not depend on the thickness of the tails of the fluctuation distribution. These observations, made here in the context of the digital currency market, provide a further strong argument for the validity of the proposed methodology of disentangling sources of multifractality in time series.</description>

      <title>Statistical reduced order modelling for the parametric Helmholtz equation</title>

Abstract: Predictive modeling involving simulation and sensor data at the same time, is a growing challenge in computational science. Even with large-scale finite element models, a mismatch to the sensor data often remains, which can be attributed to different sources of uncertainty. For such a scenario, the statistical finite element method (statFEM) can be used to condition a simulated field on given sensor data. This yields a posterior solution which resembles the data much better and additionally provides consistent estimates of uncertainty, including model misspecification. For frequency or parameter dependent problems, occurring, e.g. in acoustics or electromagnetism, solving the full order model at the frequency grid and conditioning it on data quickly results in a prohibitive computational cost. In this case, the introduction of a surrogate in form of a reduced order model yields much smaller systems of equations. In this paper, we propose a reduced order statFEM framework relying on Krylov-based moment matching. We introduce a data model which explicitly includes the bias induced by the reduced approximation, which is estimated by an inexpensive error indicator. The results of the new statistical reduced order method are compared to the standard statFEM procedure applied to a ROM prior, i.e. without explicitly accounting for the reduced order bias. The proposed method yields better accuracy and faster convergence throughout a given frequency range for different numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Topology Optimization for Multiscale Biomimetic Spinodal Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spinodoid architected materials have drawn significant attention due to their unique nature in stochasticity, aperiodicity, and bi-continuity. Compared to classic periodic truss-, beam- and plate-based lattice architectures, spinodoids are insensitive to manufacturing defects, scalable for high throughput production, functionally graded by tunable local properties, and material failure resistant due to low-curvature morphology. However, the design of spinodoids is often hindered by the curse of dimensionality with extremely large design space of spinodoid types, material density, orientation, continuity, and anisotropy. From a design optimization perspective, while genetic algorithms are often beyond the reach of computing capacity, gradient-based topology optimization is challenged by the intricate mathematical derivation of gradient fields with respect to various spinodoid parameters. To address such challenges, we propose a data-driven multiscale topology optimization framework. Our framework reformulates the design variables of spinodoid materials as the parameters of neural networks, enabling automated computation of topological gradients. Additionally, it incorporates a Gaussian Process surrogate for spinodoid constitutive models, eliminating the need for repeated computational homogenization and enhancing the scalability of multiscale topology optimization. Compared to 'black-box' deep learning approaches, the proposed framework provides clear physical insights into material distribution. It explicitly reveals why anisotropic spinodoids with tailored orientations are favored in certain regions, while isotropic spinodoids are more suitable elsewhere. This interpretability helps to bridge the gap between data-driven design with mechanistic understanding.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Crypto-shopper: Knowledge and Preferences of Consumers Using Cryptocurrencies for Purchases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02911v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fast-growing cryptocurrency sector presents both challenges and opportunities for businesses and consumers alike. This study investigates the knowledge, expertise, and buying habits of people who shop using cryptocurrencies. Our survey of 516 participants shows that knowledge levels vary from beginners to experts. Interestingly, a segment of respondents, nearly 30%, showed high purchase frequency despite their limited knowledge. Regression analyses indicated that while domain knowledge plays a role, it only accounts for 11.6% of the factors affecting purchasing frequency. A K-means cluster analysis further segmented the respondents into three distinct groups, each having unique knowledge levels and purchasing tendencies. These results challenge the conventional idea linking extensive knowledge to increased cryptocurrency usage, suggesting other factors at play. Understanding this varying crypto-shopper demographic is pivotal for businesses, emphasizing the need for tailored strategies and user-friendly experiences. This study offers insights into current crypto-shopping behaviors and discusses future research exploring the broader impacts and potential shifts in the crypto-consumer landscape.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topology optimization is a valuable tool in engineering, facilitating the design of optimized structures. However, topological changes often require a remeshing step, which can become challenging. In this work, we propose an isogeometric approach to topology optimization driven by topological derivatives. The combination of a level-set method together with an immersed isogeometric framework allows seamless geometry updates without the necessity of remeshing. At the same time, topological derivatives provide topological modifications without the need to define initial holes [7]. We investigate the influence of higher-degree basis functions in both the level-set representation and the approximation of the solution. Two numerical examples demonstrate the proposed approach, showing that employing higher-degree basis functions for approximating the solution improves accuracy, while linear basis functions remain sufficient for the level-set function representation.</description>
