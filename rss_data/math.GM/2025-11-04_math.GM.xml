      <title>Pythagorean conics and homothetic triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates a generalisation of the Pythagorean theorem to the lengths of conic arcs constructed symmetrically on the sides of a right triangle. It is demonstrated that the theorem remains valid whenever the conic eccentricity is fixed and the ratio between the length of each arc sagitta and its corresponding side is constant. We identify the existence of a Pythagorean centre, defined as the common centre of all homotheties between the original right triangle and the enveloping right triangles of the infinite set of Pythagorean triples of conics that can be derived from it. The proofs rely on the application of both geometrical and analytical techniques starting from classical Pythagoras theorem.</description>

      <title>Generalized quasiorders: constructions and characterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiorders $\varrho\subseteq A^{2}$ have the property that an operation $f:A^{n}\to A$ preserves $\varrho$ if and only if each (unary) translation obtained from $f$ is an endomorphism of $\rho$. Generalized quasiorders $\rho\subseteq A^{m} $ are generalizations of (binary) quasiorders sharing the same property. We show how new generalized quasiorders can be obtained from given ones using well-known algebraic constructions. Special generalized quasiorders, as generalized equivalences and (weak) generalized partial orders, are introduced, which extend the corresponding notions for binary relations. It turns out that generalized equivalences can be characterized by usual equivalence relations. Extending some known results of binary quasiorders, it is shown that generalized quasiorders can be ``decomposed'' uniquely into a (weak) generalized partial order and a generalized equivalence. Furthermore, generalized quasiorders of maximal clones determined by equivalence or partial order relations are investigated. If $F=Pol\,\varrho$ is a maximal clone and $\varrho$ an equivalence relation or a lattice order, then every(!) relation in $Inv\, F$ is a generalized quasiorder. Moreover, lattice orders are characterized by this property among all partial orders. Finally we prove that each term operation of a rectangular algebra gives rise to a generalized partial order. Some problems requiring further research are also highlighted.</description>

      <title>Sine Laws with an Anti-Automorphism: A Left-Translation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stetk\ae r's matrix method is a useful tool for analyzing functional equations on semigroups involving a homomorphism $\sigma$. However, this method fails when $\sigma$ is an anti-automorphism because the underlying right-regular representation reverses composition order. To resolve this, we introduce an approach centered on the key conjugation identity $J R(\sigma(y)) J = L(y)$, where $J$ is the operator of composition with $\sigma$. This identity restores a well-behaved representation via left translations, making the matrix method applicable again. Using this approach, we extend Stetk\ae r's main structural theorem for the generalized sine law to the anti-automorphic setting. For linearly independent solutions, we show that the equation implies a simpler addition law and that the solutions obey the same transformation rules ($f\circ\sigma=\beta f$, etc.) as in the homomorphic case.</description>

      <title>Transient waves in linear dispersive media with dissipation: an approach based on the steepest descent path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of linear dispersive media it is of primary interest to gain knowledge of the impulse response of the material. The standard approach to compute the response involves a Laplace transform inversion, i.e., the solution of a Bromwich integral, which can be a notoriously troublesome problem. In this paper we propose a novel approach to the calculation of the impulse response, based on the well assessed method of the steepest descent path, which results in the replacement of the Bromwich integral with a real line integral along the steepest descent path. In this exploratory investigation, the method is explained and applied to the case study of the Klein- Gordon equation with dissipation, for which analytical solutions of the Bromwich integral are available, as to compare the numerical solutions obtained by the newly proposed method to exact ones. Since the newly proposed method, at its core, consists in replacing a Laplace transform inverse with a potentially much less demanding real line integral, the method presented here could be of general interest in the study of linear dispersive waves in presence of dissipation, as well as in other fields in which Laplace transform inversion come into play.</description>

      <title>On a power series distribution with mean parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article examines the distribution of the power series of the function $ w(y) = \left( 1 + \sqrt{1 - y} \right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}. $ The distribution of the considered function into a power series is obtained $ \left(1 + \sqrt{1 - y}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \frac{(4m)! \, 16^{-m}}{(2m)! \, (2m+1)! \, \sqrt{2}} \, y^m. $ The dispersion function is found $ \nu(x) = x (2x + 1)(4x + 1), \; x &gt; 0. $ A distribution with mean parameterization is constructed $ \Pr(\xi = k) = \binom{4k + 1}{2k} \, 2^{-k} \, x^k \, (2k + 1)^{k + \frac{1}{2}} \, (4k + 1)^{-2k - \frac{3}{2}}, \; x &gt; 0. $ It is proved that the raw moments $\alpha_m$, central moments $\mu_m$, cumulants $\chi_m, \; m = 1, 2, \ldots$ satisfy the following recurrence relations: $ \alpha_{m+1} = x \alpha_m + \nu(x) \frac{d\alpha_m}{dx}, \; \alpha_0 = 1, \; \alpha_1 = x; \quad \mu_{m+1} = m \mu_{m-1} + \nu(x) \frac{d\mu_m}{dx}, \; \mu_0 = 1, \; \mu_1 = 0; \quad \chi_{m+1} = \nu(x) \frac{d\chi_m}{dx}, \; \chi_1 = x. $</description>

      <title>Using Simple Linear Models with Truncation to Determine the Gregorian Day of the Week</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00082v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gregorian calendar -- first established for daily use on Friday, October 15th, 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII in Catholic countries -- is presently the most pervasive calendar in the world. As such, algorithms for performing various calendrical computations in accurate, performant, and easily implementable ways are extremely useful in fields like software engineering. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for determining the day of the week for any date in the Gregorian calendar. Of note, our algorithm does not rely on remembering tables of values. Instead, we encode tables needed for computation using simple linear regression with truncation to adjust for any errors present in our linear models in such a way that no tables have to be recalled. In addition, our algorithm does not require a relabeling of days, weeks, months, or years to values other than their intuitive representations. The algorithm works by taking a date in the Gregorian calendar, calculating the number of days (accounting for leap years using simple linear regression with truncation) that have elapsed since the epoch of the Gregorian calendar in 1582 from the specified date and adding this number modulo 7 to the epoch's day of the week thus, obtaining the day of the week for the requested date in numeric form.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two new proofs of the Pythagorean theorem via area rearrangement arguments starting from very simple geometric configurations. The constructions depend on an angular parameter, each choice of which yields a proof. For specific values of the parameter, we recover some classical and more recent proofs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Associativity of a two-place function $T: [0,1]^2\rightarrow [0,1]$ defined by $T(x,y)=f^{(-1)}(F(f(x),f(y)))$ where $F:[0,\infty]^2\rightarrow[0,\infty]$ is an associative function, $f: [0,1]\rightarrow [0,\infty]$ is a monotone function which satisfies either $f(x)=f(x^{+})$ when $f(x^{+})\in \mbox{Ran}(f)$ or $f(x)\neq f(y)$ for any $y\neq x$ when $f(x^{+})\notin \mbox{Ran}(f)$ for all $x\in[0,1]$ and $f^{(-1)}:[0,\infty]\rightarrow[0,1]$ is a pseudo-inverse of $f$ depends only on properties of the range of $f$. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the $T$ to be associative are presented by applying the properties of the monotone function $f$.</description>

      <title>Optional intervals event, sequential operation and their applications in physics, computer science and applied mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09471v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply algebraic theories such as set theory and group theory to analyze the execution interval and sequence of events. We propose a triple, the "Optional Intervals Event", as an abstract entity mapping to events, and define two sequential operations, "Complete Sequential Addition" for concurrent events and "Complete Sequential Multiplication" for ordered sequential events. We prove that complete sequential addition and complete sequential multiplication form semigroups, and further construct a quotient semigroup for complete sequential addition semigroup that satisfies the commutative law. Then we draw Cayley tables to visualize algebraic structures, and this additionally reveals a new mathematical object.
  With these new concepts, we provide a rigorous formalization of "starting simultaneously" thereby resolving measurement errors by using quotient semigroup of complete sequential addition semigroup, and explain why both one-by-one races and head-to-head races can determine the first place. Finally, we present other implications derived from our work.
  This work enables more rigorous event scheduling, physical simulations, and computational modeling beyond observational limitations.</description>
