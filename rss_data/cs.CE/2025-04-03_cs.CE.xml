      <title>Responsible Innovation: A Strategic Framework for Financial LLM Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial institutions of all sizes are increasingly adopting Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance credit assessments, deliver personalized client advisory services, and automate various language-intensive processes. However, effectively deploying LLMs requires careful management of stringent data governance requirements, heightened demands for interpretability, ethical responsibilities, and rapidly evolving regulatory landscapes. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured six-decision framework specifically designed for the financial sector, guiding organizations systematically from initial feasibility assessments to final deployment strategies.
  The framework encourages institutions to: (1) evaluate whether an advanced LLM is necessary at all, (2) formalize robust data governance and privacy safeguards, (3) establish targeted risk management mechanisms, (4) integrate ethical considerations early in the development process, (5) justify the initiative's return on investment (ROI) and strategic value, and only then (6) choose the optimal implementation pathway -- open-source versus proprietary, or in-house versus vendor-supported -- aligned with regulatory requirements and operational realities. By linking strategic considerations with practical steps such as pilot testing, maintaining comprehensive audit trails, and conducting ongoing compliance evaluations, this decision framework offers a structured roadmap for responsibly leveraging LLMs. Rather than acting as a rigid, one-size-fits-all solution, it shows how advanced language models can be thoughtfully integrated into existing workflows -- balancing innovation with accountability to uphold stakeholder trust and regulatory integrity.</description>

      <title>A Quality Diversity Approach to Evolving Model Rockets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model rocketry presents a design task accessible to undergraduates while remaining an interesting challenge. Allowing for variation in fins, nose cones, and body tubes presents a rich design space containing numerous ways to achieve various altitudes. Therefore, when exploring possible designs computationally, it makes sense to apply a method that produces various possibilities for decision-makers to choose from: Quality Diversity (QD). The QD methods MAP-Elites, CMA-ME, and CMA-MAE are applied to model rocket design using the open-source OpenRocket software to characterize the behavior and determine the fitness of evolved designs. Selected rockets were manufactured and launched to evaluate them in the real world. Simulation results demonstrate that CMA-ME produces the widest variety of rocket designs, which is surprising given that CMA-MAE is a more recent method designed to overcome shortcomings with CMA-ME. Real-world testing demonstrates that a wide range of standard and unconventional designs are viable, though issues with the jump from simulation to reality cause some rockets to perform unexpectedly. This paper provides a case study on applying QD to a task accessible to a broader audience than industrial engineering tasks and uncovers unexpected results about the relative performance of different QD algorithms.</description>

      <title>A User-Tunable Machine Learning Framework for Step-Wise Synthesis Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MHNpath, a machine learning-driven retrosynthetic tool designed for computer-aided synthesis planning. Leveraging modern Hopfield networks and novel comparative metrics, MHNpath efficiently prioritizes reaction templates, improving the scalability and accuracy of retrosynthetic predictions. The tool incorporates a tunable scoring system that allows users to prioritize pathways based on cost, reaction temperature, and toxicity, thereby facilitating the design of greener and cost-effective reaction routes. We demonstrate its effectiveness through case studies involving complex molecules from ChemByDesign, showcasing its ability to predict novel synthetic and enzymatic pathways. Furthermore, we benchmark MHNpath against existing frameworks, replicating experimentally validated "gold-standard" pathways from PaRoutes. Our case studies reveal that the tool can generate shorter, cheaper, moderate-temperature routes employing green solvents, as exemplified by compounds such as dronabinol, arformoterol, and lupinine.</description>

      <title>Stock Price Prediction Using Triple Barrier Labeling and Raw OHLCV Data: Evidence from Korean Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that deep learning models trained on raw OHLCV (open-high-low-close-volume) data can achieve comparable performance to traditional machine learning models using technical indicators for stock price prediction in Korean markets. While previous studies have emphasized the importance of technical indicators and feature engineering, we show that a simple LSTM network trained on raw OHLCV data alone can match the performance of sophisticated ML models that incorporate technical indicators. Using a dataset of Korean stocks from 2006 to 2024, we optimize the triple barrier labeling parameters to achieve balanced label proportions with a 29-day window and 9\% barriers. Our experiments reveal that LSTM networks achieve similar performance to traditional machine learning models like XGBoost, despite using only raw OHLCV data without any technical indicators. Furthermore, we identify that the optimal window size varies with model hidden size, with a configuration of window size 100 and hidden size 8 yielding the best performance. Additionally, our results confirm that using full OHLCV data provides better predictive accuracy compared to using only close price or close price with volume. These findings challenge conventional approaches to feature engineering in financial forecasting and suggest that simpler approaches focusing on raw data and appropriate model selection may be more effective than complex feature engineering strategies.</description>

      <title>Parallel Market Environments for FinRL Contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has shown great potential in finance. We have organized the FinRL Contests 2023-2025 featuring different financial tasks. Large language models have a strong capability to process financial texts. Integrating LLM-generated signals into FinRL is a new task, enabling agents to use both structured market data and unstructured financial text. To address the sampling bottleneck during training, we introduce GPU-based parallel market environments to improve sampling speed. In this paper, we summarize the parallel market environments used in FinRL Contests 2023-2025. Two new environments incorporate LLM-generated signals and support massively parallel simulation. Contestants utilize these environments to train agents for stock and cryptocurrency trading tasks.</description>

      <title>Solving adhesive rough contact problems with Atomic Force Microscope data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an advanced numerical framework that integrates experimentally acquired Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) data into high-fidelity simulations for adhesive rough contact problems, bridging the gap between experimental physics and computational mechanics. The proposed approach extends the eMbedded Profile for Joint Roughness (MPJR) interface finite element method to incorporate both surface topography and spatially varying adhesion properties, imported directly from AFM measurements. The adhesion behavior is modeled using a modified Lennard-Jones potential, which is locally parameterized based on the AFM-extracted adhesion peak force and energy dissipation data. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through 2D and 3D finite element simulations of a heterogeneous PS-LDPE (polystyrene matrix with low-density polyethylene inclusions) sample, where the bulk elastic properties are also experimentally characterized via AFM. The results highlight the significance of accounting for both surface adhesion variability and material bulk heterogeneity in accurately predicting contact responses.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Level Sentiment Analysis Framework for Financial Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing financial sentiment analysis methods often fail to capture the multi-faceted nature of risk in bond markets due to their single-level approach and neglect of temporal dynamics. We propose Multi-Level Sentiment Analysis based on pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs), a novel framework that systematically integrates firm-specific micro-level sentiment, industry-specific meso-level sentiment, and duration-aware smoothing to model the latency and persistence of textual impact. Applying our framework to the comprehensive Chinese bond market corpus constructed by us (2013-2023, 1.39M texts), we extracted a daily composite sentiment index. Empirical results show statistically measurable improvements in credit spread forecasting when incorporating sentiment (3.25% MAE and 10.96% MAPE reduction), with sentiment shifts closely correlating with major social risk events and firm-specific crises. This framework provides a more nuanced understanding of sentiment across different market levels while accounting for the temporal evolution of sentiment effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel approach for characterizing the mechanical behavior of atrial tissue using constitutive neural networks. Based on experimental biaxial tensile test data of healthy human atria, we automatically discover the most appropriate constitutive material model, thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional, pre-defined models. This approach offers a new perspective on modeling atrial mechanics and is a significant step towards improved simulation and prediction of cardiac health.</description>

      <title>Vectorised Parallel in Time methods for low-order discretizations with application to Porous Media problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High order methods have shown great potential to overcome performance issues of simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs) on modern hardware, still many users stick to low-order, matrixbased simulations, in particular in porous media applications. Heterogeneous coefficients and low regularity of the solution are reasons not to employ high order discretizations. We present a new approach for the simulation of instationary PDEs that allows to partially mitigate the performance problems. By reformulating the original problem we derive a parallel in time time integrator that increases the arithmetic intensity and introduces additional structure into the problem. By this it helps accelerate matrix-based simulations on modern hardware architectures. Based on a system for multiple time steps we will formulate a matrix equation that can be solved using vectorised solvers like Block Krylov methods. The structure of this approach makes it applicable for a wide range of linear and nonlinear problems. In our numerical experiments we present some first results for three different PDEs, a linear convection-diffusion equation, a nonlinear diffusion-reaction equation and a realistic example based on the Richards' equation.</description>

      <title>Grammar-based Ordinary Differential Equation Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The understanding and modeling of complex physical phenomena through dynamical systems has historically driven scientific progress, as it provides the tools for predicting the behavior of different systems under diverse conditions through time. The discovery of dynamical systems has been indispensable in engineering, as it allows for the analysis and prediction of complex behaviors for computational modeling, diagnostics, prognostics, and control of engineered systems. Joining recent efforts that harness the power of symbolic regression in this domain, we propose a novel framework for the end-to-end discovery of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), termed Grammar-based ODE Discovery Engine (GODE). The proposed methodology combines formal grammars with dimensionality reduction and stochastic search for efficiently navigating high-dimensional combinatorial spaces. Grammars allow us to seed domain knowledge and structure for both constraining, as well as, exploring the space of candidate expressions. GODE proves to be more sample- and parameter-efficient than state-of-the-art transformer-based models and to discover more accurate and parsimonious ODE expressions than both genetic programming- and other grammar-based methods for more complex inference tasks, such as the discovery of structural dynamics. Thus, we introduce a tool that could play a catalytic role in dynamics discovery tasks, including modeling, system identification, and monitoring tasks.</description>
