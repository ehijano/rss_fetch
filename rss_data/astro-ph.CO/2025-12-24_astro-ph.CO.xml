      <title>SN 2025ogs: A Spectroscopically-Normal Type Ia Supernova at z = 2 as a Benchmark for Redshift Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will provide a revolutionary measurement of the Universe's expansion kinematics, driven by dark matter and dark energy, out to $z \approx 3$. The accuracy of this measurement is predicated on the assumption that standardized Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) luminosities do not evolve with redshift. If present, SN Ia luminosity evolution is expected to be most detectable in the dark matter-dominated era of the Universe ($z \gtrsim 1.5$), with its effects becoming more easily distinguishable from dark energy variation at increasing redshift. We present JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of SN 2025ogs, a normal SN Ia at $z = 2.05 \pm 0.01$. This SN offers a key point of comparison for interpreting future high-redshift SN Ia samples. The NIRCam light curve indicates a blue color ($B - V = -0.27 \pm 0.06$ mag) and a moderately fast decline ($\Delta m_{15}(B) = 1.55 \pm 0.15$ mag), both within standard criteria for inclusion in cosmological analyses. Its luminosity distance is in $1.0\sigma$ agreement with a standard flat $\Lambda$CDM model, as well as with current cosmological constraints from the Dark Energy Survey (DES 5yr) and Pantheon+. The NIRSpec spectrum displays all of the hallmark absorption features of a normal SN Ia observed at peak brightness. We find that the rest-frame optical color, rest-frame near-ultraviolet properties, and Si II line strengths are all consistent with the moderately fast decline inferred from the light curve. Multiple absorption features (Ca II H&amp;K, O I $\lambda7774$, and the Ca II NIR triplet) all appear at a lower blueshift relative to a sample of low-$z$ SNe Ia. Together, these results suggest that SN Ia standardization remains robust at $z \approx 2$, and also highlight the importance of JWST spectroscopy for uncovering evolutionary effects that could impact Roman's high-precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>A multiwavelength study of an early galaxy group merger in COSMOS revealed by two tailed radio galaxies at z = 0.35</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of two tailed radio galaxies in the COSMOS field, associated with a massive, dynamically unrelaxed galaxy group detected in X-rays at z = 0.349. One of them is a wide-angle tail (WAT) galaxy, supporting the role of WATs as tracers of dynamically young groups and clusters. Our multiwavelength analysis combines VLA radio data, HST-ACS imaging, COSMOS2020 photometric redshifts, COSMOS2015 photometry, the newest compilation of spectroscopic redshifts in COSMOS, and X-ray observations from Chandra and XMM-Newton. We used these data to study the tailed radio galaxies, their host galaxies, and the group environment. Both radio galaxies are hosted by massive ($\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=11.88\pm0.03$ and $\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=11.49\pm0.06$), red, elliptical galaxies with extended stellar halos, as revealed by a color, magnitude, and stellar mass analysis combined with GALFIT modeling and surface-brightness profiles. One corresponds to the brightest group galaxy (BGG), while the other is the second-brightest. A diffuse intragroup medium (IGM) is characterized by its irregular shape and the analysis of the X-ray spectra of the group core reveals high temperature ($T_X=2.4\pm0.6\hspace{0.1cm}\mathrm{keV}$) and an electron density of $(8.2\pm0.3)\times 10^{-4}\hspace{0.1cm}\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. A galaxy overdensity associated with the group was detected via Voronoi tessellation, using COSMOS2020 CLASSIC photometric redshifts, displaying an irregular morphology, along with evidence of substructure. Assuming the jet bending results from interaction with the IGM, we find a high relative velocity between the BGG and the IGM ($v_{\mathrm{BGG/IGM}} \gtrsim 540$ km/s), primarily due to bulk gas motion. Our findings indicate a dynamically young system in the early stages of assembly via group-group merging.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on early time non-phantom behaviour of dynamical dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dynamical dark energy models that allow for general late time behaviour while admitting non-phantom dynamics at early times, including thawing, scaling$+$thawing, and effective fluid extensions. Using current cosmological data, we find that the standard background parameters remain tightly constrained and stable across all models, indicating no significant impact of these dynamics on the late time expansion history. At low redshift, parametrizations with a time-dependent equation of state, particularly CPL, show a $\sim2\sigma$ preference for evolution away from $w=-1$, driven by phantom-like behaviour. We then examine the observational consequences of allowing non-phantom dark energy at early times through scaling type dynamics. The data impose strong lower bounds on the steepness of the exponential potential $\gtrsim 20-30$, forcing the dark energy density to remain below the percent level around matter-radiation equality. Consequently, early dark energy is tightly constrained, and neither scaling nor tracker-type dynamics can produce a sufficiently large early dark energy component to alleviate the Hubble tension. While late time dynamical dark energy can improve the goodness of fit, the inclusion of early time scaling does not provide additional improvement and is strongly penalised by model selection criteria, leading to a disfavouring of such scenarios.</description>

      <title>Parity-odd Four-Point Correlation Function from DESI Data Release 1 Luminous Red Galaxy Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parity-odd four-point function provides a unique probe of fundamental symmetries and potential new physics in the large-scale structure of the Universe. We present measurements of the parity-odd four-point function using the DESI DR1 LRG sample and assess its detection significance. Our analysis considers both auto- and cross-correlations, using two complementary approaches to the covariance: (i) the full analytic covariance matrix applied to the uncompressed data vector, and (ii) a compressed data vector combined with a hybrid covariance matrix constructed from simulations and analytic estimates. When using the full analytic covariance matrix without corrections, we observe apparent auto-correlation signals with significance up to $4\sigma$. However, this excess is also consistent with a mismatch between the statistical fluctuations estimated from the simulations and those present in the real data. Our findings therefore suggest that the parity-odd signal in the current DESI DR1 LRG sample is consistent with zero. We note, however, that the low completeness of this sample may have a non-negligible impact on the detection sensitivity. Future data releases with improved completeness will be crucial for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Abundance of cosmic voids in EFT of dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic voids in the large-scale structure are among the useful probes for testing gravity on cosmological scales. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of voids in the Horndeski theory using the effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy. Modeling the void formation with the dynamics of spherical mass shells, we study how modifications of gravity encoded into the EFT of dark energy change the linearly extrapolated critical density contrast that is relevant for the criterion for void formation, with particular focus on the time-dependent parameter characterizing the effect of kinetic braiding. It is found that the change in the critical density contrast is one order of magnitude smaller than the dimensionless EFT parameter because of a slight imbalance between two compensating effects. We then compute the void abundance using the Sheth--van de Weygaert void size function and demonstrate that it exhibits scale-dependent modifications. It is shown that the modifications to the void size function on small scales are almost entirely determined by the modified linear matter power spectrum, while the modifications on large scales are dominated by the contributions from the linear matter spectrum and the critical density contrast.</description>

      <title>Decay of $f(R)$ quintessence into dark matter: mitigating the Hubble tension?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a revised cosmological scenario that extends the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) framework by incorporating metric $f(R)$ gravity in the Jordan frame. In this model, the dark energy component arises from a non-minimally coupled scalar field, decomposed into a smooth background (set to unity to recover General Relativity) and a rapidly varying, massive fluctuation that decays into the dark matter sector. In the near-GR limit, this setup provides a phenomenological extension of $\Lambda$CDM characterized by two additional parameters: the present-day value of the scalar fluctuation and a normalized decay rate. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of low-redshift cosmological data, comprising Type Ia Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), and Cosmic Chronometer measurements, we find that the proposed model achieves a better overall fit than $\Lambda$CDM, while the Bayesian evidence remains statistically inconclusive given the inclusion of two extra parameters. The model predicts a moderate increase in the inferred value of $H_0$ and an improved consistency with DESI BAO data when adopting the SH0ES prior. Furthermore, describing dark matter particle creation as a transition phase in the late Universe offers an intriguing physical interpretation, potentially capturing features already present in current data and providing a promising avenue to explore extensions of the standard cosmological model within modified gravity frameworks.</description>

      <title>A Spectrum of Cosmological Rips and Their Observational Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified dark energy framework capable of generating a continuous spectrum of cosmological ``rip'' scenarios -- including the Big Rip, Grand Rip, Mild Rip, Little Rip, Little Sibling of the Big Rip, and the newly found Dollhouse Rip -- while ensuring a physically consistent evolution across cosmic history. Building on earlier phenomenological proposals, we introduce a barotropic equation-of-state parameter with a sigmoid-like correction to guarantee a strictly positive dark energy density and to avoid early-time pathologies commonly present in previous models. Using this formulation, closed-form analytic expressions for the energy density can be obtained. This, in turn, enables a systematic classification of future singularities based on the signs and magnitudes of two key parameters of the model. We test these scenarios with state-of-the-art cosmological probes, including DESI DR2 BAO, cosmic chronometers, CMB compressed likelihoods, and the Pantheon+ supernovae sample. According to our Bayesian analysis, all rip scenarios yield best-fit parameters compatible with $\Lambda$CDM at the $1\sigma$ level, with Bayes factors weakly favoring $\Lambda$CDM. The mild, logarithmic evolution of the proposed dark energy density prevents current observations from distinguishing among the different future fates. We conclude that, for rip cosmologies to gain observational support over $\Lambda$CDM, they must display more accentuated late-time dynamical features -- such as perhaps rapid transitions or a phantom-divide crossing -- within the redshift range probed by present surveys.</description>

      <title>From Cosmology to Cosmonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For most of its history, cosmology was a qualitatively constrained discourse on the universe, shaped by limited observational access and the absence of global dynamical laws. This situation has changed decisively in recent decades. Modern cosmology is now driven by an unprecedented flow of high-precision data from a wide range of independent probes, including the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, gravitational lensing, cosmic chronometers, redshift-space distortions, gravitational-wave standard sirens, and emerging 21-cm observations, among others. This observational wealth is matched by a concrete theoretical and mathematical framework, based on general relativity, which provides the dynamical equations governing the evolution of spacetime and matter at cosmic scales. Combined with explicit background and perturbative equations, this framework enables quantitative, predictive, and falsifiable descriptions of cosmic evolution. Thus, cosmology operates today as a nomological natural science of the observable universe, characterized by general laws, predictive power, and systematic empirical testing. We argue that this epistemic transformation motivates a corresponding conceptual shift, directly analogous to the historical transition from astrology to astronomy. In this sense, the transition from cosmology to \emph{cosmonomy} should begin to be discussed among cosmologists, or, more precisely, among cosmonomers.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy models in light of the latest observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study several models and parameterizations of dynamical dark energy (DE) that have been studied already in the past, in conjunction with the recently proposed model $w$XCDM, the running vacuum model (RVM) with and without a threshold at $z=1$ and two variants of it, the RRVM and the ``flipped RVM'', and compare them all with the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model and the popular $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization. We use two standard sets of cosmological data, one including distant supernovae from Pantheon$+$ and the other from DES-Y5. The rest of the data (BAO from DESI DR2 and CMB from Planck PR4) are shared by the two sets. They are analyzed with the help of \texttt{CLASS}. No structure formation data are utilized for this analysis and no use is made of the SH0ES calibration of $H_0$. Even so, we find that the flipped RVM and to a lesser extent the $w$XCDM and the RVM with threshold, point to significant evidence of dynamical DE, at a level comparable to $w_0w_a$CDM, more conspicuously for the dataset that involves DES-Y5 observations. We also find that while more traditional models studied in the past, in which there is an exchange between vacuum energy and cold dark matter (through e.g. an interactive source proportional either to the density of dark matter or to that of vacuum) still hint at dynamical DE, the strength of the statistical signal (which we assess through information criteria and other estimators) is nevertheless less pronounced. Finally, we discuss the ability of the various models to explain the data by performing an analysis of their effective equation-of-state parameters and corresponding evolution of their dark energy densities.</description>

      <title>$N_{\textrm{eff}}$ Constraint on Pseudo-Dirac Neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After the electroweak symmetry breaking, we can write down two types of mass for the Standard Model neutrinos, Dirac or Majorana. It is often said that both types of mass cannot be distinguished in neutrino oscillation phenomena. This is in fact not true if neutrinos are pseudo-Dirac (strictly speaking still Majorana) where they mix almost maximally with sterile neutrinos to form pseudo-Dirac pairs. If this is indeed realized in Nature, what we observe experimentally as three mass eigenstates are actually three pairs of mass eigenstates with yet-to-be-measured new mass splitting among each pair. While the new mass squared splitting of the first and second mass eigenstates have stringent constraints from solar neutrino to be $|\delta m_{1,2}^2| \lesssim10^{-11}\,\textrm{eV}^{2}$, the one regarding the third mass eigenstate has a weaker constraint $|\delta m_3^2| \lesssim10^{-5}\,\textrm{eV}^{2}$. By keeping only one nonzero pseudo-Dirac mass squared splitting at a time, we derive an effective 3+1 description for the pseudo-Dirac scenario. Then we use the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) constraint on neutrino relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\textrm{eff}}$ to derive a new constraint $|\delta m_3^2| &lt; 2 \times 10^{-6}\,{\rm eV}^2$ and show that the future CMB-S4 and CMB-HD can improve this bound by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent flux backgrounds in type IIB supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically construct families of type IIB supergravity backgrounds in ten dimensions in which the four-dimensional metric is time dependent, while the six-dimensional internal space is an arbitrary compact Calabi-Yau manifold (with no restriction on holonomy) up to an overall time-dependent scale factor. Our solutions include cases with all fluxes (three-form and self-dual five-form) switched on, as well as cases with subsets of these fluxes, together with a time-dependent axiodilaton in most cases. These constructions require no local sources. We show that the associated energy-momentum tensors (both 10D and the resulting 4D effective) satisfy the null, weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions. In our explicit constructions, the Ricci scalar of the four-dimensional Einstein frame metric is negative; such backgrounds may find applications to anisotropic or FLRW cosmologies in the early universe. We also revisit the Maldacena--Nu\~nez no-go analysis, incorporating new elements that appear in our constructions, namely an overall noncompact spacetime-dependent scale factor multiplying the internal metric, and field strengths with components partially covering the noncompact directions. We argue that, with these generalizations, a four-dimensional Einstein-frame metric with positive Ricci scalar cannot be ruled out by such an analysis.</description>

      <title>Dissipative cosmology with $\Lambda$ from the first law of thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We phenomenologically derive a cosmological model that includes both a cosmological constant term $\Lambda/3$ and a dissipative driving term $\beta (2 H^{2} + \dot{H})$ by applying the first law of thermodynamics to matter creation cosmology. Here $H$, $\dot{H}$, and $\beta$ are the Hubble parameter, the time derivative of $H$, and a non-negative dimensionless coefficient, respectively. The dissipative term is proportional to the Ricci scalar curvature, suggesting that the dynamic creation pressure has the same dependence. We examine the model's background evolution in the late universe and its horizon thermodynamics. The present model supports a transition from a decelerating universe to an accelerating universe when $\beta &lt;0.5$. The second law of thermodynamics is always satisfied on the horizon, and maximization of entropy is satisfied in the final stage. We examine constraints on the present model using observed Hubble parameter data and the transitional and thermodynamic constraints and find that a weakly dissipative universe with $\Lambda$ is likely favored and consistent with our Universe. We also discuss irreversible entropy due to adiabatic particle creation, assuming a holographic-like matter creation cosmology.</description>

      <title>A non-compact QCD axion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmology of an axion that is fundamentally non-compact. During inflation, fluctuations of the effectively massless field populate many QCD vacua, thereby evading conventional isocurvature constraints while generating domain walls -- without accompanying cosmic strings. A small non-QCD contribution to the axion potential is required to trigger the timely collapse of domain walls; as a consequence, a residual amount of CP violation in the strong sector must exist, potentially within reach of planned experiments. Non-compact axions can account for the entirety of the dark matter abundance, and the collapse of domain walls sources a stochastic gravitational-wave background at nanohertz frequencies. Such axion dynamics can be embedded in top-down constructions -- such as Weyl-invariant Einstein-Cartan gravity -- where the tilting of the axion potential arises automatically.</description>

      <title>Novel Light Dark Matter Detection with Quantum Parity Detector Using Qubit Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design and the sensitivity reach of the Qubit-based Light Dark Matter detection experiment. We propose the novel two-chip design to reduce signal dissipation, with quantum parity measurement to enhance single-phonon detection sensitivity. We demonstrate the performance of the detector with full phonon and quasiparticle simulations. The experiment is projected to detect $\gtrsim 30$ meV energy deposition with nearly $100\%$ efficiency and high energy resolution. The sensitivity to $m_\chi\gtrsim 0.01$ MeV dark matter scattering cross section is expected to be advanced by orders of magnitude for both light and heavy mediators, and similar improvements will be achieved for axion and dark photon absorption in the $0.04$-$0.2$ eV mass range.</description>

      <title>Cosmological consequences of spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics and the $\Lambda$CDM model of cosmology provide an incomplete description of our Universe. Both models face challenges, including explaining the nature of dark matter, the origin of the Universe's initial conditions, and the fine-tuning of the Higgs boson mass. This thesis investigates the cosmological implications of spontaneous symmetry breaking to address some of these issues, focusing on theories with a non-trivial vacuum structure. We introduce a novel class of elementary scalars called ''accidents'', which emerge as accidentally flat directions in the vacuum manifold: unlike Nambu-Goldstone boson directions, accident directions are not related to any symmetry. Radiative corrections induce a mass for the accidents that is one-loop suppressed with respect to naive expectations, making them naturally light. We propose that accidents can act as viable dark matter candidates, and as the inflaton driving cosmic inflation. We construct a model of hybrid inflation in which the inflaton potential is an accident direction and is naturally flat. In models of accident inflation where the vacuum manifold has a non-trivial topology, cosmic strings and domain walls form after the end of inflation. Such topological defects generate a stochastic background of gravitational waves. Finally, we investigate the cosmological production of dark magnetic monopoles. Focusing on 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles from SO(3)$\rightarrow$SO(2) symmetry breaking, we explore both second-order and first-order phase transitions, and we identify the regions of parameter space where the monopole relic density matches the one of dark matter. This model also features stable massive gauge bosons. We find that the relic density of dark gauge bosons is always far larger than the one of monopoles, concluding that dark monopoles cannot constitute a sizeable fraction of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Quantum Field Theory and Axion Electrodynamics in curved spacetimes</title>

Abstract: Axions are hypothetical pseudoscalar particles introduced initially as a solution to the Strong CP problem in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and they also arise naturally in a broad class of low-energy compactifications of string theory. Astrophysical, cosmological, and laboratory constraints require axions to be extremely weakly coupled to Standard Model particles, making them viable dark matter candidates .This PhD thesis presents original results developed over three years of research, focusing on axion cosmology and axion electrodynamics. These topics address the production of axions and their associated topological defects in the early Universe, as well as the interactions of axions with Standard Model particles. The analysis combines methods from non-equilibrium quantum field theory and quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. After reviewing the foundations of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes and cosmology, the thesis introduces the Strong CP problem and the Peccei-Quinn mechanism, including the PQWW axion model and its invisible extensions. Ultraviolet completions of QCD axion theories are discussed in both field-theoretic and extra-dimensional frameworks. A significant part of the thesis is devoted to axion electrodynamics, where a classical axion background modifies Maxwell's equations and electromagnetic observables. The non-equilibrium dynamics of self-interacting axion fields coupled to the Standard Model or to a dark sector are also studied using the two-particle-irreducible effective action, and applied to pre- and post-inflationary cosmological scenarios, yielding new insights and preliminary constraints.</description>

      <title>Signatures of High-Frequency Gravitational Waves in Electromagnetic Cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Similar to axions, gravitational waves (GW) can induce oscillating electromagnetic fields inside electromagnetic cavities. We explore their experimental sensitivity to monochromatic and non-monochromatic GW signals, using the total deposited energy as a primary measure. Focusing on cylindrical and spherical cavities, we present the coupling coefficients of GWs to the dominant electromagnetic resonances in transverse-traceless gauge, which is most appropriate in this regime. By considering the superposition of degenerate modes, we further examine their angular sensitivity. In addition, we calculate the response of a spherical cavity to non-monochromatic GWs emitted by primordial black hole mergers. We find that, for transient signals, a high quality factor with $Q \gtrsim 10^5$ does not necessarily enhance experimental sensitivity. In fact, even in the most optimistic scenario, only mergers within the solar system yield an observable energy deposit in the cavity.</description>

      <title>Full-sky Models of Galactic Microwave Emission and Polarization at Sub-arcminute Scales for the Python Sky Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarized foreground emission from the Galaxy is one of the biggest challenges facing current and upcoming cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization experiments. We develop new models of polarized Galactic dust and synchrotron emission at CMB frequencies that draw on the latest observational constraints, that employ the ``polarization fraction tensor'' framework to couple intensity and polarization in a physically motivated way, and that allow for stochastic realizations of small-scale structure at sub-arcminute angular scales currently unconstrained by full-sky data. We implement these models into the publicly available Python Sky Model (PySM) software and additionally provide PySM interfaces to select models of dust and CO emission from the literature. We characterize the behavior of each model by quantitatively comparing it to observational constraints in both maps and power spectra, demonstrating an overall improvement over previous PySM models. Finally, we synthesize models of the various Galactic foreground components into a coherent suite of three plausible microwave skies that span a range of astrophysical complexity allowed by current data.</description>

      <title>Is Dynamical Dark Energy Necessary? DESI BAO and Modified Recombination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) exhibit a mild-to-moderate tension with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernova (SN) observations when interpreted within the $\Lambda$CDM framework. This discrepancy has been cited as evidence for dynamical dark energy (DDE). Given the profound implications of DDE for fundamental physics, we explore whether the tension can instead be resolved by modifying the physics of recombination. We find that a phenomenological model of modified recombination can effectively reconcile the BAO and CMB datasets and, unlike DDE, also predicts a higher Hubble constant $H_0$, thereby partially alleviating the Hubble tension. A global fit to BAO, CMB, and calibrated SN data favors modified recombination over DDE.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves from self-resonant preheating in $\alpha$-attractor models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After the inflationary phase, the universe enters the preheating phase, during which the inflaton field rolls down its potential and oscillates. When the potential significantly deviates from a parabolic shape at its minimum, these oscillations trigger an instability in the scalar perturbations, leading to their amplification. This phenomenon, known as self-resonance, has important implications in cosmology. Notably, since scalar perturbations couple to tensor perturbations at second order in the equations of motion, this amplification results in the production of Gravitational Waves (GWs), referred to as Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs). In this study, we investigate the production of SIGWs during the preheating phase for a class of inflationary models known as $\alpha$-attractors, characterized by a single parameter $\alpha$. We focus on small values of this parameter, specifically $\alpha \sim O(10^{-1} - 10^{-4})$, where the self-resonance effect is particularly pronounced. We obtain lower bounds on this parameter, $\log_{10}(\alpha)&gt;-3.54$ for the T-model and $\log_{10}(\alpha)&gt;-3.17$ for the E-model, based on the energy density of SIGWs constrained by Big Bang nucleosynthesis, which ultimately translates into lower bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r&gt;9.61\times10^{-7}$ for the T-model and $r&gt;2.25\times10^{-6}$ for the E-model. Note that these bounds on $\alpha$ and $r$ are derived within the linear framework of tensor fluctuations at the level of equations of motion, which nevertheless include scalar-scalar-tensor interactions with metric and matter fields. However, fully non-linear approaches, with all higher-order metric fluctuations, would be needed in the future to further validate these conclusions.</description>

      <title>The Bispectrum of Intrinsic Alignments: II. Precision Comparison Against Dark Matter Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure three-dimensional bispectra of halo intrinsic alignments (IA) and dark matter overdensities in real space from N-body simulations for halos of mass $10^{12}-10^{12.5} M_\odot /h$. We show that their multipoles with respect to the line of sight can be accurately described by a tree-level perturbation theory model on large scales ($k\lesssim 0.11\,h$/Mpc) at $z=0$. For these scales and in a simulation volume of 1 (Gpc/$h)^3$, we detect the bispectrum monopole $B_{\delta\delta E}^{00}$ at SNR $\sim 30$ and the two quadrupoles $B_{\delta \delta E}^{11}$ and $B_{\delta \delta E}^{20}$ at SNR $\sim 25$ and SNR $\sim 15$, respectively. We also report similar SNR for the lowest order multipoles of $B_{\delta EE}$ and $B_{EEE}$, although these are largely driven by stochastic contributions. We show that the first and second order EFT parameters are consistent with those obtained from fitting the IA power spectrum analysis at next-to-leading order, without requiring any priors to break degeneracies for the quadratic bias parameters. Moreover, the inclusion of higher multipole moments of $B_{\delta\delta E}$ greatly reduces the errors on second order bias parameters, by factors of 5 or more. The IA bispectrum thus provides an effective means of determining higher order shape bias parameters, thereby characterizing the scale dependence of the IA signal. We also detect parity-odd bispectra such as $B_{\delta \delta B}$ and $B_{\delta EB}$ at $\sim 10 \sigma$ significance or more for $k&lt;0.15\,h$/Mpc and they are consistent with the parity-even sector. Furthermore, we check that the Gaussian covariance approximation works reasonably well on the scales we consider here. These results lay the groundwork for using the bispectrum of IA in cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>Cosmographic Footprints of Dynamical Dark Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel cosmographic framework to trace the late-time kinematics of the Universe without assuming any underlying dynamics. The method relies on generalized Pad\'e-$(2,1)$ expansions around arbitrary pivot redshifts, which, compared to state-of-the-art calculations, reduce truncation errors by up to two orders of magnitude at high redshift and yield more precise constraints by defining cosmographic parameters exactly where the data lie. This avoids extrapolations, mitigates degeneracies, and enables a clean disentangling of their effects. Using the latest low-redshift datasets, we center the generalized expansion in multiple bins across $z\in[0,1]$ and obtain precise constraints on the redshift evolution of cosmographic parameters. We find that all key parameters deviate from their $\Lambda$CDM predictions in a redshift-dependent way that can be naturally explained within dynamical Dark Energy scenarios. The deceleration parameter $q(z)$ follows a redshift evolution consistent with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization, while the generalized $Om(z)$ diagnostic shows deviations of up to $\sim4\sigma$ from the constant $\Lambda$CDM expectation, closely matching the CPL predictions. Taken together, these results point to footprints of dynamical Dark Energy in the kinematics of the Universe at $z\lesssim 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a compelling dark matter candidate and a unique probe of small-scale cosmological fluctuations. Their formation is usually attributed to large positive curvature perturbations, which collapse upon Hubble re-entry during radiation domination. In this work we investigate instead the role of negative curvature perturbations, corresponding to the growth of primordial void (PV) like regions. Using numerical relativity simulations, we show that sufficiently deep PV can undergo a nonlinear rebounce at the center, generating an effective overdensity that eventually collapses into a PBH. We determine the critical threshold for this process for a variety of equations of state, and demonstrate that the resulting black holes obey a scaling relation analogous to the standard overdensity case. These results establish primordial voids as a novel channel for PBH formation and highlight their potential impact on PBH abundances and cosmological signatures.</description>

Abstract: Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey have reignited the debate on the true nature of dark energy, challenging the standard cosmological constant model of cosmology. The results suggest a preference for dark energy to be dynamical rather than a cosmological constant. Several recent analyses of DESI data indicate that the universe's expansion may not be accelerating in the way suggested by supernova based cosmology. Motivated by these studies, we investigated a tachyon type scalar field $\phi$ as a model for dark energy, assuming an exponential potential for the field and performed parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Such a model offers solutions that have $w \sim -1$ and are decelerating without requiring a phantom like equation of state. The present day value of the equation of state parameter is treated as a free parameter; however, for the reference model, we fix its present value to $-1$. The analysis is carried out using the latest Supernovae dataset (Pantheon+) and BAO measurements from DESI. The results show that both types of datasets consistently predict a turnaround in the equation of state, regardless of whether $w_{\phi 0}$ is treated as a free parameter or fixed to $-1$. The corresponding deceleration parameter also exhibits a future turnaround for both datasets when $w_{\phi 0}$ is free. However, in the reference model with $w_{\phi 0} = -1$, the deceleration parameter instead approaches $-1$ asymptotically. A model comparison using the Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria shows that the Pantheon+ dataset favors the free $w_{\phi 0}$ scenario, while BAO observations prefer the $w_{\phi 0} = -1$ case. This indicates a disagreement in the future evolution trends predicted by the two datasets within the tachyon type dark energy model.</description>

Abstract: We review the conservation laws of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in an expanding homogeneous and isotropic Universe that can be applied to the study of early Universe physics during the epoch of radiation domination. The conservation laws for a conducting perfect fluid with relativistic bulk velocities in an expanding background are presented, extending previous results that apply in the limit of subrelativistic bulk motion. Furthermore, it is shown that the subrelativistic limit presents new corrections that have not been considered in previous work. We discuss the conformal invariance of the MHD equations for a radiation-dominated fluid and different types of scaling of the fluid variables that are relevant for other equations of state when the bulk velocity is subrelativistic. In particular, we review the super-comoving coordinates that scale the time coordinate with the Universe expansion, and present a particular choice that allows the equations to become conformally flat for any choice of the equation of state. Imperfect relativistic fluids are briefly described but their detailed study is not included in this work. We review the propagation of sound waves, Alfv\'en waves, and magnetosonic waves in the early Universe plasma. The Boris correction for relativistic Alfv\'en speeds is presented and adapted for early Universe applications. This review is an extension, including new results, of part of the lectures presented at the minicourse ``Simulations of Early Universe Magnetohydrodynamics'' lectured by A. Roper Pol and J. Schober at EPFL, as part of the six-week program ``Generation, evolution, and observations of cosmological magnetic fields'' at the Bernoulli Center in May 2024.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the phenomenology of MOND, we propose a theory based on a fundamental non Abelian Yang-Mills gauge field with gravitational coupling constant (a "graviphoton") emerging in a regime of weak acceleration, i.e. below the MOND acceleration scale. Using the formalism of the effective field theory and invoking a mechanism of gravitational polarization of the dark matter medium, we show that generic solutions of this theory reproduce the deep MOND limit without having to introduce in an ad hoc way an arbitrary function in the action. In this framework, MOND is due to the existence of a new sector of the standard model of particle physics. Furthermore, the model involves a violation of the local Lorentz invariance in the low acceleration regime. We show how to restore the general covariance of the model by adding one gravitational degree of freedom in the form of the scalar Khronon field.</description>

      <title>Multifaceted Supercooling: From PTA to LIGO</title>

Abstract: Supercooled phase transitions, as predicted, e.g., in near-conformal and confining extensions of the Standard Model (SM), are established sources of strong stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs). In this work, we investigate another facet of such transitions: their significant and largely uncharted impact on gravitational wave spectra originating from independent cosmological sources. Focusing on gravitational waves produced by a metastable cosmic string network, we show that an intervening supercooled phase, initiating thermal inflation, can reshape and suppress the high-frequency part of the spectrum. This mechanism reopens regions of string parameter space previously excluded by LIGO's null results, while remaining compatible with the nanohertz SGWB signal reported by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). The resulting total spectrum typically exhibits a dual-component structure, sourced by both string decay and the phase transition itself, rendering the scenario observationally distinctive. We systematically classify the viable parameter space and identify regions accessible to upcoming detectors such as Advanced LIGO, LISA, and ET.</description>

      <title>Decay and lifetime of oscillons coupled to an external scalar field: Insights from instability band analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13276</link>

Abstract: Oscillons are long-lived, spherically symmetric solitons that can arise in real scalar field theories with potentials shallower than quadratic ones. They are considered to form via parametric resonance during the preheating stage after inflation and have extended lifetimes. However, the estimation of their lifespan becomes complicated when taking into account the interactions between the inflaton field and other fields, as naturally expected in realistic reheating scenarios. In this study, we investigate how the lifetime of a single oscillon is affected by the coupling to the external real scalar field. By numerically computing the instability bands of the external field with the inhomogeneous oscillon profile as background, we show that the resonance behavior depends intricately on the coupling strength and shape of the oscillon. We analyze distinct instability mechanisms that dominate across different regimes of the coupling strength and oscillon shapes. Especially, we show that the parametric resonance fails to occur when the oscillon size is too limited to drive enhancement of the external field. Furthermore, our simulations show that as the oscillon loses energy, the exponential growth of the external field can terminate before the oscillon reaches its critical energy for collapse, which indicates that the external field does not necessarily lead to rapid destruction of oscillons even in the presence of strong coupling or with large amplitudes. These results suggest that oscillons can remain long-lived across a wide range of coupling strengths, with potential implications for their role in cosmological evolution.</description>
