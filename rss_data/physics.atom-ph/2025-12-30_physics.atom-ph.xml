      <title>Magneto-Optical Trapping of a Metal Hydride Molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a three-dimensional magneto-optical trap (MOT) of a metal hydride molecule, CaH. We are able to scatter $\sim$$10^{4}$ photons with vibrational loss covered up to vibrational quantum number $\nu=2$. This allows us to laser slow the molecular beam near zero velocity with a "white-light" technique and subsequently load it into a radio-frequency MOT. The MOT contains 230(40) molecules, limited by beam source characteristics and predissociative loss of CaH. The temperature of the MOT is below one millikelvin. The predissociative loss mechanism could, in turn, facilitate controlled dissociation of the molecule, offering a possible route to optical trapping of hydrogen atoms for precision spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Double to tenfold M-shell photoionization of singly charged lanthanum ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the photon-ion merged-beams technique at the PETRA\,III synchrotron light source, we have measured cross sections for double and up to tenfold photoionization of La$^{+}$ ions by a single photon in the energy range 820--1400~eV, where resonances and thresholds occur that are associated with the excitation or ionization of one $M$-shell electron. These cross sections represent experimental benchmark data for the further development of quantum theoretical methods, which will have to provide the bulk of the atomic data required for the modeling of nonequilibrium plasmas such as kilonovae. In the present work, we have upgraded the Jena Atomic Calculator (JAC) and pushed the state-of-the-art of quantum calculations for heavy many-electron systems to new limits. In particular, we have performed large-scale calculations of the La$^+$ photoabsorption cross section and of the deexcitation cascades, which set in after the initial creation of a $3d$ hole. Our theoretical results largely agree with our experimental findings. However, our theoretical product-ion charge state distributions are somewhat narrower than the experimental ones, which is most probably due to the simplifications necessary to keep the cascade calculations tractable.</description>

      <title>Theoretical calculations of isotope shifts in highly charged Ni$^{12+}$ ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present relativistic many-body perturbation theory plus configuration interaction (MBPT+CI) calculations of the lowest four excited states of Ni$^{12+}$, a promising candidate for highly charged ion (HCI) optical clocks. By combining the convergence behavior from multiple calculation models, we perform a detailed analysis of the electron-correlation effects and both the excitation energies and their uncertainties are obtained. Our computed energies for the first two excited states deviate from experimental values by less than $10~\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, with relative uncertainties estimated below $0.2\%$. Building on the same computational procedure, we calculate the mass shift and field shift constants for the lowest four excited states of Ni$^{12+}$, and the resulting isotope shifts exhibit valence-correlation-induced relative uncertainties below the $1\%$ level. These results provide essential atomic-structure input for high-precision isotope shift spectroscopy in Ni$^{12+}$.</description>

      <title>Two-photon sweeping out of the K-shell of a heavy atomic ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the second-order non-relativistic quantum perturbation theory, the methods of the theory of irreducible tensor operators, and nonorthogonal orbitals, the absolute values and shape of the generalized cross-sections of the two-photon double ionization (sweeping) of the K-shell of a heavy neon-like ion of an iron atom were predicted. The complete wave functions of the ground state of the ion and the states of its ionization are obtained in the single-configuration Hartree-Fock approximation. The effects of radial relaxation of ionization states in the field of one and two vacancies in the K-shell are taken into account. The matrix element of the operator of the radiation transition between continuum-spectrum states is taken into account by introducing a correlation function. It was established that the generalized cross-section of the two-photon sweeping of the K-shell at high (greater than or equal to 15.8 keV) energies of absorbed X-ray photons is several orders of magnitude greater than the generalized cross-section of the two-photon single ionization of the K-shell. This result qualitatively reproduces the work of Novikov S.A. and Hopersky A.N. (J. Phys. B 2002. V. 35. P. L339), stimulates future research, in particular, the effects of cascade "evaporation" of electron shells of an atom (atomic ion) when filling an empty K-shell and can be tested in X-ray free-electron laser experiments with high peak radiation brightness and ultrashort photon pulse duration. The scheme of the proposed experiment with two linearly polarized X-ray photons is presented.</description>

      <title>Magic wavelengths and triple magic trapping conditions for $5s^2~^1\!S_0$ and $5s5p~^3\!P_{0,2}$ states of Sr atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The static and dynamic electric dipole polarizabilities of the $5s^2~^1\!S_0$ and $5s5p~^3\!P_{0,2}$ states of Sr atoms are calculated using the relativistic configuration interaction plus the many-body perturbation theory (RCI+MBPT) method. Magic wavelengths are determined for the transitions $5s^2~^1\!S_0\rightarrow 5s5p~^3\!P_{0}$, $5s^2~^1\!S_0\rightarrow 5s5p~^3\!P_{2}$, and $5s5p~^3\!P_0\rightarrow 5s5p~^3\!P_{2}$. A comprehensive study is conducted on the dependence of magic wavelengths on the angle between the laser polarization and the magnetic field. Furthermore, the conditions for realizing triple magic trapping at 813.4~nm for the $5s^2~^1\!S_0$, $5s5p~^3\!P_{0}$ and $5s5p~^3\!P_{2}$ states are investigated. In the case of linearly polarized light, when the angle ($\theta_p$) between the laser polarization direction and the magnetic field is $79.1(0.7)^\circ$, triple magic trapping for the $5s^2~^1\!S_0$, $5s5p~^3\!P_{0}$, and $5s5p~^3\!P_{2}~M=0$ states can be achieved. This result agrees well with the recent experimental measurement (78.49(3)$^\circ$)[Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 143401 (2025)]. Meanwhile, triple magic trapping involving the $5s5p~^3\!P_{2}~M=2$ state can be achieved when $\theta_p= 37.4(0.3)^\circ$. The conditions for achieving triple magic trapping with circularly and arbitrarily elliptically polarized light are also presented.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional imaging of single atoms in an optical lattice via helical point-spread-function engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05341v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a method for determining the three-dimensional location of single atoms in a quantum gas microscopy system using a phase-only spatial light modulator to modify the point-spread function of the high-resolution imaging system. Here, the typical diffracted spot generated by a single atom as a point source is modified to a double spot that rotates as a function of the atom's distance from the focal plane of the imaging system. We present and numerically validate a simple model linking the rotation angle of the point-spread function with the distance to the focal plane. We show that, when aberrations in the system are carefully calibrated and compensated for, this method can be used to determine an atom's position to within a single lattice site in a single experimental image, extending quantum simulation with microscopy systems further into the regime of three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Fast collisional $\sqrt{\mathrm{SWAP}}$ gate for fermionic atoms in an optical superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisional gates in optical superlattices have recently achieved record fidelities, but their operation times are typically limited by tunneling. Here we propose and analyze an alternative route to a fast $\sqrt{\mathrm{SWAP}}$ gate for two fermionic atoms in an optical superlattice based on optimized, time-dependent control of the short and long lattice depths. The gate is implemented by transiently releasing the atoms into a quasi-harmonic confinement centered between the two sites. With an appropriately chosen contact interaction strength, a controlled collision accumulates the exchange phase required for $\sqrt{\mathrm{SWAP}}$ and generates entanglement. We employ a continuum, time-dependent Schr\"odinger-equation simulation that goes beyond a two-site Fermi--Hubbard description and benchmark it against experimentally implemented tunneling-based protocols, reproducing the observed single-particle tunneling and spin-exchange dynamics. For experimentally accessible lattice depths, we find that the proposed gate operates in $\sim 21\,\mu\mathrm{s}$, more than an order of magnitude faster than tunneling-based implementations, while achieving fidelities $\gtrsim 99\%$. We further analyze sensitivity to lattice-depth variations and show that a composite sequence improves robustness. Our results establish fast, collision-mediated entangling gates in superlattices as a promising building block for scalable neutral-atom quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Emergence of nonclassical radiation in strongly laser-driven quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonclassical light sources are central to emerging quantum technologies, yet current platforms offer limited tunability and typically operate at low photon numbers. In parallel, strong-field physics provides widely tunable, bright coherent radiation through high-order harmonic generation (HHG), but its quantum optical character has remained largely unexplained. While recent experiments have revealed signatures of entanglement, squeezing, and quantum-state modification in both the driving and generated fields, a unified theoretical framework capable of identifying the origin and controllability of these effects has been missing. Here we introduce a fully quantum, analytically tractable theory of intense light-matter interaction that rigorously captures the emergence of nonclassicality in HHG. Our approach employs a parametric factorization of the coupled electron-field system into a driven electronic state and a dynamically perturbed quantum optical field, derived directly from the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation without requiring conditioning, homodyne detection, or mode-selection techniques. We show how quantum correlations, squeezing, and Wigner-function negativity arise intrinsically from the interaction dynamics, and we identify the precise conditions under which specific nonclassical features are amplified or suppressed. The theory enables predictive design of bright, high-photon-number quantum states at tunable frequencies, and we demonstrate its utility by outlining realistic conditions for generating bright nonclassical ultraviolet light. Our results establish a comprehensive foundation for strong-field quantum optics and open new avenues toward tabletop quantum light sources for sensing, communication, and photonic quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>A simple fourth order propagator based on the Magnus expansion in the Liouville space: Application to a $\Lambda$-system and assessment of the rotating wave approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simple 4th order propagator [Ture and Jang, {\it J. Phys. Chem. A.} {\bf 128}, 2871 (2024)] based on the Magnus expansion (ME) is extended to the Liouville space for both closed-system and Lindbladian open-system quantum dynamics. For both dynamics, commutator free versions of 4th order propagators are provided as well. These propagators are then applied to the dynamics of a driven $\Lambda$-system, where Lindblad terms represent the effect of a photonic bath. For both dynamics, the accuracy of the rotating wave approximation (RWA) for the matter-radiation interaction is assessed. We confirmed reasonable performance of RWA for weak and resonant fields. However, small errors appear for moderate fields and substantial errors can be found for strong fields where coherent population trapping can still be expected. We also found that the presence of bath for open system quantum dynamics consistently reduces the errors of the RWA. These results provide a quantitative information on how the RWA breaks down beyond weak field or for non-resonant cases. Major results are benchmarked against results of our 6th order ME-based propagator. We also provide numerical comparison of our algorithms with other 4th order algorithms for the $\Lambda$-system. These confirm reasonable performance of our simple propagators and the improvement gained through commutator-free expressions.</description>

      <title>Adaptive, symmetry-informed Bayesian metrology for precise quantum technology measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10615v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High precision measurements are essential to solve major scientific and technological challenges, from gravitational wave detection to healthcare diagnostics. Quantum sensing delivers greater precision, but an in-depth optimisation of measurement procedures has been overlooked. Here we present a systematic strategy for parameter estimation in the low-data limit that integrates experimental control parameters and natural symmetries. The method is guided by a Bayesian quantifier of precision gain, enabling adaptive optimisation tailored to the experiment. We provide general expressions for optimal estimators for any parameter. The strategy's power is demonstrated in a quantum technology experiment, in which ultracold caesium atoms are confined in a micromachined hole in an optical fibre. We find a five-fold reduction in the fractional variance of the estimated parameter, compared to the standard measurement procedure. Equivalently, our strategy achieves a target precision with a third of the data points previously required. Such enhanced device performance and accelerated data collection will be essential for applications in quantum computing, communication, metrology, and the wider quantum technology sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling interactions of ultracold molecules is a cornerstone of quantum chemistry. While the laboratory creation of degenerate molecular gases comprised of bosonic atoms has unlocked powerful new platforms for quantum simulation, progress is limited by the absence of a robust theoretical framework for characterizing inter-molecular interactions. This is in stark contrast to the situation for Fermi gases. In this Letter, we present such a framework providing universal expressions for these molecular scattering lengths as functions of experimentally measurable quantities. Our discoveries are crucial for understanding molecular condensate formation. Calculations of the compressibility reveal that a sign change in such molecular scattering lengths is directly correlated with the instability of these condensates. These results offer fresh insight with broad applications for atomic, molecular, and condensed matter physics, as well as quantum chemistry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical mechanics of two-dimensional "super-Coulombic" plasmas, namely, neutral plasmas with power-law interactions longer-ranged than Coulomb. To that end, we employ numerically exact large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. Contrary to naive energy-entropy arguments, we observe a charge confinement-deconfinement transition as a function of temperature. Remarkably, the transition lies in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) universality class. Our results corroborate recent dielectric medium and renormalization group calculations predicting effective long-scale Coulomb interactions in microscopically super-Coulombic gases. We explicitly showcase this novel dielectric screening phenomenon, capturing the emergent Coulomb potential and the associated crossover length scale. This is achieved by utilizing a new test charge based methodology for determining effective inter-particle interactions. Lastly, we show that this Coulomb emergence and the associated BKT transition occur universally across generic interactions and densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sensing of parameters is an important aspect in all disciplines, with applications ranging from fundamental science to medicine. Quantum sensing and metrology is an emerging field that lies at the cross-roads of quantum physics, quantum technology, and the discipline in which the parameter estimation is to be performed. While miniaturization of devices often requires quantum mechanics to be utilized for understanding and planning of a parameter estimation, quantum-enhanced sensing is also possible that uses paradigmatic quantum characteristics like quantum coherence and quantum entanglement to go beyond the so-called standard quantum limit. The current review hopes to bring together the concepts related to quantum sensing as realized in ensemble systems, like spin ensembles, light-matter systems, and Bose-Einstein condensates, and lattice systems, like those which can be modeled by the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models, and quantum spin models.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the influence of varying Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of NiCoCrAlYTa coatings with electrodeposited, vacuum-annealed Ptsingle bondRu overlays. Weight change measurements, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM/EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used for high-temperature oxidation analyses, showing superior resistance with higher Pt contents. This was attributed to the creation of a denser, thinner, and more homogeneous layer of alumina (alpha-Al2O3) in the thermally-grown oxide (TGO) layer. On the contrary, an increase in Ru contents led to the development of other oxides and microcracks along with alumina in the TGO layer, undermining oxidation protection. The accommodation of Ti and Ta, in the minimally-deteriorative form of carbide, along with Y into the TGO layer with increasing Pt contents further enhanced oxidation resistance. In addition to the explored significant impact of the Pt/Ru ratio on oxide scale characteristics and oxidation resistance, the lower cost of Ru compared to Pt suggests the potential for designing cost-effective systems through optimized Pt/Ru ratios and microstructural engineering.</description>
