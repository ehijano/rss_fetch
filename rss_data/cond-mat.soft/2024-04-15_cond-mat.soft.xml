      <title>Thermally activated intermittent flow in amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using mean field theory and a mesoscale elastoplastic model, we analyze the steady state shear rheology of thermally activated amorphous solids. At sufficiently high temperature and driving rates, flow is continuous and described by well-established rheological flow laws such as Herschel-Bulkley and logarithmic rate dependence. However, we find that these flow laws change in the regime of intermittent flow, were collective events no longer overlap and serrated flow becomes pronounced. In this regime, we identify a thermal activation stress scale, $x_{a}(T,\dot{\gamma})$, that wholly captures the effect of driving rate $\dot{\gamma}$ and temperature $T$ on average flow stress, stress drop (avalanche) size and correlation lengths. Different rheological regimes are summarized in a dynamic phase diagram for the amorphous yielding transition. Theoretical predictions call for a need to re-examine the rheology of very slowly sheared amorphous matter much below the glass transition.</description>

      <title>Large bubble drives melting in circular DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the melting transition of non-supercoiled circular DNA of different lengths, employing Brownian dynamics simulation. In the absence of supercoiling, we find that melting of circular DNA is driven by a large bubble, which agrees with the previous predictions of circular DNA melting in the presence of supercoiling. By analyzing sector-wise changes in average base-pair distance, our study reveals that the melting behavior of circular DNA closely resembles that of linear DNA. Additionally, we find a marked difference in the thermal stability of circular DNA over linear DNA at very short length scales, an effect that diminishes as the length of circular DNA increases. The stability of smaller circular DNA is linked to the occurrence of transient small bubbles, characterized by a lower probability of growth.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Assisted Sorting of Active Microswimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active matter systems being in a non-equilibrium state, exhibit complex behaviors such as self-organization and giving rise to emergent phenomena. There are many examples of active particles with biological origins, including bacteria and spermatozoa, or with artificial origins, such as self-propelled swimmers and Janus particles. The ability to manipulate active particles is vital for their effective application e.g. separating motile spermatozoa from nonmotile and dead ones, to increase fertilization chance. In this study, we proposed a mechanism -- an apparatus -- to sort and demix active particles based on their motility values (P\`eclet number). Initially, using Brownian simulations we demonstrated the feasibility of sorting self-propelled particles. Following this, we employed machine learning methods, supplemented with data from comprehensive simulations that we conducted for this study, to model the complex behavior of active particles. This enabled us to sort them based on their P\`eclet number. Finally, we evaluated the performance of the developed models and showed their effectiveness in demixing and sorting the active particles. Our findings can find applications in various fields, including physics, biology, and biomedical science, where the sorting and manipulation of active particles play a pivotal role.</description>

      <title>Evidence of ferroelectric features in low-density supercooled water from ab initio deep neural-network simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decade, an increasing body of evidence has emerged, supporting the existence of a metastable liquid-liquid critical point in supercooled water, whereby two distinct liquid phases of different densities coexist. Analysing long molecular dynamics simulations performed using deep neural-network force fields trained to accurate quantum mechanical data, we demonstrate that the low-density liquid phase displays a strong propensity toward spontaneous polarization, as witnessed by large and long-lived collective dipole fluctuations. Our findings suggest that the dynamical stability of the low-density phase, and hence the transition from high-density to low-density liquid, is triggered by a collective process involving an accumulation of rotational angular jumps, which could ignite large dipole fluctuations. This dynamical transition involves subtle changes in the electronic polarizability of water molecules which affects their rotational mobility within the two phases. These findings hold the potential for catalyzing new activity in the search for dielectric-based probes of the putative second critical point.</description>

      <title>Polarisable soft solvent models with applications in dissipative particle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We critically examine a broad class of explicitly polarisable soft solvent models aimed at applications in dissipative particle dynamics. We obtain the dielectric permittivity using the fluctuating box dipole method in linear response theory, and verify the models in relation to several test cases including demonstrating ion desorption from an oil-water interface due to image charge effects. We additionally compute the Kirkwood factor and find it uniformly lies in the range gK approx 0.7-0.8, indicating that dipole-dipole correlations are not negligible in these models. This is supported by measurements of dipole-dipole correlation functions. As a consequence, Onsager theory over-predicts the dielectric permittivity by approximately 20-30 percent. On the other hand, the mean square molecular dipole moment can be accurately estimated with a first-order Wertheim perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Universal time and length scales of polar active polymer melts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an in-depth multi-scale analysis of the conformations and dynamics of polar active polymers, comparing very dilute and very dense conditions. We unveil characteristic length and time scales, common to both dilute and dense systems, that recapitulate the conformational and dynamical properties of these active polymers upon varying both the polymer size and the strength of the activity. Specifically, we find that a correlation (or looping) length characterises the polymer conformations and the monomer dynamics. Instead, the dynamics of the center of mass can be fully characterised by the end-to-end mean-square distance and by the associated relaxation time. As such, we show that the dynamics in melts of polar active polymers are not controlled by entanglements but only by the strength of the self-propulsion.</description>

      <title>Active nematic liquid crytals under a quenched random field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupling between flow and orientation is a central issue in understanding the collective dynamics of active biofilaments and cells. Active stressess generated by motor activity destroy (quasi-)long-range orientational order and induce chaotic vortex flows. In cellular and subcellular environment, alignment is also hindered by heterogeneous filamentous structures in extracellular matrix and various organelles in a cell. Here we address the effects of a quenched random field on the flow patterns and orientational order in two-dimensional active nematic liquid crystals. We found that the director dynamics is frozen above a critical disorder strength. For sufficiently strong randomness, the orientational correlation function decays exponentially with the distance, reproducing the behavior of passive random-field nematics. In contrast, the flow velocity decreases only gradually as the randomness is increased, and develops a logarithmic spatial correlation for strong disorder. The threshold between the activity- and disorder-dominated regimes is specified and its dependence on the activity parameter is discussed.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian model of fluctuating membrane and its scattering properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mathematical model is developed, to jointly analyze elastic and inelastic scattering data of fluctuating membranes within a single theoretical framework. The model builds on a non-homogeneously clipped time-dependent Gaussian random field. This specific approach provides one with general analytical expressions for the intermediate scattering function, for any number of sublayers in the membrane and arbitrary contrasts. The model is illustrated with the analysis of small-angle x-ray and neutron scattering as well as with neutron spin-echo data measured on unilamellar vesicles prepared from phospholipids extracted from porcine brain tissues. The parameters fitted on the entire dataset are the lengths of the chain and head of the molecules that make up the membrane, the amplitude and lateral sizes of the bending deformations, the thickness fluctuation, and a single parameter characterizing the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Rotation-equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Learning Glassy Liquids Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The difficult problem of relating the static structure of glassy liquids and their dynamics is a good target for Machine Learning, an approach which excels at finding complex patterns hidden in data. Indeed, this approach is currently a hot topic in the glassy liquids community, where the state of the art consists in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which have great expressive power but are heavy models and lack interpretability. Inspired by recent advances in the field of Machine Learning group-equivariant representations, we build a GNN that learns a robust representation of the glass' static structure by constraining it to preserve the roto-translation (SE(3)) equivariance. We show that this constraint significantly improves the predictive power at comparable or reduced number of parameters but most importantly, improves the ability to generalize to unseen temperatures. While remaining a Deep network, our model has improved interpretability compared to other GNNs, as the action of our basic convolution layer relates directly to well-known rotation-invariant expert features. Through transfer-learning experiments displaying unprecedented performance, we demonstrate that our network learns a robust representation, which allows us to push forward the idea of a learned structural order parameter for glasses.</description>

      <title>Softness Matters: Effects of Compression on the Behavior of Adsorbed Microgels at Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deformable colloids and macromolecules adsorb at interfaces, as they decrease the interfacial energy between the two media. The deformability, or softness, of these particles plays a pivotal role in the properties of the interface. In this study, we employ a comprehensive \emph{in situ} approach, combining neutron reflectometry with molecular dynamics simulations, to thoroughly examine the profound influence of softness on the structure of microgel Langmuir monolayers under compression. Lateral compression of both hard and soft microgel particle monolayers induces substantial structural alterations, leading to an amplified protrusion of the microgels into the aqueous phase. However, a critical distinction emerges: hard microgels are pushed away from the interface, in stark contrast to the soft ones, which remain steadfastly anchored to it. Concurrently, on the air-exposed side of the monolayer, lateral compression induces a flattening of the surface of the hard monolayer. This phenomenon is not observed for the soft particles as the monolayer is already extremely flat even in the absence of compression. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the pivotal role of softness on both the equilibrium phase behavior of the monolayer and its effect when soft colloids are used as stabilizers of responsive interfaces and emulsions.</description>

      <title>Force Propagation in Active Cytoskeletal Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04217v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In biological systems, molecular-scale forces and motions are pivotal for enabling processes like motility, shape change, and replication. These forces and motions are organized, amplified, and transmitted across macroscopic scales by active materials such as the cytoskeleton, which drives micron-scale cellular movement and re-organization. Despite the integral role of active materials, understanding how molecular-scale interactions alter macroscopic structure and force propagation remains elusive. This knowledge gap presents challenges to the harnessing and regulation of such dynamics across diverse length scales. Here, we demonstrate how mediating the bundling of microtubules can shift active matter between a global force-transmitting phase and a local force-dissipating phase. A fivefold increase in microtubule effective length results in the transition from local to global phase with a hundredfold increase in velocity autocorrelation. Through theory and simulation, we identify signatures of a percolation-driven transition between the two phases. This provides evidence for how force propagation can be generated when local molecular interactions reach a sufficient length scale. We show that force propagation in the active matter system enables material transport. Consequently, we demonstrate that the global phase is capable of facilitating millimeter-scale human cell transport and manipulation, as well as powering the movement of aqueous droplets. These findings underscore the potential for designing active materials capable of force organization and transmission. Our results lay the foundation for further exploration into the organization and propagation of forces/stresses in biological systems, thereby paving the way for the engineering of active materials in synthetic biology and soft robotics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-life bacteria often swim in complex fluids, but our understanding of the interactions between bacteria and complex surroundings is still evolving. In this work, rod-like \textit{Bacillus subtilis} swims in a quasi-2D environment with aqueous liquid-liquid interfaces, i.e., the isotropic-nematic coexistence phase of an aqueous chromonic liquid crystal. Focusing on the bacteria motion near and at the liquid-liquid interfaces, we collect and quantify bacterial trajectories ranging across the isotropic to the nematic phase. Despite its small magnitude, the interfacial tension of the order of 10 $\mathrm{\mu N/m}$ at the isotropic-nematic interface justifies our observations that bacteria swimming more perpendicular to the interface have a higher probability of crossing the interface. Our force-balance model, considering the interfacial tension, further predicts how the length and speed of the bacteria affect their crossing behaviors. We also find, as soon as the bacteria cross the interface and enter the nematic phase, they wiggle less, but faster, and that this occurs as the flagellar bundles aggregate within the nematic phase.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Antimicrobial Activity of Ionic Liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bactericidal potency of ionic liquids (ILs) is well-established, yet their precise mechanism of action remains elusive. Here, we show evidence that the bactericidal action of ILs primarily involves permeabilizing the bacterial cell membrane. Our findings reveal that ILs exert their effects by directly interacting with the lipid bilayer and enhancing the membrane dynamics. Lateral lipid diffusion is accelerated which in turn augments membrane permeability, ultimately leading to bacterial death. Furthermore, our results establish a significant connection: an increase in the alkyl chain length of ILs correlates with a notable enhancement in both lipid lateral diffusion and antimicrobial potency. This underscores a compelling correlation between membrane dynamics and antimicrobial effectiveness, providing valuable insights for the rational design and optimization of IL-based antimicrobial agents in healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Hidden nonreciprocity as a stabilizing effective potential in active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active matter with nonreciprocal interactions is known for its distinctive dynamics. To shed light on the stationary properties of such systems, we consider paradigmatic systems of nonreciprocally coupled active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles. For each system, we uniquely decompose the interparticle force into an energy gradient and a transverse nonconservative force. We show that the steady-state distribution of positions, which would only reflect the energy if the noise were thermal, features the transverse force as an effective potential that stabilizes the energy minima, due to the persistent noise that propels the particles. We exactly solve the distribution for nonreciprocal harmonic oscillators and numerically verify it for systems with more complex couplings. When the breaking of reciprocity in the interactions produces a transverse force without changing the energy gradient, we indeed find that the nonreciprocity plays a stabilizing role in the stationary state.</description>
