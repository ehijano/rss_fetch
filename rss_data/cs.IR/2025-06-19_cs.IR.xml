      <title>Advancing Loss Functions in Recommender Systems: A Comparative Study with a R\'enyi Divergence-Based Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loss functions play a pivotal role in optimizing recommendation models. Among various loss functions, Softmax Loss (SL) and Cosine Contrastive Loss (CCL) are particularly effective. Their theoretical connections and differences warrant in-depth exploration. This work conducts comprehensive analyses of these losses, yielding significant insights: 1) Common strengths -- both can be viewed as augmentations of traditional losses with Distributional Robust Optimization (DRO), enhancing robustness to distributional shifts; 2) Respective limitations -- stemming from their use of different distribution distance metrics in DRO optimization, SL exhibits high sensitivity to false negative instances, whereas CCL suffers from low data utilization. To address these limitations, this work proposes a new loss function, DrRL, which generalizes SL and CCL by leveraging R\'enyi-divergence in DRO optimization. DrRL incorporates the advantageous structures of both SL and CCL, and can be demonstrated to effectively mitigate their limitations. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the superiority of DrRL on both recommendation accuracy and robustness.</description>

      <title>Next-User Retrieval: Enhancing Cold-Start Recommendations via Generative Next-User Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The item cold-start problem is critical for online recommendation systems, as the success of this phase determines whether high-quality new items can transition to popular ones, receive essential feedback to inspire creators, and thus lead to the long-term retention of creators. However, modern recommendation systems still struggle to address item cold-start challenges due to the heavy reliance on item and historical interactions, which are non-trivial for cold-start items lacking sufficient exposure and feedback. Lookalike algorithms provide a promising solution by extending feedback for new items based on lookalike users. Traditional lookalike algorithms face such limitations: (1) failing to effectively model the lookalike users and further improve recommendations with the existing rule- or model-based methods; and (2) struggling to utilize the interaction signals and incorporate diverse features in modern recommendation systems.
  Inspired by lookalike algorithms, we propose Next-User Retrieval, a novel framework for enhancing cold-start recommendations via generative next-user modeling. Specifically, we employ a transformer-based model to capture the unidirectional relationships among recently interacted users and utilize these sequences to generate the next potential user who is most likely to interact with the item. The additional item features are also integrated as prefix prompt embeddings to assist the next-user generation. The effectiveness of Next-User Retrieval is evaluated through both offline experiments and online A/B tests. Our method achieves significant improvements with increases of 0.0142% in daily active users and +0.1144% in publications in Douyin, showcasing its practical applicability and scalability.</description>

      <title>Multi-Interest Recommendation: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing recommendation methods often struggle to model users' multifaceted preferences due to the diversity and volatility of user behavior, as well as the inherent uncertainty and ambiguity of item attributes in practical scenarios. Multi-interest recommendation addresses this challenge by extracting multiple interest representations from users' historical interactions, enabling fine-grained preference modeling and more accurate recommendations. It has drawn broad interest in recommendation research. However, current recommendation surveys have either specialized in frontier recommendation methods or delved into specific tasks and downstream applications. In this work, we systematically review the progress, solutions, challenges, and future directions of multi-interest recommendation by answering the following three questions: (1) Why is multi-interest modeling significantly important for recommendation? (2) What aspects are focused on by multi-interest modeling in recommendation? and (3) How can multi-interest modeling be applied, along with the technical details of the representative modules? We hope that this survey establishes a fundamental framework and delivers a preliminary overview for researchers interested in this field and committed to further exploration. The implementation of multi-interest recommendation summarized in this survey is maintained at https://github.com/WHUIR/Multi-Interest-Recommendation-A-Survey.</description>

      <title>DiscRec: Disentangled Semantic-Collaborative Modeling for Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative recommendation is emerging as a powerful paradigm that directly generates item predictions, moving beyond traditional matching-based approaches. However, current methods face two key challenges: token-item misalignment, where uniform token-level modeling ignores item-level granularity that is critical for collaborative signal learning, and semantic-collaborative signal entanglement, where collaborative and semantic signals exhibit distinct distributions yet are fused in a unified embedding space, leading to conflicting optimization objectives that limit the recommendation performance.
  To address these issues, we propose DiscRec, a novel framework that enables Disentangled Semantic-Collaborative signal modeling with flexible fusion for generative Recommendation.First, DiscRec introduces item-level position embeddings, assigned based on indices within each semantic ID, enabling explicit modeling of item structure in input token sequences.Second, DiscRec employs a dual-branch module to disentangle the two signals at the embedding layer: a semantic branch encodes semantic signals using original token embeddings, while a collaborative branch applies localized attention restricted to tokens within the same item to effectively capture collaborative signals. A gating mechanism subsequently fuses both branches while preserving the model's ability to model sequential dependencies. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that DiscRec effectively decouples these signals and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our codes are available on https://github.com/Ten-Mao/DiscRec.</description>

      <title>Aug2Search: Enhancing Facebook Marketplace Search with LLM-Generated Synthetic Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) is an important technique in modern search engines, enabling semantic match between search queries and relevant results. However, search logging data on platforms like Facebook Marketplace lacks the diversity and details needed for effective EBR model training, limiting the models' ability to capture nuanced search patterns. To address this challenge, we propose Aug2Search, an EBR-based framework leveraging synthetic data generated by Generative AI (GenAI) models, in a multimodal and multitask approach to optimize query-product relevance. This paper investigates the capabilities of GenAI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), in generating high-quality synthetic data, and analyzing its impact on enhancing EBR models. We conducted experiments using eight Llama models and 100 million data points from Facebook Marketplace logs. Our synthetic data generation follows three strategies: (1) generate queries, (2) enhance product listings, and (3) generate queries from enhanced listings. We train EBR models on three different datasets: sampled engagement data or original data ((e.g., "Click" and "Listing Interactions")), synthetic data, and a mixture of both engagement and synthetic data to assess their performance across various training sets. Our findings underscore the robustness of Llama models in producing synthetic queries and listings with high coherence, relevance, and diversity, while maintaining low levels of hallucination. Aug2Search achieves an improvement of up to 4% in ROC_AUC with 100 million synthetic data samples, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, our experiments reveal that with the same volume of training data, models trained exclusively on synthetic data often outperform those trained on original data only or a mixture of original and synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Generative Next POI Recommendation with Semantic ID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation systems aim to predict the next destinations of user based on their preferences and historical check-ins. Existing generative POI recommendation methods usually employ random numeric IDs for POIs, limiting the ability to model semantic relationships between similar locations. In this paper, we propose Generative Next POI Recommendation with Semantic ID (GNPR-SID), an LLM-based POI recommendation model with a novel semantic POI ID (SID) representation method that enhances the semantic understanding of POI modeling. There are two key components in our GNPR-SID: (1) a Semantic ID Construction module that generates semantically rich POI IDs based on semantic and collaborative features, and (2) a Generative POI Recommendation module that fine-tunes LLMs to predict the next POI using these semantic IDs. By incorporating user interaction patterns and POI semantic features into the semantic ID generation, our method improves the recommendation accuracy and generalization of the model. To construct semantically related SIDs, we propose a POI quantization method based on residual quantized variational autoencoder, which maps POIs into a discrete semantic space. We also propose a diversity loss to ensure that SIDs are uniformly distributed across the semantic space. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that GNPR-SID substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 16% improvement in recommendation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Contributions to Representation Learning with Graph Autoencoders and Applications to Music Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.14651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph autoencoders (GAE) and variational graph autoencoders (VGAE) emerged as two powerful groups of unsupervised node embedding methods, with various applications to graph-based machine learning problems such as link prediction and community detection. Nonetheless, at the beginning of this Ph.D. project, GAE and VGAE models were also suffering from key limitations, preventing them from being adopted in the industry. In this thesis, we present several contributions to improve these models, with the general aim of facilitating their use to address industrial-level problems involving graph representations. Firstly, we propose two strategies to overcome the scalability issues of previous GAE and VGAE models, permitting to effectively train these models on large graphs with millions of nodes and edges. These strategies leverage graph degeneracy and stochastic subgraph decoding techniques, respectively. Besides, we introduce Gravity-Inspired GAE and VGAE, providing the first extensions of these models for directed graphs, that are ubiquitous in industrial applications. We also consider extensions of GAE and VGAE models for dynamic graphs. Furthermore, we argue that GAE and VGAE models are often unnecessarily complex, and we propose to simplify them by leveraging linear encoders. Lastly, we introduce Modularity-Aware GAE and VGAE to improve community detection on graphs, while jointly preserving good performances on link prediction. In the last part of this thesis, we evaluate our methods on several graphs extracted from the music streaming service Deezer. We put the emphasis on graph-based music recommendation problems. In particular, we show that our methods can improve the detection of communities of similar musical items to recommend to users, that they can effectively rank similar artists in a cold start setting, and that they permit modeling the music genre perception across cultures.</description>

      <title>MERGE -- A Bimodal Audio-Lyrics Dataset for Static Music Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Music Emotion Recognition (MER) field has seen steady developments in recent years, with contributions from feature engineering, machine learning, and deep learning. The landscape has also shifted from audio-centric systems to bimodal ensembles that combine audio and lyrics. However, a lack of public, sizable and quality-controlled bimodal databases has hampered the development and improvement of bimodal audio-lyrics systems. This article proposes three new audio, lyrics, and bimodal MER research datasets, collectively referred to as MERGE, which were created using a semi-automatic approach. To comprehensively assess the proposed datasets and establish a baseline for benchmarking, we conducted several experiments for each modality, using feature engineering, machine learning, and deep learning methodologies. Additionally, we propose and validate fixed train-validation-test splits. The obtained results confirm the viability of the proposed datasets, achieving the best overall result of 81.74\% F1-score for bimodal classification.</description>

      <title>OM4OV: Leveraging Ontology Matching for Ontology Versioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20302v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the dynamic nature of the Semantic Web, version control is necessary to capture time-varying information, particularly for widely used ontologies. Despite the long-standing recognition of ontology versioning (OV) as a crucial component for efficient ontology management, the growing size of ontologies and accumulating errors caused by manual labour overwhelm current OV approaches. In this paper, we propose yet another approach to performing OV using existing ontology matching (OM) techniques and systems. We introduce a unified OM4OV pipeline. From an OM perspective, we reconstruct a new task formulation and measurement for OV tasks. Building upon the prior alignment(s) from OM, we propose a pipeline optimisation method called the cross-reference (CR) mechanism to enhance overall OV performance. We experimentally validate the OM4OV pipeline and the cross-reference mechanism in the OV tested originating from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) datasets. We also discuss insights into OM used for OV tasks, where some false mappings detected by OV systems are not actually untrue.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Multi-Positive Contrastive Learning for Patent Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Patent images are technical drawings that convey information about a patent's innovation. Patent image retrieval systems aim to search in vast collections and retrieve the most relevant images. Despite recent advances in information retrieval, patent images still pose significant challenges due to their technical intricacies and complex semantic information, requiring efficient fine-tuning for domain adaptation. Current methods neglect patents' hierarchical relationships, such as those defined by the Locarno International Classification (LIC) system, which groups broad categories (e.g., "furnishing") into subclasses (e.g., "seats" and "beds") and further into specific patent designs. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical multi-positive contrastive loss that leverages the LIC's taxonomy to induce such relations in the retrieval process. Our approach assigns multiple positive pairs to each patent image within a batch, with varying similarity scores based on the hierarchical taxonomy. Our experimental analysis with various vision and multimodal models on the DeepPatent2 dataset shows that the proposed method enhances the retrieval results. Notably, our method is effective with low-parameter models, which require fewer computational resources and can be deployed on environments with limited hardware.</description>
