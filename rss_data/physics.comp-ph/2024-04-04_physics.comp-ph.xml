      <title>Circle radius distributions determine random close packing density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circles of a single size can pack together densely in a hexagonal lattice, but adding in size variety disrupts the order of those packings. We conduct simulations which generate dense random packings of circles with specified size distributions, and measure the area fraction in each case. While the size distributions can be arbitrary, we find that for a wide range of size distributions the random close packing area fraction $\phi_{rcp}$ is determined to high accuracy by the polydispersity and skewness of the size distribution. At low skewness, all packings tend to a minimum packing fraction $\phi_0 \approx 0.840$ independent of polydispersity. In the limit of high skewness, $\phi_{rcp}$ becomes independent of skewness, asymptoting to a polydispersity-dependent limit. We show how these results can be predicted from the behavior of simple, bidisperse or bi-Gaussian circle size distributions.</description>

      <title>cppdlr: Imaginary time calculations using the discrete Lehmann representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce cppdlr, a C++ library implementing the discrete Lehmann representation (DLR) of functions in imaginary time and Matsubara frequency, such as Green's functions and self-energies. The DLR is based on a low-rank approximation of the analytic continuation kernel, and yields a compact and explicit basis consisting of exponentials in imaginary time and simple poles in Matsubara frequency. cppdlr constructs the DLR basis and associated interpolation grids, and implements standard operations. It provides a flexible yet high-level interface, facilitating the incorporation of the DLR into both small-scale applications and existing large-scale software projects.</description>

      <title>Combining transition path sampling with data-driven collective variables through a reactivity-biased shooting algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare event sampling is a central problem in modern computational chemistry research. Among the existing methods, transition path sampling (TPS) can generate unbiased representations of reaction processes. However, its efficiency depends on the ability to generate reactive trial paths, which in turn depends on the quality of the shooting algorithm used. We propose a new algorithm based on the shooting success rate, i.e. reactivity, measured as a function of a reduced set of collective variables (CVs). These variables are extracted with a machine learning approach directly from TPS simulations, using a multi-task objective function. Iteratively, this workflow significantly improves shooting efficiency without any prior knowledge of the process. In addition, the optimized CVs can be used with biased enhanced sampling methodologies to accurately reconstruct the free energy profiles. We tested the method on three different systems: a two-dimensional toy model, conformational transitions of alanine dipeptide, and hydrolysis of acetyl chloride in bulk water. In the latter, we integrated our workflow with an active learning scheme to learn a reactive machine learning-based potential, which allowed us to study the mechanism and free energy profile with an ab initio-like accuracy.</description>

      <title>GPU acceleration of ab initio simulations of large-scale identical particles based on path integral molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) and path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) provide the golden standard for the ab initio simulations of identical particles. In this work, we achieved significant GPU acceleration based on PIMD, which is equivalent to PIMC in the ab initio simulations, and developed an open-source PIMD code repository that does not rely on any other third party library. Numerical experiments show that for a system of 1600 interacting identical bosons in a harmonic trap, using a single GPU and a single CPU, it only takes two hours to achieve satisfactory simulation accuracy. With the increase of the number of identical particles, the advantage of GPU acceleration over CPU becomes more obvious, making it possible to simulate tens of thousands of identical particles from first principles using a single GPU. For example, for a system of 10000 non-interacting bosons, numerical experiments show that it takes 23 hours to obtain a simulation that is highly consistent with the exact results. Our study shows that GPU acceleration can lay a solid foundation for the wide application of PIMD simulations for extremely large-scale identical particle quantum systems with more than 10,000 particles. Numerical experiments show that a 24GB GPU can simulate up to 40000 identical particles from first principles, and the GPU acceleration leads to a roughly linear relationship between the computation time and the number of identical particles. In addition, we have also successfully implemented simulations for fictitious identical particle thermodynamics using GPU to overcome the Fermion sign problem, which makes it promising to efficiently and accurately simulate tens of thousands of fermions based on GPU.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based vorticity evolution and superresolution of homogeneous isotropic turbulence using wavelet projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wavelet-based machine learning method is proposed for predicting the time evolution of homogeneous isotropic turbulence where vortex tubes are preserved. Three-dimensional convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory are trained with a time series of direct numerical simulation (DNS) data of homogeneous isotropic turbulence at the Taylor microscale Reynolds number 92. The predicted results are assessed by using flow visualization of vorticity and statistics, e.g., probability density functions of vorticity and enstrophy spectra. It is found that the predicted results are in good agreement with DNS results. The small-scale flow topology considering the second and third invariant of the velocity gradient tensor likewise shows an approximate match. Furthermore, we apply the pre-trained neural networks to coarse-grained vorticity data using superresolution. It is shown that the superresolved flow field well agrees with the reference DNS field and thus small-scale information and vortex tubes are well regenerated.</description>

      <title>A lattice Boltzmann approach for acoustic manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a lattice Boltzmann method to compute the acoustic radiation force produced by standing waves on a compressible object. Instead of simulating the fluid mechanics equations directly, the proposed method uses a lattice Boltzmann model that reproduces the wave equation, together with a kernel interpolation scheme, to compute the first order perturbations of the pressure and velocity fields on the object's surface and, from them, the acoustic radiation force. The procedure reproduces with excellent accuracy the theoretical expressions by Gor'kov and Wei for the sphere and the disk, respectively, even with a modest number of lattice Boltzmann cells. The proposed method shows to be a promising tool for simulating phenomena where the acoustic radiation force plays a relevant role, like acoustic tweezers or the acoustic manipulation of microswimmers, with applications in medicine and engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the regularized recurrent inference machine (rRIM), a novel machine-learning approach to solve the challenging problem of deriving the pairing glue function from measured optical spectra. The rRIM incorporates physical principles into both training and inference and affords noise robustness, flexibility with out-of-distribution data, and reduced data requirements. It effectively obtains reliable pairing glue functions from experimental optical spectra and yields promising solutions for similar inverse problems of the Fredholm integral equation of the first kind.</description>

Abstract: This work introduces a method for generating generalized structures of amorphous polymers using simulated polymerization and molecular dynamics equilibration, with a particular focus on amorphous polymers. The techniques and algorithms used in this method are described in the main text, and example input scripts are provided for the GMXPolymer code, which is based on the GROMACS molecular dynamics package. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we apply it to different glassy polymers exhibiting varying degrees of functionality, polarity, and rigidity. The reliability of the method is validated by comparing simulation results to experimental data for various structural and thermal properties, all of which show excellent agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the implementation of the Materials Genome Project by the Obama administration in the United States, the development of various computational materials databases has fundamentally expanded the choices of industries such as materials and energy. In the field of thermoelectric materials, the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT quantifies the performance of the material. From the viewpoint of calculations for vast materials, the ZT values are not easily obtained due to their computational complexity. Here, we show how to build a database of thermoelectric materials based on first-principles calculations for the electronic and heat transport of materials. Firstly, the initial structures are classified according to the values of bandgap and other basic properties using the clustering algorithm K-means in machine learning, and high-throughput first principles calculations are carried out for narrow-bandgap semiconductors which exhibiting potential thermoelectric application. The present framework of calculations mainly includes deformation potential module, electrical transport performance module, mechanical and thermodynamic properties module. We have also set up a search webpage for the calculated database of thermoelectric materials, providing searching and viewing the related physical properties of materials. Our work may inspire the construction of more computational databases of first-principle thermoelectric materials and accelerate research progress in the field of thermoelectrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The free energy of ion solvation can be decomposed into enthalpic and entropic contributions. This helps to understand the connection between the dielectric properties and the underlying forces. We present a simple linear-response model of screened charge interactions that provides an alternative understanding of solvation barriers. Moreover, it explains the ``anti-Coulomb'' interactions (attraction between like-charged ions and repulsion between opposite-charged ions) observed in both simulations and experiments. We show that this is a universal behavior associated to the non-local response function of any dielectric or metallic system.</description>

      <title>Efficient Structure-Informed Featurization and Property Prediction of Ordered, Dilute, and Random Atomic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structure-informed materials informatics is a rapidly evolving discipline of materials science relying on the featurization of atomic structures or configurations to construct vector, voxel, graph, graphlet, and other representations useful for machine learning prediction of properties, fingerprinting, and generative design. This work discusses how current featurizers typically perform redundant calculations and how their efficiency could be improved by considering (1) fundamentals of crystallographic (orbits) equivalency to optimize ordered cases and (2) representation-dependent equivalency to optimize cases of dilute, doped, and defect structures with broken symmetry. It also discusses and contrasts ways of (3) approximating random solid solutions occupying arbitrary lattices under such representations.
  Efficiency improvements discussed in this work were implemented within pySIPFENN or python toolset for Structure-Informed Property and Feature Engineering with Neural Networks developed by authors since 2019 and shown to increase performance from 2 to 10 times for typical inputs. Throughout this work, the authors explicitly discuss how these advances can be applied to different kinds of similar tools in the community.</description>

Abstract: We design the helicity-conservative physics-informed neural network model for the Navier-Stokes equation in the ideal case. The key is to provide an appropriate PDE model as loss function so that its neural network solutions produce helicity conservation. Physics-informed neural network model is based on the strong form of PDE. We compare the proposed Physics-informed neural network model and a relevant helicity-conservative finite element method. We arrive at the conclusion that the strong form PDE is better suited for conservation issues. We also present theoretical justifications for helicity conservation as well as supporting numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Reweighted Manifold Learning of Collective Variables from Enhanced Sampling Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhanced sampling methods are indispensable in computational physics and chemistry, where atomistic simulations cannot exhaustively sample the high-dimensional configuration space of dynamical systems due to the sampling problem. A class of such enhanced sampling methods works by identifying a few slow degrees of freedom, termed collective variables (CVs), and enhancing the sampling along these CVs. Selecting CVs to analyze and drive the sampling is not trivial and often relies on physical and chemical intuition. Despite routinely circumventing this issue using manifold learning to estimate CVs directly from standard simulations, such methods cannot provide mappings to a low-dimensional manifold from enhanced sampling simulations as the geometry and density of the learned manifold are biased. Here, we address this crucial issue and provide a general reweighting framework based on anisotropic diffusion maps for manifold learning that takes into account that the learning data set is sampled from a biased probability distribution. We consider manifold learning methods based on constructing a Markov chain describing transition probabilities between high-dimensional samples. We show that our framework reverts the biasing effect yielding CVs that correctly describe the equilibrium density. This advancement enables the construction of low-dimensional CVs using manifold learning directly from data generated by enhanced sampling simulations. We call our framework reweighted manifold learning. We show that it can be used in many manifold learning techniques on data from both standard and enhanced sampling simulations.</description>

      <title>A hybrid neural-network and MAC scheme for Stokes interface problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a hybrid neural-network and MAC (Marker-And-Cell) scheme for solving Stokes equations with singular forces on an embedded interface in regular domains. As known, the solution variables (the pressure and velocity) exhibit non-smooth behaviors across the interface so extra discretization efforts must be paid near the interface in order to have small order of local truncation errors in finite difference schemes. The present hybrid approach avoids such additional difficulty. It combines the expressive power of neural networks with the convergence of finite difference schemes to ease the code implementation and to achieve good accuracy at the same time. The key idea is to decompose the solution into singular and regular parts. The neural network learning machinery incorporating the given jump conditions finds the singular part solution, while the standard MAC scheme is used to obtain the regular part solution with associated boundary conditions. The two- and three-dimensional numerical results show that the present hybrid method converges with second-order accuracy for the velocity and first-order accuracy for the pressure, and it is comparable with the traditional immersed interface method in literature.</description>

      <title>Feasibility and Performance of the Staged Z-Pinch: A One-dimensional Study with FLASH and MACH2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Z-pinch platforms constitute a promising pathway to fusion energy research. Here, we present a one-dimensional numerical study of the staged Z-pinch (SZP) concept using the FLASH and MACH2 codes. We discuss the verification of the codes using two analytical benchmarks that include Z-pinch-relevant physics, building confidence on the codes' ability to model such experiments. Then, FLASH is used to simulate two different SZP configurations: a xenon gas-puff liner (SZP1*) and a silver solid liner (SZP2). The SZP2 results are compared against previously published MACH2 results, and a new code-to-code comparison on SZP1* is presented. Using an ideal equation of state and analytical transport coefficients, FLASH yields a fuel convergence ratio (CR) of approximately 39 and a mass-averaged fuel ion temperature slightly below 1 keV for the SZP2 scheme, significantly lower than the full-physics MACH2 prediction. For the new SZP1* configuration, full-physics FLASH simulations furnish large and inherently unstable CRs (&gt; 300), but achieve fuel ion temperatures of many keV. While MACH2 also predicts high temperatures, the fuel stagnates at a smaller CR. The integrated code-to-code comparison reveals how magnetic insulation, heat conduction, and radiation transport affect platform performance and the feasibility of the SZP concept.</description>

      <title>Quasi-one-dimensional spin transport in altermagnetic $Z^3$ nodal net metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00371v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In three dimensions, quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) transport has traditionally been associated with systems featuring a Q1D chain structure. Here, based on first-principle calculations, we go beyond the common belief to show that the Q1D transport can also be realized in many three-dimensional (3D) altermagnetic (AM) metals with a topological nodal net in momentum space but lacking Q1D chain structure in real space, including the existing compounds $\beta$-Fe$_2$(PO$_4$)O, Co$_2$(PO$_4$)O, and LiTi$_2$O$_4$. These materials exhibit an AM ground state and feature an ideal crossed $Z^3$ Weyl nodal line in each spin channel, formed by three straight and flat nodal lines traversing the entire Brillouin zone. These nodal lines eventually lead to an AM $Z^3$ nodal net. Surprisingly, longitudinal conductivity $\sigma_{xx}$ in these topological nodal net metals is dozens of times larger than $\sigma_{yy}$ and $\sigma_{zz}$ in the up-spin channel, while $\sigma_{yy}$ dominates transport in the down-spin channel. This suggests a distinctive Q1D transport signature in each spin channel, with orthogonal principal moving directions for the two spin channels, resulting in Q1D direction-dependent spin transport. This novel phenomenon cannot be found in both conventional 3D bulk materials and Q1D chain materials. In particular, it gradually disappears as the Fermi level moves away from the nodal net, further confirming its topological origin. Our work not only enhances the comprehension of topological physics in altermagnets but also opens a new direction for the exploration of topological spintronics.</description>
