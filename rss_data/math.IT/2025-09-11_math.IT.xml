      <title>The Linear Reliability Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a discrete soft-decision channel called the linear reliability channel (LRC) in which the soft information is the rank ordering of the received symbol reliabilities. We prove that the LRC is an appropriate approximation to a general class of discrete modulation, continuous noise channels when the noise variance is high. The central feature of the LRC is that its combinatorial nature allows for an extensive mathematical analysis of the channel and its corresponding hard- and soft-decision maximum likelihood (ML) decoders. In particular, we establish explicit error exponents for ML decoding in the LRC when using random codes under both hard- and soft-decision decoding. This analysis allows for a direct, quantitative evaluation of the relative advantage of soft-decision decoding. The discrete geometry of the LRC is distinct from that of the BSC, which is characterized by the Hamming weight, offering a new perspective on code construction for soft-decision settings.</description>

      <title>Holographic Beamforming for Integrated Sensing and Communication with Mutual Coupling Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is envisioned as a key technology in 6G networks, owing to its potential for high spectral and cost efficiency. As a promising solution for extremely large-scale arrays, reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHS) can be integrated with ISAC to form the holographic ISAC paradigm, where enlarged radiation apertures of RHS can achieve significant beamforming gains, thereby improving both communication and sensing performance. In this paper, we investigate holographic beamforming designs for ISAC systems, which, unlike existing holographic beamforming schemes developed for RHS-aided communications, requires explicit consideration of mutual coupling effects within RHS. This is because, different from prior works only considering communication performance, ISAC systems incorporate sensing functionality, which is sensitive to sidelobe levels. Ignoring mutual coupling in holographic beamforming can lead to notable undesired sidelobes, thus degrading sensing performance. The consideration of mutual coupling introduces new challenges, i.e., it induces non-linearity in beamforming problems, rendering them inherently non-convex. To address this issue, we propose a tractable electromagnetic-compliant holographic ISAC model that characterizes mutual coupling in a closed form using coupled dipole approximations. We then develop an efficient mutual coupling aware holographic beamforming algorithm to suppress sidelobes and enhance ISAC performance. Numerical results validate effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>SCA-LLM: Spectral-Attentive Channel Prediction with Large Language Models in MIMO-OFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the success of large language models (LLMs) has inspired growing interest in exploring their potential applications in wireless communications, especially for channel prediction tasks. However, directly applying LLMs to channel prediction faces a domain mismatch issue stemming from their text-based pre-training. To mitigate this, the ``adapter + LLM" paradigm has emerged, where an adapter is designed to bridge the domain gap between the channel state information (CSI) data and LLMs. While showing initial success, existing adapters may not fully exploit the potential of this paradigm. To address this limitation, this work provides a key insight that learning representations from the spectral components of CSI features can more effectively help bridge the domain gap. Accordingly, we propose a spectral-attentive framework, named SCA-LLM, for channel prediction in multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. Specifically, its novel adapter can capture finer spectral details and better adapt the LLM for channel prediction than previous methods. Extensive simulations show that SCA-LLM achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance and strong generalization, yielding up to $-2.4~\text{dB}$ normalized mean squared error (NMSE) advantage over the previous LLM based method. Ablation studies further confirm the superiority of SCA-LLM in mitigating domain mismatch.</description>

      <title>The Shannon Upper Bound for the Error Exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the discrete-time additive white generalized Gaussian noise channel with a generalized input power constraint, with the respective shape and power parameters &gt;= 1, we derive an upper bound on the optimal block error exponent. Explicit asymptotic upper bounds in the limit of a large block length n are given for three special cases: the Laplace noise channel and the Gaussian noise channel with the average absolute value constraint, and for the Laplace noise channel with the second power constraint. The derivation uses the method of types with finite alphabets of sizes depending on the block length n and with the number of types sub-exponential in n.</description>

      <title>Deep holes of a class of twisted Reed-Solomon codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deep hole problem is a fundamental problem in coding theory, and it has many important applications in code constructions and cryptography. The deep hole problem of Reed-Solomon codes has gained a lot of attention. As a generalization of Reed-Solomon codes, we investigate the problem of deep holes of a class of twisted Reed-Solomon codes in this paper.
  Firstly, we provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for $\boldsymbol{a}=(a_{0},a_{1},\cdots,a_{n-k-1})\in\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n-k}$ to be the syndrome of some deep hole of $TRS_{k}(\mathcal{A},l,\eta)$. Next, we consider the problem of determining all deep holes of the twisted Reed-Solomon codes $TRS_{k}(\mathbb{F}_{q}^{*},k-1,\eta)$. Specifically, we prove that there are no other deep holes of $TRS_{k}(\mathbb{F}_{q}^{*},k-1,\eta)$ for $\frac{3q+2\sqrt{q}-8}{4}\leq k\leq q-5$ when q is even, and $\frac{3q+3\sqrt{q}-5}{4}\leq k\leq q-5$ when q is odd. We also completely determine their deep holes for $q-4\leq k\leq q-2$ when $q$ is even.</description>

      <title>The Landscape of Fairness: An Axiomatic and Predictive Framework for Network QoE Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating network-wide fairness is challenging because it is not a static property but one highly sensitive to Service Level Agreement (SLA) parameters. This paper introduces a complete analytical framework to transform fairness evaluation from a single-point measurement into a proactive engineering discipline centered on a predictable sensitivity landscape. Our framework is built upon a QoE-Imbalance metric whose form is not an ad-hoc choice, but is uniquely determined by a set of fundamental axioms of fairness, ensuring its theoretical soundness. To navigate the fairness landscape across the full spectrum of service demands, we first derive a closed-form covariance rule. This rule provides an interpretable, local compass, expressing the fairness gradient as the covariance between a path's information-theoretic importance and its parameter sensitivity. We then construct phase diagrams to map the global landscape, revealing critical topological features such as robust "stable belts" and high-risk "dangerous wedges". Finally, an analysis of the landscape's curvature yields actionable, topology-aware design rules, including an optimal "Threshold-First" tuning strategy. Ultimately, our framework provides the tools to map, interpret, and navigate the landscape of system sensitivity, enabling the design of more robust and resilient networks.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity CSI Acquisition Exploiting Geographical Diversity in Fluid Antenna System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) employs reconfigurable antennas for high spatial gains in compact spaces, enhancing physical layer flexibility. Channel state information (CSI) acquisition is vital for port selection and FAS optimization. Greedy algorithms rely on signal assumptions, and model-free methods face high complexity. A flexible, low-complexity solution is needed for massive connectivity in FAS. Based on expectation maximization-approximate message passing (EM-AMP) framework, efficient matrix computations and adaptive learning without prior model knowledge naturally suit CSI acquisition for FAS. We propose a EM-AMP variant exploiting FAS geographical priors, improving estimation precision, accelerating convergence, and reducing complexity in large-scale deployment. Simulations validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Systems: A Geometric Approach to Error Probability and Fundamental Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) concept is an emerging paradigm that promotes the utilization of the feature of shape and position reconfigurability in antennas to broaden the design of wireless communication systems. This also means that spatial diversity can be exploited in an unconventional way. However, a rigorous framework for error probability analysis of FAS under realistic spatially correlated channels has been lacking. In this paper, we fill this gap by deriving a tight, closed-form asymptotic expression for the symbol error rate (SER) that establishes the fundamental scaling law linking the system's SER to the channel's spatial correlation structure. A key insight of our analysis is that the achievable diversity gain is governed not by the number of antenna ports, but by the channel's effective rank. To find this critical parameter, we propose a novel dual-pronged approach. First of all, we develop a geometry-based algorithm that extracts distinct performance thresholds from the channel's eigenvalue spectrum. Second, we theoretically prove that the effective rank converges to a fundamental limit dictated solely by the antenna's normalized aperture width. We further establish the equivalence between the threshold identified by the geometric algorithm and the derived theoretical limit, providing rigorous validation for the proposed method. Our effective rank model achieves higher accuracy than existing approaches in the literature. Building on this framework, we offer a complete characterization of diversity and coding gains. The analysis leads to a definitive design insight: FAS performance improvements are fundamentally driven by enlarging the antenna's explorable aperture, which increases the effective channel rank, whereas increasing port density within a fixed aperture yields diminishing returns.</description>

      <title>Optimizing information flow in Gene Regulatory Networks: a geometric perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of gene regulatory networks is governed by the interaction between deterministic biochemical reactions and molecular noise. To understand how gene regulatory networks process information during cell state transitions, we study stochastic dynamics derived from a Boolean network model via its representation on the parameter space of Gaussian distributions, equipped with the Fisher information metric. This reformulation reveals that the trajectories of optimal information transfer are gradient flows of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We demonstrate that the most efficient dynamics require isotropic decay rates across all nodes and that the noise intensity quantitatively determines the potential differentiation between the initial and final states. Furthermore, we show that paths minimizing biological cost correspond to metric geodesics that require noise suppression, leading to biologically irrelevant deterministic dynamics. Our approach frames noise and decay rates as fundamental control parameters for cellular differentiation, providing a geometric principle for the analysis and design of synthetic networks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Sum Capacity via Quantum and No-Signaling Cooperation Between Transmitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a communication scenario over a discrete memoryless interference channel or multiple access channel without feedback, where transmitters exploit classical, quantum, or no-signaling cooperation. In this scenario, several previous works have shown that the sum capacities of channels involving pseudo-telepathy games can be enhanced by quantum or no-signaling cooperation. However, a full characterization of which channels admit such an improvement remains open. By focusing on the common characteristics of previously studied channels, we propose a broader class of channels for which quantum or no-signaling cooperation increases the sum capacity. Channels in this class are associated with a pseudo-telepathy game, with channel inputs specified as tuples of questions and answers from the game. In addition, when the channel inputs satisfy the winning condition of the game, the channel decomposes into parallel weakly symmetric sub-channels and is less noisy compared to the case when the inputs do not meet the winning condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article proposes a paraconsistent framework for evaluating similarity in knowledge bases. Unlike classical approaches, this framework explicitly integrates contradictions, enabling a more robust and interpretable similarity measure. A new measure $ S^* $ is introduced, which penalizes inconsistencies while rewarding shared properties. Paraconsistent super-categories $ \Xi_K^* $ are defined to hierarchically organize knowledge entities. The model also includes a contradiction extractor $ E $ and a repair mechanism, ensuring consistency in the evaluations. Theoretical results guarantee reflexivity, symmetry, and boundedness of $ S^* $. This approach offers a promising solution for managing conflicting knowledge, with perspectives in multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Array-Aided Hybrid Beamforming for Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is one of the pivotal supporting technologies for next-generation wireless communication networks. As an emerging technical means, the new six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) system can effectively improve the communication and sensing performance of ISAC systems. However, related research on the architecture based on three-dimensional rotatable antennas (RA) remains relatively limited. Especially under the influence of non-ideal channel characteristics, how to balance system performance and hardware cost control through beamforming technology in non-ideal channels has become a crucial issue to be solved urgently. Given the significant advantages of hybrid beamforming technology in balancing system performance and hardware complexity, this paper focuses on the channel model considering effective aperture loss under the RA architecture and studies the sub-connected hybrid beamforming design for multi-user ISAC systems. Aiming at the non-convex nature with coupled variables in this problem, this paper first transforms the complex fractional objective function using the Fractional Programming (FP) framework, and then proposes an algorithm based on the Alternating Optimization (AO) architecture, which achieves optimization by alternately solving five subproblems. Among them, the closed-form update expression of the array rotation angle is derived through the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, and a two-stage Gradient Ascent (GA) based method is proposed to optimize the antenna rotation angle. Simulation results show that compared with the traditional fixed-position antenna (FPA), the proposed method can significantly improve the overall performance of the system.</description>

      <title>Perfectly-Private Analog Secure Aggregation in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In federated learning, multiple parties train models locally and share their parameters with a central server, which aggregates them to update a global model. To address the risk of exposing sensitive data through local models, secure aggregation via secure multiparty computation has been proposed to enhance privacy. At the same time, perfect privacy can only be achieved by a uniform distribution of the masked local models to be aggregated. This raises a problem when working with real valued data, as there is no measure on the reals that is invariant under the masking operation, and hence information leakage is bound to occur. Shifting the data to a finite field circumvents this problem, but as a downside runs into an inherent accuracy complexity tradeoff issue due to fixed point modular arithmetic as opposed to floating point numbers that can simultaneously handle numbers of varying magnitudes. In this paper, a novel secure parameter aggregation method is proposed that employs the torus rather than a finite field. This approach guarantees perfect privacy for each party's data by utilizing the uniform distribution on the torus, while avoiding accuracy losses. Experimental results show that the new protocol performs similarly to the model without secure aggregation while maintaining perfect privacy. Compared to the finite field secure aggregation, the torus-based protocol can in some cases significantly outperform it in terms of model accuracy and cosine similarity, hence making it a safer choice.</description>

      <title>Deep Unrolling of Sparsity-Induced RDO for 3D Point Cloud Attribute Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given encoded 3D point cloud geometry available at the decoder, we study the problem of lossy attribute compression in a multi-resolution B-spline projection framework. A target continuous 3D attribute function is first projected onto a sequence of nested subspaces $\mathcal{F}^{(p)}_{l_0} \subseteq \cdots \subseteq \mathcal{F}^{(p)}_{L}$, where $\mathcal{F}^{(p)}_{l}$ is a family of functions spanned by a B-spline basis function of order $p$ at a chosen scale and its integer shifts. The projected low-pass coefficients $F_l^*$ are computed by variable-complexity unrolling of a rate-distortion (RD) optimization algorithm into a feed-forward network, where the rate term is the sparsity-promoting $\ell_1$-norm. Thus, the projection operation is end-to-end differentiable. For a chosen coarse-to-fine predictor, the coefficients are then adjusted to account for the prediction from a lower-resolution to a higher-resolution, which is also optimized in a data-driven manner.</description>

      <title>GC+ Code: A Systematic Short Blocklength Code for Correcting Random Edit Errors in DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01244v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Storing digital data in synthetic DNA faces challenges in ensuring data reliability in the presence of edit errors--deletions, insertions, and substitutions--that occur randomly during various stages of the storage process. Current limitations in DNA synthesis technology also impose the use of short DNA sequences, highlighting the particular need for short edit-correcting codes. Motivated by these factors, we introduce a systematic code designed to correct random edits while adhering to typical length constraints in DNA storage. We evaluate its performance both theoretically and through simulations, and assess its integration within a DNA storage framework, revealing promising results.</description>

      <title>Alternating Minimization Schemes for Computing Rate-Distortion-Perception Functions with $f$-Divergence Perception Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the computation of the rate-distortion-perception function (RDPF) for discrete memoryless sources subject to a single-letter average distortion constraint and a perception constraint belonging to the family of $f$-divergences. In this setting, the RDPF forms a convex programming problem for which we characterize optimal parametric solutions. We employ the developed solutions in an alternating minimization scheme, namely Optimal Alternating Minimization (OAM), for which we provide convergence guarantees. Nevertheless, the OAM scheme does not lead to a direct implementation of a generalized Blahut-Arimoto (BA) type of algorithm due to implicit equations in the iteration's structure. To overcome this difficulty, we propose two alternative minimization approaches whose applicability depends on the smoothness of the used perception metric: a Newton-based Alternating Minimization (NAM) scheme, relying on Newton's root-finding method for the approximation of the optimal solution of the iteration, and a Relaxed Alternating Minimization (RAM) scheme, based on relaxing the OAM iterates. We show, by deriving necessary and sufficient conditions, that both schemes guarantee convergence to a globally optimal solution. We also provide sufficient conditions on the distortion and perception constraints, which guarantee that the proposed algorithms converge exponentially fast in the number of iteration steps. We corroborate our theoretical results with numerical simulations and establish connections with existing results.</description>

      <title>Recursively Extended Permutation Codes under Chebyshev Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the construction and analysis of permutation codes under the Chebyshev distance. Direct product group permutation (DPGP) codes, independently introduced by Kl\o ve et al. and Tamo et al., represent the best-known class of permutation codes in terms of both size and minimum distance, while also allowing for algebraic and efficient encoding and decoding. In contrast, this study focuses on recursively extended permutation (REP) codes, proposed by Kl\o ve et al. as a recursive alternative. We analyze the properties of REP codes and prove that, despite their distinct construction principles, optimal REP codes achieve exactly the same size and minimum distance as the best DPGP codes under the Chebyshev metric. This surprising equivalence uncovers a deep connection between two structurally dissimilar code families and establishes REP codes as a structurally flexible yet equally powerful alternative to DPGP codes. In addition, we present efficient encoding and decoding algorithms for REP codes, including a sequential encoder with $O(n \log n)$ complexity and a bounded-distance decoder with $O(n \log^2 n)$ complexity.</description>

      <title>On the Optimality of Gaussian Code-books for Signaling over a Two-Users Weak Gaussian Interference Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article shows that the capacity region of a 2-users weak Gaussian interference channel is achieved using Gaussian code-books. The approach relies on traversing the boundary in incremental steps. Starting from a corner point with Gaussian code-books, and relying on calculus of variation, it is shown that the end point in each step is achieved using Gaussian code-books. Optimality of Gaussian code-books is first established by limiting the random coding to independent and identically distributed scalar (single-letter) samples. Then, it is shown that the optimum solution for vector inputs coincides with the single-letter case. It is also shown that the maximum number of phases needed to realize the gain due to power allocation over time is two. It is also established that the solution to the Han-Kobayashi achievable rate region, with single letter Gaussian random code-books, achieves the optimum boundary.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagonal RIS in Multiuser MIMO: Graph Theoretic Modeling and Optimal Architectures with Low Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) is regarded as a key enabler of wave/analog-domain beamforming, processing, and computing in future wireless communication systems. Recently, Beyond Diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has been proposed as a generalization of conventional RIS, offering enhanced design flexibility thanks to the presence of tunable impedances that connect RIS elements. However, increased interconnections lead to high circuit complexity, which poses a significant practical challenge. In this paper, we address the fundamental open question: What is the class of BD-RIS architectures that achieves the optimal performance in a RIS-aided multiuser multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system? By modeling BD-RIS architectures using graph theory, we identify a class of BD-RIS architectures that achieves the optimal performance--matching that of fully-connected RIS--while maintaining low circuit complexity. Our result holds for a broad class of performance metrics, including the commonly used sum channel gain/sum-rate/energy efficiency maximization, transmit power minimization, and the information-theoretic capacity region. The number of tunable impedances in the proposed class is ${O}(N\min\{D,N/2\})$, where $N$ denotes the number of RIS elements and $D$ is the degree of freedom of the multiuser MIMO channel, i.e., the minimum between the number of transmit antennas and the total number of received antennas across all users. Since $D$ is much smaller than $N$ in practice, the complexity scales as ${O}(ND)$, which is substantially lower than the ${O}(N^2)$ complexity of fully-connected RIS. We further introduce two novel BD-RIS architectures--band-connected RIS and stem-connected RIS--and show that they belong to the optimal architecture class under certain conditions. Simulation results validate the optimality and enhanced performance-complexity tradeoff of our proposed architectures.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis of Multi-coding with Arbitrary Correlations Among the Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of non-orthogonal signals has several benefits over orthogonal signals in multi-coded communications. We provide a novel, theoretical study of non-orthogonal signaling to expand the applicability of these schemes. Motivated by a class of multi-carrier spread spectrum systems, this paper presents a thorough symbol error rate analysis of the broad class of multi-code signaling methods when they make use of codes which are not necessarily orthogonal. Our analysis is also extended to the case where the code set includes the negative of each code vector, i.e., an extension to biorthogonal signaling. Moreover, it is shown that the symbol error rate results derived in this paper reduce to those available in the literature when the multi-codes are orthogonal or have equal correlation between vectors. Additionally, we show how Monte Carlo integration can be used to evaluate the integrals in the error probability calculation and derive low complexity upper bounds on the error probabilities. We show that by combining these techniques, the error probability can be efficiently computed across the full SNR regime. Finally, we use the upper bound of the error probability to develop some analytical insights about the impacts of non-orthogonality among the code vectors on the symbol error probability.</description>

      <title>SDP bounds on quantum codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a semidefinite programming hierarchy based on state polynomial optimization to determine the existence of quantum codes with given parameters. The hierarchy is complete, in the sense that a $(\!(n, K, {\delta})\!)_2$ code exists if and only if every level of the hierarchy is feasible. It is not limited to stabilizer codes and thus is applicable generally. While the machinery is formally dimension-free, we restrict it to qubit codes through quasi-Clifford algebras. We derive the quantum analog of a range of classical results: first, from an intermediate level a Lov\'asz bound for self-dual quantum codes is recovered. Second, a symmetrization of a minor variation of this Lov\'asz bound recovers the quantum Delsarte bound. Third, a symmetry reduction using the Terwilliger algebra leads to semidefinite programming bounds of size $O(n^4)$. With this we give an alternative proof that there is no $(\!(7, 1, 4)\!)_2$ quantum code, and show that $(\!(8, 9, 3)\!)_2$ and $(\!(10, 5, 4)\!)_2$ codes do not exist.</description>
