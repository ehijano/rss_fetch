      <title>An Efficient Algorithm for Constrained CASSCF(1,2) and CASSCF(3,2) Simulations as Relevant to Electron and Hole Transfer Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficient algorithm for the recently published electron/hole-transfer Dynamical-weighted State-averaged Constrained CASSCF (eDSC/hDSC) method studying charge transfer states and D$_1$-D$_0$ crossings for systems with odd numbers of electrons. By separating the constrained minimization problem into an unconstrained self-consistent-field (SCF) problem and a constrained non-self-consistent-field (nSCF) problem, and accelerating the direct inversion in the iterative subspace (DIIS) technique to solve the SCF problem, the overall computational cost is reduced by a factor of 8 to 20 compared with directly using sequential quadratic programming (SQP). This approach should be applicable for other constrained minimization problems and, in the immediate future, once gradients are available, the present eDSC/hDSC algorithm should allow for speedy non-adiabatic dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>A multi-dimensional, robust, and cell-centered finite-volume scheme for the ideal MHD equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new multi-dimensional, robust, and cell-centered finite-volume scheme for the ideal MHD equations. This scheme relies on relaxation and splitting techniques and can be easily used at high order. A fully conservative version is not entropy satisfying but is observed experimentally to be more robust than standard constrained transport schemes at low plasma beta. At very low plasma beta and high Alfv\'en number, we have designed an entropy-satisfying version that is not conservative for the magnetic field but preserves admissible states and we switch locally a-priori between the two versions depending on the regime of plasma beta and Alfv\'en number. This strategy is robust in a wide range of standard MHD test cases, all performed at second order with a classic MUSCL-Hancock scheme.</description>

      <title>Description of electromagnetic fields in inhomogeneous accelerating sections. I Field representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present the results of a study of the possibility of using a homogeneous basis and a new generalization of coupled modes theory to describe inhomogeneous accelerating sections. It was shown that the single mode representation describes the electromagnetic fields with small errors in the regular part of the section. In the couplers the accuracy is worse, but it is small enough to be used in calculations. Solving the equations of generalized coupled modes theory requires calculating the derivatives of the fields with respect to various geometrical parameters. Procedures for calculating these derivatives have been developed.</description>

      <title>Generalized Representative Structures for Atomistic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new method is presented to generate atomic structures that reproduce the essential characteristics of arbitrary material systems, phases, or ensembles. Previous methods allow one to reproduce the essential characteristics (e.g. chemical disorder) of a large random alloy within a small crystal structure. The ability to generate small representations of random alloys, with the restriction to crystal systems, results from using the fixed-lattice cluster correlations to describe structural characteristics. A more general description of the structural characteristics of atomic systems is obtained using complete sets of atomic environment descriptors. These are used within for generating representative atomic structures without restriction to fixed lattices. A general data-driven approach is provided utilizing the atomic cluster expansion(ACE) basis. The N-body ACE descriptors are a complete set of atomic environment descriptors that span both chemical and spatial degrees of freedom and are used within for describing atomic structures. The generalized representative structure(GRS) method presented within generates small atomic structures that reproduce ACE descriptor distributions corresponding to arbitrary structural and chemical complexity. It is shown that systematically improvable representations of crystalline systems on fixed parent lattices, amorphous materials, liquids, and ensembles of atomic structures may be produced efficiently through optimization algorithms. We highlight reduced representations of atomistic machine-learning training datasets that contain similar amounts of information and small 40-72 atom representations of liquid phases. The ability to use GRS methodology as a driver for informed novel structure generation is also demonstrated. The advantages over other data-driven methods and state-of-the-art methods restricted to high-symmetry systems are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Effects of Trailing Edge Thickness on NACA 4412 Airfoil Performance at Low Reynolds Numbers: A CFD Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the augmentation of the significance of wind energy, giving a high priority to the \text{airfoil's} efficiency enhancement is obligatory. To improve the performance of airfoils, many impressive techniques are already invented. In this article, the trailing edge of the NACA 4412 airfoil is modified by changing the thickness. CFD is used in this study, which aids in the identification of several important details. For our investigation, we choose the reliable Spalart Almaras model and the Reynolds number is 300k. Overall, the results demonstrate that using \(0.8\%\) thickness at the trailing edge of the NACA 4412 airfoil is viable to obtain the best output. The predominant reason is that not only the better coefficient of lift but also the preferable lift-to-drag \(\frac{C_L}{C_D}\) ratio is found in this configuration. However, using \(0.2\%\) thickness at the trailing edge reduces performance as a whole. So, it is recommended to utilize \(0.2\%\) thickness on the trailing edge of the NACA 4412 airfoil.</description>

      <title>High-order Space-time Flux Reconstruction Methods for Moving Domain Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A high-order space-time flux reconstruction (FR) method has been developed to solve conservation laws on moving domains. In the space-time framework, the moving domain simulation is similar to that on a stationary domain, except that the shape of the space-time elements varies with time (and space when a deforming grid is used). The geometric conservation law can be automatically satisfied to the level of the numerical resolution of the space-time schemes when the space-time discretization of the governing partial differential equations can resolve the geometric nonlinearity of curvilinear space-time elements. In this study, a space-time tensor product operation is used to construct the FR formulation, and the Gauss-Legendre quadrature points are used as solution points both in space and time. A dual time stepping method is used to solve the resulting space-time system. As has been proved by Huynh [J Sci Comput 96, 51 (2023)], in the temporal direction, the FR scheme with the Gauss-Legendre solution points is equivalent to the so-called DG-Gauss implicit Runge-Kutta (IRK) scheme when the quadrature rule based on the solution points (i.e. quadrature points used in DG) is sufficiently accurate to integrate the space-time curvilinear elements. Specifically, we show that when linear space-time elements are adopted in moving domain simulations, the temporal FR scheme based on Gauss-Legendre solution points can always guarantee its equivalency to IRK DG-Gauss. The conditions, under which the moving domain simulation with the method of lines are consistent with those using the space-time formulation, are also discussed. The new space-time FR method can achieve arbitrarily high-order spatial and temporal accuracy without numerical constraints on the physical time step in moving domain simulations. The temporal superconvergence property for moving domain simulations have been demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Higher-order-ReLU-KANs (HRKANs) for solving physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) more accurately, robustly and faster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) is an important and essential component in many scientific and engineering discoveries. One of the common approaches empowered by deep learning is Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Recently, a new type of fundamental neural network model, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), has been proposed as a substitute of Multilayer Perceptions (MLPs), and possesses trainable activation functions. To enhance KANs in fitting accuracy, a modification of KANs, so called ReLU-KANs, using "square of ReLU" as the basis of its activation functions has been suggested. In this work, we propose another basis of activation functions, namely, Higher-order-ReLU, which is simpler than the basis of activation functions used in KANs, namely, B-splines; allows efficient KAN matrix operations; and possesses smooth and non-zero higher-order derivatives, essential for physics-informed neural networks. Our detailed experiments on two standard and typical PDEs, namely, the linear Poisson equation and nonlinear Burgers' equation with viscosity, reveal that our proposed Higher-order-ReLU-KANs (HRKANs) achieve the highest fitting accuracy and training robustness and lowest training time significantly among KANs, ReLUKANs and HRKANs.</description>

      <title>Improvement of NACA6309 Airfoil with Passive Air-Flow Control by using Trailing Edge Flap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When fossil fuel supplies can no longer be replenished and hence fossil fuel power generation becomes outdated, wind energy will become a vital solution to the impending energy crisis. A horizontal-axis wind turbine is a widely used technology that is highly dependent on the design of high-performing airfoils. In this paper, we have studied the performance of the NACA6309 airfoil and designed it by modifying the airfoil with a trailing edge plain flap. Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations are utilized for this purpose. We have designed sixteen configurations of NACA 6309 airfoil by using plain flaps at the trailing edge and studied their aerodynamic performance. After comparing the lift, drag, and lift-to-drag ratios, it is evident that the \(1^\circ\) up-flap configuration generates the best output. In addition, the \(10^\circ\) down flap provides the worst performance among all configurations. Finally, pressure contours and velocity contours around the airfoils are presented, which describe the overall characteristics.</description>

      <title>The zero-sum rock-paper-scissors game with non-exponential waiting times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Waiting times between successive events play an important role in population dynamics and can vary widely, notably due to environmental conditions. In this work, we focus on the zero-sum rock-paper-scissors (zRPS) model, broadly used to describe cyclic dominance in ecology and biology, with non-Markovian dynamics and study how its survival and fixation properties are affected by interevent times. When the dynamics are Markovian, with exponentially-distributed waiting times, the fate of zRPS games in large well-mixed populations obeys the simple, yet counterintuitive, ``law of the weakest'': the species with the lowest predation-reproduction rate is the most likely to prevail, with a fixation/survival probability asymptotically approaching one. Here, we systematically study how the fixation/survival behavior is influenced by power-law and gamma waiting time distributions, and analyze the deviations from the law of the weakest. Importantly, we determine the phases of the parameter space in which each species dominates, and how these crucially depend on memory and history-dependent interactions. Analytical calculations, which yield nontrivial memory kernels, support our numerical results, shedding light on the evolutionary influence of long waiting times.</description>

      <title>Phonon Dephasing, Entanglement and Exchange-Only Toffoli Gate Sequence in Quantum Dot Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum dot spin chain system is vital for quantum simulation and studying collective electron behaviors, necessitating an understanding of its mechanisms and control protocols. Chapter 1 introduces key concepts, focusing on the extended Hubbard model, double quantum dot systems, and electron-phonon coupling. Chapter 2 explores electron-phonon coupling in multielectron double quantum dots under unbiased and biased scenarios via detuning variations. In the unbiased case, dephasing due to electron-phonon coupling generally increases with more electrons in the right dot; this trend is inconsistent in the biased case, suggesting potential advantages of multielectron quantum dots under certain conditions. Chapter 3 investigates entanglement entropy in a multielectron quantum dot spin chain described by the extended Hubbard model. Local and pairwise entanglement are influenced by Coulomb interactions, tunneling strengths, electronic configurations, and site potential energies. The entanglement diagram reveals phase transitions significantly impacted by coupling strength ratios and potential energy variations; adjusting the potential energy of a specific dot critically influences ground state configurations and entanglement entropy. Chapter 4, inspired by the decoherence-free subspace concept, explores operation sequences in a nine-spin, nine-quantum-dot system defined by the Heisenberg model, with bases determined by total angular momentum quantum numbers. Employing the Krotov method of quantum optimal control, we identify a more efficient pulse-level operation sequence for an exchange-only quantum dot spin chain, offering a superior alternative to conventional quantum gate decomposition and potentially enhancing the development of more concise quantum algorithm representations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the predictability of dynamical systems: a new local data-driven approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems are ubiquitous in nature and they are hard to forecast. Not only they may be sensitive to small perturbations in their initial conditions, but they are often composed of processes acting at multiple scales. Classical approaches based on the Lyapunov spectrum rely on the knowledge of the dynamic forward operator, or of a data-derived approximation of it. This operator is typically unknown, or the data are too noisy to derive a faithful representation. Here, we propose a new data-driven approach to analyze the local predictability of dynamical systems. This method, based on the concept of recurrence, is closely linked to the well-established framework of local dynamical indices. Applied to both idealized systems and real-world datasets, this new index shows results consistent with existing knowledge, proving its effectiveness in estimating local predictability. Additionally, we discuss its relationship with local dynamical indices, illustrating how it complements the previous framework as a more direct measure of predictability. Furthermore, we explore its reflection of the scale-dependent nature of predictability, its extension that includes a weighting strategy, and its real-time application. We believe these aspects collectively demonstrate its potential as a powerful diagnostic tool for complex systems.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study on the core-excited states of the allyl using CVS-icMRCISD method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The allyl radical (C3H5) is a well-characterized hydrocarbon radical, renowned for its pivotal role as an intermediate species in high-energy environments. Its core excited states can elucidate intricate details pertaining to its electronic and structural properties. The core excited states of allyl were studied experimentally using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and the primary characteristic peaks were assigned using the MCSCF approach, but not entirely. In this work, the recently developed CVS-icMRCISD scheme was used to simulate the excitation and ionization processes of C's K-shell electrons within allyl radicals, cations, and anions, respectively. Our results indicate that the XAS spectrum obtained not merely captured the distinctive peaks associated with allyl radicals, but also encompassed the characteristic peaks pertaining to allyl cations. Meanwhile, unlike manually adjusting the state weights of different electronic states to align with experimental spectral data, we adopt the CVS-icMRCISD scheme, which uses state averaging and produces unbiased results, making it suitable for studying multiple states simultaneously and easy to converge. More importantly, when accounting for the dynamic electron correlation, our results align seamlessly with the experimental XAS. This congruence underscores the potential of our CVS-icMRCISD as a robust tool for theoretical investigations pertaining to the excitation of inner shell electrons in small molecules.</description>

      <title>Meta-Generalized-Gradient Approximation made Magnetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Jacob's ladder of density functional theory (DFT) proposes the compelling view that by extending the form of successful approximations -- being guided by exact conditions and selected (least empirical) norms -- upper rungs will do better than the lower, thus allowing to balance accuracy and computational effort. Meta-generalized-gradient-approximations (MGGA) belong to the last rung of the semi-local approximations before hybridization with non-local wave function theories. The performance of MGGAs on {\em non} magnetic systems greatly improves upon that of GGAs from the lower rung. Instead, failures of MGGAs on magnetic materials are daunting and make GGAs more reliable for magnetism. This raises the question as to whether consistent improvements can be achieved for magnetism along the lines of the Jacob's ladder. Here, we present a solution from first principles: departing from the standard approach (i.e. collinear spin-DFT), we exploit the U(1)$\times$SU(2) gauge symmetry of the exact functional of spin-current-DFT to access an extended set of building blocks for approximations. Crucially, this allows us to treat broken symmetry ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states. For these states, we derive a collinear MGGA that performs well for prototypical magnets and make it available in an implementation in the \textsc{Crystal} electronic structure package.</description>

Abstract: We present TURB-Lagr, a new open database of 3d turbulent Lagrangian trajectories, obtained by Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of the original Navier-Stokes equations in the presence of a homogeneous and isotropic forcing. The aim is to provide the community interested in data-assimilation and/or Lagrangian-properties of turbulence a new testing-ground made of roughly 300K different Lagrangian trajectories. TURB-Lagr data are influenced by the strong non-Gaussian fluctuations characteristic of turbulence and by the rough and non differentiable fields. In addition, coming from fully resolved numerical simulations of the original partial differential equations, they offer the possibility to apply a wide range of approaches, from equation-free to physics-based models. TURB-Lagr data are reachable at http://smart-turb.roma2.infn.it</description>

      <title>A Resolution Independent Neural Operator</title>

Abstract: The Deep operator network (DeepONet) is a powerful yet simple neural operator architecture that utilizes two deep neural networks to learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. This architecture is highly flexible, allowing the evaluation of the solution field at any location within the desired domain. However, it imposes a strict constraint on the input space, requiring all input functions to be discretized at the same locations; this limits its practical applications. In this work, we introduce RINO, which provides a framework to make DeepONet resolution-independent, enabling it to handle input functions that are arbitrarily, but sufficiently finely, discretized. To this end, we propose two dictionary learning algorithms to adaptively learn a set of appropriate continuous basis functions, parameterized as implicit neural representations (INRs), from correlated signals defined on arbitrary point cloud data. These basis functions are then used to project arbitrary input function data as a point cloud onto an embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions) with dimensionality equal to the dictionary size, which DeepONet can directly use without any architectural changes. In particular, we utilize sinusoidal representation networks (SIRENs) as trainable INR basis functions. The introduced dictionary learning algorithms can be used in a similar way to learn an appropriate dictionary of basis functions for the output function data. This approach can be seen as an extension of POD DeepONet for cases where the realizations of the output functions have different discretizations, making the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) approach inapplicable. We demonstrate the robustness and applicability of RINO in handling arbitrarily (but sufficiently richly) sampled input and output functions during both training and inference through several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A highly accurate procedure for computing globally optimal Wannier functions in one-dimensional crystalline insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A standard task in solid state physics and quantum chemistry is the computation of localized molecular orbitals known as Wannier functions. In this manuscript, we propose a new procedure for computing Wannier functions in one-dimensional crystalline materials. Our approach proceeds by first performing parallel transport of the Bloch functions using numerical integration. Then a simple analytically computable correction is introduced to yield the optimally localized Wannier function. The resulting scheme is rapidly convergent and proven to produce globally optimal Wannier functions. The analysis in this manuscript can also be viewed as a proof of the existence of exponentially localized Wannier functions in one dimension. We illustrate the performance of the scheme by a number of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Sparse Solvers for Severely Ill-Conditioned Linear Systems in Geophysical Marker-In-Cell Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving sparse linear systems is a critical challenge in many scientific and engineering fields, particularly when these systems are severely ill-conditioned. This work aims to provide a comprehensive comparison of various solvers designed for such problems, offering valuable insights and guidance for domain scientists and researchers. We develop the tools required to accurately evaluate the performance and correctness of 16 solvers from 11 state-of-the-art numerical libraries, focusing on their effectiveness in handling ill-conditioned matrices. The solvers were tested on linear systems arising from a coupled hydro-mechanical marker-in-cell geophysical simulation. To address the challenge of computing accurate error bounds on the solution, we introduce the Projected Adam method, a novel algorithm to efficiently compute the condition number of a matrix without relying on eigenvalues or singular values. Our benchmark results demonstrate that Intel oneAPI MKL PARDISO, UMFPACK, and MUMPS are the most reliable solvers for the tested scenarios. This work serves as a resource for selecting appropriate solvers, understanding the impact of condition numbers, and improving the robustness of numerical solutions in practical applications.</description>
