      <title>Quantum hydrodynamics of a polariton fluid: pure energy relaxation terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity polaritons, hybrid half-light half-matter excitations in quantum microcavities in the strong-coupling regime demonstrate clear signatures of quantum collective behavior, such as analogues of BEC and superfluidity at surprisingly high temperatures. The analysis of the formation of these states demands an account of the relaxation processes in the system. Although there are well-established approaches for the description of some of them, such as finite lifetime polariton, an external optical pump, and coupling with an incoherent excitonic reservoir, the treatment of pure energy relaxation in a polariton fluid still remains a puzzle. Here, based on the quantum hydrodynamics approach, we derive the corresponding equations where the energy relaxation term appears naturally. We analyze in detail how it affects the dynamics of polariton droplets and the dispersion of elementary excitations of a uniform polariton condensate. Although we focus on the case of cavity polaritons, our approach can be applied to other cases of bosonic condensates, where the processes of energy relaxation play an important role.</description>

      <title>Resistance hysteresis in twisted bilayer graphene: Intrinsic versus extrinsic effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hysteresis in resistance under magnetic field sweeps is a key signature for identifying magnetism in twisted bilayer graphene and similar systems. However, such sweeps can induce extrinsic thermal effects, complicating interpretations. Distinguishing intrinsic magnetic ordering from extrinsic thermal influences is crucial. In this study, we report hysteresis in the longitudinal resistance ($(R_{xx}$)) of a near magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) sample under an in-plane magnetic field ($(B_{||}$)). The hysteresis phase appears at the edge of the superconducting dome, diminishes deep within the superconducting regime, and reemerges near the superconducting critical temperature ($(T \sim T_c$)). The hysteresis magnitude and coercive fields strongly depend on the magnetic field sweep rate ($(dB/dt)$) and exhibit transient relaxation in time-series measurements. Notably, similar hysteresis behavior was observed in the temperature profile of the sample stage, measured using a calibrated temperature sensor under analogous magnetic field cycles, suggesting extrinsic thermal origins rather than intrinsic magnetic ordering. These findings underscore the importance of carefully distinguishing intrinsic and extrinsic effects in resistance hysteresis observed in mesoscopic van der Waals systems.</description>

      <title>How to Make a Pristine Tellurium Atomic Helix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tellurium atomic helices are currently attracting increasing attention. However, to date individual tellurium atomic helices have only been grown encapsulated in host materials. A bare free-standing tellurium atomic helix has yet to be realized experimentally despite the fundamental interest of these systems. Here DFT-based simulations are presented that show that a pristine tellurium atomic helix can be drawn from a tellurium crystal with the help of a gold STM tip, paving the way to a better understanding of tellurium atomic helices.</description>

      <title>Quantized Artificial Neural Networks Implemented with Spintronic Stochastic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) inference involves matrix vector multiplications that require a very large number of multiply and accumulate operations, resulting in high energy cost and large device footprint. Stochastic computing (SC) offers a less resource-intensive ANN implementation and can be realized through stochastic-magnetic tunnel junctions (s-MTJ) that generate random numbers, where the energy barrier to switch between the up and down states is designed to be small. While s-MTJs have previously been used to implement SC-ANNs, these studies have been limited to architectures with continuously varying (analog) weights. We study the use of SC for matrix vector multiplication with quantized synaptic weights and outputs. We show that a quantized SC-ANN, implemented by using experimentally obtained s-MTJ bitstreams and using a limited number of discrete quantized states for both weights and hidden layer outputs in an ANN, can effectively reduce latency and energy consumption in SC compared to an analog implementation, while largely preserving accuracy. We implemented quantization with 5 and 11 quantized states, along with SC configured with stochastic bitstream lengths of 100 to 500 on neural networks with one and three hidden layers. Inference was performed on the MNIST dataset for both training with SC and without SC. Training with SC provided better accuracy for all cases. For the shortest bitstream of 100 bits, the highest accuracies were 92% for one hidden layer and over 96% for three hidden layers. The overall system attained its peak accuracy of 96.82% using a 400-bit stochastic bitstream with three hidden layers and demonstrated 9X improvement in latency to implement neuron activations and 2.6X improvement in energy consumption using the quantized SC approach compared to a similar s-MTJ based ANN architecture without quantization.</description>

      <title>Artificial Spin Ice: A Tutorial on Design and Control of Geometry, Microstate, Magnon Dynamics &amp; Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial spin ice, arrays of strongly interacting nanomagnets, are complex magnetic systems with many emergent properties, rich microstate spaces, intrinsic physical memory, high-frequency dynamics in the GHz range and compatibility with a broad range of measurement approaches. This tutorial article aims to provide the foundational knowledge needed to understand, design, develop, and improve the dynamic properties of artificial spin ice (ASI). Special emphasis is placed on introducing the theory of micromagnetics, which describes the complex dynamics within these systems, along with their design, fabrication methods, and standard measurement and control techniques. The article begins with a review of the historical background, introducing the underlying physical phenomena and interactions that govern artificial spin ice. We then explore standard experimental techniques used to prepare the microstate space of the nanomagnetic array and to characterize magnetization dynamics, both in artificial spin ice and more broadly in ferromagnetic materials. Finally, we introduce the basics of neuromorphic computing applied to the case of artificial spin ice systems with goal to help researchers new to the field grasp these exciting new developments.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Nano Interface Through Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum dots (QD) interface in solution can play significant roles in electron transfer dynamics for quantum dots-sensitized solar cells and different biological, environmental, and industrial systems. Here, we predict an avenue to identify the contribution of the quantum dots interface created static electric field on the nonlinear optical response (NLO) due to four-wave mixing (FWM), especially for the nanoparticles where surface contribution is high. We implement a way to disentangle the FWM response in QDs originating from the three incoming oscillating laser fields (NLOoscillating) and a contribution (NLOstatic) arising from the three oscillating laser fields and the static electric field caused by the interface. Advanced two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) employs phase-resolved heterodyne techniques where FWM response is measured in a particular phase-matched direction, and the response is distinctively phase sensitive. Theoretical analysis shows alteration in the interface can introduce phase variation in the NLOstatic signal, resulting in a distinct change in the 2D-spectra. Our studies establish a range of ionic strength, which can be important to untwine the usual NLO signal (NLOoscillating) from the NLO (NLOstatic) contributed by the interface of quantum dots. This analysis may open up the possibility to study the different kinds of dynamics occurring specifically in the interface and also will pave the path towards different ion interactions through phase change in 2D spectra, and enormous scope will be employing deep learning-assisted phase recognition.</description>

      <title>Properties and prevalence of false poor man's Majoranas in two- and three-site artificial Kitaev chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was predicted that a minimal chain of two quantum dots (QDs) connected via a superconductor can host perfectly localized zero-energy states, known as poor man's Majoranas (PMMs). It is expected that these states are related to Majorana bound states (MBSs) in longer chains and that the tunable nature of this setup makes it a promising platform to study MBSs. However, realistic systems can only host highly, but not perfectly, localized near-zero-energy states, called imperfect PMMs. It has been shown that these imperfect PMMs can evolve into trivial states unrelated to MBSs when the chain is extended. Such states are called false PMMs, whereas PMMs that evolve into MBSs in long chains are called true PMMs. Here, using a microscopic model of QD-superconductor arrays, we consider properties of false PMMs and the circumstances under which they appear. In two-site systems, we find that the origin of many false PMMs can be related to zero-energy states occurring in the absence of superconductivity and we use this analytic understanding to characterize the false PMMs that are typical for different regions of parameter space. In three-site systems, we show that false PMMs can occur via the same mechanism as for two-site systems, but we also find them in regions of parameter space where they are not predicted to exist, thus hinting that the physics of false PMMs can be richer in longer chains. Finally, we demonstrate that the PMMs most stable to perturbations in chemical potential and with the largest excitation gaps appear in a region of parameter space that also has a large ratio of false to true PMMs.</description>

      <title>Rhombohedral graphite junctions as a platform for continuous tuning between topologically trivial and non-trivial electronic phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating the topological properties of quantum states can provide a way to protect them against disorder. However, typically, changing the topology of electronic states in a crystalline material is challenging because their nature is underpinned by chemical composition and lattice symmetry that are difficult to modify. We propose junctions between rhombohedral graphite crystals as a platform that enables smooth transition between topologically trivial and non-trivial regimes distinguished by the absence or presence of topological junction states. By invoking an analogy with the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, the appearance of topological states is related to the symmetry of the atomic stacking at the interface between the crystals. The possibility to explore both the topological and non-topological phases is provided by sliding the crystals with respect to each other.</description>

      <title>Layer-dependent field-free switching of N\'eel vector in a van der Waals antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional antiferromagnets, combining the dual advantages of van der Waals (vdW) and antiferromagnetic materials, provide an unprecedented platform for exploring emergent spin-related phenomena. However, electrical manipulation of N\'eel vectors in vdW antiferromagnets - the cornerstone of antiferromagnetic spintronics - remains challenging. Here, we report layer-dependent electrical switching of the N\'eel vector in an A-type vdW antiferromagnet $(Fe,Co)_3$$GaTe_2$ (FCGT) with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The N\'eel vector of FCGT with odd-number vdW layers can be 180{\deg} reversed via spin-orbit torques. Furthermore, we achieve field-free switching in an all-vdW, all-antiferromagnet heterostructure of FCGT/CrSBr in which the noncollinear interfacial spin texture breaks the mirror symmetry. Our results establish layer-controlled spin symmetries and interfacial spin engineering as universal paradigms for manipulating antiferromagnetic order, paving the way for realising reliable and efficient vdW antiferromagnetic devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum controlling and the topological properties of the magnon photo-transport in two-dimensional collinear ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06852v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our work, we study magnon transport induced by light through Aharonov-Casher (AC) effect, including magnon spin photocurrent (MSPC) and magnon energy photocurrent (MEPC). Firstly, we regard the effect of the electric field on the magnon through the AC effect as a perturbation. Then we derived the expressions of MSPC and MEPC in two-dimensional collinear ferromagnetic system. And we apply our theory to the two-dimension ferromagnetic Hexagonal and Kagome lattice. We find that the optical frequency and the relaxation time of the material can be used to control the photo-transport of magnons. In addition, under the condition of low light frequncy and infinite relaxation time, the longitudinal magnon photo-transport is related to the topological property of the magnon system.</description>

      <title>Optical imaging of spontaneous electric polarizations in tetralayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of sliding ferroelectricity has sparked intense interests in studying interfacial polarizations in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials. However, akin to the conventional ferroelectrics, the studies have predominantly reported semiconducting and/or insulating moir\'e systems and binary compounds. Spontaneous electric polarizations in elemental metallic phases remain scarcity. Here, we report the first optical imaging of intrinsic out-of-plane electric polarizations and domain wall (DW) sliding dynamics in tetralayer graphene, a 2D conductive layer composed entirely of carbon. Using scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM), we directly visualize adjacent ABAC and ABCB stacking orders with intrinsic and opposite electric polarizations. Our gate-dependent SNOM measurements reveal distinct optical response that systematically changes upon carrier doping and unconventional interplay between DW sliding and electric polarizations, which are supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Independent corroboration through Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and Raman spectroscopy confirms the polar nature and their polarization directions. Furthermore, reversible mechanical switching of polar states via atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip manipulation is also demonstrated. Our work establishes SNOM as a critical tool for probing sliding ferroelectricity in conductive 2D layers, opening avenues for exploring multiferroic behaviors and nonvolatile memory applications in atomically thin metals at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Surface Oxidation of SnTe Analyzed by Self-Consistent Fitting of all Emission Peaks in its X-ray Photoelectron Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is among the most widely used methods for surface characterization. Currently, the analysis of XPS data is almost exclusively based on the main emission peak of a given element and the rest of the spectrum is discarded. This makes quantitative chemical state analyses by peak fitting prone to substantial error, especially in light of incomplete and flawed reference literature. However, most elements give rise to multiple emission peaks in the x-ray energy range, which are virtually never analyzed. For samples with an inhomogeneous depth distribution of chemical states, these peaks show different but interdependent ratios of signal components, as they correspond to different information depths. In this work, we show that self-consistent fitting of all emission peaks lends additional reliability to the depth profiling of chemical states by angular-resolved (AR-)XPS. We demonstrate this using a natively oxidized thin film of the topological crystalline insulator tin telluride (SnTe). This approach is not only complementary to existing depth profiling methods, but may also pave the way towards complete deconvolution of the XPS spectrum, facilitating a more comprehensive and holistic understanding of the surface chemistry of solids.</description>

      <title>Brillouin Platycosms and Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exist ten distinct closed flat $3$D manifolds, known as platycosms, which hold significance in mathematics and have been postulated as potential geometric models for our universe. In this work, we demonstrate their manifestation as universes of Bloch particles, namely as momentum-space units referred to as Brillouin platycosms, which are natural extensions of the Brillouin torus within a broader framework of projective crystallographic symmetries. Moreover, we provide exact K-theoretical classifications of topological insulators over these platycosms by the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence, and formulate a complete set of topological invariants for their identification. Topological phase transitions are generically characterized by Weyl semimetals, adhering to the generalized Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem: the total chirality number over a Brillouin platycosm is even (zero) if the platycosm is non-orientable (orientable). Our work generalizes the notion of Brillouin torus to ten Brillouin platycosms and therefore fundamentally diversifies the stages on which Block wavefunctions can perform their topological dance.</description>

      <title>Identifying and mitigating errors in hole spin qubit readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity readout of spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots can be achieved by combining a radio-frequency (RF) charge sensor together with spin-to-charge conversion and Pauli spin blockade. However, reaching high readout fidelities in hole spin qubits remains elusive and is complicated by a combination of site-dependent spin anisotropies and short spin relaxation times. Here, we analyze the different error processes that arise during readout using a double-latched scheme in a germanium double quantum dot hole spin qubit system. We first investigate the spin-to-charge conversion process as a function of magnetic field orientation, and configure the system to adiabatically map the $\lvert \downarrow\downarrow \rangle$ state to the only non-blockaded state. We reveal a strong dependence of the spin relaxation rates on magnetic field strength and minimize this relaxation by operating at low fields. We further characterize and mitigate the error processes that arise during the double-latching process. By combining an RF charge sensor, a double-latching process, and optimized magnetic field parameters, we achieve a single-shot single-qubit state-preparation-and-measurement fidelity of 97.0%, the highest reported fidelity for hole spin qubits. Unlike prior works and vital to usability, we simultaneously maintain universal control of both spins. These findings lay the foundation for the reproducible achievement of high-fidelity readout in hole-based spin quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Signatures of unconventional superconductivity near reentrant and fractional quantum anomalous Hall insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional moir\'e Chern bands provide an exceptional platform for exploring a variety of many-body electronic liquid and solid phases at zero magnetic field within a lattice system. One particular intriguing possibility is that flat Chern bands can, in principle, support exotic superconducting phases together with fractional topological phases. Here, we report the observation of integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects, the reentrant quantum anomalous Hall effect, and superconductivity within the first moir\'e Chern band of twisted bilayer MoTe2. The superconducting phase emerges from a normal state exhibiting anomalous Hall effects and sustains an large perpendicular critical magnetic field. Our results present the first example of superconductivity emerging within a flat Chern band that simultaneously hosts fractional quantum anomalous effects, a phenomenon never observed in any other systems. Our work expands the understanding of emergent quantum phenomena in moir\'e Chern bands, and offers a nearly ideal platform for engineering Majorana and parafermion zero modes in gate-controlled hybrid devices.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive framework to simulate real-time chemical dynamics on a fault-tolerant quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive end-to-end framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of chemical systems on a fault-tolerant quantum computer, incorporating both electronic and nuclear quantum degrees of freedom. An all-particle simulation is nominally efficient on a quantum computer, but practically infeasible. Hence, central to our approach is the construction of a first-quantized plane-wave algorithm making use of pseudoions. The latter consolidate chemically inactive electrons and the nucleus into a single effective dynamical ionic entity, extending the well-established concept of pseudopotentials in quantum chemistry to a two-body interaction. We explicitly describe efficient quantum circuits for initial state preparation across all degrees of freedom, as well as for block-encoding the Hamiltonian describing interacting pseudoions and chemically active electrons, by leveraging recent advances in quantum rejection sampling to optimize the implementations. To extract useful chemical information, we first design molecular fingerprints by combining density-functional calculations with machine learning techniques, and subsequently validate them through surrogate classical molecular dynamics simulations. These fingerprints are then coherently encoded on a quantum computer for efficient molecular identification via amplitude estimation. We provide an extensive analysis of the cost of running the algorithm on a fault-tolerant quantum computer for several chemically interesting systems. As an illustration, simulating the interaction between $\mathrm{NH_3}$ and $\mathrm{BF_3}$ (a 40-particle system) requires 808 logical qubits to encode the problem, and approximately $10^{11}$ Toffoli gates per femtosecond of time evolution. Our results establish a foundation for further quantum algorithm development targeting chemical and material dynamics.</description>

      <title>Polaron-induced modifications in the linear and nonlinear optical properties of graphene under electric and magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarons are the primary charge carriers in organic materials. A deep understanding of their properties can open channels for novel optoelectronic applications. By applying electric and magnetic fields, we investigate the influence of polaron interactions on the linear and nonlinear optical properties of a graphene monolayer between a substrate and air. Using the density matrix approach, we derive the linear and nonlinear optical absorption coefficients and the relative refractive index by incorporating the zero-energy level. Our numerical results reveal that the polaron effect and the magnetic field induce shifts in the peak positions of the optical absorption coefficients and refractive index. Moreover, while the presence of electric and magnetic fields significantly alters the amplitude of the absorption coefficients, only the magnetic field affects the refractive index amplitude. Additionally, we find that the magnetic field amplifies the influence of surface optical phonons on the optical properties of graphene. These findings provide deeper insights into the optical behavior of graphene in external fields, which could be relevant for optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Exceptionally large winding number of a finite-size topological superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study finite-size-induced topological phenomena in unconventional superconductors. Specifically, we focus on a thin film with a persistent spin texture, fabricated on a high-$T_{\text{c}}$ cuprate $d_{xy}$-wave superconductors. In two-dimensional $d_{xy}$-wave superconductors, flat-band Andreev bound states appear at the edges. As the system narrows, these bound states acquire an energy gap due to finite-size hybridization and spin-orbit coupling of the persistent spin texture. This induced gap gives rise to the emergence of a topological phase, characterized by an exceptionally large one-dimensional winding number that scales with the film width. We demonstrate the appearance of highly degenerate zero-energy states, leading to anomalous perfect charge transport in dirty superconducting junctions. These findings provide a promising platform for exploring fascinating topological superconducting phases driven by gapped Andreev bound states.</description>

      <title>The Power of the Pareto Front: Balancing Uncertain Rewards for Adaptive Experimentation in scanning probe microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated experimentation has the potential to revolutionize scientific discovery, but its effectiveness depends on well-defined optimization targets, which are often uncertain or probabilistic in real-world settings. In this work, we demonstrate the application of Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) to balance multiple, competing rewards in autonomous experimentation. Using scanning probe microscopy (SPM) imaging, one of the most widely used and foundational SPM modes, we show that MOBO can optimize imaging parameters to enhance measurement quality, reproducibility, and efficiency. A key advantage of this approach is the ability to compute and analyze the Pareto front, which not only guides optimization but also provides physical insights into the trade-offs between different objectives. Additionally, MOBO offers a natural framework for human-in-the-loop decision-making, enabling researchers to fine-tune experimental trade-offs based on domain expertise. By standardizing high-quality, reproducible measurements and integrating human input into AI-driven optimization, this work highlights MOBO as a powerful tool for advancing autonomous scientific discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical studies of ionic motion through solid electrolytes commonly involve static nudged-elastic band (NEB) methods or costly \emph{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD). Building on a time-local model of current carrier-electrolyte interaction and incorporating thermal motion, we introduce an approach that is intermediate between the two well-established methodologies by treating the electrolyte as an effective medium that interacts with the mobile particle. Through this coupling, the thermally vibrating electrolyte imparts energy to the charge carriers while also absorbing energy from them due to its own finite elasticity. Using a simple model system, we validate our approach through a series of numerical simulations. Our methodology reproduces both dissipative and diffusive behavior, and helps link microscopic system parameters to measurable macroscopic properties.</description>

      <title>Probing Remote Nuclear Magnetic Moments in hBN with VB Electron Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the initial discovery of optically addressable spins of the negatively charged boron vacancy defect (VB) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), substantial progress has been made, enabling promising applications in quantum sensing, information processing, and simulations. A deep understanding of the VB (electron): hBN (nuclear) spin systems is crucial for realizing these potentials. In this article, we employ Electron Nuclear Double Resonance (ENDOR) to demonstrate the sensing of dis tant nuclear spins via the VB electron spin. We identify the nature and localization of the probed nuclear magnetic moments as 14N spins localized 0.4 nm away from the vacancy and resolve the energies of the corresponding interactions. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations further confirm these findings, providing a detailed description of the interactions between the VB electron spin and surrounding nitrogen atoms in different shells. The results establish the VB electron spin as a promising tool for developing novel van der Waals material-based nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) probes, advancing the understanding of spin physics in hBN, and unlocking its potential to study distant nuclear spin interactions in the host.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) captures the variations of quantum states with parameters, serving as a central concept in modern quantum physics. Its real part, the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM), has a measurement-dependent counterpart that links statistics to distinguishability. However, an analogous extension for the QGT is hindered by the fundamental inaccessibility of its imaginary part through measurement probabilities. Here we introduce a counterpart to the QGT that includes measurement operators, termed the \textit{semi-classical} geometric tensor (SCGT). We show that the SCGT provides a lower bound to the QGT that is tight for pure states. Moreover, we use the SCGT to derive sharp multiparameter information bounds and discuss extensions of the Berry phase.</description>

      <title>Generic deformation channels for critical Fermi surfaces including the impact of collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper constitutes a sequel to our theoretical efforts to determine the nature of the generic low-energy deformations of the Fermi surface of a quantum-critical metal, which arises at the stable non-Fermi liquid (NFL) fixed point of a quantum phase transition. The emergent critical Fermi surface, arising right at the Ising-nematic quantum critical point (QCP), is a paradigmatic example where an NFL behaviour is induced by the strong interactions of the fermionic degrees of freedom with those of the bosonic order parameter. It is an artifact of the bosonic modes becoming massless at the QCP, thus undergoing Landau damping at the level of one-loop self-energy. We resort to the well-tested formalism of the quantum Boltzmann equations (QBEs)for identifying the excitations. While in our earlier works, we have focussed on the collisionless regime by neglecting the collision integral and assuming the bosons to be in equilibrium, here we embark on a full analysis. In particular, we take into account the bosonic part of the QBEs. The final results show that that the emergent modes are long-lived and robust against the damping effects brought about the collision integral(s), exhibiting the same qualitative features as obtained from the no-collision approximations.</description>

      <title>Intertwining Josephson and Vortex Topologies in Conventional Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental advances have unveiled promising evidence of vortex-bound Majorana quasiparticles in multiple superconducting compounds. However, theoretical progress in understanding these phenomena, especially from ab initio approaches, has been limited by the computational complexity of simulating vortex structures. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Josephson-vortex correspondence (JVC), a theoretical framework that systematically maps the bound-state topological properties of vortices to those of $\pi$-phase Josephson junctions in the same superconductor. This correspondence allows vortex phase diagrams to be constructed directly from junction calculations, thereby eliminating the need for large-scale vortex calculations. We demonstrate the validity and predictive power of JVC across a variety of effective models, and further extend the framework to the first-principles level. Applying our approach to 2M-WS$_2$ and Sr$_3$SnO, we identify them as realistic, doping-tunable platforms for realizing vortex Majorana zero modes. Our theory will pave the way for ab initio Majorana material discovery and design.</description>

Abstract: The bulk-boundary correspondence predicts the existence of boundary modes localized at the edges of topologically nontrivial systems. The wavefunctions of hermitian boundary modes can be obtained as the eigenmode of a modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation. Recently, the bulk-boundary correspondence has been extended to nonhermitian systems, which describe physical phenomena such as gain and loss in open and non-equilibrium systems. Nonhermitian energy spectra can be complex-valued and exhibit point gaps or line gaps in the complex plane, whether the gaps can be continuously deformed into points or lines, respectively. Specifically, line-gapped nonhermitian systems can be continuously deformed into hermitian gapped spectra. Here, we find the analytical form of the wavefunctions of nonhermitian boundary modes with zero energy localized at smooth domain boundaries between topologically distinct phases, by solving the generalized Jackiw-Rebbi equation in the nonhermitian regime. Moreover, we unveil a universal relation between the scalar fields and the decay rate and oscillation wavelength of the boundary modes. This relation quantifies the bulk-boundary correspondence in nonhermitian line-gapped systems in terms of experimentally measurable physical quantities and is not affected by the details of the spatial dependence of the scalar fields. These findings shed some new light on the localization properties of boundary modes in nonhermitian and topologically nontrivial states of matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05138v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integer quantum Hall effect can be observed in a two-dimensional conductor penetrated by a perpendicular magnetic field and with edges connecting the current carrying contacts. Its signature is a state of quantized Hall and simultaneously vanishing longitudinal resistances. A widely accepted model is the Landauer-B\"uttiker picture, which assumes an incompressible, i.e., electrically insulating bulk state surrounded by current carrying one-dimensional edge channels. This single-particle model is challenged by the screening theory. It derives, that electron-electron interaction leads to a fragmentation of the Hall bar into compressible and incompressible strips, where the current flows inside the incompressible strips. Because the latter gradually shift from the sample edges into the bulk as the magnetic field is increased, it suggests a transition from edge- to bulk-current. We present a direct experimental proof of this transition. Our results support the screening theory.</description>

      <title>Bias driven circular current in a ring nanojunction: Critical role of environmental interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The specific role of environmental interaction on bias driven circular current in a ring nanojunction is explored within a tight-binding framework based on wave-guide theory. The environmental interaction is implemented through disorder in backbone sites where these sites are directly coupled to parent lattice sites of the ring via single bonds. In absence of backbone disorder circular current becomes zero for a lengthwise symmetric nanojunction, while it increases with disorder which is quite unusual, and after reaching a maximum it eventually drops to zero in the limit of high disorder. The effects of ring-electrode interface configuration, ring-backbone coupling, different types of backbone disorder and system temperature are critically investigated. All the studied results are valid for a broad range of physical parameters, giving us confidence that the outcomes of this theoretical work can be verified experimentally. To make this study self-contained, we also discuss the feasibility of detecting bias-driven circular current and provide design guidelines for implementing our proposed quantum system in a laboratory.</description>

Abstract: Higher dimensions provide fertile ground for diverse topological phases and their associated localization phenomena, thanks to the rich geometric features of boundaries and defects. In this paper, we investigate non-Hermitian lattices with defects and establish a correspondence between spectral winding topology, fractal structures, and defect-localized states in arbitrary dimensions. Through analytical derivation and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that defect states emerge only when the spectral winding number exceeds a threshold determined by the defect size, which is linked to their fractal characteristics. By utilizing the Green's function, we identify amplified responses at defects under external driving fields, strengthening the physical correspondence between these topological and fractal features. Our findings offer a universal framework for understanding defect-localized states in higher-dimensional non-Hermitian systems.</description>

However, SOC contributions to the electron magnetic moment operator are conventionally disregarded. In this work, we analyze relativistic contributions to the latter operator, including those of the SOC-type: in vacuum, for the semiconductor 8 band Kane model, and for an arbitrary system with two spectral branches. In this endeavor, we introduce a notion of relativistic corrections to the operation $\partial/\partial\boldsymbol B$, where $\boldsymbol B$ is an external magnetic field. We highlight the difference between the magnetic moment and $-\partial H/\partial\boldsymbol B$, where $H$ is the system Hamiltonian. We suggest to call this difference the abnormal magnetic moment. We demonstrate that the conventional splitting of the total magnetic moment into the spin and orbital parts becomes ambiguous when relativistic corrections are taken into account. The latter also jeopardize the ``modern theory of orbital magnetization'' in its standard formulation. We derive a linear response Kubo formula for the kinetic magnetoelectric effect projected to individual branches of a two branch system. This allows us, in particular, to identify a source of this effect that stems from noncommutation of the position and $\partial/\partial\boldsymbol B$ operators' components. This is an analog of the contribution to the Hall conductivity from noncommuting components of the position operator. We also report several additional observations related to the electron magnetic moment operator in systems with SOC and other relativistic corrections.</description>

      <title>SEMIDV: A Compact Semiconductor Device Simulator with Quantum Effects</title>

Abstract: In this paper, I present SEMIDV - a compact semiconductor device simulator incorporating quantum effects. SEMIDV solves the Poisson-Drift-Diffusion equations for semiconductor devices and provides a user-friendly Python interface for scripting and data analysis. Localization landscape theory is introduced to provide quantum corrections to the Drift-Diffusion equation. This theory directly solves the ground state of the Schrodinger equation without further approximation, offering an efficient solution for quantum effect modeling. Additionally, a compact mobility model considering ballistic transport is developed to capture the ballistic length dependence of mobility and the velocity overshoot effect in short-channel devices. Finally, a study on a nanosheet FET using SEMIDV is conducted. I analyze the electrical characteristics of a state-of-the-art GAA/RibbonFET with a 6 nm gate length and discuss the effects of velocity overshoot and quantum confinement on currents and capacitances. A design for an ultra-short-channel transistor with a gate length down to 4.5 nm with a Vdd = 0.45 V is proposed to push the boundaries of integrated circuit technology further.</description>

      <title>Multifunctional steep-slope spintronic transistors with spin-gapless-semiconductor or spin-gapped-metal electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs) are a promising class of materials for spintronic applications, enabling functions beyond conventional electronics. This study introduces a novel design for multifunctional spintronic field-effect transistors (FETs) using SGSs and/or spin-gapped metals (SGMs) as source and drain electrodes. These devices operate similarly to metal-semiconductor Schottky barrier FETs, where a potential barrier forms between the SGS (or SGM) electrode and the semiconducting channel. Unlike traditional Schottky barrier FETs, these devices utilize the unique spin-dependent transport properties of SGS/SGM electrodes to achieve sub-60 mV/dec switching, overcoming the 60 mV/dec sub-threshold swing limit in MOSFETs for low-voltage operation. Additionally, SGMs contribute a negative differential resistance (NDR) effect with an ultra-high peak-to-valley current ratio. The proposed spintronic FETs combine sub-60 mV/dec switching, non-local giant magnetoresistance (GMR), and NDR, making them suitable for applications like logic-in-memory computing and multivalued logic. These properties support computing architectures beyond the von-Neumann model, enabling efficient data processing. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials provide a promising platform for these multifunctional FETs. We screen a computational 2D materials database to identify suitable SGS and SGM materials, selecting VS$2$ as the SGS for simulations. Using a non-equilibrium Green's function method with density functional theory, we simulate transfer ($I{\mathrm{D}}$-$V_{\mathrm{G}}$) and output ($I_{\mathrm{D}}$-$V_{\mathrm{D}}$) characteristics of a VS$_2$/Ga$_2$O$_2$ FET based on 2D type-II SGS VS$_2$, predicting a sub-threshold swing of 20 mV/dec, a high on/off ratio of 10$^8$, and a notable non-local GMR effect, demonstrating potential for low-power, high-performance applications.</description>

      <title>Noise-based Local Learning using Stochastic Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>

Abstract: Brain-inspired learning in physical hardware has enormous potential to learn fast at minimal energy expenditure. One of the characteristics of biological learning systems is their ability to learn in the presence of various noise sources. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a novel noise-based learning approach for physical systems implementing multi-layer neural networks. Simulation results show that our approach allows for effective learning whose performance approaches that of the conventional effective yet energy-costly backpropagation algorithm. Using a spintronics hardware implementation, we demonstrate experimentally that learning can be achieved in a small network composed of physical stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions. These results provide a path towards efficient learning in general physical systems which embraces rather than mitigates the noise inherent in physical devices.</description>

      <title>Short two-qubit pulse sequences for exchange-only spin qubits in 2D layouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exchange-only (EO) spin qubits in quantum dots offer an expansive design landscape for architecting scalable device layouts. The study of two-EO-qubit operations, which involve six electrons in six quantum dots, has so far been limited to a small number of the possible configurations, and previous works lack analyses of design considerations and implications for quantum error correction. Using a simple and fast optimization method, we generate complete pulse sequences for CX, CZ, iSWAP, leakage-controlled CX, and leakage-controlled CZ two-qubit gates on 450 unique planar six-dot topologies and analyze differences in sequence length (up to 43\% reduction) across topology classes. In addition, we show that relaxing constraints on post-operation spin locations can yield further reductions in sequence length; conversely, constraining these locations in a particular way generates a CXSWAP operation with minimal additional cost over a standard CX. We integrate this pulse library into the Intel quantum stack and experimentally verify pulse sequences on a Tunnel Falls chip for different operations in a linear-connectivity device to confirm that they work as expected. Finally, we explore architectural implications of these results for quantum error correction. Our work guides hardware and software design choices for future implementations of scalable quantum dot architectures.</description>

      <title>Mixed-state geometric phases of coherent and squeezed spin states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two mixed-state geometric phases, known as the Uhlmann phase and interferometric geometric phase (IGP), of spin coherent states (CSSs) and spin squeezed states (SSSs) are analyzed. While each phase follows its parallel-transport condition, we also consider the non-adiabatic IGP for arbitrary unitary evolution beyond parallel transport. For the $j=3/2$ CSS, the Uhlmann phase shows temperature-induced topological phase transitions with jumps. The IGP and non-adiabatic IGP for the $j=3/2$ CSS also exhibits temperature-induced jumps. In contrast, the Uhlmann phase of the $j=1$ one-axis SSS exhibits smooth behavior without any temperature-induced transition. Interestingly, the parallel-transport condition of the IGP of the $j=1$ one-axis SSS only admits a trivial solution at finite temperature while the non-adiabatic IGP for the $j=1$ one-axis SSS has a solution showing smooth behavior as the squeezing parameter and temperature change. By considering $j=1$ two-axis SSS, the IGP and its non-adiabatic generalization exhibit smooth behavior at finite temperatures. We also briefly discuss possible experimental implications and simulations.</description>

      <title>Pyroelectric doping reversal of MoS2 p-n junctions on ferroelectric domain walls probed by photoluminescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tailoring the optical properties and electronic doping in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a central strategy for developing innovative systems with tunable characteristics. In this context, pyroelectric materials, which hold the capacity for charge generation when subjected to temperature changes, offer a promising route for this modulation. This work employs spatially resolved photoluminescence (PL) to explore the impact of pyroelectricity on the electronic doping of monolayer MoS2 deposited on periodically poled LiNbO3 (LN) substrates. The results demonstrate that pyroelectricity in LN modulates the charge carrier density in MoS2 on ferroelectric surfaces acting as doping mechanism without the need for gating electrodes. Furthermore, upon cooling, pyroelectric charges effectively reverse the doping of p-n junctions on DWs, converting them into n-p junctions. These findings highlight the potential of pyroelectric substrates for tunable and configurable charge engineering in transition metal dichalcogenides and suggest their applicability to other combinations of 2D materials and ferroelectric substrates. They also open avenues for alternative device architectures in nanoelectronic or nanophotonic devices including switches, memories or sensors.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of Bulk-Radiation Correspondence in Radiative Photonic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topological characteristics of energy bands in crystalline systems are encapsulated in the Berry curvature of the bulk Bloch states. In photonic crystal slabs, far-field emission from guided resonances naturally provides a non-invasive way to probe the embedded wavefunctions, raising the question of how the information carried by escaping photons relates to the band topology. We develop a non-Hermitian model to describe the guided and leaky modes of photonic crystal slabs with long-range couplings and non-local responses. Within this framework, radiation Berry curvature is defined from the far-field polarization and compared to the conventional bulk Berry curvature of the crystal Bloch modes. We investigate this bulk-radiation correspondence in the vicinity of the $\Gamma$-point of the square lattice and the $K$-point of the honeycomb lattice. The results show that the comparability between the bulk topology and the radiation topology is not universal; the validity is contingent upon the specific bulk Bloch states. Notably, the correspondence completely breaks down surrounding the far-field singularities, while it can hold in smooth regions under special symmetry conditions, e.g., rotational symmetry. Besides, net Berry curvature concentration is captured at the valleys of the non-local honeycomb lattice, facilitating further exploration on generalized topological phases in photonic lattices beyond the regimes with localized couplings and Hermiticity.</description>
