      <title>Quantum phase diagram of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square-kagome lattice: a tensor network study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the quantum phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnetic model on the square-kagome lattice upon varying the two symmetry inequivalent nearest-neighbor couplings, $J_{1}$ on squares and $J$ on triangles. Employing large-scale tensor network simulations based on infinite projected entangled pair states, we find four distinct valence bond crystal (VBC) states and a ferrimagnetically ordered region. Starting from the limit of weakly interacting squares for small $J/J_{1}$ where a plaquette cross-dimer VBC with long-range singlets is stabilized, we show that with increasing $J/J_{1}$ it transitions to a VBC with resonances over hexagons, the so-called loop-six VBC, which persists across the isotropic point. Interestingly, a generalized version of the pinwheel VBC, earlier reported to be a closely competing state for the isotropic model is energetically stabilized in a sliver of parameter space right beyond the isotropic point. For further increases in $J/J_{1}$, a decorated loop-six VBC occupies an appreciable region of parameter space before transitioning into an imperfect ferrimagnet which finally evolves into a Lieb ferrimagnet. Our characterization of the underlying phases and phase transitions is based on a careful analysis of the energy, magnetization, spin-spin correlations, and bond entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Exact Chiral Symmetries of 3+1D Hamiltonian Lattice Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct Hamiltonian models on a 3+1d cubic lattice for a single Weyl fermion and for a single Weyl doublet protected by exact (as opposed to emergent) chiral symmetries. In the former, we find a not-on-site, non-compact chiral symmetry which can be viewed as a Hamiltonian analog of the Ginsparg-Wilson symmetry in Euclidean lattice models of Weyl fermions. In the latter, we combine an on-site $U(1)$ symmetry with a not-on-site $U(1)$ symmetry, which together generate the $SU(2)$ flavor symmetry of the doublet at low energies, while in the UV they generate an algebra known in integrability as the Onsager algebra. This latter model is in fact the celebrated magnetic Weyl semimetal which is known to have a chiral anomaly from the action of $U(1)$ and crystalline translation, that gives rise to an anomalous Hall response - however reinterpreted in our language, it has two exact $U(1)$ symmetries that gives rise to the global $SU(2)$ anomaly which protects the gaplessness even when crystalline translations are broken. We also construct an exact symmetry-protected single Dirac cone in 2+1d with the $U(1) \rtimes T$ parity anomaly. Our constructions evade both old and recently-proven no-go theorems by using not-on-siteness in a crucial way, showing our results are sharp.</description>

      <title>Purely Electronic Model for Exciton-Polaron Formation in Moir\'e Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding interactions between excitons and correlated electronic states presents a fundamental challenge in quantum many-body physics. Here, we introduce a purely electronic model for the formation of exciton-polarons in moir\'e lattices. Unlike conventional approaches that treat excitons as tightly-bound bosonic particles, our model considers only electronic degrees of freedom, describing excitons as electron-hole bound states. Our findings reveal a pronounced renormalization of the polaron mass as a function of electron density, particularly near correlated insulators, consistent with recent transport experiments. Additionally, we predict an observable sign change in the effective polaron mass when increasing the electron density that can be measured in Hall-type experiments. Our purely electronic model provides a unified framework to investigate the formation and renormalization of exciton-polarons in correlated states.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Vacancy-Bound Non-Abelian Anyons in the Kitaev Model in a Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for non-Abelian anyons in quantum spin liquids (QSLs) is crucial for advancing fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. In the exactly solvable Kitaev honeycomb model, nonmagnetic spin vacancies are known to bind emergent gauge fluxes of the QSL ground state, which in turn become non-Abelian anyons for an infinitesimal magnetic field. Here, we investigate how this approach for stabilizing non-Abelian anyons at spin vacancies extends to a finite magnetic field represented by a proper Zeeman term. Specifically, we use large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations to compute the vacancy-anyon binding energy as a function of magnetic field for both the ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) Kitaev models. We find that, while the inclusion of the field weakens anyon binding in both cases, there is a pronounced difference in the finite-field behavior; the binding energy remains finite within the entire QSL phase for the FM Kitaev model but approaches zero already inside this phase for the AFM Kitaev model. To reliably compute a very small binding energy that is three orders of magnitude below the magnetic interaction strength, we also introduce a refined definition for the binding energy and an extrapolation scheme for its accurate extraction through exclusively ground-state properties using DMRG.</description>

      <title>Untwisted and Twisted R\'{e}nyi Negativities: Toward a R\'{e}nyi Proxy for Logarithmic Negativity in Fermionic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy is a fundamental measure of quantum entanglement for pure states, but for large-scale many-body systems, R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy is much more computationally accessible. For mixed states, logarithmic negativity (LN) serves as a widely used entanglement measure, but its direct computation is often intractable, leaving R\'{e}nyi negativity (RN) as the practical alternative. In fermionic systems, RN is further classified into untwisted and twisted types, depending on the definition of the fermionic partial transpose. However, which of these serves as the true R\'{e}nyi proxy for LN has remained unclear -- until now. In this work, we address this question by developing a robust quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method to compute both untwisted and twisted RNs, focusing on the rank-4 twisted RN, where non-trivial behavior emerges. We identify and overcome two major challenges: the singularity of the Green's function matrix and the exponentially large variance of RN estimators. Our method is demonstrated in the Hubbard model and the spinless $t$-$V$ model, revealing critical distinctions between untwisted and twisted RNs, as well as between rank-2 and high-rank RNs. Remarkably, we find that the twisted R\'{e}nyi negativity ratio (RNR) adheres to the area law and decreases monotonically with temperature, in contrast to the untwisted RNR but consistent with prior studies of bosonic systems. This study not only establishes the twisted RNR as a more pertinent R\'{e}nyi proxy for LN in fermionic systems but also provides comprehensive technical details for the stable and efficient computation of high-rank RNs. Our work lays the foundation for future studies of mixed-state entanglement in large-scale fermionic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Constraints from anti-unitary symmetries on phase diagrams of sign problem-free models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A powerful way to guarantee the absence of a sign problem in determinantal quantum Monte Carlo simulations is imposing a particular type of anti-unitary symmetries. It is shown that these same symmetries give rise to constraints on correlation functions, which can be used to identify local operators whose correlations upper bound those of a large class of physically relevant operators, including for example superconducting order parameters. Our results also help understand why it is difficult to realize generic finite-momentum orders in sign problem-free models.</description>

      <title>Effect of the Coulomb repulsion and oxygen level on charge distribution and superconductivity in the Emery model for cuprates superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Emery model (aka the three-band Hubbard model) offers a simplified description of the copper-oxide planes that form the building blocks of high-temperature superconductors. By contrast with the even simpler one-band Hubbard model, it differentiates between copper and oxygen orbitals and thus between oxygen occupation ($n_p$) and copper occupation ($n_d$). Here we demonstrate, using cluster dynamical mean field theory, how the two occupations are related to the on-site Coulomb repulsion $U$ on the copper orbital and to the energy difference $\epsilon_p$ between oxygen and copper orbitals. Since the occupations ($n_p$ and $n_d$) have been estimated from NMR for a few materials (LCO, YBCO and NCCO), this allows us to estimate the value of $U-\epsilon_p$ for these materials, within this model. We compute the density of states for these and the effect of $(U,\epsilon_p)$ on the $n_d$-$n_p$ curve, superconductivity, and antiferromagnetism.</description>

      <title>Bloch oscillations in interacting systems driven by a time-dependent magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to Faraday's law in classical physics, a varying magnetic field stimulates an electric eddy field. Intuitively, when a classical field is constant and imposed on a lattice, the Wannier-Stark ladders (WSL) can be established, resulting in Bloch oscillations. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of an interacting system on a (generalized) ring lattice threaded by a varying magnetic flux. Based on the rigorious results, we demonstrate that there exist many invariant subspaces in which the dynamics is periodic when the flux varies linearly over time. Nevertheless, for a given initial state, the evolved state differs from that driven by a linear field. However, the probability distributions of the two states are identical, referred to as the quantum analogue of Faraday's law. Our results are ubiquitous for a wide variety of interacting systems. We demonstrate these results through numerical simulations in an extended fermi-Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Probing Electron Localization and Delocalization in the Selective Long-Range Tight-Binding Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we perform a detailed investigation into the interplay between disorder-induced electron localization and long-range hopping amplitudes within the Selective Long-Range Tight-Binding Model (SLRTB). Through numerical simulations, we analyze the electronic properties of the system, with a focus on the participation ratio (PR), entanglement entropy (EE), energy spectrum, and the ratio of level spacings ($r_n$). Our results reveal a marked distinction between negative and positive long-range hopping amplitudes, manifesting in different electronic behaviors and transitions. Notably, we carry out a finite-size scaling analysis, identifying the critical point and exponents that characterize the system's behavior near the transition. The investigation highlights the role of gapless regions in shaping the system's PR, $r_n$, and EE, and the influence of disorder on these properties. The SLRTB model proves to be an effective framework for understanding the effects of disorder and long-range hopping on electron dynamics, offering valuable insights into localization and delocalization phenomena.</description>

      <title>Spin-lattice coupling and lattice anharmonicity across structural phase transitions in spin-orbit coupled K2IrBr6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between lattice distortions, magnetism, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in 5d transition-metal halides offers a platform for studying correlated spin-lattice dynamics. Here, we investigate the impact of the temperature-driven structural phase transitions on local spin environments and lattice vibrations in the antifluorite compound K2IrBr6 using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), Raman scattering, and first-principles calculations. K2IrBr6 undergoes two structural transitions at nominal temperatures: cubic-to-tetragonal near 170 K and tetragonal-to-monoclinic at ~122 K. EPR reveals persistent spin-spin correlations emerging well above the N\'eel temperature (12 K), accompanied by strong exchange narrowing and anisotropic g-factors, highlighting the role of SOC and structural symmetry breaking in modifying spin-lattice interactions. Raman scattering identifies phonon anomalies at the transition temperatures, with increasing lattice anharmonicity as symmetry is reduced. While no soft phonons are observed, the systematic enhancement of anharmonic effects suggests that evolving spin correlations may contribute to phonon renormalization. These findings establish K2IrBr6 as a model system for investigating coupled spin-lattice effects in SOC-driven materials.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism and beyond in the $t$-$t^\prime$-$\delta$ Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the phase diagram of the $t$-$t^\prime$-$\delta$ Fermi-Hubbard model on the square lattice to gain a more comprehensive understanding of this correlated model at half filling. This model has recently become a prominent topic of research because it hosts altermagnetic phases. Using mean-field analysis, we identify four metallic phases and two insulating phases with nontrivial magnetic orders at an intermediate value of $\delta = 0.5$, presenting a rich ground-state phase diagram in the $U$-$t^\prime$ plane. We also highlight the distinct features of the Fermi surface topology for each metallic phase. To go beyond the mean-field theory, we employ the density-matrix renormalization group method to simulate the ground state numerically. The phase boundaries are determined from the discontinuities and peaks in the entanglement entropy and magnetizations. In addition to the phases identified in the mean-field theory, we find a valence-bond solid state in a narrow intermediate-$t'$ region. Our work offers a firm step forward in understanding the complex behaviors of correlated electrons in the $t$-$t^\prime$-$\delta$ Hubbard model over a large parameter space.</description>

      <title>Computation Kernel for Feynman Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general representation for solving problems in many-body perturbation theory. By defining an overcomplete representation for the single-particle Green's function we show how one can convert an arbitrary Feynman graph to a universal kernel representation. Once constructed, the computation kernel contains no problem specific information yet contains all explicit temperature and frequency dependence of the diagram. This computation kernel is problem agnostic, and valid for any physical problem that would normally leverage the Matsubara formalism of many-body perturbation theory. The result of any diagram can be written as a linear combination of these computation kernel elements with coefficients given by a sum over products of known tensor elements that are themselves problem specific and represent spatial degrees of freedom. We probe the efficacy of this approach by generating the computation kernel for a low order self-energy diagram which we then use to construct solutions to distinct problems.</description>

      <title>A hybrid method integrating Green's function Monte Carlo and projected entangled pair states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08450v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a hybrid approach combining Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC) method with projected entangled pair state (PEPS) ansatz. This hybrid method regards PEPS as a trial state and a guiding wave function in GFMC. By leveraging PEPS's proficiency in capturing quantum state entanglement and GFMC's efficient parallel architecture, the hybrid method is well-suited for the accurate and efficient treatment of frustrated quantum spin systems. As a benchmark, we applied this approach to study the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions (PBC). Compared with other numerical methods, our approach integrating PEPS and GFMC shows competitive accuracy in the performance of ground-state energy. This paper provides systematic and comprehensive discussion of the approach of our previous work.</description>

      <title>The Low-Temperature Phenomenology of Gap Inhomogeneity in the Cuprate Superconductors: High-Energy Granularity, Low-Energy Homogeneity, and Spectral Kinks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments on a number of cuprate superconductors have revealed that these materials are highly inhomogeneous. However, even though this inhomogeneity is well-characterized experimentally, a theoretical understanding of the effect of an inhomogeneous superconducting $d$-wave order parameter on various observables is still not complete. Here, we focus on the particular role played by the length scale of superconducting order-parameter inhomogeneity. We make use of a model involving square patches tiling the system, with each patch hosting a broadly distributed random value of the $d$-wave parameter. By using large-scale simulations, we are able to study how the size of the patches affects the correspondence between various measures of the superconducting gap and the underlying order parameter. If the length scale of the inhomogeneity is smaller than the average superconducting coherence length, the resulting $d$-wave superconductor is homogeneous. However, when the order parameter varies on the scale of the coherence length, we find the emergence of a striking low-/high-energy dichotomy, in which the low-energy regime is homogeneous while the high-energy states are strongly inhomogeneous. Kinks in the local spectra are found at the energy demarcating the homogeneous-inhomogeneous transition. We also observe that the gap extracted from the low-energy slope of the LDOS is extremely uniform. We find in both of these regimes that the distribution of the spectral gap is narrower than that of the order parameter; these start to match only when the size of the patches becomes parametrically larger than the coherence length. We comment on the applicability of these results to the cuprates, discuss the limitations of the inhomogeneous $d$-wave model, and point out where beyond-mean-field correlation effects are likely to be present in addition to inhomogeneity.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Partial Transpose in the Overlap Matrix Framework for Entanglement Negativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07742v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, the overlap matrix approach has been developed to compute quantum entanglement in free-fermion systems, particularly to calculate entanglement entropy and entanglement negativity. This method involves the use of partial trace and partial transpose operations within the overlap matrix framework. However, previous studies have only considered the conventional partial transpose in fermionic systems, which does not account for fermionic anticommutation relations. Although the concept of a fermionic partial transpose was introduced in \cite{Shapourian2017prb}, it has not yet been systematically incorporated into the overlap matrix framework. In this paper, we introduce the fermionic partial transpose into the overlap matrix approach, provide a systematic analysis of the validity of partial trace and partial transpose operations, and derive an explicit formula for calculating entanglement negativity in bipartite systems. Additionally, we numerically compute the logarithmic negativity of two lattice models to verify the Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law. For tripartite geometries, we uncover limitations of the overlap matrix method and demonstrate that the previously reported logarithmic negativity result for a homogeneous one-dimensional chain in a disjoint interval geometry exceeds its theoretical upper bound. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of partial trace and partial transpose operations in different representations.</description>

      <title>Andreev versus Tunneling Spectroscopy of Unconventional Flat Band Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: STM experiments in the tunneling and Andreev regimes on graphene-based moire superconductors (SC) show two distinct energy scales whose origin is mysterious. We express the conductance of a normal-SC interface in terms of Green's functions, which allows us to sharpen the issues in two ways. First, we show that the two distinct energy scales cannot be understood in terms of a pseudogap in tunneling and a superconducting gap in the Andreev spectra. Second, the large Fermi velocity vF mismatch between the STM tip and the at band SC renormalizes a transparent interface towards the tunneling regime, and the ballistic Andreev regime cannot be realized in moire SCs. We also discuss self energy corrections to vF that determines the conductance. Finally, we offer a resolution to these problems by modeling the Andreev experiment as a circular metallic disc embedded in an unconventional SC. We show that with strong vF mismatch the low bias conductance is dominated by Andreev bound states induced by the tip at the interface with the unconventional SC. The ABS give rise to the low energy scale seen in Andreev experiments, smaller than the SC gap in tunneling spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Unprecedented Spin-Lifetime of Itinerant Electrons in Natural Graphite Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long spin-lifetime of electrons is the holy grail of spintronics, a field exploiting the electron angular momentum as information carrier and storage unit. Previous reports indicated a spin lifetime, $\tau_{\text{s}}$ near $10$ ns at best in graphene-based devices at low temperatures. We detail the observation of $\tau_{\text{s}}$ approaching the ultralong $1{,}000$~ns at room temperature in natural graphite crystals using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The relaxation time shows a giant anisotropy: the lifetime of spins, polarized perpendicular to the graphite plane, is more than $50$ times longer than for the in-plane polarization. The temperature dependence of $\tau_{\text{s}}$ proves that diffusion of spins to the crystallite edges, where relaxation occurs, limits the lifetime. This suggests that graphite is an excellent candidate for spintronic applications, seamlessly integrating with emerging 2D van der Waals technologies.</description>

      <title>Condensate ground states of hardcore bosons induced by an array of impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neither hardcore bosons nor fermions can occupy the same lattice site-state. However, a nearest neighbour interaction may counteract the hardcore effect, resulting in condensate states in a bosonic system. In this work, we unveil the underlying mechanism by developing a general method to construct the condensate eigenstates from those of sub-Hamiltonians. As an application, we find that a local on-site potential can induce an evanescent condensate mode. Based on this, exact condensate ground states of hardcore bosons, possessing off-diagonal long-range order, can be constructed when an array of impurities is applied. The effect of the off-resonance impurity on the condensate ground states is also investigated using numerical simulations of the dynamic response.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a universal parameter-free quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating arbitrary high-spin (spin greater than $1/2$) Hamiltonians. This approach extends a previously developed method by the authors for spin-$1/2$ Hamiltonians [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 013281 (2024)]. To demonstrate its applicability and versatility, we apply our method to the spin-$1$ and spin-$3/2$ quantum Heisenberg models on the square lattice. Additionally, we detail how the approach naturally extends to general Hamiltonians involving mixtures of particle species, including bosons and fermions. We have made our program code freely accessible on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions and Critical Behavior in Quasi-One-Dimensional Two-Channel Systems with Quasiperiodic Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the localization properties of a quasi-one-dimensional two-channel system with symmetric and asymmetric onsite energies using the Aubry-Andr\'{e} model. By analyzing the Lyapunov exponent and localization length, we characterize the phase transitions and critical behavior of the system. For the symmetric model, we obtain the phase diagram for the entire spectrum, revealing mobility edges between delocalized and localized states. In contrast, for the asymmetric model, we identify a critical line $ \lambda_1^c + \lambda_2^c \approx 0.5 $ marking the phase transition between delocalized and localized states. We also study the effects of the inter-channel coupling $ \tilde{t} $, and observe that increasing $ \tilde{t} $ reduces the delocalized phase space, shifting the transition from $ \lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = 1 $ at $ \tilde{t} = 0 $ to $ \lambda_1^c + \lambda_2^c \approx 0.5 $ at larger $ \tilde{t} $. Furthermore, the phase transition point is found to be sensitive to both $ \tilde{t} $ and the incommensurate modulation parameter $ b $. While the general phase transition behavior is preserved, subtle differences arise for different values of $ b $, indicating a dependence of the phase boundary on both parameters. Using the cost function approach, we calculate the critical potential strength $ \lambda_c $ and the critical exponent $ \nu $, with $ \nu \approx 0.5 $ for the middle of the spectrum in both symmetric and asymmetric models.</description>

      <title>Directional Localization in Disordered 2D Tight-Binding Systems: Insights from Single Particle Entanglement Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the directional localization properties of wave-functions in a two-dimensional tight-binding model with uniform hopping and correlated random on-site energies. By controlling the disorder correlation strength with a parameter $\alpha$, we explore the effects of disorder on wave-function localization using Single Particle Entanglement Entropy (SPEE) and Single Particle R\'enyi Entropy (SPRE) at different values of $q$. Our analysis includes two distinct randomness structures: row-wise and fully correlated disorder. We find that row-wise disorder maintains maximal entanglement for horizontal cuts while enhancing horizontal spread for vertical cuts as $\alpha$ increases. In contrast, fully correlated disorder leads to reduced vertical entanglement for horizontal cuts and increased horizontal entanglement for vertical cuts with rising $\alpha$. Additionally, our results show that the difference between SPEE and SPRE provides valuable insights into localization behavior. These findings highlight the significance of directional properties in understanding localization transitions in disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Geometric quantum drives: Hyperbolically driven quantum systems and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a geometrical construction of driven quantum systems, in which the position of a classical particle moving autonomously on a smooth connected manifold is used to steer a quantum Hamiltonian over time. This results in a time-dependent quantum Hamiltonian with a structured temporal profile and properties dependent on the local and global nature of the underlying choice of manifold. We explain how our construction recovers the well-known classes of periodically-driven and quasiperiodically-driven quantum systems, but also unveils fundamentally novel classes of quantum dynamics: by steering a quantum Hamiltonian using a classical particle freely moving on a compact 2d hyperbolic Riemann surface called the Bolza surface, we demonstrate an example of a hyperbolically driven quantum system. We show that fully gapped hyperbolically driven quantum systems in the adiabatic limit are topologically classified by a quantized dynamical response. We propose geometric quantum driving to be a general framework to chart the landscape of time-dependent quantum systems, which can be realized with time-dependent controls available in modern day quantum simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By means of density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory, we systematically studies film bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (2222-La327), hybrid monolayer-bilayer La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$ (1212-La5311), and La$_2$NiO$_4$ under doping or high-pressure conditions. We find that enhanced quasi-particle weights and local spin fluctuation of the Ni-$e_g$ orbitals are commonly realized by hole doping or high pressure in the known superconducting Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates, suggesting that they are key to the superconductivity. We also summarize experimentally synthesized RP nickelates into a phase diagram with local spin moment as a parameter, where phases of spin density wave/antiferromagnetism (SDW/AFM), superconductivity, and Fermi liquid are distinguished surprisingly. At last, we predict a promising candidate of superconducting RP nickelate, which is constructed in a ``bilayer-trilayer'' stacking sequence.</description>

Abstract: Strange metals arise in a variety of platforms for strongly correlated electrons, ranging from the cuprates, heavy fermions to flat band systems. Motivated by recent experiments in kagome metals, we study a Hubbard model on a kagome lattice whose noninteracting limit contains flat bands. A Kondo lattice description is constructed, in which the correlation effects are captured by symmetry preserving and exponentially localized molecular orbitals. These compact molecular orbitals represent the local degrees of freedom that emerge from topological flat bands. We identify a quantum critical point at which quasiparticles are lost and strange metallicity emerges. Our theoretical work opens up a new route for realizing beyond-Landau quantum criticality, as well as the associated strange metallicity and emergent quantum phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effects of short-range fermion-fermion interactions on the low-energy properties of rhombohedral trilayer graphene are comprehensively investigated using the momentum-shell renormalization group method. We take into account all one-loop corrections and establish the energy-dependent coupled evolutions of independent fermionic couplings that carry the physical information stemming from the interplay of various fermion-fermion interactions. With detailed numerical analysis, we observe that the ferocious competition among all fermion-fermion interactions can drive fermionic couplings to four distinct fixed points, dubbed $\textrm{FP}_{1}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, $\textrm{FP}_{3}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, in the interaction-parameter space. These fixed points primarily dictate the fate of the system in the low-energy regime and are always associated with some instabilities characterized by specific symmetry breakings, leading to certain phase transitions. To determine the favorable states arising from the potential phase transitions, we introduce a number of fermion-bilinear source terms to characterize the underlying candidate states. By comparing their related susceptibilities, we find that the dominant states correspond to spin-singlet superconductivity, spin-triplet pair-density-waves, and spin-triplet superconductivity for fixed points $\textrm{FP}_{1,3}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, respectively. These provide valuable insights into the low-energy properties of rhombohedral trilayer graphene and analogous materials.</description>

Abstract: The spin-$3/2$ chain is a versatile prototypical platform for the study of competition between different kinds of magnetic orders, with the objective of obtaining a deeper understanding of the corresponding quantum phase transitions. In this work, we investigate the spin-$3/2$ chain with nearest-neighbor $J_1$, next-nearest-neighbor $J_2$, and uniaxial single-ion anisotropy $D$ terms in the absence of a magnetic field. For positive values of $J_2/J_1$ and $D/J_1$, we find seven different phases in a rich phase diagram. Without frustration $J_2=0$, a gapless Luttinger liquid phase remains stable for all $D&gt;0$. As $J_2$ increases, we observe three phases with distinct dimerized valence bond orders, which show an intricate competition with vector chiral order and incommensurate correlations. For large $J_2$, regions of phase coexistence between the dimerized and vector chiral orders emerge. We present large-scale numerical data for the determination of transition lines, order parameters, and the nature of the phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersymmetry is an algebraic property of a quantum Hamiltonian that, by giving every boson a fermionic superpartner and vice versa, may underpin physics beyond the Standard Model. Fractional bosonic and fermionic quasiparticles are familiar in condensed matter, as in the spin and charge excitations of the $t$-$J$ model describing electron dynamics in one-dimensional materials, but this type of symmetry is almost unknown. However, the triplet excitations of a quantum spin ladder in an applied magnetic field provide a supersymmetric analogue of the $t$-$J$ chain. Here we perform neutron spectroscopy on the spin-ladder compounds (C$_5$D$_{12}$N)$_2$CuBr$_4$ and (C$_5$D$_{12}$N)$_2$CuCl$_4$ over a range of applied fields and temperatures, and apply matrix-product-state methods to the ladder and equivalent chain models. From the momentum-resolved dynamics of a single charge-like excitation in a bath of fractional spins, we find essential differences in thermal broadening between the supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric sectors. The persistence of a strict zone-centre pole at all temperatures constitutes an observable consequence of supersymmetry that marks the beginning of supersymmetric studies in experimental condensed matter.</description>

      <title>Classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid on the generalized four-color Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While $U$(1) spin liquids have been extensively studied in both quantum and classical regimes, exact classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquids arising from models with nearest-neighbor, bilinear spin interactions are still rare. In this Letter, we explore the four-color Kitaev model as a minimal model for stabilizing classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquids across a broad family of tricoordinated lattices. By formulating a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, we identify this spin liquid as being described by an emergent Gauss's law with effective charge-2 condensation, and deconfined fractionalized bond-charge excitations. We complement our findings with Monte Carlo simulations, revealing a crossover from a high-temperature paramagnet to a low-temperature liquid phase characterized by residual entropy, classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux order, and diffuse spin structure factors.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration with antiferromagnetically ordered NaGdP$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the structural, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties, as well as the adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration (ADR) performance of NaGdP$_2$O$_7$. Although NaGdP$_2$O$_7$ exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering at a N\'eel temperature of $T_{\rm N} = 570$ mK in zero field, ADR experiments achieved a minimum temperature of 220 mK starting from $T = 2$ K under an applied magnetic field of $\mu_0H = 5$ T. The warm-up time back to $T = 2$ K exceeds 60 hours, which is roughly 50 times longer than that of its Yb-based analogue, underscoring the potential of NaGdP$_2$O$_7$ as an efficient precooling stage in double-stage ADR systems. We show that NaGdP$_2$O$_7$ can be seen as a network of ferromagnetic spin chains with antiferromagnetic interchain couplings and also investigate the influence of antiferromagnetic ordering on the magnetic entropy. We find that the temperature dependence of the entropy plays a more dominant role than its magnetic field dependence in the magnetically ordered state.</description>

      <title>Nonflat bands and chiral symmetry in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study an interacting tight-binding model of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), with a twist angle of $1.05^\circ$. We derive effective theories based on a mean-field normal state at charge neutrality, thereby including the renormalizations coming from integrating out high-energy modes. In these theories, the flat bands display a sizable increase of the bandwidth, suggesting a renormalization of the magic angle. Additionally, the corresponding wavefunctions flow towards the limit of perfect particle-hole symmetry and sublattice polarization (the 'chiral' limit). We further represent the flat bands in the 'vortex Chern' basis and discuss the implications on the dynamics regarding the 'flat' and 'chiral' symmetries of MATBG, as manifested in the symmetry-broken states at neutrality.</description>

      <title>Emergence of topological states in relaxation dynamics of interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological concepts have been employed to understand the ground states of many strongly correlated systems, but it is still quite unclear if and how topology manifests itself in the relaxation dynamics. Here we uncover emergent topological phenomena in the time evolution of far-from-equilibrium one-dimensional interacting bosons. Beginning with simple product states, the system evolves into long-time stationary states with high energy that are nonthermal for a wide range of parameters, and they exhibit nonlocal string correlation that is characteristic of the symmetry-protected topological ground state of the Hamiltonian. In contrast, no topological feature is found in the stationary state as long as the system thermalizes. This difference is further corroborated by the distinct behaviour of quantum entanglement and edge states of the system. Our theoretical prediction can be examined by current experimental techniques and paves the way for a more comprehensive understanding of topological phases in nonequilibrium settings.</description>

      <title>Linear-T Resistivity from Spatially Random Vector Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11170v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Patel et al. introduced a higher dimensional version of the SYK model with random coupling in a Yukawa interaction to find the linear-$T$ resistivity. We test the universality of the mechanism by replacing the scalar field with a vector field in various dimensions. We find that it works for vector and scalar interactions, although the details are largely different. However, this mechanism for the linear-$T$ resistivity works only in $(2+1)$ dimensions and not in higher dimensions, regardless of the interaction type. Based on these results, we explore the r\^ole of spatial random disorder and find a simple explanation of how such random scattering converts the Fermi liquid to a strange metal by changing the self-energies of the involved bosons and fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These Lecture Notes discuss the recent theoretical advances in the understanding of open quantum many-body physics in platforms where both dissipative and coherent processes can be tuned and controlled to a high degree. We start by reviewing the theoretical frameworks and methods used to describe and tackle open quantum many-body systems. We then discuss the use of dissipative processes to engineer many-body stationary states with desired properties and the emergence of dissipative phase transitions arising out of the competition between coherent evolution and dissipation. We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the 1d XY model on a quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of quantum computing has grown fast in recent years, both in theoretical advancements and the practical construction of quantum computers. These computers were initially proposed, among other reasons, to efficiently simulate and comprehend the complexities of quantum physics. In this paper, we present a comprehensive scheme for the exact simulation of the 1-D XY model on a quantum computer. We successfully diagonalize the proposed Hamiltonian, enabling access to the complete energy spectrum. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach to design a quantum circuit to perform exact time evolution. Among all the possibilities this opens, we compute the ground and excited state energies for the symmetric XY model with spin chains of $n=4$ and $n=8$ spins. Further, we calculate the expected value of transverse magnetization for the ground state in the transverse Ising model. Both studies allow the observation of a quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic to a paramagnetic state. Additionally, we have simulated the time evolution of the state all spins up in the transverse Ising model. The scalability and high performance of our algorithm make it an ideal candidate for benchmarking purposes, while also laying the foundation for simulating other integrable models on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Probing the many-body localized spin-glass phase through quench dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eigenstates of quantum many-body systems are often used to define phases of matter in and out of equilibrium; however, experimentally accessing highly excited eigenstates is a challenging task, calling for alternative strategies to dynamically probe nonequilibrium phases. In this work, we characterize the dynamical properties of a disordered spin chain, focusing on the spin-glass regime. Using tensor-network simulations, we observe oscillatory behavior of local expectation values and bipartite entanglement entropy. We explain these oscillations deep in the many-body localized spin glass regime via a simple theoretical model. From perturbation theory, we predict the timescales up to which our analytical description is valid and confirm it with numerical simulations. Finally, we study the correlation length dynamics, which, after a long-time plateau, resumes growing in line with renormalization group (RG) expectations. Our work suggests that RG predictions can be quantitatively tested against numerical simulations and experiments, potentially enabling microscopic descriptions of dynamical phases in large systems.</description>

      <title>Note on surface defects in multiscalar critical models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies generic surface defects for multiscalar critical models using a perturbative $\epsilon$ expansion in $4-\epsilon$ dimensions. The beta functions of the defect couplings for a generic multiscalar bulk with quartic interactions are computed at first non-trivial order in $\epsilon$. Specific bulks of interest are then considered: $O(N)$, hypercubic, hypertetrahdral, and biconical $O(m)\times O(n)$. In each case, we compute fixed points for the defect couplings and determine the remaining bulk symmetry. Expanding beyond the $O(N)$ model, we find a greater variety of patterns of symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Lindblad many-body scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars have received much recent attention for being both intriguing non-ergodic states in otherwise quantum chaotic systems and promising candidates to encode quantum information efficiently. So far, these studies have mostly been restricted to Hermitian systems. Here, we study many-body scars in many-body quantum chaotic systems coupled to a Markovian bath, which we term Lindblad many-body scars. They are defined as simultaneous eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian and dissipative parts of the vectorized Liouvillian. Importantly, because their eigenvalues are purely real, they are not related to revivals. The number and nature of the scars depend on both the symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the choice of jump operators. For a dissipative four-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with $N$ fermions, either Majorana or complex, we construct analytically some of these Lindblad scars while others could only be obtained numerically. As an example of the former, we identify $N/2+1$ scars for complex fermions due to the $U(1)$ symmetry of the model and two scars for Majorana fermions as a consequence of the parity symmetry. Similar results are obtained for a dissipative XXZ spin chain. We also characterize the physical properties of Lindblad scars. First, the operator size is independent of the disorder realization and has a vanishing variance. By contrast, the operator size for non-scarred states, believed to be quantum chaotic, is well described by a distribution centered around a specific size and a finite variance, which could be relevant for a precise definition of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in dissipative quantum chaos. Moreover, the entanglement entropy of these scars has distinct features such as a strong dependence on the partition choice and, in certain cases, a large entanglement.</description>
