      <title>Period matrices and homological quasi-trees on discrete Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study discrete period matrices associated with graphs cellularly embedded on closed surfaces, resembling classical period matrices of Riemann surfaces. Defined via integrals of discrete harmonic 1-forms, these period matrices are known to encode discrete conformal structure in the sense of circle patterns. We obtain a combinatorial interpretation of the discrete period matrix, where its minors correspond to weighted sums over certain spanning subgraphs, which we call homological quasi-trees. Furthermore, we relate the period matrix to the determinant of the Laplacian for a flat complex line bundle. We derive a combinatorial analogue of the Weil-Petersson potential on Teichm\"uller space, expressed as a weighted sum over homological quasi-trees. Finally, we prove that the collection of homological quasi-trees form a delta-matroid. The discrete period matrix plays a role similar to that of the response matrix in circular planar networks, thereby addressing a question posed by Richard Kenyon.</description>

      <title>High degree simple partial fractions in the Bergman space: Approximation and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the class of standard weighted Bergman spaces $A^2_{\alpha}(\mathbb{D})$ and the set $SF^N(\mathbb{T})$ of simple partial fractions of degree $N$ with poles on the unit circle. We prove that under certain conditions, the simple partial fractions of order $N$, with $n$ poles on the unit circle attain minimal norm if and only if the points are equidistributed on the unit circle. We show that this is not the case if the conditions we impose are not met, exhibiting a new interesting phenomenon. We find sharp asymptotics for these norms. Additionally we describe the closure of these fractions in the standard weighted Bergman spaces.</description>

      <title>Dual realizations of Bergman spaces on strongly convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fantappi\`e and Laplace transforms realize isomorphisms between analytic functionals supported on a convex compact set $K\subset{\mathbb C}^n$ and certain spaces of holomorphic functions associated with $K$. Viewing the Bergman space of a bounded domain in ${\mathbb C}^n$ as a subspace of the space of analytic functionals supported on its closure, the images of the restrictions of these transforms have been studied in the planar setting. For the Fantappi\`e transform, this was done for simply connected domains (Napalkov Jr--Yulumukhamtov, 1995), and for the Laplace transform, this was done for convex domains (Napalkov Jr--Yulumukhamtov, 2004). In this paper, we study this problem in higher dimensions for strongly convex domains, and establish duality results analogous to the planar case. We also produce examples to show that the planar results cannot be generalized to all convex domains in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>The Laplace and Leray transforms on some (weakly) convex domains in $\mathbb{C}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The space of Laplace transforms of holomorphic Hardy-space functions have been characterized as weighted Bergman spaces of entire functions in two cases: that of planar convex domains (Lutsenko--Yumulmukhametov, 1991), and that of strongly convex domains in higher dimensions (Lindholm, 2002). In this paper, we establish such a Paley--Weiner result for a class of (weakly) convex Reinhardt domains in $\mathbb{C}^2$ that are well-modelled by the so-called egg domains. We consider Hardy spaces on these domains with respect to a canonical choice of boundary Monge--Ampere measure. This class of domains was introduced by Barrett--Lanzani (2009) to study the $L^2$-boundedness of the Leray transform in the absence of either strongly convexity or $\mathcal{C}^2$-regularity. The boundedness of the Leray transform plays a crucial role in understanding the image of the Laplace transform. As a supplementary result, we expand the known class of convex Reinhardt domains for which the Leray transform is $L^2$-bounded (with respect to the aforementioned choice of boundary measure). Finally, we also produce an example to show that the Lutsenko--Yumulmukhametov result cannot be expected to generalize to all convex domains in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>A Szeg\"o limit theorem for a class of Toeplitz operators on the Bergman space of the unit ball with singular symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a Szeg\"o limit theorem for a family of Toeplitz operators defined on the weighted Bergman space of the unit ball $\mathbb{B}_{n}$. The symbols of these operators are supported on some isotropic or co-isotropic submanifold $\Gamma \subseteq \mathbb{B}_{n}$ and can be seen, in general, as measures that are singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{C}^{n}$. The given theorem allows to describe the asymptotic behavior of these operators as the parameter of the weighted Bergman space tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>On products and partial isometry of Toeplitz operators with operator-valued symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve the following problems associated with Toeplitz operators $T_{\Phi}$ on Hilbert space-valued Hardy spaces $H_{\mathcal{E}}^2(\mathbb{D}^n)$ over the unit polydisc $\mathbb{D}^n$. $(I)$ Given operator-valued bounded analytic functions $\Gamma, \Psi$ on $\mathbb{D}^n$, we completely characterize when the product $M_{\Gamma}M_{\Psi}^*$ becomes a Toeplitz operator by identifying tractable conditions on the functions. Furthermore, these conditions can be used to explicitly write the product into a sum of simple Toeplitz operators. $(II)$ We prove that partially isometric Toeplitz operators admit the following factorization: \[ T_{\Phi} = M_{\Gamma} M_{\Psi}^*, \] where, $\Gamma, \Psi$ are operator-valued inner functions on $\mathbb{D}^n$. A few of the immediate consequences are: $(a)$ every partially isometric Toeplitz operator has a partially isometric symbol almost everywhere on $\mathbb{T}^n$ (distinguished boundary of $\mathbb{D}^n$), $(b)$ any partially isometric analytic Toeplitz operator is of the form $M_{\Gamma V^*}$, where $\Gamma$ is an operator-valued inner function and $V$ is an constant isometry. In connection with the result $(ii)$, we establish and use a crucial phenomenon: the range of partially isometric Toeplitz operators is always a Beurling-type invariant subspace of $H_{\mathcal{E}}^2(\mathbb{D}^n)$. Our results are new even in the case of Hardy spaces over the unit disc and extend the work of Brown--Douglas, Deepak--Pradhan--Sarkar on scalar-valued spaces.</description>
