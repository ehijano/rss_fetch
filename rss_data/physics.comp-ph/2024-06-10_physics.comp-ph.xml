      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for the Numerical Modeling of Steady-State and Transient Electromagnetic Problems with Discontinuous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising numerical method based on deep learning for modeling boundary value problems, showcasing promising results in various fields. In this work, we use PINNs to discretize three-dimensional electromagnetic, parametric problems, with material discontinuities, covering both static and transient regimes. By replacing the discontinuous material properties with a continuous approximation, we eliminate the need to directly enforce interface conditions. Using the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis, we show that using the first-order formulation of Maxwell's equations is more suitable for interface problems. We introduce a PINN-based decomposition on overlapping domains to enhance the convergence rate of the PINN.</description>

      <title>Nanodosimetric characterisation of proton track structure: a comparison of sampling and clustering algorithms using Geant4-DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the influence of the algorithm used to calculate conditional ionisation cluster size distributions (ICSD) and nanodosimetric parameters from proton track structures obtained with Geant4-DNA simulations. The Uniform Sampling (US) and Associated Volume (AV) sampling algorithms and the DBSCAN clustering algorithm were used to calculate the ICSD conditioned on cluster sizes $\nu \ge 1$. In the AV algorithm, we explored two configurations: one where sampling volumes could overlap ("Overlap") and one where volumes could not overlap ("No Overlap"). The Overlap configuration was corrected with the weight function $w(\nu)=\nu^{-1}$ to eliminate the bias towards regions of high density of ionisations. In sampling algorithms, clusters were defined as the number of ionisations in spheres of 3.4 nm in diameter. In DBSCAN, clusters were formed according to a proximity criterion (maximum distance of 3.4 nm) between two ionisations - no additional geometrical restrictions were applied. The conditional ICSD, the mean cluster size, and a set of complementary cumulative frequencies were compared. We considered differences in the mean difference larger than two standard deviations statistically significant. Overall, differences between the No Overlap and the Overlap configurations and between the US and AV algorithms were statistically significant but relatively small, except when statistical fluctuations dominated. DBSCAN always resulted in significantly larger mean cluster sizes. We showed that the fast and efficient AV can be used instead of the relatively inefficient US to calculate conditional ICSDs without significant loss of accuracy. The differences observed between DBSCAN and the other algorithms are understood and originate in the fact that while the scoring volume is fixed for the sampling algorithms, for DBSCAN, it evolves according to the distance between ionisations.</description>

      <title>A momentum space formulation for some relativistic statistical field theories with quantum-like observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering a fluctuating scalar field on momentum space, some relativistic statistical field theories are constructed. A Hilbert space of observables is then constructed from functionals of the fluctuating scalar field with an inner product defined in terms of expectation values of the functionals. A bosonic Fock space is then constructed from the Hilbert space and creation and annihilation operators that act on the Fock space are defined. The creation and annihilation operators are used to define field operators. These field operators have some interesting quantum-like properties. For example, the field operators do not commute in general and, in the particular case of the free field theory, can be shown to satisfy the microcausality condition.</description>

      <title>Physics-enhanced Neural Operator for Simulating Turbulent Transport</title>

Abstract: The precise simulation of turbulent flows is of immense importance in a variety of scientific and engineering fields, including climate science, freshwater science, and the development of energy-efficient manufacturing processes. Within the realm of turbulent flow simulation, direct numerical simulation (DNS) is widely considered to be the most reliable approach, but it is prohibitively expensive for long-term simulation at fine spatial scales. Given the pressing need for efficient simulation, there is an increasing interest in building machine learning models for turbulence, either by reconstructing DNS from alternative low-fidelity simulations or by predicting DNS based on the patterns learned from historical data. However, standard machine learning techniques remain limited in capturing complex spatio-temporal characteristics of turbulent flows, resulting in limited performance and generalizability. This paper presents a novel physics-enhanced neural operator (PENO) that incorporates physical knowledge of partial differential equations (PDEs) to accurately model flow dynamics. The model is further refined by a self-augmentation mechanism to reduce the accumulated error in long-term simulations. The proposed method is evaluated through its performance on two distinct sets of 3D turbulent flow data, showcasing the model's capability to reconstruct high-resolution DNS data, maintain the inherent physical properties of flow transport, and generate flow simulations across various resolutions. Additionally, experimental results on multiple 2D vorticity flow series, generated by different PDEs, highlight the transferability and generalizability of the proposed method. This confirms its applicability to a wide range of real-world scenarios in which extensive simulations are needed under diverse settings.</description>

      <title>FlowMM: Generating Materials with Riemannian Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystalline materials are a fundamental component in next-generation technologies, yet modeling their distribution presents unique computational challenges. Of the plausible arrangements of atoms in a periodic lattice only a vanishingly small percentage are thermodynamically stable, which is a key indicator of the materials that can be experimentally realized. Two fundamental tasks in this area are to (a) predict the stable crystal structure of a known composition of elements and (b) propose novel compositions along with their stable structures. We present FlowMM, a pair of generative models that achieve state-of-the-art performance on both tasks while being more efficient and more flexible than competing methods. We generalize Riemannian Flow Matching to suit the symmetries inherent to crystals: translation, rotation, permutation, and periodic boundary conditions. Our framework enables the freedom to choose the flow base distributions, drastically simplifying the problem of learning crystal structures compared with diffusion models. In addition to standard benchmarks, we validate FlowMM's generated structures with quantum chemistry calculations, demonstrating that it is about 3x more efficient, in terms of integration steps, at finding stable materials compared to previous open methods.</description>

      <title>Physically consistent immersed boundary method: a framework for predicting hydrodynamic forces on particles with coarse meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, a fluid-particle coupling method is directly derived from the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) by applying the concept of volume-filtering, yielding a physically consistent methodology to incorporate solid wall boundary conditions in the volume-filtered flow solution, thereby allowing to solve the governing flow equations on non-body conforming meshes. The resulting methodology possesses similarities with a continuous forcing immersed boundary method (IBM) and is, therefore, termed physically consistent IBM (PC-IBM). Based on the recent findings of arXiv:2402.05842v1, the closures arising in the volume-filtered NSE are closed by suitable models or even expressed analytically. The PC-IBM is fully compatible with the large eddy simulation framework, as the volume-filtered NSE converge to the filtered NSE away from solid boundaries. The potential of the PC-IBM is demonstrated by means of different particle-laden flow applications, including a dense packing of fixed particles and periodic settling of 500 particles. The new methodology turns out to be capable of accurately predicting the fluid forces on particles with relatively coarse mesh resolutions. For the flow around isolated spheres, a spatial resolution of six fluid mesh cells per diameter is sufficient to predict the drag force with less than 10% deviation from highly resolved simulation for the investigated particle Reynolds numbers ranging from 10 to 250.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Transformer Neural Network for Simulating Open Quantum Systems via a Probabilistic Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.05580v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of open quantum systems lays the foundations for a substantial part of modern research in quantum science and engineering. Rooted in the dimensionality of their extended Hilbert spaces, the high computational complexity of simulating open quantum systems calls for the development of strategies to approximate their dynamics. In this paper, we present an approach for tackling open quantum system dynamics. Using an exact probabilistic formulation of quantum physics based on positive operator-valued measure (POVM), we compactly represent quantum states with autoregressive transformer neural networks; such networks bring significant algorithmic flexibility due to efficient exact sampling and tractable density. We further introduce the concept of String States to partially restore the symmetry of the autoregressive transformer neural network and improve the description of local correlations. Efficient algorithms have been developed to simulate the dynamics of the Liouvillian superoperator using a forward-backward trapezoid method and find the steady state via a variational formulation. Our approach is benchmarked on prototypical one and two-dimensional systems, finding results which closely track the exact solution and achieve higher accuracy than alternative approaches based on using Markov chain Monte Carlo to sample restricted Boltzmann machines. Our work provides general methods for understanding quantum dynamics in various contexts, as well as techniques for solving high-dimensional probabilistic differential equations in classical setups.</description>

      <title>One-shot learning for solution operators of partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.05512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning and solving governing equations of a physical system, represented by partial differential equations (PDEs), from data is a central challenge in a variety of areas of science and engineering. Traditional numerical methods for solving PDEs can be computationally expensive for complex systems and require the complete PDEs of the physical system. On the other hand, current data-driven machine learning methods require a large amount of data to learn a surrogate model of the PDE solution operator, which could be impractical. Here, we propose the first solution operator learning method that only requires one PDE solution, i.e., one-shot learning. By leveraging the principle of locality of PDEs, we consider small local domains instead of the entire computational domain and define a local solution operator. The local solution operator is then trained using a neural network, and utilized to predict the solution of a new input function via mesh-based fixed-point iteration (FPI), meshfree local-solution-operator informed neural network (LOINN) or local-solution-operator informed neural network with correction (cLOINN). We test our method on diverse PDEs, including linear or nonlinear PDEs, PDEs defined on complex geometries, and PDE systems, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalization capabilities of our method across these varied scenarios.</description>

      <title>Neural Pfaffians: Solving Many Many-Electron Schr\"odinger Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural wave functions accomplished unprecedented accuracies in approximating the ground state of many-electron systems, though at a high computational cost. Recent works proposed amortizing the cost by learning generalized wave functions across different structures and compounds instead of solving each problem independently. Enforcing the permutation antisymmetry of electrons in such generalized neural wave functions remained challenging as existing methods require discrete orbital selection via non-learnable hand-crafted algorithms. This work tackles the problem by defining overparametrized, fully learnable neural wave functions suitable for generalization across molecules. We achieve this by relying on Pfaffians rather than Slater determinants. The Pfaffian allows us to enforce the antisymmetry on arbitrary electronic systems without any constraint on electronic spin configurations or molecular structure. Our empirical evaluation finds that a single neural Pfaffian calculates the ground state and ionization energies with chemical accuracy across various systems. On the TinyMol dataset, we outperform the `gold-standard' CCSD(T) CBS reference energies by 1.9m$E_h$ and reduce energy errors compared to previous generalized neural wave functions by up to an order of magnitude.</description>
