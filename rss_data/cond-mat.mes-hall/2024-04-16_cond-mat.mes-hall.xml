      <title>Influence of Auger heating and Shockley-Read-Hall recombination on hot carrier dynamics in InGaAs nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the origin of hot carrier relaxation in nanowires (NWs) with one-dimensional (1D) geometry is significant for designing efficient hot carrier solar cells with such nanostructures. Here, we study the influence of Auger heating and Shockley-Read-Hall recombination on hot carrier dynamics of catalyst-free InGaAs-InAlAs core-shell NWs. Using steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy the dependencies of hot carrier effects on the degree of confinement of photo-generated carriers induced by the nanowire diameter are determined at different lattice temperatures. Analysis of excitation-power dependent data and temperature-dependent PL linewidth broadening reveal that at low temperatures, strong Auger recombination and phonon-bottleneck are responsible for hot carrier effects. Our analysis gives also insights into electron-phonon and ionized impurity scattering, showing opposing trends with NW diameter, and it allows to estimate the Fr\"ohlich coupling constant for the InGaAs NWs. Conversely, with increasing lattice temperature, hot carrier relaxation rates increase due to enhanced Shockley-Read Hall and surface recombination. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals a fourfold increase in the rate of Shockley-Read-Hall recombination from 6 ns at 10 K to 1.5 ns at 150 K. The findings suggest that minimizing defect densities in the bulk and surfaces of these NWs will be key to enhance hot carrier effects towards higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent exciton-exciton interactions in a mixed lead halide perovskite crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the two-pulse photon echo response of excitons in the mixed lead halide perovskite crystal \sample in dependence on the excitation intensity and polarization of the incident laser pulses. Using spectrally narrow picosecond laser pulses, we address localized excitons with long coherence times $T_2 \approx 100\,$ps. This approach offers high sensitivity for the observation of excitation-induced changes in the homogeneous linewidth $\Gamma_2=2\hbar/T_2$ on the $\mu$eV scale. Through intensity-dependent measurements, we evaluate the increase of $\Gamma_2$ by 10~$\mu$eV at an exciton density of 10$^{17}$~cm$^{-3}$ being comparable with the intrinsic linewidth of 14$\,\mu$eV. We observe that the decay of the photon echo and its power dependence are sensitive to the polarization configuration of the excitation pulses, which indicates that spin-dependent exciton-exciton interactions contribute to excitation-induced dephasing. In cross-linear polarization, the decay is faster and its dependence on exciton density is stronger as compared to the co-polarized configuration. Using a two-exciton model accounting for different spin configurations we are able to reproduce the experimental results.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved quantum correlations in electronic noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistics of quantum transport in nanostructures can be tailored by a time-dependent bias voltage $V(t)$. We demonstrate experimentally how correlations of current fluctuations at two different times $t$ and $t+\tau$ depend on the shape of $V(t)$ via the phase accumulated by the electronic wavefunctions between $t$ and $t+\tau$. For this we measure the current-current correlation of the shot noise of an ac+dc biased tunnel junction using a 10 GHz bandwidth, time-resolved detection. Our result allows to explore correlations within a single excitation period. It demonstrates the counterpart of the ac Josephson effect in superconducting junctions, to a normal, non-superconducting mesoscopic device.</description>

      <title>Interplay between electronic dephasing and localization in finite-sized Chern insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anderson localization is anticipated to play a pivotal role in the manifestation of the quantum anomalous Hall effect, akin to its role in conventional quantum Hall effects. The significance of Anderson localization is particularly pronounced in elucidating the reasons behind the fragility of the observed quantum anomalous Hall state in the intrinsic magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4 with a large predicted magnetic gap. Here, employing varying sized MnBi2Te4 micro/nano-structures fabricated from a single molecular-beam-epitaxy-grown thin film, we have carried out a systematic size- and temperature-dependent study on the transport properties of the films regarding the quantum anomalous Hall states. The low-temperature transport properties of the finite-sized MnBi2Te4 samples can be quantitatively understood through Anderson localization, which plays an indispensable role in stabilizing the ground states. At higher temperatures, the failure of electron localization induced by an excessively short electronic dephasing length is identified as the cause of deviation from quantization. The work reveals that electronic dephasing and localization are non-negligible factors in designing high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall systems.</description>

      <title>Photo-induced Multiply Quantized Vortex States in Dirac-like Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subjecting a massive two-dimensional Dirac material to a vortex light beam provides a mechanism for the photo-induction of multiply quantized vortices. Using Floquet theory, we show that electronic vortices, characterized by their total angular momentum, are exclusive to circularly polarized vortex beams. The equations for the driven system at the one photon-resonance are mapped to the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations of $s$-wave superconductors with multiply quantized vortices. This mapping provides valuable analytical tools for the analysis of the system's spectral properties.</description>

      <title>Coherently controlling robust spin-orbit qubits of electrons in nanowire quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an electron confined in a gated nanowire quantum dot (NQD) with arbitrarily strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and weak static magnetic field, and treat the latter as a perturbation to seek the maximal spin-motion entangled states with the exact general solutions of the perturbed equations. From the boundedness and self-consistent conditions of the general solutions we find two corrected energies to any n level of the unperturbed system with ground state n = 0, which are much less than the unperturbed level-difference and corresponds to a spin-orbit qubit. We demonstrate the metastability of the two-level states and the decoherence-averse effect of SOC, and suggest an alternative scheme to perform the qubit control, simply by adjusting the orientation of magnetic field for any fixed SOC. Such a adjustment can lead to the spin flipping of the state vector and the position exchanging of the probability-density wavepackets which can be proposed as the non-Abelian quasiparticles. The results could be directly extended to a weakly coupled array of NQDs for coherently encoding the robust spin-orbit qubits.</description>

      <title>Interfacial reaction boosts thermal conductance of room-temperature integrated semiconductor interfaces stable up to 1100 C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overheating has emerged as a primary challenge constraining the reliability and performance of next-generation high-performance electronics, such as chiplets and (ultra)wide bandgap electronics. Advanced heterogeneous integration not only constitutes a pivotal technique for fabricating these electronics but also offers potential solutions for thermal management. This study presents the integration of high thermal conductivity semiconductors, specifically, 3C-SiC thin films and diamond substrates, through a room-temperature surface-activated bonding technique. Notably, the thermal conductivity of the 3C-SiC films is among the highest for all semiconductor films which can be integrated near room temperature with similar thicknesses. Furthermore, following annealing, the interfaces between 3C-SiC and diamond demonstrate a remarkable enhancement in thermal boundary conductance (TBC), reaching up to approximately 300%, surpassing all other grown and bonded heterointerfaces. This enhancement is attributed to interfacial reactions, specifically the transformation of amorphous silicon into SiC upon interaction with diamond, which is further corroborated by picosecond ultrasonics measurements. Subsequent to annealing at 1100 C, the achieved TBC (150 MW/m2-K) is record-high among all bonded diamond interfaces. Additionally, the visualization of large-area TBC, facilitated by femtosecond laser-based time-domain thermoreflectance measurements, shows the uniformity of the interfaces which are capable of withstanding temperatures as high as 1100 C. Our research marks a significant advancement in the realm of thermally conductive heterogeneous integration, which is promising for enhanced cooling of next-generation electronics.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed tracking of qubit fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental fluctuations degrade the performance of solid-state qubits but can in principle be mitigated by real-time Hamiltonian estimation down to time scales set by the estimation efficiency. We implement a physics-informed and an adaptive Bayesian estimation strategy and apply them in real time to a semiconductor spin qubit. The physics-informed strategy propagates a probability distribution inside the quantum controller according to the Fokker-Planck equation, appropriate for describing the effects of nuclear spin diffusion in gallium-arsenide. Evaluating and narrowing the anticipated distribution by a predetermined qubit probe sequence enables improved dynamical tracking of the uncontrolled magnetic field gradient within the singlet-triplet qubit. The adaptive strategy replaces the probe sequence by a small number of qubit probe cycles, with each probe time conditioned on the previous measurement outcomes, thereby further increasing the estimation efficiency. The combined real-time estimation strategy efficiently tracks low-frequency nuclear spin fluctuations in solid-state qubits, and can be applied to other qubit platforms by tailoring the appropriate update equation to capture their distinct noise sources.</description>

      <title>Intravalley Andreev reflection in the multi-terminal device with Y-shaped Kekul\'{e} graphene superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the tight-binding model, a multi-terminal superconductor(S) device is proposed, where the structures of the center region are primitive grpahene(G) and Y-shaped Kekul\'{e} graphene superlattice(GS), respectively. The intravalley Andreev reflection is studied in this model through the utilization of the non-equilibrium Green's function method. In the G/S device, due to the time-reverse symmetry the dominant process of Andreev reflection is intervalley reflection. In a three-terminal GS/S device, it has been observed that the coefficient of intravalley Andreev reflection can surpass that of intervalley reflection in crossed Andreev reflection. This is attributed to the coupling between valleys K and -K within the first Brillouin zone, resulting in enhanced intervalley scattering. The valley-dependent transport of Andreev reflection can be influenced by the phase difference between superconductor terminals. The valley polarization of the local Andreev reflection and the crossed Andreev reflection could be controlled by adjusting the structure of the central region.</description>

      <title>Optical probing of the carriers-mediated coupling of the spin of two Co atoms in a quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the optical spectroscopy of the spin of two Co atoms in a quantum dot and interacting with a single exciton. The spectrum of quantum dots containing two Co atoms are exchange interaction and by the strain at the location of the magnetic atoms. A wide range of spectrum can be obtained depending on the relative coupling of each atom to the confined exciton. We obtained a comprehensive interpretation of the experimental data with a spin Hamiltonian model. We show that the two Co atoms spins can be orientated by the injection of spin polarized carriers at zero magnetic field. This induces a correlation between the two spins that is observed in the intensity distribution of the emission spectra. The optical absorption in the phonon sideband of quantum dots doped with two Co reveals resonant absorptions which strongly depend on a transverse magnetic field. We show that these characteristic absorptions result from an interplay between the mixing of Co spin states induced by the presence of in-plane strain anisotropy at the magnetic atoms location and the transverse field.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Off-Axis Fields for Vector Magnetometry with Point Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector magnetometry is an essential tool in characterizing the distribution of currents and magnetization in a broad range of systems. Point defect sensors, like the nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond, have demonstrated impressive sensitivity and spatial resolution for detecting these fields. Measuring the vector field at a single point in space using single defects, however, remains an outstanding challenge. We demonstrate that careful optimization of the static bias field can enable simultaneous measurement of multiple magnetic field components with enhanced sensitivity by leveraging the nonlinear Zeeman shift from transverse magnetic fields. This work quantifies the trade-off between the increased frequency shift from second-order Zeeman effects with decreasing contrast as off-axis field components increase, demonstrating the measurement of multiple components of the magnetic field from an exemplar antiferromagnet with a complex magnetic texture.</description>

      <title>First-order quantum breakdown of superconductivity in amorphous superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous quantum phase transitions are widely assumed and frequently observed in various systems of quantum particles or spins. Their characteristic trait involves scaling laws governing a second-order, gradual suppression of the order parameter as the quantum critical point is approached. The localization of Cooper pairs in disordered superconductors and the resulting breakdown of superconductivity have long stood as a prototypical example. Here, we show a departure from this paradigm, showcasing that amorphous superconducting films of indium oxide undergo a distinctive, discontinuous first-order quantum phase transition tuned by disorder. Through systematic measurements of the plasmon spectrum in superconducting microwave resonators, we provide evidence for a marked jump of both the zero-temperature superfluid stiffness and the transition temperature at the critical disorder. This discontinuous transition sheds light on the previously overlooked role of repulsive interactions between Cooper pairs and the subsequent competition between superconductivity and insulating Cooper-pair glass. Furthermore, our investigation shows that the critical temperature of the films no longer relates to the pairing amplitude but aligns with the superfluid stiffness, consistent with the pseudogap regime of preformed Cooper pairs. Our findings raise fundamental new questions into the role of disorder in quantum phase transitions and carry implications for superinductances in quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Gate tunable enhancement of supercurrent in hybrid planar Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions (JJs) have emerged as a promising platform for the realization of topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes. To obtain robust quasi one-dimensional (1D) topological superconducting states using planar JJs, limiting the number of 1D Andreev bound states' subbands that can be present, and increasing the size of the topological superconducting gap, are two fundamental challenges. It has been suggested that both problems can be addressed by properly designing the interfaces between the JJ's normal region and the superconducting leads. We fabricated Josephson junctions with periodic hole structures on the superconducting contact leads on InAs heterostructures with epitaxial superconducting Al. By depleting the chemical potential inside the hole region with a top gate, we observed an enhancement of the supercurrent across the junction. Such an enhancement is reproduced in theoretical simulations. The theoretical analysis shows that the enhancement of the JJ's critical current is achieved when the hole depletion is such to optimize the matching of quasiparticles' wave-function at the normal/superconductor interface. These results show how the combination of carefully designed patterns for the Al coverage, and external gates, can be successfully used to tune the density and wave functions' profiles in the normal region of the JJ, and therefore open a new avenue to tune some of the critical properties, such as number of subbands and size of the topological gap, that must be optimized to obtain robust quasi 1D superconducting states supporting Majorana bound states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons are key to the optoelectronic applications of van der Waals semiconductors with the potential for versatile on-demand tuning of properties. Yet, their electrical manipulation is complicated by their inherent charge neutrality and the additional loss channels induced by electrical doping. We demonstrate the dynamic control of valley polarization in charged biexciton (quinton) states of monolayer tungsten disulfide, achieving up to a sixfold increase in the degree of circular polarization under off-resonant excitation. In contrast to the weak direct tuning of excitons typically observed using electrical gating, the quinton photoluminescence remains stable, even with increased scattering from electron doping. By exciting at the exciton resonances, we observed the reproducible non-monotonic switching of the charged state population as the electron doping is varied under gate bias, indicating a coherent interplay between neutral and charged exciton states.</description>

      <title>Double-dome Unconventional Superconductivity in Twisted Trilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene moir\'e systems are ideal environments for investigating complex phase diagrams and gaining fundamental insights into the mechanisms underlying exotic states of matter, as they permit controlled manipulation of electronic properties. Magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG) has emerged as a key platform to explore moir\'e superconductivity, owing to the robustness of its superconducting order and the displacement-field tunability of its energy bands. Recent measurements strongly suggest that superconductivity in MATTG is unconventional. Here, we report the first direct observation of double-dome superconductivity in MATTG. The temperature, magnetic field, and bias current dependence of the superconductivity of doped holes collectively show that it is significantly suppressed near moir\'e filling $\nu^* = -2.6$, leading to a double dome in the phase diagram within a finite window of the displacement field. The temperature dependence of the normal-state resistance and the $I-V$ curves straddling $\nu^*$ are suggestive of a phase transition and the potentially distinct nature of superconductivity in the two domes. Hartree-Fock calculations incorporating mild strain yield an incommensurate Kekul\'e spiral state whose effective spin polarization peaks in the regime where superconductivity is suppressed in experiments. This allows us to draw conclusions about the normal state as well as the unconventional nature of the superconducting order parameter.</description>

      <title>Tuning confined states and valley g-factors by quantum dot design in bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrostatically confined quantum dots in bilayer graphene have shown potential as building blocks for quantum technologies. To operate the dots, e.g., as qubits, a precise understanding and control of the confined states and their properties is required. Herein, a large-scale numerical characterization of confined quantum states in bilayer graphene dots is performed over an extensive range of gate-tunable parameters such as the dot size, depth, shape, and the bilayer graphene gap. The dot states' orbital degeneracy, wave function distribution, and valley g-factor are established and the parametric dependencies to achieve different regimes are provided. It is found that the dot states are highly susceptible to gate-dependent confinement and material parameters, enabling efficient tuning of confined states and valley g-factor modulation by quantum dot design.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with strong exchange bias in PtMn/Co by magneto-ionics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric field control of magnetic properties offers a broad and promising toolbox for enabling ultra-low power electronics. A key challenge with high technological relevance is to master the interplay between the magnetic anisotropy of a ferromagnet and the exchange coupling to an adjacent antiferromagnet. Here, we demonstrate that magneto-ionic gating can be used to achieve a very stable out-of-plane (OOP) oriented magnetization with strong exchange bias in samples with as-deposited preferred in-plane (IP) magnetization. We show that the perpendicular interfacial anisotropy can be increased by a factor of 2.2 in the stack Ta/Pt/PtMn/Co/HfO2 by applying -2.5 V gate voltage over 3 nm HfO2, causing a reorientation of the magnetization from IP into OOP with a strong OOP exchange bias of more than 50 mT. Comparing two thicknesses of PtMn, we identify a notable trade-off: while thicker PtMn yields a significantly larger exchange bias, it also results in a slower response to ionic liquid gating. These results pave the way for post-deposition electrical tailoring of magnetic anisotropy and exchange bias in samples requiring significant exchange bias.</description>

      <title>Stable phases of freestanding monolayer TiO$_2$: The emergence of out-of-plane ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite being successfully synthesized [Zhang $et$ $al.$, Nat. Mater. \textbf{20}, 1073 (2021)], the monolayer structure of stable hexagonal TiO$_2$ is unknown, and it is not even clear whether it can exist in a freestanding form. Through first-principles calculations, we have identified two previously uncharted stable structures, namely, distorted 1$\times$$\sqrt{3}$ 1T-TiO$_2$ and $\sqrt{3}$$\times$$\sqrt{3}$ 1T-TiO$_2$, both of which are energetically more favourable than commonly adopted 1H and 1T phases. Here structural distortions are characterized by the out-of-plane shifts of Ti atoms due to the pseudo-Jahn-Teller interactions, which break one and all two inversion symmetries of 1T configuration. As a consequence, the 1$\times$$\sqrt{3}$ 1T remains centrosymmetric while the $\sqrt{3}$$\times$$\sqrt{3}$ 1T exhibits out-of-plane ferroelectricity. Electronic structure calculations show that both two are wide-bandgap semiconductors with bandgaps larger than their bulk counterparts. Our study not only deepens the understanding of structural instability in wide-gap semiconductors but also adds a new member to the rare family of two-dimensional out-of-plane ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Solution-Processed Inks with Fillers of NbS$_3$ Quasi-One-Dimensional Charge-Density-Wave Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the solution processing and testing of electronic ink comprised of quasi-one-dimensional NbS$_3$ charge-density-wave fillers. The ink was prepared by liquid-phase exfoliation of NbS$_3$ crystals into high-aspect ratio quasi-1D fillers dispersed in a mixture of isopropyl alcohol and ethylene glycol solution. The results of the electrical measurements of two-terminal electronic test structures printed on silicon substrates reveal resistance anomalies in the temperature range of ~330 K to 370 K. It was found that the changes in the temperature-dependent resistive characteristics of the test structures originate from the charge-density-wave phase transition of individual NbS$_3$ fillers. The latter confirms that the exfoliated NbS$_3$ fillers preserve their intrinsic charge-density-wave quantum condensate states and can undergo phase transitions above room temperature even after chemical exfoliation processes and printing. These results are important for developing "quantum inks" with charge-density-wave fillers for the increased functionality of future solution-processed electronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent and dissipative interactions between different quantum systems are essential for the construction of hybrid quantum systems and the investigation of novel quantum phenomena. Here, we propose and analyze a magnon-skyrmion hybrid quantum system, consisting of a micromagnet and nearby magnetic skyrmions. We predict a strong coupling mechanism between the magnonic mode of the micromagnet and the quantized helicity degree of freedom of the skyrmion. We show that with this hybrid setup it is possible to induce magnon-mediated nonreciprocal interactions and responses between distant skyrmion qubits or between skyrmion qubits and other quantum systems like superconducting qubits. This work provides a quantum platform for the investigation of diverse quantum effects and quantum information processing with magnetic microstructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skyrmion qubits are a new highly promising logic element for quantum information processing. However, their scalability to multiple interacting qubits remains challenging. We propose a hybrid quantum setup with skyrmion qubits strongly coupled to nanomechanical cantilevers via magnetic coupling, which harnesses phonons as quantum interfaces for the manipulation of distant skyrmion qubits. A linear drive is utilized to achieve the modulation of the stiffness coefficient of the cantilever, resulting in an exponential enhancement of the coupling strength between the skyrmion qubit and the mechanical mode. We also consider the case of a topological resonator array, which allows us to study interactions between skyrmion qubits and topological phonon band structure, as well as chiral skyrmion-skyrmion interactions. The scheme suggested here offers a fascinating platform for investigating quantum information processing and quantum simulation with magnetic microstructures.</description>

      <title>Odd-frequency superconducting pairing and multiple Majorana edge modes in driven topological superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes have been shown to be the simplest quasiparticles exhibiting pure odd-frequency pairing, an effect that has so far been theoretically established in the static regime. In this work we investigate the formation of Majorana modes and odd-frequency pairing in $p$-wave spin-polarized superconductors under a time-dependent drive. We first show that the driven system hosts multiple Majorana modes emerging at zero and $\pi$, whose formation can be controlled by an appropriate tuning of the drive frequency and chemical potential. Then we explore the induced pair correlations and find that odd-frequency spin-polarized $s$-wave pairing is broadly induced, acquiring large values in the presence of Majorana modes. We discover that, while odd-frequency pairing is proportional to $\sim1/\omega$ in the presence of Majorana zero modes, it is proportional to $\sim 1/(\omega-\pi\hbar/T)$ in the presence of Majorana $\pi$ modes, where $T$ is the periodicity of the drive. Furthermore, we find that the amount of odd-frequency pairing becomes larger when multiple Majorana modes appear but the overall divergent profile as a function of frequency remains. Our work thus paves the way for understanding the emergent pair correlations in driven topological superconductors</description>

      <title>Surprising pressure-induced magnetic transformations from Helimagnetic order to Antiferromagnetic state in NiI2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interlayer magnetic interactions play a pivotal role in determining the magnetic arrangement within van der Waals (vdW) magnets, and the remarkable tunability of these interactions through applied pressure further enhances their significance. Here, we investigate NiI2 flakes, a representative vdW magnet, under hydrostatic pressures up to 11 GPa. We reveal a notable increase in magnetic transition temperatures for both helimagnetic and antiferromagnetic states, and find that a reversible transition from helimagnetic to antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases at approximately 7 GPa challenges established theoretical and experimental expectations. While the increase in transition temperature aligns with pressure-enhanced overall exchange interaction strengths, we identify the significant role of the second-nearest neighbor interlayer interaction, which competes with intra-layer frustration and favors the AFM state as demonstrated in the Monte Carlo simulations. Experimental and simulated results converge on the existence of an intermediate helimagnetic ordered state in NiI2 before transitioning to the AFM state. These findings underscore the pivotal role of interlayer interactions in shaping the magnetic ground state, providing fresh perspectives for innovative applications in nanoscale magnetic device design.</description>

      <title>Microwave Hall measurements using a circularly polarized dielectric cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a circularly polarized dielectric rutile (TiO$_2$) cavity with a high quality-factor that can generate circularly polarized microwaves from two orthogonal linearly polarized microwaves with a phase difference of $\pm\pi/2$ using a hybrid coupler. Using this cavity, we have established a new methodology to measure the microwave Hall conductivity of a small single crystal of metals in the skin-depth region. Based on the cavity perturbation technique, we have shown that all components of the surface impedance tensor can be extracted under the application of a magnetic field by comparing the right- and left-handed circularly polarization modes. To verify the validity of the developed method, we performed test measurements on tiny Bi single crystals at low temperatures. As a result, we have successfully obtained the surface impedance tensor components and confirmed that the characteristic field dependence of the ac Hall angle in the microwave region is consistent with the expectation from the dc transport measurements. These results demonstrate a significant improvement in sensitivity compared to previous methods. Thus, our developed technique allows more accurate microwave Hall measurements, opening the way for new approaches to explore novel topological quantum materials, such as time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire phenomenological approach we explore the strain-polarization coupling in the low-dimensional van der Waals ferrielectrics. We evolve the analytical model of the piezoelectric susceptibility of the material in response to the periodic strain modulation, such as caused by a surface acoustic wave. Numerical calculations are performed for recently discovered and poorly studied ultrathin layers of the van der Waals ferrielectric CuInP2S6, which are very promising candidates for advanced nanoelectronics. We obtained that the temperature dependences of the dielectric and piezoelectric susceptibilities, and elastic compliance of the ultrathin CuInP2S6 layer have a sharp maximum at the temperature of CuInP2S6 paraelectric-ferrielectric phase transition near 320 K. The magnitudes of the dielectric and piezoelectric susceptibilities, and elastic compliance depend significantly on the modulation period of the surface acoustic wave. Obtained results explore the potential of ultrathin CuInP2S6 layers for application in piezoelectric and straintronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Periodically-driven systems engender a rich competition between the time scales of the drives and those of the system, leading to a limited ability to describe the system in full. We present a framework for the description of interacting bosonic driven systems via a Floquet expansion on top of a quantization that "counts" the drive photons, and provide compelling arguments for the superior performance of our method relative to standard Floquet approaches. Crucially, our approach extends beyond the rotating wave approximation and addresses the long-standing issue of mismatch between the quantum Floquet formalism and its classical counterpart. We, furthermore, pinpoint key corrections to the positions of multiphoton resonances, which are commonly used in the calibration and operation of qubit architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductors (Eg &gt;2.0 eV) are integral to the advancement of next generation electronics, optoelectronics, and power industries, owing to their capability for high temperature operation, high breakdown voltage and efficient light emission. Enhanced power efficiency and functional performance can be attained through miniaturization, specifically via the integration of device fabrication into two-dimensional (2D) structure enabled by WBG 2D semiconductors. However, as an essential subgroup of WBG semiconductors, 2D transition metal oxides (TMOs) remain largely underexplored in terms of physical properties and applications in 2D opto-electronic devices, primarily due to the scarcity of sufficiently large 2D crystals. Thus, our goal is to develop synthesis pathways for 2D TMOs possessing large crystal domain (e.g. &gt;10 nm), expanding the 2D TMOs family and providing insights for future engineering of 2D TMOs. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of WBG 2D nickel oxide (NiO) (Eg &gt; 2.7 eV) thermally converted from 2D nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) with the lateral domain size larger than 10 um. Moreover, the conversion process is investigated using various microscopic techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), providing significant insights on the morphology and structure variation under different oxidative conditions. The electronic structure of the converted NixOy is further investigated using multiple soft X-ray spectroscopies, such as X-ray absorption (XAS) and emission spectroscopies (XES).</description>

Abstract: This article reviews recent developments in the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), particularly on its rich interplay with topology. The review starts off with a pedagogical introduction on the modified bulk-boundary correspondence, the synergy and hybridization of NHSE and band topology in higher dimensions, as well as, the associated topology on the complex energy plane such as spectral winding topology and spectral graph topology. Following which, emerging topics are introduced such as non-Hermitian criticality, dynamical NHSE phenomena, and the manifestation of NHSE beyond the traditional linear non-interacting crystal lattices, particularly its interplay with quantum many-body interactions. Finally, we survey the recent demonstrations and experimental proposals of NHSE.</description>

Abstract: We use Boltzmann model to study the semi-classical dynamics of electrons in a two-dimensional (2D) tilted Dirac material in which the tilt varies in space. The spatial variation of the tilt parameter induces a non-trivial spacetime geometry on the background of which the electrons roam about. As the first manifestation of graivto-electric phenomena, we find a geometric planar Hall effect according to which a current flows in a direction transverse to the chemical potential gradient and is proportional to component $g^{xy}$ of the emergent spacetime structure. The longitudinal conductivity contains information about the gravitational red-shift factors. Furthermore, in the absence of externally applied electric field there can be "free-fall" or zero-bias currents that can be used as detectors of terahertz radiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analytic, Mie theory-based solution for the energy-loss and the photon-emission probabilities in the interaction of spherical nanoparticles with electrons passing nearby and through them, in both cathodoluminescence and electron energy-loss spectroscopies. In particular, we focus on the case of penetrating electron trajectories, for which the complete fully electrodynamic and relativistic formalism has not been reported as yet. We exhibit the efficiency of this method in describing collective excitations in matter through calculations for a dispersive and lossy system, namely a sphere described by a Drude permittivity. Subsequently, we use the analytic solution to corroborate the implementation of electron-beam sources in a state-of-the-art numerical method for problems in electrodynamics, the discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) method. We show that the two approaches produce spectra in good mutual agreement, and demonstrate the versatility of DGTD via simulations of spherical nanoparticles characterized by surface roughness. The possibility of simultaneously employing both kinds of calculations (analytic and numerical) facilitates a better understanding of the rich optical response of nanophotonic architectures excited by fast electron beams.</description>

      <title>Edge theory of non-Hermitian skin modes in higher dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03950v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish an effective edge theory to characterize non-Hermitian edge-skin modes in higher dimensions. We begin by proposing a bulk projection criterion to straightforwardly identify the localized edges of skin modes. Through an exact mapping, we show that the edge-skin mode shares the same bulk-boundary correspondence and localization characteristics as the zero-energy edge states in a Hermitian semimetal under open-boundary conditions, bridging the gap between non-Hermitian edge-skin effect and Hermitian semimetals. Another key finding is the introduction of ``skewness,'' a term we proposed to describe the characteristic decay direction of skin mode from the localized edge into the bulk. Remarkably, we demonstrate that skewness is an intrinsic quantity of the skin mode and can be analytically determined using the corresponding cylinder-geometry bulk Hamiltonian, without requiring any boundary details. Furthermore, we reveal that in the edge-skin effect, the spectrum exhibits anomalous spectral sensitivity to weak local disturbances, a feature that crucially distinguishes it from the corner-skin effect.</description>

      <title>Mode-Shell correspondence, a unifying phase space theory in topological physics -- Part I: Chiral number of zero-modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a theory, that we call the \textit{mode-shell correspondence}, which relates the topological zero-modes localised in phase space to a \textit{shell} invariant defined on the surface forming a shell enclosing these zero-modes. We show that the mode-shell formalism provides a general framework unifying important results of topological physics, such as the bulk-edge correspondence, higher-order topological insulators, but also the Atiyah-Singer and the Callias index theories. In this paper, we discuss the already rich phenomenology of chiral symmetric Hamiltonians where the topological quantity is the chiral number of zero-dimensionial zero-energy modes. We explain how, in a lot of cases, the shell-invariant has a semi-classical limit expressed as a generalised winding number on the shell, which makes it accessible to analytical computations.</description>

      <title>Moving frame theory of zero-bias photocurrent on the surface of topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by observations of zero-biased photocurrent on the surface of topological insulators, we show that the in-plane effective magnetic field $\tilde B$ implements a moving frame transformation on the topological insulators' helical surface states. As a result, photo-excited electrons on the surface undergo a Galilean boost proportional to the effective in-plane magnetic field $\tilde B$. The boost velocity is transversely proportional to $\tilde B$. This explains why the experimentally observed photocurrent depends linearly on $\tilde B$. Our theory while consistent with the observation that at leading order the effect does not depend on the polarization of the incident radiation, at next leading order in $\tilde B$ predicts a polarization dependence in both parallel and transverse directions to the polarization. We also predict two induced Fermi surface effects that can serve as further confirmation of our moving frame theory. Based on the estimated value $\zeta\approx 0.34$ of the tilt parameter for a magnetic fields of $\tilde B\sim 3$T, our geometric picture qualifies the surface Dirac cone of magnetic topological insulators as an accessible platform for the synthesis and experimental investigation of strong synthetic gravitational phenomena.</description>

      <title>Dirac mass induced by optical gain and loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass is commonly regarded as an intrinsic property of matter, but modern physics reveals particle masses to have complex origins, such as the Higgs mechanism in high-energy physics. In crystal lattices such as graphene, relativistic Dirac particles can exist as low-energy quasiparticles with masses imparted by lattice symmetry-breaking perturbations. These mass-generating mechanisms all assume Hermiticity, or the conservation of energy in detail. Using a photonic synthetic lattice, we show experimentally that Dirac masses can be generated via non-Hermitian perturbations based on optical gain and loss. We then explore how the space-time engineering of the gain/loss-induced Dirac mass affects the quasiparticles. As we show, the quasiparticles undergo Klein tunnelling at spatial boundaries, but a local breaking of a non-Hermitian symmetry can produce a novel flux nonconservation effect at the domain walls. At a temporal boundary that abruptly flips the sign of the Dirac mass, we observe a variant of the time reflection phenomenon: in the nonrelativistic limit, the Dirac quasiparticle reverses its velocity, while in the relativistic limit the original velocity is retained.</description>

      <title>Impact of bright-dark exciton thermal population mixing on the brightness of CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between bright and dark exciton states is crucial for deciphering the luminescence properties of low-dimensional materials. The origin of the outstanding brightness of lead halide perovskites remains elusive. Here, we analyse temperature-dependent time-resolved photoluminescence to investigate the population mixing between bright and dark exciton sublevels in individual CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals in the intermediate confinement regime. We extract bright and dark exciton decay rates, and show quantitatively that the decay dynamics can only be reproduced with second-order phonon transitions. Furthermore, we find that any exciton sublevel ordering is compatible with the most likely population transfer mechanism. The remarkable brightness of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals rather stems from a reduced asymmetry between bright-to-dark and dark-to-bright conversion originating from the peculiar second-order phonon-assisted transitions that freeze bright-dark conversion at low temperature together with the very fast radiative recombination and favourable degeneracy of the bright exciton state.</description>

      <title>Topology-induced symmetry breaking: a demonstration in antiferromagnetic magnons on a M\"obius strip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism of topology-induced symmetry breaking, where certain local symmetry preserved by the Hamiltonian is broken in the excited eigenstates due to the nontrivial boundary condition. As a demonstration, we study magnon excitations on a M\"obius strip comprising of two antiferromagnetically coupled spin chains. Even under a simple Hamiltonian respecting local rotational symmetry and without considering curvature effects, magnons exhibit linear polarization of the N\'eel vector devoid of chirality and form two non-degenerate branches that cannot be smoothly connected to or be decomposed by the circularly-polarized magnons typically seen in antiferromagnets. One branch supports standing-wave formation on the M\"obius strip while the other does not, owing to its spectral shift incurred by the boundary condition. Our findings showcase the significant influence of real-space topology on the physical nature of quasiparticles.</description>

Abstract: Triangular cross-section color center photonics in silicon carbide is a leading candidate for scalable implementation of quantum hardware. Within this geometry, we model low-loss beam splitters for applications in key quantum optical operations such as entanglement and single-photon interferometry. We consider triangular cross-section single-mode waveguides for the design of a directional coupler. We optimize parameters for a 50:50 beam splitter. Finally, we test the experimental feasibility of the designs by fabricating triangular waveguides in an ion beam etching process and identify suitable designs for short-term implementation.</description>

      <title>Inducing a Tunable Skyrmion-Antiskyrmion System through Ion Beam Modification of FeGe Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Skyrmions and antiskyrmions are nanoscale swirling textures of magnetic moments formed by chiral interactions between atomic spins in magnetic non-centrosymmetric materials and multilayer films with broken inversion symmetry. These quasiparticles are of interest for use as information carriers in next-generation, low-energy spintronic applications. To develop skyrmion-based memory and logic, we must understand skyrmion-defect interactions with two main goals -- determining how skyrmions navigate intrinsic material defects and determining how to engineer disorder for optimal device operation. Here, we introduce a tunable means of creating a skyrmion-antiskyrmion system by engineering the disorder landscape in FeGe using ion irradiation. Specifically, we irradiate epitaxial B20-phase FeGe films with 2.8 MeV Au$^{4+}$ ions at varying fluences, inducing amorphous regions within the crystalline matrix. Using low-temperature electrical transport and magnetization measurements, we observe a strong topological Hall effect with a double-peak feature that serves as a signature of skyrmions and antiskyrmions. These results are a step towards the development of information storage devices that use skyrmions and anitskyrmions as storage bits and our system may serve as a testbed for theoretically predicted phenomena in skyrmion-antiskyrmion crystals.</description>

      <title>Periodically Driven Open Quantum Systems: Spectral Properties and Non-Equilibrium Steady States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate periodically driven open quantum systems within the framework of Floquet-Lindblad master equations. Specifically, we discuss Lindblad master equations in the presence of a coherent, time-periodic driving and establish their general spectral features. We also clarify the notions of transient and non-decaying solutions from this spectral perspective, and then prove that any physical system described by a Floquet-Lindblad equation must have at least one \textit{physical} non-equilibrium steady state (NESS), corresponding to an eigenoperator of the Floquet-Lindblad evolution superoperator $\mathcal{U}_F$ with unit eigenvalue. Since the Floquet-Lindblad formalism encapsulates the entire information regarding the NESS, it in principle enables us to obtain non-linear effects to all orders at once. The Floquet-Lindblad formalism thus provides a powerful tool for studying driven-dissipative solid-state systems, which we illustrate by deriving the nonlinear optical response of a simple two-band model of an insulating solid and comparing it with prior results established through Keldysh techniques.</description>

      <title>Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer interaction as an infinite-range Penson-Kolb pairing mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the well-known $(k\uparrow, -k\downarrow)$ Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer interaction, when considered in real space, is equivalent to an infinite-range Penson-Kolb pairing mechanism coexisting with an attractive Hubbard term. Driven by this discovery and aiming at exploring the conduction properties, we investigate the dynamics of fermionic particles confined in a ring-shaped lattice. We assume that fermions are simultaneously influenced by the pairing interaction and by an Aharonov-Bohm electromagnetic phase, which is incorporated into the model in a highly non-trivial manner. Remarkably, the aforementioned model shows Richardson integrability for both integer and half-integer values of the applied magnetic flux $\Phi/\Phi_0$, thus permitting the exact solution of a genuine many-body problem. We discuss the ground state properties of both two-particle and many-particle systems, drawing comparisons with results from the attractive Hubbard model. Our approach combines exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group techniques, and numerical solution of the Richardson equations. This comprehensive analysis allows us to study various key metrics, including the system's conductivity as a function of the interaction strength. In this way, the BCS-BEC transition is investigated in a continuous manner, thus permitting to shed light on fundamental aspects of superconducting pairing. Our findings can be experimentally tested in a condensed matter context or, with greater level of control, using atomtronics platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solid-state elastic-wave phonons are a promising platform for a wide range of quantum information applications. An outstanding challenge and enabling capability in harnessing phonons for quantum information processing is achieving strong nonlinear interactions between them. To this end, we propose a general architecture using piezoelectric-semiconductor heterostructures consisting of a piezoelectric acoustic material hosting phonon modes in direct proximity to a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). Each phonon in the piezoelectric material carries an electric field, which extends into the 2DEG. The fields induce polarization of 2DEG electrons, which in turn interact with other piezoelectric phononic electric fields. The net result is coupling between the various phonon modes. We derive, from first principles, the nonlinear phononic susceptibility of the system. We show that many nonlinear processes are strongly favored at high electron mobility, motivating the use of the 2DEG to mediate the nonlinearities. We derive in detail the first, second, and third-order susceptibilities and calculate them for the case of a lithium niobate surface acoustic wave interacting with a GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructure 2DEG. We show that, for this system, the strong third-order nonlinearity could enable single-phonon Kerr shift in an acoustic cavity that exceeds realistic cavity linewidths, potentially leading to a new class of acoustic qubit. We further show that the strong second-order nonlinearity could be used to produce a high-gain, traveling-wave parametric amplifier to amplify--and ultimately detect--the outputs of the acoustic cavity qubits. Assuming favorable losses in such a system, these capabilities, combined with the ability to efficiently transduce phonons from microwave electromagnetic fields in transmission lines, thus hold promise for creating all-acoustic quantum information processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the anharmonic signatures in dissipative polaritons' stationary energy distribution and thermodynamics under external periodic driving. First, we introduce a dynamic model for the dissipative anharmonic Jaynes-Cummings polariton with a generic time-periodic interaction representing modulations of the polariton's energy due to an external force or field. We characterize the stationary state in terms of the exciton, phonon, and interaction energy dependence on the phonon anharmonicity, exciton-phonon coupling strength, and intensity and form of the external field-polariton coupling. Our model also captures the quantum thermodynamics of the driven polariton, which we analyze in connection with the irreversible heat, maximum power, and efficiency of the process. We find considerable differences in energy distribution and thermodynamics between harmonic, moderate, and strongly anharmonic polaritons. Moreover, comparing the external modulations to the phonon and exciton energy, we conclude that the former enhances the polariton's energy storage capacity and is occasionally limited by interference effects and energy saturation at the exciton.</description>

      <title>Surface Luttinger surfaces and Luttinger-Lifshitz transitions in topological band structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard paradigm of topological phases posits that two phases with the same symmetries are necessarily separated by a bulk phase transition, while breaking the symmetry unlocks a path in parameter space that allows the phases to be connected adiabatically. Moreover, if the symmetry is broken only on the boundary, topological surface states are generically gapped and single-particle surface properties are expected to be blind to distinction between the two phases. In this work, we prove this last expectation incorrect. We first reveal that the single-particle surface Green's function contains zeros or ``Luttinger surfaces'' that respect the same bulk-boundary correspondence as the well-known topological surface states. Remarkably, the Luttinger surfaces survive symmetry-breaking perturbations that destroy the surface states. Thus, a bulk topological phase transition in the presence of surface symmetry breaking causes a reconstruction of Luttinger surfaces on the surface, which we refer to as a surface Luttinger-Lifshitz transition. At non-zero temperatures, the Luttinger surfaces contribute negatively to an effective surface specific heat, and a Luttinger-Lifshitz transition manifests as a discontinuity in this specific heat.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report measurements of counting statistics, average and variance, of microwave photons of ill-defined frequency: bichromatic photons, i.e. photons involving two well separated frequencies, and "white", broadband photons. Our setup allows for the detection of single photonic modes of arbitrary waveform over the 1-10 GHz frequency range. The photon statistics is obtained by on-the-fly numerical calculation from the measured time-dependent voltage. After validating our procedure with thermal- and squeezed- radiation of such photons, we relate the detected statistics to the squeezing spectrum of an ac+dc biased tunnel junction. We observe an optimal squeezing of $\sim$1.5dB over a bandwidth $&gt;1$ GHz, better than 1dB over 3.5 GHz and still see squeezing over a bandwidth of $\sim6$ GHz around 6 GHz. We also show how the waveform of a bichromatic photon can be optimized for maximum squeezing.</description>
