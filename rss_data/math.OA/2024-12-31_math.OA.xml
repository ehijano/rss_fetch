      <title>On a class of left ideals of nest algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of left ideals (and subalgebras) of nest algebras determined by totally ordered families of partial isometries on a complex Hilbert space $H$.
  Let $\mathcal{E}$ be a family of partial isometries that is totally ordered in the Halmos--McLaughlin ordering, and let $\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{E}}$ be the subset of operators in $B(H)$ which, for all $E\in \mathcal{E}$, map the initial space of $E$ to the final space of $E$. We show that $\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{E}}$ is a subalgebra of $B(H)$ if and only if $\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{E}}$ is a left ideal of a certain nest algebra, and if so,
  $\mathcal{E}$ consists of power partial isometries, except possibly for its supremum $\vee \mathcal{E}$, in which case the range $\operatorname{ran}(\vee \mathcal{E})$ is $H$. It is also shown that any left ideal $\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{E}}$ is decomposable and that the subset of finite rank operators in its closed unit ball is strongly dense in the ball. Necessary and sufficient conditions to solve $Tx=y$ and $T^*x=y$ in $\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{E}}$ are given.</description>

      <title>On the Elementary Equivalence of Group Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use techniques of distortion systems, introduced by James Hanson to show that any two elementarily equivalent infinite discrete ICC groups give rise to elementarily equivalent group von Neumann algebras. This answers a question raised by Goldbring-Pi (and attributed there to Koichi Oyakawa), in the negative. In a special case, this resolves the model theoretic free factor isomorphism problem.</description>

      <title>Free denoising via overlap measures and c-freeness techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of free denoising. For free selfadjoint random variables $a,b$, where we interpret $a$ as a signal and $b$ as noise, we find $E(a|a+b)$. To that end, we study a probability measure $\mu^{( \mathrm{ov} )}_{a,a+b}$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$ which we call the overlap measure. We show that $\mu^{( \mathrm{ov} )}_{a,a+b}$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the product measure $\mu_a\times \mu_{a+b}$. The Radon-Nikodym derivative gives direct access to $E(a|a+b)$. We show that analogous results hold in the case of multiplicative noise when $a,b$ are positive and the aim is to find $E(a|a^{1/2}ba^{1/2})$. In a parallel development we show that, for a general selfadjoint expression $P(a,b)$ made with $a$ and $b$, finding $E(a|P(a,b))$ is equivalent to finding the distribution of $P(a,b)$ in a certain two-state probability space $(\mathcal{A},\varphi,\chi)$, where $a,b$ are c-free with respect to $(\varphi,\chi)$ in the sense of Bo\.zejko-Leinert-Speicher.</description>

      <title>A Projection Characterization and Symmetry Bootstrap for Elements of a von Neumann Algebra that are Nearby Commuting Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a symmetry map $\varphi$ on a unital $C^\ast$-algebra $\mathcal A$ to be an $\mathbb{R}$-linear map on $\mathcal A$ that generalizes transformations on matrices like: transpose, adjoint, complex-conjugation, conjugation by a unitary matrix, and their compositions. We include an overview of such symmetry maps on unital $C^\ast$-algebras. We say that $A\in\mathcal A$ is $\varphi$-symmetric if $\varphi(A)=A$, $A$ is $\varphi$-antisymmetric if $\varphi(A)=-A$, and $A$ has a $\zeta=e^{i\theta}$ $\varphi$-phase symmetry if $\varphi(A)=\zeta A$.
  Our main result is a new projection characterization of two operators $U$ (unitary), $B$ that have nearby commuting operators $U'$ (unitary), $B'$. This can be used to ``bootstrap'' symmetry from operators $U, B$ that are nearby some commuting operators $U', B'$ to prove the existence of nearby commuting operators $U'', B''$ which satisfy the same symmetries/antisymmetries/phase symmetries as $U, B$, provided that the symmetry maps and symmetries/antisymmetries/phase symmetries satisfy some mild conditions. We also prove a version of this for $X=U$ self-adjoint instead of unitary.
  As a consequence of the prior literature and the results of this paper, we prove Lin's theorem with symmetries: If a $\varphi$-symmetric matrix $A$ is almost normal ($\|[A^\ast, A]\|$ is small), then it is nearby a $\varphi$-symmetric normal matrix $A'$. We also extend this further to include rotational and dihedral symmetries.
  We also obtain bootstrap symmetry results for two and three almost commuting self-adjoint operators. As a corollary, we resolve a conjecture of arXiv:1502.03498 for two almost commuting self-adjoint matrices in the Atland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes related to topological insulators.</description>

      <title>A note on the Cuntz algebra automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Permutative automorphisms of the Cuntz algebras $\mathcal{O}_n$ are in bijection with the stable permutations of $[n]^k$. Thereby, it is used to determine the restricted Weyl group of $Aut(\mathcal{O}_n)$ by describing all satble permutations. In this note, we characterize some stable involutions of rank one, and thus we prove Conjecture 12.2 of Brenti and Conti [Adv. Math. 381 (2021), p. 60].</description>

      <title>Exploring Cohomology, Deformations, and Hom-NS Structures in Hom-Leibniz Conformal Algebras through Nijenhuis Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the Nijenhuis operator on Hom-Leibniz conformal algebra, defining their representations and cohomologies. We determine the cohomologies for both Hom-Leibniz conformal algebra and Nijenhuis operators on Hom-Leibniz conformal algebra. Subsequently, establishing the cohomology of Hom-Nijenhuis-Leibniz conformal algebras. As an application to this cohomology, we study formal deformations of the Nijenhuis operator on Hom-Leibniz conformal algebra. Additionally, we introduce Hom-NS-Leibniz conformal algebra and explore how various operators such as Rota-Baxter operator, Twisted Rota Baxter operator, and Nijenhuis operators can provide Hom-NS-Leibniz conformal algebras.</description>

      <title>Cohomology and Homotopification of averaging operators on the Lie conformal algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building upon the work of Pavel in [P. Kolesnikov, Journal of Mathematical Physics, 56, 7 (2015)], we first present the cohomology of averaging operators on the Lie conformal algebras and use it to develop the cohomology of averaging Lie conformal algebras. We then introduce the homotopy version of averaging Lie conformal algebras and establish a connection between $2$-term averaging $\mathfrak{L}_\infty$-conformal algebra with the $3$-cocycle and crossed module of averaging Lie conformal algebra. Next, we study the non-abelian extension of the averaging Lie conformal algebras, showing that they are classified by the second non-abelian cohomology group. Finally, we demonstrate that a pair of automorphisms of averaging Lie conformal algebra is inducible if it can be seen as an image of a suitable Wells map.</description>

      <title>Free infinite divisibility, fractional convolution powers, and Appell polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Initiated by an observation of Steinerberger [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 147(11):4733--4744, 2019], there has been a recent growing body of literature connecting repeated differentiation of real rooted polynomials to free additive convolution semigroups in free probability. Roughly, this connection states that in the large degree limit the empirical measure of the roots after many derivatives is, up to a rescaling, the original empirical measure of the roots raised to a free additive convolution power. If the original roots satisfy some bounds and the number of derivatives is such that the remaining degree is fixed, then these high derivatives converge to the Hermite polynomials. In the context of convolution semigroups and finite free probability these results have a natural interpretation as a central limit theorem for repeated differentiation. We consider the case when these root bounds are removed and identify the potential limits of repeated differentiation as the real rooted Appell sequences. We prove that a sequence of polynomials is in the domain of attraction of an Appell sequence exactly when the empirical measures of the roots are, up to a rescaling, in the domain of attraction of a free infinitely divisible distribution naturally associated to the Appell sequence. We additionally extend these notions of infinite divisibility and fractional convolution semigroups to rectangular finite free probability. Our approach is based on the finite free R-transform of the polynomials, providing a step towards an analytic theory of finite free probability. These transforms provide a clear connection between Appell polynomials and free infinitely divisible distributions, where the finite free R-transform of a real rooted Appell polynomial is a truncated version of the R-transform of an infinitely divisible distribution.</description>

      <title>Stratification in equivariant Kasparov theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study stratification, that is the classification of localizing tensor ideal subcategories by geometric means, in the context of Kasparov's equivariant KK-theory of C*-algebras. We introduce a straightforward countable analog of the notion of stratification by Balmer-Favi supports and conjecture that it holds for the equivariant bootstrap subcategory of every finite group G. We prove this conjecture for groups whose nontrivial elements all have prime order, and we verify it rationally for arbitrary finite groups. In all these cases we also compute the Balmer spectrum of compact objects. In our proofs we use larger versions of the equivariant Kasparov categories which admit not only countable coproducts but all small ones; they are constructed in an Appendix using infinity-categorical enhancements and adapting ideas of Bunke-Engel-Land.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Fibre Bundles via Bimodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a Leray-Serre spectral sequence for fibre bundles for de Rham sheaf cohomology on noncommutative algebras. The morphisms are bimodules with zero-curvature extendable bimodule connections. This generalises definitions involving differentiable algebra maps to differentiable completely positive maps by using the KSGNS construction and Hilbert $C^*$-bimodules with bimodule connections. We give examples of noncommutative fibre bundles, involving group algebras, matrix algebras, and the quantum torus.</description>
