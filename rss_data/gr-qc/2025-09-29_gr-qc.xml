      <title>Buchdahl limit of compact stars in presence of Weyl anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We setup an anisotropic compact star model in presence of Weyl ``trace" anomaly. We derive an exact interior solution which determines the contribution of the vacuum trace anomaly. We introduce a dimentionless parameter, $\beta$, to characterize this contribution. Applying appropriate matching conditions with the exterior solution, we determine the model parameters in terms of the Weyl anomaly parameter $\beta$ and the compactness parameter, $C=\frac{2GM}{c^2 \mathcal{R}}$ where $M$ and $\mathcal{R}$ are the mass and the radius of the star. We investigate the parameter space $\{\beta, C\}$ and the corresponding modifications of Buchdahl limit on the maximum compactness. We use astrophysical observations of mass and radius of the pulsar PSR J0740+6620 to constrain the Weyl anomaly parameter $\beta$. Also, we investigate the Mass-Radius diagram with other observational constraints from NICER and LIGO/Virgo collaboration.</description>

      <title>Twins in relativistic spacetimes: dispelling some misconceptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to Newtonian physics, there is no absolute time in relativistic (Lorentzian) spacetimes. This immediately implies that two twins may, in general, age at different rates. For this to happen, there must be, of course, some asymmetry between their worldlines, along which the elapsed proper times are evaluated; such asymmetry might not be, however, so intuitively apparent. Our primary objective is to present, in a concise and didactic manner, some lesser-known results and derive novel ones from a modern, geometrical, and covariant standpoint, which aims to clarify the issue and dispel related misconceptions. First, we recall that: (i) the original ``twin paradox'' may be perfectly dealt with in special relativity (physics in a flat spacetime) and does not necessarily involve an accelerated twin. We then explore the issue of differential aging in general relativity (physics in a curved background) in the prototypical case of the vacuum Schwarzschild spacetime, considering several pairs of twins. In this context, we show that: (ii) it is not true that a twin which gets closer to the Schwarzschild horizon, by being subject to a stronger gravitational field, where time sort of slows down, should always get younger than a twin that stays further away, in a region of weaker gravitational field, and (iii) it is also false that an accelerated twin always returns younger than a geodesic one. Finally, we argue that (iv) in a generic spacetime, there is no universal correlation between the phenomena of differential aging and the Doppler effect. Two particularly pedagogical resources provided are a glossary of relevant terms and supplementary Python notebooks in a GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Black holes in higher-derivative Weyl conformal gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain exact black hole solutions for static and spherically symmetric sources in a Weyl conformal gauge theory of gravity. We consider a quadratic gravitational action built from the Weyl tensor within a dilation geometry. In a post-Riemannian formulation, we derive a Weyl conformal action for a scalar-vector-tensor theory, where the scalar degree of freedom originates from the high-curvature terms and the vectorial one stems from the Weyl non-metricity condition. Adopting a static, spherically symmetric geometry, the vacuum field equations for the gravitational, scalar, and Weyl fields are obtained. Under these conditions, we find a Mannheim-Kazanas-type black hole solution, whose Rindler acceleration term depends on the Weyl gauge coupling constant. Furthermore, we show that the original theory can recover the Einstein-Hilbert action with a positive cosmological constant plus a higher-derivative term with Horndeski-like terms through a spontaneous symmetry breaking triggered by the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field. The new solution in the theory without conformal symmetry presents new terms introduced by the residual Weyl symmetry corrections. We demonstrate that in a regime where the Planck mass suppresses the higher-derivative term, the Rindler term persists in the low-energy limit.</description>

      <title>A Python Interface for Numerical Relativity Program AMSS-NCKU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical relativity has produced wide-ranging influences on modern astrophysics and gravitational-wave astronomy. In this work, we develop a Python interface for the numerical relativity program AMSS-NCKU, which enables the automation of initializing and starting the AMSS-NCKU simulations and the automatically generating visualizations of the output results. Numerical relativity simulations using this Python interface have been presented through two representative examples (binary back hole and triple black hole merger processes), and well-behaved stable numerical results and the expected physical behaviors for black hole systems have been acquired. The Python operational interface significantly lowers the operational complexity of the simulation workflow of AMSS-NCKU simulations, reducing the technical barriers for freshman users.</description>

      <title>(Gravitational Wave) Memory of Starobinsky in a Time Crystal (Condensate)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter we have revealed the presence of Gravitational Wave Memory Effect (GWME) in a new and physically appealing scenario - the Time Crystal (TC) condensate of Starobinsky Quadratic Gravity. We have used a Gravitational Wave form, induced in a TC condensate in FLRW spacetime, that is much more general than the idealized and somewhat unphysical Plane Wave spacetimes, that are conventionally used. We have presented new results for non-zero GWME, both in coordinate and in velocity variables. The results are expressed in Cartesian and Brinkmann coordinates. Approximate analytic forms of transverse geodesics in Brinkmann coordinates are provided. Very rough quantitative estimates for GWME are also suggested.</description>

      <title>Quadrupole perturbations of slowly spinning Ellis-Bronnikov wormholes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the axial and polar perturbations of slowly rotating Ellis-Bronnikov wormholes in General Relativity, applying a perturbative double expansion. In particular, we derive the equations for $l=2$, $M_z=2$ perturbations of these objects which are parametrized by an asymmetry parameter. The equations constitute an astrophysically interesting sector of the perturbations that contribute dominantly to the gravitational wave radiation. Moreover, calculation of these modes may exhibit potential instabilities in the quadrupole sector.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of BTZ Black Holes in Bumblebee Gravity with Barrow Entropy with Cavity-Modification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of $(2+1)$ dimensional BTZ black holes in the Einstein bumblebee gravity theory with spontaneous breaking of Lorentz symmetry caused by a nonzero vacuum expectation value of the vector field. We analyse corrections to black hole thermodynamics, including the non extensive Barrow entropy, parametrising quantum gravitational corrections to the Bekenstein Hawking area law. We introduce the York cavity formalism by placing the black hole in a finite isothermal cavity to obtain a properly defined canonical ensemble. Here we arrive at the corrected temperature, free energy, and stability conditions of the BTZ black hole, demonstrating the interplay among the Lorentz violating effects, the Barrow corrections to Entropy, and the boundary conditions within the cavity. Our results indicate that the collective impact of bumblebee dynamics and Barrow entropy significantly alters the phase structure, equilibrium configurations, and thermal stability of BTZ black holes. These findings provide insight into the implications of Lorentz violation and generalised entropy frameworks in lower dimensional quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Double Wick rotations between symmetries of Taub-NUT, near-horizon extreme Kerr, and swirling spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explicitly show that certain 4-dimensional infinitesimal group actions with 3-dimensional orbits are related by double Wick rotations. In particular, starting with the symmetries of the spherical/hyperbolic/planar Taub-NUT spacetimes, one can obtain symmetries of the near-horizon extreme Kerr (NHEK) geometry or swirling universe by complex analytic continuations of coordinates. Similarly, the static spherical/hyperbolic/planar symmetries (i.e., symmetries of the Schwarzschild spacetime and other A-metrics) are mapped to symmetries of the B-metrics (or Melvin spacetime). All these mappings are theory-independent -- they constitute relations among symmetries themselves, and, hence among the classes of symmetry-invariant metrics and electromagnetic field strengths, rather than among specific solutions. Consequently, finding, e.g., vacuum Taub-NUT-type solutions in a given gravitational theory automatically yields vacuum NHEK- or swirling-type solutions of that theory, with a possible extension to the electromagnetic case.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-free inference for gravitational-wave data analysis and public alerts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid and reliable detection and dissemination of source parameter estimation data products from gravitational-wave events, especially sky localization, is critical for maximizing the potential of multi-messenger astronomy. Machine learning based detection and parameter estimation algorithms are emerging as production ready alternatives to traditional approaches. Here, we report validation studies of AMPLFI, a likelihood-free inference solution to low-latency parameter estimation of binary black holes. We use simulated signals added into data from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's (LVK's) third observing run (O3) to compare sky localization performance with BAYESTAR, the algorithm currently in production for rapid sky localization of candidates from matched-filter pipelines. We demonstrate sky localization performance, measured by searched area and volume, to be equivalent with BAYESTAR. We show accurate reconstruction of source parameters with uncertainties for use distributing low-latency coarse-grained chirp mass information. In addition, we analyze several candidate events reported by the LVK in the third gravitational-wave transient catalog (GWTC-3) and show consistency with the LVK's analysis. Altogether, we demonstrate AMPLFI's ability to produce data products for low-latency public alerts.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Fermions in $AdS_2$ Black Hole: Chirality, Entanglement, and Spectral Crossovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider free Dirac fermions on a discretized $AdS_2$ black hole background, and analyze how curved space redshift, horizons, and the spin connection induced chiral gravitational effect shape spectral, transport, and scrambling phenomena. The system is discretized via staggered fermions followed by the Jordan-Wigner transform to encode the model in qubit degrees of freedom, whose Hamiltonian carries site dependent warp factors and bond chirality terms encoding the redshift and spin connection effects. We calculate the ground state and first excited states energies, their local charge profiles, and their half-chain entanglement entropies, showing how redshift and chirality affect the transition from criticality to a gapped regime. Probing operator growth via out-of-time-order correlators, we find that horizons and the chiral coupling accelerate scrambling, yet remain within a non-chaotic regime. Finally, we map out an integrable to ergodic crossover via level-spacing statistics and Brody fits, and introduce on-site disorder to drive a many body localization transition.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Seismic Waveforms: A Deep Learning Approach for Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce \textit{SeismoGPT}, a transformer-based model for forecasting three-component seismic waveforms in the context of future gravitational wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope. The model is trained in an autoregressive setting and can operate on both single-station and array-based inputs. By learning temporal and spatial dependencies directly from waveform data, SeismoGPT captures realistic ground motion patterns and provides accurate short-term forecasts. Our results show that the model performs well within the immediate prediction window and gradually degrades further ahead, as expected in autoregressive systems. This approach lays the groundwork for data-driven seismic forecasting that could support Newtonian noise mitigation and real-time observatory control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to bring gravitational theories into play within the quickly developing framework of factorization algebras. We fit the causal structure of Lorentzian manifolds into categorical language, and in the globally hyperbolic case discover a convenient equivalence of coverages. Then, we show how both perturbative general relativity and perturbative conformal gravity define Batalin-Vilkovisky classical field theories. Finally, we describe how the observables of linearized general relativity define a particularly nice factorization algebra on the category of all globally hyperbolic manifolds and present a few conjectures which arise in specific cases, primarily motivated by the study of black hole entropy as a conserved Noether charge.</description>

      <title>Constraining GREA, an alternative theory accounting for the present cosmic acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the Universe's late-time accelerated expansion remains unknown. The General Relativistic Entropic Acceleration (GREA) theory offers a compelling alternative to $\Lambda$CDM, attributing cosmic acceleration to entropy growth associated with cosmic and black hole horizons, without invoking a cosmological constant. We test GREA against the latest DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), multiple Type Ia supernova compilations (Union3, Pantheon$\texttt{+}$, DES-SN5YR), and cosmic microwave background (CMB) distance measurements. While GREA is not nested within $\Lambda$CDM, it achieves a comparable goodness-of-fit, highlighting its potential as a theoretically motivated framework that circumvents some of the fine-tuning issues of the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that the best-fit model features a transient phantom crossing at $z \lesssim 2$, with $w_a\equiv \mathrm{d} w(a=1)/\mathrm{d}a \simeq-0.3$, in good agreement with observations. However, its present-day value $w_0\equiv w(z=0)$ is tightly constrained to be $w_0\simeq-1$. Upcoming low-redshift (i.e. $z &lt; 1$) cosmological probes, from both background and perturbations, will offer promising avenues for further exploring the viability of the GREA theory.</description>

      <title>Dirac QNM spectrum from twisted semiclassical gauge theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted Abelian gauge theory coupled to a noncommutative (NC) Dirac field is studied in order to infer
  the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum of the fermion matter perturbations in the vicinity of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole. The action functional of the theory is invariant under the truncated NC local $U(1)_{\star}$ gauge transformations that keep the gravitational background intact. The latter, being a classical gravitational background unaffected by the
  NC local gauge transformations, makes the theory semiclassical. The most prominent feature of the QNM spectrum is the splitting in the total angular momentum projection due to the noncommutativity induced $SO(3) \rightarrow U(1)$ symmetry breaking pattern.</description>

      <title>Probing the bubble interior with entanglement entropy and bulk-cone singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the thin wall approximation, we study a class of asymptotically AdS black holes which contain a spherically symmetric vacuum bubble with a different (positive or negative) cosmological constant. Collapsing, expanding, and static bubble solutions are considered. Among these, expanding bubbles with positive cosmological constant can provide a way to apply the AdS/CFT correspondence to describe the physics of an expanding universe. We systematically study the causal structure of the solutions as a function of the cosmological constant, the mass of the black hole, and the tension of the bubble. We then compute the holographic entanglement entropy for a class of boundary subregions using extremal codimension-two surfaces as a probe. For collapsing bubbles, we find examples in which the entanglement entropy also explores the geometry inside the black hole bifurcation surface. As a complementary way to probe the interior of the bubble, we investigate almost-null radial geodesics related to the bulk-cone singularities of boundary two-point correlators. While the bulk-cone singularities for collapsing and expanding bubbles are consistent with thermalization at late time, static bubbles violate thermalization and exhibit properties similar to those of scar states.</description>

      <title>Probing the Topology of the Early Universe using CMB Temperature and Polarization Anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The temperature and polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), as measured today, may offer key insights into the topology of the early universe prior to inflation, for example, by discriminating between flat and warped geometries. In this paper, we focus on a Kaluza-Klein model with an extra spatial dimension that compactifies at the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) epoch, subject to mixed Neumann/Dirichlet boundary conditions at fixed points. As a consequence, a set of infrared cutoffs naturally emerges in both the scalar and tensor spectra, leading to observable consequences in the CMB. We examine in detail the possible signatures of such a topology, particularly in relation to the even-odd parity imbalance already reported by the COBE, WMAP and Planck missions in the temperature angular correlations at large scales. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the existing Planck E-mode polarization data, and to the high-precision B-mode polarization measurements expected from the forthcoming LiteBIRD mission.</description>

      <title>Holographic defect CFTs with Dirichlet end-of-the-world branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a holographic model of defect conformal field theories (DCFTs) with defects of codimension greater than one. Our construction generalizes the AdS/BCFT model by anchoring the end-of-the-world brane on defects at the asymptotic AdS boundary and imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions for the metric on the brane. We compute the defect entropy and defect free energy and show that the defect $\mathcal{C}$-function is always non-negative. We further study holographic defect-localized RG flows triggered by a localized scalar field on the brane and show that the defect $\mathcal{C}$-theorem holds. We also verify that our model reproduces the expected forms of correlation functions in DCFTs.</description>

      <title>Coupled non-canonical scalar field to neutrinos could alleviate the Hubble tension and cross the phantom barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an analysis of cosmological parameters, focusing on resolving the Hubble tension and constraining neutrino masses within a coupled quintom model. By utilizing datasets from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Pantheon + Analysis, Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and CMB Lensing, we explore the interplay between cosmological parameters and observational constraints. The model effectively reduces the Hubble tension, achieving a consistency in $H_0$ measurements of $1.37\sigma$ and $1.24\sigma$ for the CMB + ALL dataset For Planck 2018 and R22 respectively. Additionally, the study refines constraints on the total mass of neutrinos ($\Sigma_{m_{\nu}}$), with a finding of $0.115\,\text{eV}$ for the CMB + ALL dataset. The analysis examines the effective equation of state parameter ($w_{\text{eff}}$), indicating a transition towards a universe dominated by exotic energy forms. The combined datasets refine $w_{\text{eff}}$ to $-1.02\pm0.018$, underscoring the importance of multi-dataset integration in understanding dark energy dynamics. Furthermore, the interaction constant $\beta$ between the quintom scalar field and neutrinos is constrained to $0.65 \pm 0.12$ for the CMB + ALL dataset. The potential parameters $\lambda_{\sigma} = -2.09 \pm 0.082$ and $\lambda_{\phi} = 2.43 \pm 0.12$ are also determined, providing insights into the quintom model's implications for cosmological dynamics. This study offers compelling evidence for the coupled quintom model's capability to resolve the Hubble tension and refine constraints on neutrino properties, enhancing our understanding of the universe's evolution.</description>

      <title>The double copy as a doppelg\"{a}nger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double copy relates scattering amplitudes and classical solutions in non-abelian gauge theories and gravity. As such, it is usually expressed in the conventional second-order formalisms in both theories corresponding to standard Yang-Mills theory, and the Einstein--Hilbert action in General Relativity. In this paper, we instead consider alternative formulations of gravity, which are known to terminate at finite order in the coupling at Lagrangian level. We focus in particular on the Chern--Simons--Witten (CSW) formulation in 2+1 dimensions, and argue that the double copy then becomes a doppelg\"{a}nger relationship between gauge theory and gravity, allowing straightforward replacement of generators and structure constants in both theories. We show how explicit (multiple) static point-source solutions can be mapped in the two approaches, and use the CSW formalism to examine when double copies are expected to be possible, and when not. In addition, we present an explicit double copy between the Wong equations for colour charges, and the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations for spinning particles, that extends also to higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harmonizing classical and quantum worlds is a major challenge for modern physics. A significant portion of the scientific community supports the notion that classical mechanics is an effective theory that arises from quantum mechanics. Recently, the present authors have argued that this should not be the case, as quantum mechanics is not trustworthy for describing the center of mass of systems with masses $m$ much larger than the Planck mass $M_\text{P}$. In this vein, a simple gravitational self-decoherence model was proposed, describing how the center of mass of quantum systems would classicalize for $m \sim M_\text{P}$. Here, we show that our model does not prevent macroscopic systems (with classical centers of mass) from harboring quantum internal vibrations (as has been observed in the laboratory).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the use of linear Paul traps as quantum sensors for detecting megahertz gravitational waves. Single-ion configurations exploit graviton-photon conversion in the presence of external magnetic fields, while two-ion systems use relative-motion excitations, which do not require magnets, to distinguish gravitational waves from axion dark matter. Furthermore, we show that entanglement of $N$ vibrational qubits enhances the signal probability by a factor of $N^2$, improving sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit.</description>

      <title>Swift Memory Burden in Merging Black Holes: how information load affects black hole's classical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we argue that the information load carried by a black hole affects its classical perturbations. We refer to this phenomenon as the ``swift memory burden effect" and show that it is universal for objects of high efficiency of information storage. The effect is expected to have observable manifestations, for example, in mergers of astrophysical black holes in Einstein gravity. The black holes with different information loads, although degenerate in the ground state, respond very differently to perturbations. The strength of the imprint is controlled by the memory burden parameter which measures the fraction of the black hole's memory space occupied by the information load. This represents a new macroscopic quantum characteristics of a black hole. We develop a calculable theoretical framework and derive some master formulas which we then test on explicit models of black holes as well as on solitons of high capacity of information storage. We show that the effect must be significant for the spectroscopy of both astrophysical and primordial black holes and can be potentially probed in gravitational wave experiments. We also provide a proposal for the test of the memory burden phenomenon in a table-top laboratory setting with cold bosons.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Polarimetry II: The Connection Between Spin and Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study synchrotron polarization in spatially resolved horizon-scale images, such as those produced by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). In both general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations as well as simplified models of the black hole magnetosphere, the polarization angle, quantified by the complex observable arg(beta_2), depends strongly and systematically on the black hole spin. This relationship arises from the coupling between spin and the structure of the magnetic field in the emission region, and it can be computed analytically in the force-free limit. To explore this connection further, we develop a semi-analytic inflow framework that solves the time stationary axisymmetric equations of GRMHD in the black hole's equatorial plane; this model can interpolate between the force-free and inertial regimes by varying the magnetization of the inflow. Our model demonstrates how finite inertia modifies the structure of the electromagnetic field and can be used to quantitatively predict the observed polarization pattern. By comparing reduced models, GRMHD simulations, and analytic limits, we show that the observed synchrotron polarization can serve as a robust diagnostic of spin under assumptions about Faraday rotation and the emission geometry. Applied to EHT data, the model disfavors high-spin configurations for both M87* and Sgr A*, highlighting the potential of polarimetric imaging as a probe of both black hole spin and near-horizon plasma physics.</description>

Abstract: If we look from a quantum perspective, the most natural way in which the universe can be created is in entangled pairs whose time flow is oppositely related. This suggests the idea of the creation of a universe-antiuniverse pair. Assuming the validity of this hypothesis, in this paper, we show that the universe expands in an accelerated manner. The same reasoning holds for the anti-universe as well. This idea does not require any form of dark energy as used in the standard cosmological model of ${\Lambda}$CDM or in the modified theories of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07011v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A regular black hole, unconstrained by the weak cosmic censorship conjecture, can exceed its critical spin limit and transition into a superspinar. In this paper, we investigate the observational appearance of a rotating regular black hole, specifically the Ghosh black hole and its superspinar counterpart, when surrounded by a thin accretion disk. The resulting images reveal distinct features: the black hole closely resembles its Kerr counterpart with slight deviations, while the superspinar configuration exhibits an inner photon ring structure. Furthermore, we investigate the image transition of the Ghosh black hole that has recently been destroyed by a collapsing null shell carrying a specific angular momentum. The results indicate that, apart from a possible sudden burst of light, the inner photon ring undergoes gradual transitions over time, with the transition times depending on the additional angular momentum gained by the black hole. Our findings also suggest that the transition timescale becomes significant for supermassive black holes, with masses at least less than about twice that of M87*.</description>

Abstract: We construct a correspondence between the quantized constrained 3BF theory and the quantized Einstein-Cartan theory with contact spin-spin interaction, both of which describe the Standard Model coupled to Einstein-Cartan gravitational field. First we introduce the expectation values of observables using the path integral formalism for both theories, and then by integrating out some configuration space variables in the quantum 3BF theory we obtain the definition of the corresponding observable in the quantum Einstein-Cartan theory with contact interaction. The correspondence is a rather general result, since it can be established without actually performing the detailed quantization of either theory. Finally, we discuss the differences in the predictions of the two theories on the example of the 4-volume density of spacetime, and on the example of gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Dirac Oscillator for Spin-1/2 Particles in a Spinning Cosmic String Spacetime with Spacelike Disclination and Dislocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Dirac oscillator for spin-1/2 particles in a spacetime containing a spinning cosmic string endowed with both curvature (disclination) and torsion (screw dislocation). The background geometry includes off-diagonal and is analyzed through a local tetrad formalism. Working in cylindrical coordinates, we derive the covariant Dirac equation and solve it exactly via a second-order differential equation for the lower spinor component. Three distinct physical configurations are examined: (i) balanced torsion where temporal and spatial contributions are equal, (ii) purely temporal torsion (spinning string), and (iii) purely spatial torsion (screw dislocation). In all cases, we obtain exact energy spectra expressed in terms of effective angular quantum numbers that depend on the oscillator frequency, the angular deficit parameter \alpha , the torsional parameters J_{t} and J_{z}, and the longitudinal momentum k. The resulting energy levels generalize the flat-spacetime Moshinsky oscillator spectrum by incorporating energy- and momentum-dependent shifts due to the background geometry. We show that curvature and torsion lift degeneracies and induce nontrivial modifications to the angular structure of the solutions. The flat-space spectrum is recovered as a special limit when both curvature and torsion vanish. This work provides a fully solvable model that illustrates how spacetime defects affect relativistic quantum systems, offering insights relevant to both high-energy physics and condensed-matter analogs.</description>

      <title>Attention U-Net for all-sky continuous gravitational wave searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting continuous gravitational waves is challenging due to the high computational cost of template-based searches across large parameter spaces, particularly for all-sky searches. Machine learning offers a promising solution to perform these searches with reasonable computational resources. In this study, we trained an attention U-Net, a convolutional neural network, on $\approx$ 10.67 days of simulated data with Gaussian noise for all-sky searches at different frequencies within the 20-1000 Hz band. Our model trained at 20 Hz achieves the best sensitivity, with a 90% detection efficiency sensitivity depth $D^{90\%} = 29.97 \pm 0.24\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ with a 1% false alarm rate per 50 mHz, while the model trained on the entire 20-1000 Hz band yields $D^{90\%} = 18.63 \pm 0.24\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. The sensitivities achieved are comparable to state-of-the-art results using deep learning approaches, with less than 50% of the training time and data. We find that sensitivity scales as $T^{0.28 \pm 0.01}$ with total observation time for the attention U-Net trained at 20 Hz, similar to semi-coherent search methods. The neural network demonstrates robustness on datasets with time gaps, with sensitivity dependence on duty factor analyzed. We also investigated the sensitivity dependence of the trained attention U-Net models on sky location. Our findings show that attention U-Net is a scalable and effective approach for all-sky continuous gravitational wave searches.</description>

      <title>Regression of Suspension Violin Modes in KAGRA O3GK Data with Kalman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suspension thermal modes in interferometric gravitational-wave detectors produce narrow, high-Q spectral lines that can contaminate gravitational searches and bias parameter estimation. In KAGRA, cryogenic mirrors are held by thick suspension fibers, designed to sustain such low-temperature environment, which may further affects inharmonicity modes, fiber dimensions, and mechanical behavior compared to typical interferometers. Remaining a prominent source of narrowband contamination, we implement a Kalman filter to model and track violin lines, building on the methodology introduced in [1], and apply subtraction to KAGRA O3GK data. Using gravitational-wave template injections, we validate that the subtraction preserves matched-filter SNR while effectively suppressing line power. Comparisons of power spectral densities and residual analyses confirm that the method removes deterministic line contributions without introducing waveform distortions. This approach provides a cleaner strain channel for searches and parameter estimation and will become increasingly important for future low-temperature detectors with higher-Q suspensions, such as the Einstein Telescope.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Logarithmic Correction to Five Dimensional BPS Black Hole Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00038v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute logarithmic correction to five dimensional BPS black hole entropy using finite temperature black hole geometry and find perfect agreement with the microscopic results and macroscopic computations based on zero temperature near horizon geometry. We also reproduce the Bekenstein-Hawking term for zero temperature black hole entropy from the corresponding term for finite temperature black hole.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the emission of gravitational waves produced by the magnetosphere of magnetars. We argue that several features in the spectrum could facilitate the identification of that source. In addition, in cases of extremely large magnetic fields we demonstrate that this emission can make the braking index of such stars to be well over 3, which is the standard prediction of the magnetic dipole radiation and aligned rotator mechanisms. A similar picture arises if one focuses on the second braking index. Moreover the braking index depends on both the rotational frequency and the strength of the magnetic field in striking difference from the other mechanisms. We also show that gravitational waves can be produced by polar gap regions due to their rapid charge-discharge process that takes place in timescales from nanosec to microsec. This can provide an alternative way to probe magnetars and test the polar gap model.</description>

      <title>Outer Solar System spacecraft to probe the $\mu$Hz gravitational wave frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15072v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The microhertz frequency band of gravitational waves probes the merger of supermassive black holes as well as many other gravitational wave phenomena. However, space-interferometry methods that use test masses would require further development of test-mass isolation systems to detect anticipated astrophysical events. We propose an approach that avoids onboard inertial test masses by situating spacecraft in the low-acceleration environment of the outer Solar System. We show that for Earth-spacecraft and inter-spacecraft distances of $\gtrsim 10$ AU, the accelerations on the spacecraft would be sufficiently small to potentially achieve gravitational wave sensitivities determined by stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds. We further argue, for arm lengths of $10-30$ AU and $\sim 10$ Watt transmissions, that stable phase locks could be achieved with 20 cm mirrors or 5 m radio dishes. We discuss designs that send both laser beams and radio waves between the spacecraft, finding that, despite the $\sim10^4\times$ longer wavelengths, even a design with radio transmissions could reach stochastic background-limited sensitivities at $\lesssim 0.3\times 10^{-4}$ Hz. Operating in the radio significantly reduces many spacecraft design tolerances. Our baseline concepts require two arms to do interferometry. However, if one spacecraft carries a clock with Allan deviations at $10^4$ seconds of $10^{-17}$, a comparable sensitivity could be achieved with a single arm. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of achieving similar gravitational wave sensitivities in a `Doppler tracking' configuration where the single arm is anchored to Earth.</description>

      <title>Induced Gravitational Waves as Cosmic Tracers of Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that induced gravitational waves (IGWs) can naturally emerge within the framework of thermal leptogenesis models, thereby providing a robust probe for exploring this theory at remarkably high energy scales. To illustrate this principle, we put forth a basic leptogenesis model in which an early matter-dominated phase, tracing the leptogenesis scale, enhances the generation of gravitational waves induced by an early structure formation. Leveraging recent N-body and lattice simulation results for IGW computations in the non-linear regime, we show that it is possible to establish a direct link between the frequency and amplitude of these IGWs and the thermal leptogenesis scale.</description>

      <title>Resolving Individual Signals in the Presence of Stochastic Background in Future Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) observations have reported evidence of a gravitational wave background (GWB). If supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are indeed the primary source of this signal, future PTA observations, such as those from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), are expected to simultaneously capture multiple continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) emitted by bright individual SMBH binaries alongside a gravitational wave background (GWB). To address this anticipated scenario in the SKA era, we revisit the F-statistic, a detection method for single source signals in PTA datasets, and introduce a new modeling that accounts for unresolved GWs as a stochastic GWB. Here, we applied this improved F-statistic to the mock datasets that include both CGW and GWB and evaluated how accurately F-statistic can identify the parameters of CGW. As a result, we demonstrate that our approach can successfully improve the estimation of the sky position and the amplitude of CGW, particularly when the GWB is dominant over white noise. This work serves as an initial step toward developing an efficient and robust algorithm based on the F-statistic for future PTA observations.</description>

      <title>Power law $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider a generalization of Starobinsky inflation obtained by combining power law ($R^\beta$), and $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation ($E$-model). The Einstein frame potential for this model is that of power law Starobinsky inflation modified by a parameter $\alpha$ in the exponential. After computing power spectra for scalar and tensor perturbations numerically, we perform MCMC analysis to put constraints on the potential parameter $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $M$, and the number of e-foldings $N_{pivot}$ during inflation, using Planck-2018, BICEP/Keck (BK18) and other LSS observations. We find $\log_{10}\alpha= 0.37^{+0.82}_{-0.85}$, $\beta = 1.969^{+0.020}_{-0.023}$, $M=\left(3.54^{+2.62}_{-1.73}\right)\times 10^{-5}$ and $N_{pivot} = 47\pm{10}$. With these mean values of the potential parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, and varying $N_{pivot}$ between $40$ to $55$, we also find that the $r-n_s$ predictions of our model lie well within the $1\sigma$ bounds of joint constraints from combined analysis of ACT, Planck-2018, BICEP and BAO observations. We compute the Bayesian evidences for our proposed model, power law Starobinsky inflation, $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation and Starobinsky inflation. Considering the Starobinsky model as the base model, we calculate the Bayes factor and find that our proposed model is preferred by the CMB and LSS observations.</description>

      <title>Notes on Rindler wave packets in Minkowski spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20078v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider wave packets of a massless scalar field that have well-localized Rindler energy, and examine how their energy appears to a Minkowski observer to study how the classical gravitational red-shift formula is modified quantum mechanically. We derive, by using the saddle point approximation, an analytic expression for the Minkowski momentum distribution of such Rindler wave packets. We find a universal lower bound on the uncertainty in the Minkowski momentum; the momentum distribution can never become arbitrarily sharp.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic recoil and the Unruh effect at CERN-NA63</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript we examine the high energy channeling radiation data sets from the CERN-NA63 experiment using ultra relativistic synchrotron emission. To incorporate recoil, we examine the standard quasi-classical formalism as well as develop a formalism which includes the Unruh effect by utilizing a hyperbolic recoil acceleration, based on conservation of momentum, in the classical synchrotron trajectory. We also perform an asymptotic radiation time scale analysis which predicts a photon energy threshold, beyond which the Unruh effect dominates. We then compare the classical, quasi-classical, and Unruh synchrotron theories to the data. We find that above threshold, the Unruh effect saturates the spectrum of all data sets.</description>

      <title>CWT-LSTM Autoencoder: A Novel Approach for Gravitational Wave Detection in LIGO Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10505v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave detection requires sophisticated signal processing to identify weak astrophysical signals buried in instrumental noise. Traditional matched filtering approaches face computational challenges with diverse signal morphologies and non-stationary noise. This work presents a deep learning methodology integrating Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) preprocessing with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder architecture for gravitational wave detection. The CWT provides optimal time-frequency decomposition capturing chirp evolution and transient characteristics essential for compact binary coalescence identification. We first develop the model using synthetic datasets incorporating binary black hole merger signals with masses ranging from 10 to 80 solar masses. These signals are then embedded in colored Gaussian noise representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity. The trained model demonstrates strong performance metrics. We then apply the CWT-LSTM model to gravitational wave data from multiple LIGO observing runs. We use 418 clean noise samples for training the anomaly detection model, while the test dataset contained a mix of 24 confirmed gravitational wave events and 161 noise samples. The model demonstrates strong performance with an AUC of 0.979 and Average Precision (AP) of 0.932, achieving a precision of 1.0 at the optimal threshold with a recall of 0.83. The reconstruction error distribution shows clear separation between noise and gravitational wave signals, with noise samples clustering around 0.45 and signals around 0.65. This unsupervised approach enables discovery of signals with unknown morphologies that could provide complementary "blind search" capability for detecting exotic astrophysical sources and novel physics beyond current theoretical models.</description>
