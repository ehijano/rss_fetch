      <title>Mysterious Triality and the Exceptional Symmetry of Loop Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work, we introduced Mysterious Triality, extending the Mysterious Duality of Iqbal, Neitzke, and Vafa between physics and algebraic geometry to include algebraic topology in the form of rational homotopy theory. Starting with the rational Sullivan minimal model of the 4-sphere $S^4$, capturing the dynamics of M-theory via Hypothesis H, this progresses to the dimensional reduction of M-theory on torus $T^k$, $k \ge 1$, with its dynamics described via the iterated cyclic loop space $\mathcal{L}_c^k S^4$ of the 4-sphere. From this, we also extracted data corresponding to the maximal torus/Cartan subalgebra and the Weyl group of the exceptional Lie group/algebra of type $E_k$.
  In this paper, we discover much richer symmetry by extending the data of the Cartan subalgebra to a maximal parabolic subalgebra $\mathfrak{p}_k^{k(k)}$ of the split real form $\mathfrak{e}_{k(k)}$ of the exceptional Lie algebra of type $E_k$ by exhibiting an action, in rational homotopy category, of $\mathfrak{p}_k^{k(k)}$ on the slightly more symmetric than $\mathcal{L}_c^k S^4$ toroidification $\mathcal{T}^k S^4$. This action universally represents symmetries of the equations of motion of supergravity in the reduction of M-theory to $11-k$ dimensions.
  Along the way, we identify the minimal model of the toroidification $\mathcal{T}^k S^4$, generalizing the results of Vigu\'{e}-Poirrier, Sullivan, and Burghelea, and establish an algebraic toroidification/totalization adjunction.</description>

      <title>Gromov--Hausdorff Distance for Directed Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gromov--Hausdorff distance measures the similarity between two metric spaces by isometrically embedding them into an ambient metric space. In this work, we introduce an analogue of this distance for metric spaces endowed with directed structures. The directed Gromov--Hausdorff distance measures the distance between two new (extended) metric spaces, where the new metric, on the same underlying space, is induced from the length of the zigzag paths. This distance is then computed by isometrically embedding the directed spaces, endowed with the zigzag metric, into an ambient directed space with respect to such zigzag distance. Analogously to the standard Gromov--Hausdorff distance, we propose alternative definitions based on the distortion of d-maps and d-correspondences. Unlike the classical case, these directed distances are not equivalent.</description>

      <title>Mayer-homology learning prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence-assisted drug design is revolutionizing the pharmaceutical industry. Effective molecular features are crucial for accurate machine learning predictions, and advanced mathematics plays a key role in designing these features. Persistent homology theory, which equips topological invariants with persistence, provides valuable insights into molecular structures. The calculation of Betti numbers is based on differential that typically satisfy \(d^2 = 0\). Our recent work has extended this concept by employing Mayer homology with a generalized differential that satisfies \(d^N = 0\) for \(N \geq 2\), leading to the development of persistent Mayer homology (PMH) theory and richer topological information across various scales. In this study, we utilize PMH to create a novel multiscale topological vectorization for molecular representation, offering valuable tools for descriptive and predictive analysis in molecular data and machine learning prediction. Specifically, benchmark tests on established protein-ligand datasets, including PDBbind-2007, PDBbind-2013, and PDBbind-2016, demonstrate the superior performance of our Mayer homology models in predicting protein-ligand binding affinities.</description>

      <title>A Topological Gaussian Mixture Model for Bone Marrow Morphology in Leukaemia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a type of blood and bone marrow cancer characterized by the proliferation of abnormal clonal haematopoietic cells in the bone marrow leading to bone marrow failure. Over the course of the disease, angiogenic factors released by leukaemic cells drastically alter the bone marrow vascular niches resulting in observable structural abnormalities. We use a technique from topological data analysis - persistent homology - to quantify the images and infer on the disease through the imaged morphological features. We find that persistent homology uncovers succinct dissimilarities between the control, early, and late stages of AML development. We then integrate persistent homology into stage-dependent Gaussian mixture models for the first time, proposing a new class of models which are applicable to persistent homology summaries and able to both infer patterns in morphological changes between different stages of progression as well as provide a basis for prediction.</description>

      <title>Topological filtering of a signal over a network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Signal Processing deals with the problem of analyzing and processing signals defined on graphs. In this paper, we introduce a novel filtering method for graph-based signals by employing ideas from topological data analysis. We begin by working with signals over general graphs and then extend our approach to what we term signals over graphs with faces. To construct the filter, we introduce a new structure called the Basin Hierarchy Tree, which encodes the persistent homology. We provide an efficient algorithm and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through examples with synthetic and real datasets. This work bridges topological data analysis and signal processing, presenting a new application of persistent homology as a topological data processing tool.</description>

Abstract: In Terao [24], Hiroaki Terao defined and studied "admissible map", which is a generalization of "social welfare function" in the context of hyperplane arrangements. Using this, he proved a generalized Arrow's Impossibility Theorem using combinatorial arguments. This paper provides another proof of this generalized Arrow's Impossibility Theorem, using the idea of algebraic topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the concept of star clusters in simplicial complexes, which was introduced by Barmak in 2013, by relating it with the structure of hypergraphs that correspond to the simplicial complexes. This implies that for a hypergraph $H$ with a vertex $v$ that is not isolated and not contained in an induced Berge cycle of length $3$, there exists a hypergraph $H'$ with fewer vertices than $H$ such that the independence complex of $H$ is homotopy equivalent to the suspension of the independence complex of $H'$. As an application, we also prove that if a hypergraph has no Berge cycle of length $0$ mod $3$, then the sum of all reduced Betti numbers of its independence complex is at most $1$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study double $\infty$-categories of double functors. To this end, we exhibit the cartesian closed structure of the $\infty$-category of double $\infty$-categories and various localizations. We prove a theorem that characterizes the companions and conjoints in functor double $\infty$-categories via the notion of companionable and conjointable 2-cells in double $\infty$-categories. Moreover, we show that under suitable conditions, functor double $\infty$-categories are horizontally closed. Throughout the paper, we highlight a few applications to $(\infty,2)$-category theory and indexed exponentiability.</description>

      <title>Complex analogues of the Tverberg--Vre\'cica conjecture and central transversal theorems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tverberg--Vre\'cica conjecture is a broad generalization of Tverberg's classical theorem. One of its consequences, the central transversal theorem, extends both the centerpoint theorem and the ham sandwich theorem. In this manuscript, we establish complex analogues of these results where the corresponding transversals are complex affine spaces. The proof of the complex Tverberg--Vre\'cica conjecture for powers of the same prime relies on the non-vanishing of an equivariant Euler class. Additionally, we obtain new Borsuk--Ulam-type theorems on complex Stiefel manifolds, which are interesting on their own. These theorems yield complex analogues of recent extensions of the ham sandwich theorem for mass assignments by Axelrod-Freed and Sober\'on, and provide a direct proof of the complex central transversal theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1903.04114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A polyhedral product is a natural subspace of a Cartesian product that is specified by a simplicial complex. The modern formalism arose as a generalization of the spaces known as moment-angle complexes which were developed within the nascent subject of toric topology. This field, which began as a topological approach to toric geometry and aspects of symplectic geometry, has expanded rapidly in recent years. The investigation of polyhedral products and their homotopy theoretic properties has developed to the point where they are studied in various fields of mathematics far removed from their origin. In this survey, we provide a brief historical overview of the development of this subject, summarize many of the main results and describe applications.</description>

Abstract: We solve the higher version of Hilbert's Third Problem for one-dimensional geometries, and in higher dimensions we reduce the problem to a computation in group homology. Our central result concerns the scissors congruence $K$-theory spectrum of Zakharevich, whose homotopy groups are the correct higher version of the classical scissors congruence groups. We prove that this spectrum is a Thom spectrum, whose base space is the homotopy orbit space of a Tits complex. The relevant computations quickly follow from this more foundational result.</description>

      <title>Convex Equipartitions inspired by the little cubes operad</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A decade ago two groups of authors, Karasev, Hubard and Aronov, and Blagojevi\'c and Ziegler, have shown that the regular convex partitions of a Euclidean space into $n$ parts yield a solution to the generalised Nandakumar and Ramana-Rao conjecture when $n$ is a prime power. This was obtained by parametrising the space of regular equipartitions of a given convex body with the classical configuration space.
  Now, we repeat the process of regular convex equipartitions many times, first partitioning the Euclidean space into $n_1$ parts, then each part into $n_2$ parts, and so on. In this way we obtain iterated convex equipartions of a given convex body into $n=n_1...n_k$ parts. Such iterated partitions are parametrised by the (wreath) product of classical configuration spaces. We develop a new configuration space -- test map scheme for solving the generalised Nandakumar \&amp; Ramana-Rao conjecture using the Hausdorff metric on the space of iterated convex equipartions.
  The new scheme yields a solution to the conjecture if and only if all the $n_i$'s are powers of the same prime. In particular, for the failure of the scheme outside prime power case we give three different proofs.</description>

Abstract: Write $P_k:= \mathbb F_2[x_1,x_2,\ldots ,x_k]$ for the polynomial algebra over the prime field $\mathbb F_2$ with two elements, in $k$ generators $x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_k$, each of degree 1. The polynomial algebra $P_k$ is considered as a module over the mod-2 Steenrod algebra, $\mathcal A$. Let $GL_k$ be the general linear group over the field $\mathbb F_2$. This group acts naturally on $P_k$ by matrix substitution. Since the two actions of $\mathcal A$ and $GL_k$ upon $P_k$ commute with each other, there is an inherit action of $GL_k$ on $\mathbb F_2{\otimes}_{\mathcal A}P_k$. Denote by $(\mathbb F_2{\otimes}_{\mathcal A}P_k)_n^{GL_k}$ the subspace of $\mathbb F_2{\otimes}_{\mathcal A}P_k$ consisting of all the $GL_k$-invariant classes of degree $n$. In 1989, Singer [24] defined the homological algebraic transfer $$\varphi_k :\mbox{Tor}^{\mathcal A}_{k,k+n}(\mathbb F_2,\mathbb F_2) \longrightarrow (\mathbb F_2{\otimes}_{\mathcal A}P_k)_n^{GL_k},$$ where $\mbox{Tor}^{\mathcal{A}}_{k, k+n}(\mathbb{F}_2, \mathbb{F}_2)$ is the dual of Ext$_{\mathcal{A}}^{k,k+n}(\mathbb F_2,\mathbb F_2)$, the $E_2$ term of the Adams spectral sequence of spheres. In general, the transfer $\varphi_k$ is not a monomorphism and Singer made a conjecture that $\varphi_k$ is an epimorphism for any $k \geqslant 0$. The conjecture is studied by many authors. It is true for $k \leqslant 3$ but unknown for $k \geqslant 4$. In this paper, by using a technique of the Peterson hit problem we prove that Singer's conjecture is not true for $k=5$ and the internal degree $n = 108$. This result also refutes a one of Ph\'uc in [19].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2003.04217v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and study a motivic lift of a spectral sequence associated to a stratified scheme, recently discovered by Petersen in the context of mixed Hodge theory and $\ell$-adic Galois representations. The original spectral sequence expresses the compactly supported cohomology of an open stratum in terms of the compactly supported cohomology of the closures of strata and the combinatorics of the poset underlying the stratification. Some of its special cases are classical tools in the study of arrangements of subvarieties and configuration spaces. Our motivic lift lives in the triangulated category of \'{e}tale motives and takes the shape of a Postnikov system. We describe its connecting morphisms and study some of its functoriality properties.</description>

      <title>Topological Structures of Large Scale Interacting Systems via Uniform Functions and Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.04699v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the topological structure of large scale interacting systems on infinite graphs, by constructing a suitable cohomology which we call the uniform cohomology. The central idea for the construction is the introduction of a class of functions called uniform functions. Uniform cohomology provides a new perspective for the identification of macroscopic observables from the microscopic system. As a straightforward application of our theory when the underlying graph has a free action of a group, we prove a certain decomposition theorem for shift-invariant closed uniform forms. This result is a uniform version in a very general setting of the decomposition result for shift-invariant closed $L^2$-forms originally proposed by Varadhan, which has repeatedly played a key role in the proof of the hydrodynamic limits of nongradient large scale interacting systems. In a subsequent article, we use this result as a key to prove Varadhan's decomposition theorem for a general class of large scale interacting systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of proarrow equipments to the $\infty$-categorical setting, termed $\infty$-equipments. These equipments take the form of particular double $\infty$-categories that support a notion of internal formal higher category theory. We will explore several examples of $\infty$-equipments. In particular, we will study the prototypical example given by the $\infty$-equipment of $\infty$-categories, and construct $\infty$-equipments of $\infty$-categories internal to general $\infty$-toposes as well. The final objective of this article is to study the fundamental notions of formal higher category theory within an arbitrary $\infty$-equipment. To this end, we not only follow the classical approach but also expand upon it.</description>

      <title>Quantitative upper bounds on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between two metric spaces measures how far the spaces are from being isometric. It has played an important and longstanding role in geometry and shape comparison. More recently, it has been discovered that the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between unit spheres equipped with the geodesic metric has important connections to Borsuk-Ulam theorems and Vietoris-Rips complexes.
  We develop a discrete framework for obtaining upper bounds on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between spheres, and provide the first quantitative bounds that apply to spheres of all possible pairs of dimensions. As a special case, we determine the exact Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the circle and any higher-dimensional sphere, and determine the precise asymptotic behavior of the distance from the 2-sphere to the $k$-sphere up to constants.</description>

      <title>Epimorphisms and Acyclic Types in Univalent Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the epimorphisms in homotopy type theory (HoTT) as the fiberwise acyclic maps and develop a type-theoretic treatment of acyclic maps and types in the context of synthetic homotopy theory as developed in univalent foundations. We present examples and applications in group theory, such as the acyclicity of the Higman group, through the identification of groups with 0-connected, pointed 1-types. Many of our results are formalized as part of the agda-unimath library.</description>

      <title>Obstruction theory for the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-index of $4$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a complete obstruction theory for the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-index of a compact connected 4-dimensional manifold with free involution. This $\mathbb{Z}_2$-index, equal to the minimum integer $n$ for which there exists an equivariant map with target the $n$-sphere with antipodal involution, is computed in two steps using cohomology with twisted coefficients. The key ingredient is a spectral sequence computing twisted cohomology of the orbit space of a free involution on odd complex projective spaces. We illustrate the main results with various examples including computation of the secondary obstruction.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Persistent Homology: a Fisher Forecast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persistent homology naturally addresses the multi-scale topological characteristics of the large-scale structure as a distribution of clusters, loops, and voids. We apply this tool to the dark matter halo catalogs from the Quijote simulations, and build a summary statistic for comparison with the joint power spectrum and bispectrum statistic regarding their information content on cosmological parameters and primordial non-Gaussianity. Through a Fisher analysis, we find that constraints from persistent homology are tighter for 8 out of the 10 parameters by margins of 13-50%. The complementarity of the two statistics breaks parameter degeneracies, allowing for a further gain in constraining power when combined. We run a series of consistency checks to consolidate our results, and conclude that our findings motivate incorporating persistent homology into inference pipelines for cosmological survey data.</description>

      <title>Equivariant $K$-theory of cellular toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14201v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we describe the $T_{comp}$-equivariant topological $K$-ring of a $T$-{\it cellular} complete toric variety. We further show that $K_{T_{comp}}^0(X)$ is isomorphic as an $R(T_{comp})$-algebra to the ring of piecewise Laurent polynomial functions on the associated fan denoted $PLP(\Delta)$. Furthermore, we compute a basis for $K_{T_{comp}}^0(X)$ as a $R(T_{comp})$-module and multiplicative structure constants with respect to this basis.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries of Non-Supersymmetric Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine generalized symmetries for 4D theories engineered via type II strings on non-supersymmetric orbifold backgrounds $\mathbb{R}^{3,1} \times \mathbb{R}^6 / \Gamma$. Probe branes detect generalized symmetries via the adjacency matrix for fermionic degrees of freedom in an associated quiver gauge theory. In situations where the tachyons are sequestered away from the boundary $S^5 / \Gamma$, this exactly matches the result extracted from singular homology. In situations with an unsequestered tachyon which stretches out to the boundary, the presence of tachyonic pulses partitions up the space into several distinct sectors, and the net contribution again matches with the answer expected via quiver methods. For IIA backgrounds, the presence of a localized closed string tachyon leads to transitions in the spectrum of states, generalized symmetries, higher-group symmetries, as well as the level matrix of the associated symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). For IIB backgrounds with a stack of spacetime filling probe D3-branes, the onset of a radiatively generated potential leads to similar considerations involving scale dependent transitions in the symmetries of the theory, including structures such as duality defects / interfaces.</description>

      <title>Scissors automorphism groups and their homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In any category with a reasonable notion of cover, each object has a group of scissors automorphisms. We prove that under mild conditions, the homology of this group is independent of the object, and can be expressed in terms of the scissors congruence K-theory spectrum defined by Zakharevich. We therefore obtain both a group-theoretic interpretation of Zakharevich's higher scissors congruence K-theory, as well as a method to compute the homology of scissors automorphism groups. We apply this to various families of groups, such as interval exchange groups and Brin--Thompson groups, recovering results of Szymik--Wahl, Li, and Tanner, and obtaining new results as well.</description>
