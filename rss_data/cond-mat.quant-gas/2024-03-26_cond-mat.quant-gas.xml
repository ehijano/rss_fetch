      <title>Vortex nucleations in spinor Bose condensates under localized synthetic magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge fields are ubiquitous in modern quantum physics. In superfluids, quantized vortices can be induced by gauge fields. Here we demonstrate the first experimental observation of vortex nucleations in spinor Bose-Einstein Condensates under radially-localized synthetic magnetic fields. The associated gauge potentials $\vec{A}$ are azimuthal and created by light-induced spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling, generating circulating azimuthal velocity fields $\propto \vec{p}-\vec{A}$ even when the canonical momentum $\vec{p}= 0$. A sufficiently large azimuthal velocity peaked near the condensate center results in a dynamically unstable localized excitation that initiates vortex nucleations. This excitation appears as a spontaneously-formed vortex-antivortex pair near the cloud center. Following the initially developed instability, the dynamics is governed by the asymmetry and dissipation, where the atomic orbital angular momentum evolves and can reach the value of the ground state. Our system exhibits dynamical and Landau instabilities and agrees reasonably with time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii simulations.</description>

      <title>Universal entropy transport far from equilibrium across the BCS-BEC crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport properties of strongly interacting fermionic systems can reveal exotic states of matter, but experiments and theory have predominantly focused on bulk systems in the hydrodynamic limit describable with linear response coefficients such as electrical and thermal conductivity. In a ballistic channel connecting two superfluid reservoirs, recent experiments revealed a far-from-equilibrium regime beyond linear hydrodynamics where particle and entropy currents respond nonlinearly to biases of chemical potential and temperature, and their ratio is robust to the channel geometry. However, the origin of this robustness and its relation to the strong interparticle interactions remain unknown. Here, we study the coupled transport of particles and entropy tuning the interaction across the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer to Bose-Einstein condensate (BCS-BEC) crossover, the reservoir degeneracy across the superfluid phase transition, as well as the local potentials and confinement of the channel. Surprisingly, the entropy advectively transported per particle depends only on the interactions and reservoir degeneracy and not on the details of the channel, suggesting that this property has its origin in the universal equilibrium properties of the reservoirs. In contrast, the magnitudes of the advective and diffusive entropy currents vary significantly with the channel details. The advective current increases monotonically towards the BEC side, which can be largely explained by the estimated superfluid gap in the channel. The Wiedemann-Franz law that links the advective and diffusive currents in Fermi liquids is most egregiously violated at unitarity, suggesting a change in the nature of the excitations responsible for entropy diffusion near unitarity. These observations pose fundamental questions regarding transport phenomena in strongly interacting Fermi systems far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Quasiprobabilities in quantum thermodynamics and many-body systems: A tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiprobabilities are mathematical quantities describing the statistics of measurement outcomes evaluated at two or more times, which incorporate the incompatibility of the measurement observables and the state of the measured quantum system. In this tutorial, we present the definition, interpretation and properties of the main quasiprobabilities known in the literature. We also discuss techniques to experimentally access a quasiprobability distribution, ranging from the weak two-point measurement scheme, to a Ramsey-like interferometric scheme and procedures assisted by an external detector. Once defined the fundamental concepts following the standpoint of joint measurability in quantum mechanics, we illustrate the use of quasiprobabilities in quantum thermodynamics to describe the quantum statistics of work and heat, and to explain anomalies in the energy exchanges entailed by a given thermodynamic transformation. On the one hand, in work protocols, we show how absorbed energy can be converted to extractable work and vice versa due to Hamiltonian incompatibility at distinct times. On the other hand, in exchange processes between two quantum systems initially at different temperatures, we explain how quantum correlations in their initial state may induce cold-to-hot energy exchanges, which are unnatural between any pair of equilibrium non-driven systems. We conclude the tutorial by giving simple examples where quasiprobabilities are applied to many-body systems: scrambling of quantum information, sensitivity to local perturbations, quantum work statistics in the quenched dynamics of models that can be mapped onto systems of free fermions, for instance the Ising model with a transverse field. Throughout the tutorial, we meticulously present derivations of essential concepts alongside straightforward examples, aiming to enhance comprehension and facilitate learning.</description>

      <title>Spectra of correlators in the relaxation time approximation of kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relaxation time approximation (RTA) of the kinetic Boltzmann equation is likely the simplest window into the microscopic properties of collective real-time transport. Within this framework, we analytically compute all retarded two-point Green's functions of the energy-momentum tensor and a conserved $U(1)$ current in thermal states with classical massless particles (a `CFT') at non-zero density, and in the absence and presence of broken translational symmetry. This is done in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. RTA allows a full explicit analysis of the analytic structure of different correlators (poles versus branch cuts) and the transport properties that they imply (the thermoelectric conductivities, and the hydrodynamic, quasihydrodynamic and gapped mode dispersion relations). Our inherently weakly coupled analysis thereby also enables a direct comparison with previously known strongly coupled results in holographic CFTs dual to the Einstein-Maxwell-axion theories.</description>

      <title>Emergent Anomalous Hydrodynamics at Infinite Temperature in a Long-Range XXZ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conventional wisdom suggests that transports of conserved quantities in non-integrable quantum many-body systems at high temperatures are diffusive. However, we discover a counterexample of this paradigm by uncovering anomalous hydrodynamics in a spin-1/2 XXZ chain with power-law couplings. This model, classified as non-integrable due to its Wigner-Dyson level-spacing statistics in the random matrix theory, exhibits a surprising superdiffusive-ballistic-superdiffusive transport transition by varying the power-law exponent of couplings for a fixed anisotropy. Our findings are verified by multiple observables, including the spin-spin autocorrelator, mean-square displacement, and spin conductivity. Interestingly, we further quantify the degree of quantum chaos using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the entanglement entropy distributions of the model's eigenstates and a random state. Remarkably, an observed local maximum in the divergence near the transition boundary suggests a link between anomalous hydrodynamics and a suppression of quantum chaos. This work offers another deep understanding of emergent anomalous transport phenomena in a wider range of non-integrable quantum many-body systems</description>

      <title>Flat band effects on the ground-state BCS-BEC crossover in atomic Fermi gases in a quasi-two-dimensional Lieb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ground-state superfluid behavior of ultracold atomic Fermi gases with a short-range attractive interaction in a quasi-two-dimensional Lieb lattice is studied using BCS mean-field theory, within the context of BCS-BEC crossover. We find that the flat band leads to nontrivial exotic effects. As the Fermi level enters the flat band, both the pairing gap and the in-plane superfluid density exhibit an unusual power law as a function of interaction, with strongly enhanced quantum geometric effects, in addition to a dramatic increase of compressibility as the interaction approaches the BCS limit. As the Fermi level crosses the van Hove singularities, the character of pairing changes from particle-like to hole-like or vice versa. We present the computed phase diagram, in which a pair density wave state emerges at high densities with relatively strong interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Supervised Training of Neural-Network Quantum States for the Next Nearest Neighbor Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Different neural network architectures can be unsupervisedly or supervisedly trained to represent quantum states. We explore and compare different strategies for the supervised training of feed forward neural network quantum states. We empirically and comparatively evaluate the performance of feed forward neural network quantum states in different phases of matter for variants of the architecture, for different hyper-parameters, and for two different loss functions, to which we refer as \emph{mean-squared error} and \emph{overlap}, respectively. We consider the next-nearest neighbor Ising model for the diversity of its phases and focus on its paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, and pair-antiferromagnetic phases. We observe that the overlap loss function allows better training of the model across all phases, provided a rescaling of the neural network.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal dynamics and non-Hermitian skin effect of repulsively bound pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a Bose-Hubbard model coupled to an engineered environment which in the non-interacting limit is described by the celebrated Hatano-Nelson model. At strong interactions, two bosons occupying the same site form a so-called repulsively bound pair, or doublon. Using tensor-network simulations, we clearly identify a distinct doublon lightcone and show that the doublon inherits non-reciprocity from that of single particles. Applying the idea of reservoir engineering at the level of doublons, we introduce a new set of dissipators and we analytically show that then the doublon dynamics are governed by the Hatano-Nelson model. This brings about an interaction-induced non-Hermitian skin effect and non-reciprocal doublon motion. Combining features of the two models we study, we show that single particles and doublons can be made to spread with opposite directionality, opening intriguing possibilities for the study of dynamics in interacting non-reciprocal models.</description>
