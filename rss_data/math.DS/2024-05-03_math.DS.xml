      <title>Rigged Dynamic Mode Decomposition: Data-Driven Generalized Eigenfunction Decompositions for Koopman Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Rigged Dynamic Mode Decomposition (Rigged DMD) algorithm, which computes generalized eigenfunction decompositions of Koopman operators. By considering the evolution of observables, Koopman operators transform complex nonlinear dynamics into a linear framework suitable for spectral analysis. While powerful, traditional Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) techniques often struggle with continuous spectra. Rigged DMD addresses these challenges with a data-driven methodology that approximates the Koopman operator's resolvent and its generalized eigenfunctions using snapshot data from the system's evolution. At its core, Rigged DMD builds wave-packet approximations for generalized Koopman eigenfunctions and modes by integrating Measure-Preserving Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition with high-order kernels for smoothing. This provides a robust decomposition encompassing both discrete and continuous spectral elements. We derive explicit high-order convergence theorems for generalized eigenfunctions and spectral measures. Additionally, we propose a novel framework for constructing rigged Hilbert spaces using time-delay embedding, significantly extending the algorithm's applicability. We provide examples, including systems with a Lebesgue spectrum, integrable Hamiltonian systems, the Lorenz system, and a high-Reynolds number lid-driven flow in a two-dimensional square cavity, demonstrating Rigged DMD's convergence, efficiency, and versatility. This work paves the way for future research and applications of decompositions with continuous spectra.</description>

      <title>On the solitary wave configurations of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation under the effect of L\'evy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to examine the effect of L\'evy noise on the solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. An improved diversity of stochastic solutions is instinctively located discretely on certain conditions by applying the generalized Kudryashov method. Moreover, the dynamical behaviors of these exact results of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation are interpreted in the context of the effect of L\'evy noise. Even mathematical evaluations have been conducted and presented.</description>

      <title>Conditioned stochastic stability of equilibrium states on uniformly expanding repellers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a notion of conditioned stochastic stability of invariant measures on repellers: we consider whether quasi-ergodic measures of absorbing Markov processes, generated by random perturbations of the deterministic dynamics and conditioned upon survival in a neighbourhood of a repeller, converge to an invariant measure in the zero-noise limit. Under suitable choices of the random perturbation, we find that equilibrium states on uniformly expanding repellers are conditioned stochastically stable. In the process, we establish a rigorous foundation for the existence of ``natural measures'', which were proposed by Kantz and Grassberger in 1984 to aid the understanding of chaotic transients.</description>

      <title>Towards a Deterministic Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics: Insights from Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments violating Bell's inequality appear to indicate deterministic models do not correspond to a realistic theory of quantum mechanics. The theory of pilot waves seemingly overcomes this hurdle via nonlocality and statistical dependence, however it necessitates the existence of "ghost waves". This manuscript develops a deterministic dynamical system with local interactions. The aggregate behavior of the trajectories are reminiscent of a quantum particle evolving under the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and reminiscent of Feynman's path integral interpretation in three canonical examples: motion in free space, double slit diffraction, and superluminal barrier traversal. Moreover, the system bifurcates into various dynamical regimes including a classical limit. These results illustrate a deterministic alternative to probabilistic interpretations and aims to shed light on the transition from quantum to classical mechanics.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional families of holomorphic curves and three-dimensional energy surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $H: \mathbb{R}^4 \to \mathbb{R}$ be any smooth function. This article introduces some arguments for extracting dynamical information about the Hamiltonian flow of $H$ from high-dimensional families of closed holomorphic curves. We work in a very general setting, without imposing convexity or contact-type assumptions. For any compact regular level set $Y$, we prove that the Hamiltonian flow admits an infinite family of pairwise distinct, proper, compact invariant subsets whose union is dense in $Y$. This is a generalization of the Fish-Hofer theorem, which showed that $Y$ has at least one proper compact invariant subset. We then establish a global Le Calvez-Yoccoz property for almost every compact regular level set $Y$: any compact invariant subset containing all closed orbits is either equal to $Y$ or is not locally maximal. Next, we prove quantitative versions, in four dimensions, of the celebrated almost-existence theorem for Hamiltonian systems; such questions have been open for general Hamiltonians since the late $1980$s. We prove that almost every compact regular level set of $H$ contains at least two closed orbits, a sharp lower bound. Under explicit and $C^\infty$-generic conditions on $H$, we prove almost-existence of infinitely many closed orbits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the set of cubic Hamiltonian vector fields for which their associated Kahan-Hirota-Kimura maps preserve the original Hamiltonian function. We analyze these fields in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^4$. We also study a family of fields in $\mathbb{R}^6$. Additionally, we explore several properties like the existence of additional first integrals of specific type, the possibility that the initial Hamiltonian vector field is a Lie Symmetry of the corresponding map, or the symplecticity of the considered maps.</description>

Abstract: Let $h : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ be an orientation preserving homeomorphism of the plane. For any bounded orbit $\mathcal{O}(x)=\{h^n(x):n\in\mathbb{Z}\}$ there exists a fixed point $x'\in\mathbb{R}^2$ of $h$ linked to $\mathcal{O}(x)$ in the sense of Gambaudo: one cannot find a Jordan curve $C\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ around $\mathcal{O}(x)$, separating it from $x'$, that is isotopic to $h(C)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2\setminus\left(\mathcal{O}(x)\cup\{x'\}\right)$.</description>

      <title>Data-driven discovery of quasiperiodically driven dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of a timeseries can provide many new perspectives if it is accompanied by the assumption that the timeseries is generated from an underlying dynamical system. For example, statistical properties of the data can be related to measure theoretic aspects of the dynamics, and one can try to recreate the dynamics itself. The underlying dynamics could represent a natural phenomenon or a physical system, where the timeseries represents a sequence of measurements. In this paper, we present a completely data-driven framework to identify and model quasiperiodically driven dynamical systems (Q.P.D.) from the timeseries it generates. Q.P.D. are a special class of systems that are driven by a periodic source with multiple base frequencies. Such systems abound in nature, e.g., astronomy and traffic flow. Our framework reconstructs the dynamics into two components - the driving quasiperiodic source with generating frequencies; and the driven nonlinear dynamics. We make a combined use of a kernel-based harmonic analysis, kernel-based interpolation technique, and Koopman operator theory. Our framework provides accurate reconstructions and frequency identification for three real-world case studies.</description>

      <title>Finding product sets in some classes of amenable groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2022, using methods from ergodic theory, Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson resolved a longstanding conjecture of Erd\H{o}s about sumsets in large subsets of the natural numbers. In this paper, we extend this result to several important classes of amenable groups, including all finitely generated virtually nilpotent groups, and all abelian groups $(G,+)$ with the property that the subgroup $2G := \{g+g : g\in G\}$ has finite index. We prove that in any group $G$ from the above classes, any $A\subset G$ with positive upper Banach density contains a shifted product set of the form $\{tb_ib_j\colon i&lt;j\}$, for some infinite sequence $(b_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ and some $t\in G$. In fact, we show this result for all amenable groups that posses a property which we call square absolute continuity. Our results provide answers to several questions and conjectures posed in a recent survey of Kra, Moreira, Richter and Robertson.</description>

      <title>Are prime numbers and quadratic residues random?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Appeals to randomness in various number-theoretic constructions appear regularly in modern scientific publications. It is enough to mention such famous names as V.I. Arnold, M. Katz, Yu.G. Sinai and T. Tao. Unfortunately, it all comes down to various, although often very non-trivial and elegant, heuristics. A new analytical approach is proposed to address the issue of randomness/complexity of an individual deterministic sequence. As an application, it demonstrates the expected high complexity of quadratic residues and the unexpectedly low complexity in the case of primes. Technically, the proposed approach is based on a fundamentally new construction of the entropy of a single trajectory of a dynamical system, which in a certain sense occupies an intermediate position between the classical metric Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy and topological entropy.</description>

      <title>Connectivity of Fatou Components of Meromorphic Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that there exist transcendental meromorphic functions with a cycle of 2-periodic Fatou components, where one is simply connected while the other is doubly connected. In particular, the doubly connected Fatou component can be an attracting, parabolic, or Baker domain. Thus, this settles the problem of whether a doubly connected periodic Fatou component must be a Herman ring.
  We also prove that there exists a transcendental meromorphic function with a wandering domain that has no eventual connectivity. In addition, we show that the connectivity sequence of this wandering domain is periodic with period two. This solves a problem about the nonexistence of the eventual connectivity of wandering domains and gives a different example constructed by Ferreira [J. London Math. Soc. (2022), DOI:10.1112/jlms.12613].</description>

      <title>StableSSM: Alleviating the Curse of Memory in State-space Models through Stable Reparameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the long-term memory learning capabilities of state-space models (SSMs) from the perspective of parameterization. We prove that state-space models without any reparameterization exhibit a memory limitation similar to that of traditional RNNs: the target relationships that can be stably approximated by state-space models must have an exponential decaying memory. Our analysis identifies this ``curse of memory'' as a result of the recurrent weights converging to a stability boundary, suggesting that a reparameterization technique can be effective. To this end, we introduce a class of reparameterization techniques for SSMs that effectively lift its memory limitations. Besides improving approximation capabilities, we further illustrate that a principled choice of reparameterization scheme can also enhance optimization stability. We validate our findings using synthetic datasets, language models and image classifications.</description>

      <title>Automating the Discovery of Partial Differential Equations in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying partial differential equations (PDEs) from data is crucial for understanding the governing mechanisms of natural phenomena, yet it remains a challenging task. We present an extension to the ARGOS framework, ARGOS-RAL, which leverages sparse regression with the recurrent adaptive lasso to identify PDEs from limited prior knowledge automatically. Our method automates calculating partial derivatives, constructing a candidate library, and estimating a sparse model. We rigorously evaluate the performance of ARGOS-RAL in identifying canonical PDEs under various noise levels and sample sizes, demonstrating its robustness in handling noisy and non-uniformly distributed data. We also test the algorithm's performance on datasets consisting solely of random noise to simulate scenarios with severely compromised data quality. Our results show that ARGOS-RAL effectively and reliably identifies the underlying PDEs from data, outperforming the sequential threshold ridge regression method in most cases. We highlight the potential of combining statistical methods, machine learning, and dynamical systems theory to automatically discover governing equations from collected data, streamlining the scientific modeling process.</description>

Abstract: We study initial value problems having dynamics ruled by discontinuous ordinary differential equations with the property of possessing a unique solution. We identify a precise class of such systems that we call solvable intitial value problems and we prove that for this class of problems the unique solution can always be obtained analytically via transfinite recursion. We present several examples including a nontrivial one whose solution yields, at an integer time, a real encoding of the halting set for Turing machines; therefore showcasing that the behavior of solvable systems is related to ordinal Turing computations.</description>
