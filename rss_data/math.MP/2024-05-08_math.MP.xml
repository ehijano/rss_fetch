      <title>Twisted vortices in two-component Ginzburg-Landau theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, a brief introduction to the physical and mathematical background of the two-component Ginzburg-Landau theory is given. From this theory we derive a boundary value problem whose solution can be obtained in part by solving a minimization problem using the technique of variational method, except that two of the eight boundary conditions cannot be satisfied. To overcome the difficulty of recovering the full set of boundary conditions, we employ a variety of methods, including the uniform estimation method and the bounded monotonic theorem, which may be applied to other complicated vortex problems in gauge field theories. The twisted vortex solutions are obtained as energy-minimizing cylindrically symmetric field configurations. We also give the sharp asymptotic estimates for the twisted vortex solutions at the origin and infinity.</description>

      <title>Expansion of the Many-body Quantum Gibbs State of the Bose-Hubbard Model on a Finite Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the many-body quantum Gibbs state for the Bose-Hubbard model on a finite graph at positive temperature. We scale the interaction with the inverse temperature, corresponding to a mean-field limit where the temperature is of the order of the average particle number. For this model it is known that the many-body Gibbs state converges, as temperature goes to infinity, to the Gibbs measure of a discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, i.e., a Gibbs measure defined in terms of a one-body theory. In this article we extend these results by proving an expansion to any order of the many-body Gibbs state with inverse temperature as a small parameter. The coefficients in the expansion can be calculated as vacuum expectation values using a recursive formula, and we compute the first two coefficients explicitly.</description>

      <title>Parametric set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation: p-racks, solutions &amp; quantum algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of the parametric set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation is established from a purely algebraic point of view. The first step towards this objective is the introduction of certain generalizations of the familiar shelves and racks called parametric (p)-shelves and racks. These objects satisfy a parametric self-distributivity condition and lead to solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Novel, non-reversible solutions are obtained from p-shelve/rack solutions by a suitable parametric twist, whereas all reversible set-theoretic solutions are reduced to the identity map via a parametric twist. The universal algebras associated to both p-rack and generic parametric, set-theoretic solutions are next presented and the corresponding universal R-matrices are derived. The admissible universal Drinfel'd twist is constructed allowing the derivation of the general set-theoretic universal R-matrix. By introducing the concept of a parametric coproduct we prove the existence of a parametric co-associativity. We show that the parametric coproduct is an algebra homomorphsim and the universal R-matrices satisfy intertwining relations with the algebra coproducts.</description>

      <title>Darboux's Theorem, Lie series and the standardization of the Salerno and Ablowitz-Ladik models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of nonlinear Hamiltonian lattices, we revisit the proof of Moser-Darboux's Theorem, in order to present a general scheme for its constructive applicability to Hamiltonian models with non-standard symplectic structures. We take as a guiding example the Salerno and Ablowitz-Ladik (AL) models: we justify the form of a well-known change of coordinates which is adapted to the Gauge symmetry, by showing that it comes out in a natural way within the general strategy outlined in the proof. Moreover, the full or truncated Lie-series technique in the extended phase-space is used to transform the Salerno model, at leading orders in the Darboux coordinates: thus the dNLS Hamiltonian turns out to be a normal form of the Salerno and AL models; as a byproduct we also get estimates of the dynamics of these models by means of dNLS one. We also stress that, once it is cast into the perturbative approach, the method allows to deal with the cases where the explicit trasformation is not known, or even worse it is not writable in terms of elementary functions.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of integrals for the emptiness formation probability in the square-ice model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emptiness formation probability (EFP) in the six-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions. We present a conjecture according to which at the ice point, i.e., when all the Boltzmann weights are equal, the known multiple integral representation (MIR) for the EFP can be given as a finite-size matrix determinant of Fredholm type. Our conjecture is based on the explicit evaluation of the MIR for particular values of geometric parameters and on two kinds of identities for the boundary correlation function. The obtained representation can be further written as the Fredholm determinant of some linear integral operator. We show that as the geometric parameters of the EFP are tuned to the vicinity of the arctic curve arising in the scaling limit, the conjectured determinant turns into the GUE Tracy--Widom distribution.</description>

      <title>Brownian Motion on The Spider Like Quantum Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper contains the probabilistic analysis of the Brownian motion on the simplest quantum graph, spider: a system of N-half axis connected only at the graph's origin by the simplest (so-called Kirchhoff's) gluing conditions. The limit theorems for the diffusion on such a graph, especially if $N \to \infty$ are significantly different from the classical case $N = 2$ (full axis). Additional results concern the properties of the spectral measure of the spider Laplacian and the corresponding generalized Fourier transforms. The continuation of the paper will contain the study of the spectrum for the class of Schr\"odinger operators on the spider graphs: Laplacian perturbed by unbounded potential and related phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Analyticity for classical hard-core gases via recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the recent work of [Michelen, Perkins, Comm. Math. Phys. 399:1 (2023)], a new lower bound of $eC_{\phi}(\beta)^{-1}$ is obtained for the positive activity up to which the pressure of a classical system of particles with repulsive pair interactions is analytic. In this paper, we extend their method to the class of radially symmetric, locally stable, and tempered pair potentials. Our main result is that the pressure of such systems is analytic for positive activities up to $e^{2(1-W(eA_{\phi}(\beta)/C_{\phi}(\beta)))}C_{\phi}(\beta)^{-1}e^{-(\beta C+1)}$, where $C&gt;0$ is the local stability constant, $W(\cdot)$ the Lambert $W$-function, and $A_{\phi}(\beta)$ the contribution from the attractive part of the pair potential to the temperedness constant. In the high-temperature limit, our result improves the classical Penrose-Ruelle bound of $C_{\phi}(\beta)^{-1}e^{-(\beta C+1)}$ by a factor of $e^{2}$. This proves the absence of phase transitions in these systems in the Lee-Yang sense for activities up to the above threshold.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger equation for diatomic molecules in deSitter and anti-deSitter spaces is studied using the extended uncertainty principle formulation. The equations are solved by the Nikiforov-Uvarov method for both the Kratzer potential and the pseudoharmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues of the system have been derived analytically, and the exact expressions of the eigenfunctions are provided in terms of Romanovski and Jacobi polynomials. The impact of the spatial deformation parameter on the bound states is also examined, with experimental results used to establish an upper limit for this parameter.</description>

      <title>The explicit form of the unitary representation of the Poincar\'e group for vector-valued wave functions (massive and massless), with applications to photon's localization and position operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14217v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We geometrically derive the explicit form of the Unitary representation of the Poincare group and use it to apply speed-of-light boosts to simple polarization basis to end up with Hawton-Baylis photon position operator with commuting components. We give explicit formulas for other photon boost eigenmodes. We investigate the underlying affine connections on the light cone in momentum space and find that while Pryce connection is metric semi-symmetric, the flat Hawton-Baylis connection is not semi-symmetric. Finally we discuss localizability of photon states localized on closed loops and show that photon states on the circle, both unnormalized improper states and finite norm wave packet smeared over washer-like regions are strictly localized with respect to Hawton-Baylis operators with commuting components and also with respect to the noncommutative Jauch-Piron-Amrein POV measure.</description>

Abstract: The Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde(WDVV) equations appeared in the study of two-dimensional topological field theoies in the early 1990s. An extension of the WDVV equations, called the open WDVV equations, was introduced by A.Horev and J.P.Solomon (arXiv:1210.4034). In this paper, we give some particular solutions to the open WDVV equations.</description>

      <title>Learning in associative networks through Pavlovian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hebbian learning theory is rooted in Pavlov's Classical Conditioning. In addition, while mathematical models of the former have been proposed and studied in the past decades, especially in spin glass theory, only recently it has been numerically shown that the Pavlovian neural and synaptic dynamics mechanisms give rise to synaptic weights that correspond to the Hebbian learning rule. In this paper, we show that we can analytically prove this result. Moreover, we obtain the Pavlovian dynamics directly with statistical mechanics considerations, so that we can model the whole process within the same framework. Then, we test and study the model in different numerical settings. Finally, drawing from evidence on pure memory reinforcement during sleep stages, we show how the proposed model can simulate neural networks that undergo sleep-associated memory consolidation processes, thereby proving the compatibility of Pavlovian learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $R&gt;0$, we give a rigorous probabilistic construction on the cylinder $\mathbb{R} \times (\mathbb{R}/(2\pi R\mathbb{Z}))$ of the (massless) Sinh-Gordon model. In particular we define the $n$-point correlation functions of the model and show that these exhibit a scaling relation with respect to $R$. The construction, which relies on the massless Gaussian Free Field, is based on the spectral analysis of a quantum operator associated to the model. Using the theory of Gaussian multiplicative chaos, we prove that this operator has discrete spectrum and a strictly positive ground state.</description>

      <title>Thermal convection in a higher velocity gradient and higher temperature gradient fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse a model for thermal convection in a class of generalized Navier-Stokes equations containing fourth order spatial derivatives of the velocity and of the temperature. The work generalises the isothermal model of A. Musesti. We derive critical Rayleigh and wavenumbers for the onset of convective fluid motion paying careful attention to the variation of coefficients of the highest derivatives. In addition to linear instability theory we include an analysis of fully nonlinear stability theory. The theory analysed possesses a bi-Laplacian term for the velocity field and also for the temperature field. It was pointed out by E. Fried and M. Gurtin that higher order terms represent micro-length effects and these phenomena are very important in flows in microfluidic situations. We introduce temperature into the theory via a Boussinesq approximation where the density of the body force term is allowed to depend upon temperature to account for buoyancy effects which arise due to expansion of the fluid when this is heated. We analyse a meaningful set of boundary conditions which are introduced by Fried and Gurtin as conditions of strong adherence, and these are crucial to understand the effect of the higher order derivatives upon convective motion in a microfluidic scenario where micro-length effects are paramount. The basic steady state is the one of zero velocity, but in contrast to the classical theory the temperature field is nonlinear in the vertical coordinate. This requires care especially dealing with nonlinear theory and also leads to some novel effects.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the partition function for beta-ensembles at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a model for a gas of $N$ confined particles interacting via a two-body logarithmic interaction, namely the real $\beta$-ensembles. We are interested in the regime where the inverse temperature scales as $N\beta=2P$ with $P$ a fixed positive parameter; this is called the high-temperature regime. The confining potential is of the form $x^2+\phi$ with bounded smooth function $\phi$. We establish for this model, the existence of a large-$N$ asymptotic expansion for the associated partition function. We also prove the existence of a large-$N$ asymptotic expansion of linear statistics for general confining potentials. Our method is based on the analysis of the loop equations. Finally, we establish a continuity result for the equilibrium density with respect to the potential dependence.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics driving the conversion of gravitational and electromagnetic waves in cylindrically symmetric spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the ``composite harmonic mapping method," we construct exact solutions for cylindrically symmetric gravitational and electromagnetic waves within the Einstein-Maxwell system, focusing on the conversion dynamics between these types of waves. In this approach, we employs two types of geodesic surfaces in ${\mathbb H}^{2}_{C}$: (a) the complex line and (b) the totally real Lagrangian plane, applied to two different vacuum seed solutions: (i) a vacuum solution previously utilized in our studies and (ii) the solitonic vacuum solution constructed previously by Economou and Tsoubelis. We study three scenarios: case (a) with seeds (i) and (ii), and case (b) with seed (ii). In all cases (a) and (b), solutions demonstrate notable mode conversions near the symmetric axis. In case (a) with seed (i) or seed (ii), we show that any change in the occupancy of the gravitational or electromagnetic mode relative to the C-energy near the axis always reverts to its initial state once the wave moves away from the axis. Particularly in case (b) with seed (ii), nontrivial conversions occur even when the wave moves away from the axis. In this case, the amplification factors of electromagnetic modes range from an upper limit of approximately $2.4$ to a lower limit of about $0.4$, when comparing the contributions of electromagnetic mode to C-energy at past and future null infinities.</description>

      <title>Stress solution of static linear elasticity with mixed boundary conditions via adjoint linear operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit stress problems in linear elasticity to provide a perspective from the geometrical and functionalanalytic points of view. For the static stress problem of linear elasticity with mixed boundary conditions we write the associated pair of unbounded adjoint operators. The stress solution is found as an intersection of affine translations of the fundamental subspaces of the adjoint operators. In particular, we treat the equilibrium equation in the operator form, involving spaces of traces on a part of the boundary, known as Lions-Magenes spaces. Our analysis of the pair of adjoint operators for the problem with mixed boundary conditions relies on the properties of the analogous pair of operators for the problem with the displacement boundary conditions, which we also include in the paper.</description>

      <title>The Large Deviation Principle for $W$-random spectral measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $W$-random graphs provide a flexible framework for modeling large random networks. Using the Large Deviation Principle (LDP) for $W$-random graphs from [9], we prove the LDP for the corresponding class of random symmetric Hilbert-Schmidt integral operators. Our main result describes how the eigenvalues and the eigenspaces of the integral operator are affected by the large deviations in the underlying random graphon. To prove the LDP, we demonstrate continuous dependence of the spectral measures associated with integral operators on the underlying graphons and use the Contraction Principle. To illustrate our results, we obtain leading order asymptotics of the eigenvalues of the integral operators corresponding to certain random graph sequences. These examples suggest several representative scenarios of how the eigenvalues and the eigenspaces of the integral operators are affected by large deviations. Potential implications of these observations for bifurcation analysis of Dynamical Systems and Graph Signal Processing are indicated.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modeling of $^{18}$F-Fluoromisonidazole ($^{18}$F-FMISO) Radiopharmaceutical Transport in Vascularized Solid Tumors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $^{18}$F-Fluoromisonidazole ($^{18}$F-FMISO) is a highly promising positron emission tomography radiopharmaceutical for identifying hypoxic regions in solid tumors. This research employs spatiotemporal multi-scale mathematical modeling to explore how different levels of angiogenesis influence the transport of radiopharmaceuticals within tumors. In this study, two tumor geometries with heterogeneous and uniform distributions of capillary networks were employed to incorporate varying degrees of microvascular density. The synthetic image of the heterogeneous and vascularized tumor was generated by simulating the angiogenesis process. The proposed multi-scale spatiotemporal model accounts for intricate physiological and biochemical factors within the tumor microenvironment, such as the transvascular transport of the radiopharmaceutical agent, its movement into the interstitial space by diffusion and convection mechanisms, and ultimately its uptake by tumor cells. Results showed that both quantitative and semi-quantitative metrics of $^{18}$F-FMISO uptake differ spatially and temporally at different stages during tumor growth. The presence of a high microvascular density in uniformly vascularized tumor increases cellular uptake, as it allows for more efficient release and rapid distribution of radiopharmaceutical molecules. This results in enhanced uptake compared to the heterogeneous vascularized tumor. In both heterogeneous and uniform distribution of microvessels in tumors, the diffusion transport mechanism has a more pronounced than convection. The findings of this study shed light on the transport phenomena behind $^{18}$F-FMISO radiopharmaceutical distribution and its delivery in the tumor microenvironment, aiding oncologists in their routine decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>Positivity and entanglement of polynomial Gaussian integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the positivity of self-adjoint polynomial Gaussian integral operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$, that is, the multivariable kernel $\kappa_{PG}$ is a product of a polynomial $P$ and a Gaussian kernel $\kappa_G$.
  We show that $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$ can be only positive if the Gaussian part is positive. This has an important corollary for the bipartite entanglement of the density operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$: if the Gaussian density operator $\widehat{\kappa}_G$ fails the Peres--Horodecki criterion, then the corresponding polynomial Gaussian density operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$ also fail the criterion for all $P$, hence they are all entangled.
  We introduce a new preorder $\preceq$ on Gaussian kernels such that if $\kappa_{G_0}\preceq \kappa_{G_1}$ then $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG_0}\geq 0$ implies $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG_1}\geq 0$ for all polynomials $P$. Therefore, deciding the positivity of a polynomial Gaussian operator determines the positivity of a lot of another polynomial Gaussian operators which have the same polynomial factor. This preorder has implication for the entanglement problem, too.
  We also prove that polynomial Gaussian operators with polynomials of odd degree cannot be positive semidefinite.</description>

      <title>Generalized classical Yang-Baxter equation and regular decompositions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The focus of the paper is on constructing new solutions of the generalized classical Yang-Baxter equation (GCYBE) that are not skew-symmetric. Using regular decompositions of finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras, we construct Lie algebra decompositions of $\mathfrak{g}(\!(x)\!) \times \mathfrak{g}[x]/x^m \mathfrak{g}[x]$. The latter decompositions are in bijection with the solutions to the GCYBE. Under appropriate regularity conditions, we obtain a partial classification of such solutions. The paper is concluded with the presentations of the Gaudin-type models associated to these solutions.</description>

Abstract: Fractals and quasiperiodic structures share self-similarity as a structural property. Motivated by the link between Fibonacci fractals and quasicrystals which are scaled by the golden mean ratio $\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$, we introduce and characterize a family of metallic-mean ratio fractals. We calculate the spatial properties of this generalized family, including their boundaries, which are also fractal. We then demonstrate how these fractals can be related to aperiodic tilings, and show how we can decorate them to produce new, fractal tilings.</description>

      <title>A fully differentiable GNN-based PDE Solver: With Applications to Poisson and Navier-Stokes Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel computational framework that integrates the finite volume method with graph neural networks to address the challenges in Physics-Informed Neural Networks(PINNs). Our approach leverages the flexibility of graph neural networks to adapt to various types of two-dimensional unstructured grids, enhancing the model's applicability across different physical equations and boundary conditions. The core innovation lies in the development of an unsupervised training algorithm that utilizes GPU parallel computing to implement a fully differentiable finite volume method discretization process. This method includes differentiable integral and gradient reconstruction algorithms, enabling the model to directly solve partial-differential equations(PDEs) during training without the need for pre-computed data. Our results demonstrate the model's superior mesh generalization and its capability to handle multiple boundary conditions simultaneously, significantly boosting its generalization capabilities. The proposed method not only shows potential for extensive applications in CFD but also establishes a new paradigm for integrating traditional numerical methods with deep learning technologies, offering a robust platform for solving complex physical problems.</description>

Abstract: We prove nonlinear Landau damping in optimal weighted Gevrey-3 spaces for solutions of the confined Vlasov-Poisson system on $\T^d\times\R^d$ which are small perturbations of homogeneous Penrose-stable equilibria.
  We also prove the existence of nonlinear scattering operators associated to the confined Vlasov-Poisson evolution, as well as suitable injectivity properties and Lipschitz estimates (also in weighted Gevrey-3 spaces) on these operators.
  Our results give definitive answers to two well-known open problems in the field, both of them stated in the recent review of Bedrossian  [4, Section 6].</description>

      <title>Limiting distributions of the Spherical model and Spin $O(N)$ model: Appearance of GFF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the relation between the spherical model of Berlin-Kac and the spin $O(N)$ model in the limit $N \to \infty$ and explain how they are related via the discrete Gaussian free field (GFF).
  More precisely, using probabilistic limit theorems and concentration of measure we first prove that the infinite volume limit of the spherical model on a $d$-dimensional torus is a massive GFF in the high-temperature regime, a standard GFF at the critical temperature, and a standard GFF plus a Rademacher random constant in the low-temperature regime. The proof in the case of the critical temperature appears to be new and requires a fine understanding of the zero-average Green's function on the torus.
  For the spin $O(N)$ model, we study the model in the double limit of the spin-dimensionality and the torus size. We take the limit as first the spin-dimension $N$ goes to infinity, and then the size of the torus, and obtain that the different spin coordinates become i.i.d. fields, whose distribution in the high-temperature regime is a massive GFF, a standard GFF at the critical temperature, and a standard GFF plus a Gaussian random constant in the low-temperature regime.
  In particular, this means that although the limiting free energies per site of the two models agree at all temperatures, their actual finite-dimensional laws still differ in terms of their zero modes in the low-temperature regime.</description>

Abstract: We study a class of conformal metric deformations in the quasi-radial coordinate parameterizing the 3-sphere in the conformally compactified Minkowski spacetime $S^1\times S^3$. Prior to reduction of the associated Laplace-Beltrami operators to a Schr\"odinger form, a corresponding class of exactly solvable potentials (each one containing a scalar and a gradient term) is found. In particular, the scalar piece of these potentials can be exactly or quasi-exactly solvable, and among them we find the finite range confining trigonometric potentials of P\"oschl-Teller, Scarf and Rosen-Morse. As an application of the results developed in the paper, the large compactification radius limit of the interaction described by some of these potentials is studied, and this regime is shown to be relevant to a quantum mechanical quark deconfinement mechanism.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the integrability of the Sasano system of type $A^{(2)}_4$ from the point of view of the Hamiltonian dynamics. We prove rigorously that for these values of the parameters for which the Sasano system of type $A^{(2)}_4$ has a particular rational solution it is not integrable by rational first integrals. By an explicit computation we show that the connected component $G^0$ of the unit element of the differential Galois group of the normal variational equations along a simple particular rational solution is a direct product of two groups $SL_2(\mathbb{C})$. This the Morales-Ramis theory leads to a non-integrable result. Moreover using B\"{a}cklund transformations we extend the obtained particular non-integrable result to the entire orbit of the parameters.</description>

      <title>Interface Modes in Honeycomb Topological Photonic Structures with Broken Reflection Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a mathematical theory for Dirac points and interface modes in honeycomb topological photonic structures consisting of impenetrable obstacles. Starting from a honeycomb lattice of obstacles attaining $120^\circ$-rotation symmetry and horizontal reflection symmetry, we apply the boundary integral equation method to show the existence of Dirac points for the first two bands at the vertices of the Brillouin zone. We then study interface modes in a joint honeycomb photonic structure, which consists of two periodic lattices obtained by perturbing the honeycomb one with Dirac points differently. The perturbations break the reflection symmetry of the system, as a result, they annihilate the Dirac points and generate two structures with different topological phases, which mimics the quantum valley Hall effect in topological insulators. We investigate the interface modes that decay exponentially away from the interface of the joint structure in several configurations with different interface geometries, including the zigzag interface, the armchair interface, and the rational interfaces. Using the layer potential technique and asymptotic analysis, we first characterize the band-gap opening for the two perturbed periodic structures and derive the asymptotic expansions of the Bloch modes near the band gap surfaces. By formulating the eigenvalue problem for each joint honeycomb structure using boundary integral equations over the interface and analyzing the characteristic values of the associated boundary integral operators, we prove the existence of interface modes when the perturbation is small.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.13668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the Cauchy problem for an energy-supercritical nonlinear wave equation in odd space dimensions that arises in equivariant Yang-Mills theory. In each dimension, there is a self-similar finite-time blowup solution to this equation known in closed form. It will be proved that this profile is stable in the whole space under small perturbations of the initial data. The blowup analysis is based on a recently developed coordinate system called hyperboloidal similarity coordinates and depends crucially on growth estimates for the free wave evolution, which will be constructed systematically for odd space dimensions in the first part of this paper. This allows to develop a nonlinear stability theory beyond the singularity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show that any Sobolev norm of nonnegative integer order of radially symmetric functions is equivalent to a weighted Sobolev norm of their radial profile. This establishes in terms of weighted Sobolev spaces on an interval a complete characterization of radial Sobolev spaces, which was open until now. As an application, we give a description of Sobolev norms of corotational maps.</description>

Interpreting the Sch\"{r}odinger equation in terms of a superpotential we determine the supersymmetric partners for $n$. We also obtain new analytical solutions for the refractive index profiles and provide graphical illustrations for them.</description>

Abstract: In this article we use the philosophy in [OS22] to construct the quantum difference equation of affine type $A$ quiver varieties in terms of the quantum toroidal algebra $U_{q,t}(\hat{\hat{\mathfrak{sl}}}_{r})$. In the construction, and we define the set of wall for each quiver varieties by the action of the universal $R$-matrix, which is shown to be almost equivalent to that of the $K$-theoretic stable envelope on each interval in $H^2(X,\mathbb{Q})$. We also give the examples of the instanton moduli space $M(n,r)$ and the equivariant Hilbert scheme $\text{Hilb}_{n}([\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_{r}])$ to show the explicit form of the quantum difference operator.</description>

      <title>Structured random matrices and cyclic cumulants: A free probability approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14315v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of large structured random matrices characterized by four fundamental properties which we discuss. We prove that this class is stable under matrix-valued and pointwise non-linear operations. We then formulate an efficient method, based on an extremization problem, for computing the spectrum of subblocks of such large structured random matrices. We present different proofs -- combinatorial or algebraic -- of the validity of this method, which all have some connection with free probability. We illustrate this method with well known examples of unstructured matrices, including Haar randomly rotated matrices, as well as with the example of structured random matrices arising in the quantum symmetric simple exclusion process. tured random matrices arising in the quantum symmetric simple exclusion process.</description>

      <title>Formal Green's function theory in non-Hermitian lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the generalized Bloch theory to rediscover the generalized Brillouin zone theory and follow this way to obtain the Green's function of the non-Hermitian system. We focus on a classical chiral model and give the exact expression of the Green's function for a finite-size system and the formal expression of the Green's function suitable for infinite size. Based on these results, we further derive the correlation matrix and validate it numerically against direct calculations for a system of size 40. The numerical results show the accuracy of our exact expression and the high fidelity of our formal expression.</description>

      <title>The Dirac Delta as a Singular Potential for the 2D Schrodinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the framework of distributionally generalized quantum theory, the object $H\psi$ is defined as a distribution. The mathematical significance is a mild generalization for the theory of para- and pseudo-differential operators (as well as a generalization of the weak eigenvalue problem), where the $\psi$-do symbol (which is not a proper linear operator in this generalized case) can have its coefficient functions take on singular distributional values. Here, a distribution is said to be singular if it is not L$^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for any $p\geq 1$. Physically, the significance is a mathematically rigorous method, which does not rely upon renormalization or regularization of any kind, while producing bound state energy results in agreement with the literature. In addition, another benefit is that the method does not rely upon self-adjoint extensions of the Laplace operator. This is important when the theory is applied to non-Schrodinger systems, as is the case for the Dirac equation and a necessary property of any finite rigorous version of quantum field theory. The distributional interpretation resolves the need to evaluate a wave function at a point where it fails to be defined. For $d=2$, this occurs as $K_o(a|x|)\delta(x)$, where $K_o$ is the zeroth order MacDonald function. Finally, there is also the identification of a missing anomalous length scale, owing to the scale invariance of the formal symbol(ic) Hamiltonian, as well as the common identity for the logarithmic function, with $a,\,b\in\mathbb{R}^+$, $\log(ab)=\log(a)+\log(b)$, which loses unitlessness in its arguments. Consequently, the energy or point spectrum is generalized as a family (set indexed by the continuum) of would-be spectral values, called the C-spectrum.</description>

      <title>Typical thermalization of low-entanglement states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18007v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proving thermalization from the unitary evolution of a closed quantum system is one of the oldest questions that is still nowadays only partially resolved. Several efforts have led to various formulations of what is called the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which leads to thermalization under certain conditions on the initial states. These conditions, however, are sensitive to the precise formulation of the hypothesis. In this work, we focus on the important case of low entanglement initial states, which are operationally accessible in many natural physical settings, including experimental schemes for testing thermalization and for quantum simulation. We prove thermalization of these states under precise conditions that have operational significance. More specifically, motivated by arguments of unavoidable finite resolution, we define a random energy smoothing on local Hamiltonians that leads to local thermalization when the initial state has low entanglement. Finally we show that such a transformation affects neither the Gibbs state locally nor, under generic smoothness conditions on the spectrum, the short-time dynamics.</description>

      <title>Generalized double bracket vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By introducing a metriplectic tensor, we generalize the double bracket vector fields defined on semi-simple Lie algebras to the case of Poisson manifolds endowed with a pseudo-Riemannian metric. We also construct a generalization of the normal metric on an adjoint orbit of a compact semi-simple Lie algebra such that the above vector fields, when restricted to a symplectic leaf, become gradient vector fields. We illustrate the newly introduced objects to a variety of examples and carefully discuss complications that arise when the pseudo-Riemannian metric does not induce a non-degenerate metric on parts of the symplectic leaves.</description>

      <title>Quantum entropy couples matter with geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theory for coupling matter fields with discrete geometry on higher-order networks, i.e. cell complexes. The key idea of the approach is to associate to a higher-order network the quantum entropy of its metric. Specifically we propose an action given by the quantum relative entropy between the metric of the higher-order network and the metric induced by the matter and gauge fields. The induced metric is defined in terms of the topological spinors and the discrete Dirac operators. The topological spinors, defined on nodes, edges and higher-dimensional cells, encode for the matter fields. The discrete Dirac operators act on topological spinors, and depend on the metric of the higher-order network as well as on the gauge fields via a discrete version of the minimal substitution. We derive the coupled dynamical equations for the metric, the matter and the gauge fields, providing an information theory principle to obtain the field theory equations in discrete curved space.</description>
