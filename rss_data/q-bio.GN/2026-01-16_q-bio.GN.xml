      <title>Detecting Batch Heterogeneity via Likelihood Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batch effects represent a major confounder in genomic diagnostics. In copy number variant (CNV) detection from NGS, many algorithms compare read depth between test samples and a reference sample, assuming they are process-matched. When this assumption is violated, with causes ranging from reagent lot changes to multi-site processing, the reference becomes inappropriate, introducing false CNV calls or masking true pathogenic variants. Detecting such heterogeneity before downstream analysis is critical for reliable clinical interpretation. Existing batch effect detection methods either cluster samples based on raw features, risking conflation of biological signal with technical variation, or require known batch labels that are frequently unavailable. We introduce a method that addresses both limitations by clustering samples according to their Bayesian model evidence. The central insight is that evidence quantifies compatibility between data and model assumptions, technical artifacts violate assumptions and reduce evidence, whereas biological variation, including CNV status, is anticipated by the model and yields high evidence. This asymmetry provides a discriminative signal that separates batch effects from biology. We formalize heterogeneity detection as a likelihood ratio test for mixture structure in evidence space, using parametric bootstrap calibration to ensure conservative false positive rates. We validate our approach on synthetic data demonstrating proper Type I error control, three clinical targeted sequencing panels (liquid biopsy, BRCA, and thalassemia) exhibiting distinct batch effect mechanisms, and mouse electrophysiology recordings demonstrating cross-modality generalization. Our method achieves superior clustering accuracy compared to standard correlation-based and dimensionality-reduction approaches while maintaining the conservativeness required for clinical usage.</description>

      <title>MitoFREQ: A Novel Approach for Mitogenome Frequency Estimation from Top-level Haplogroups and Single Nucleotide Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lineage marker population frequencies can serve as one way to express evidential value in forensic genetics. However, for high-quality whole mitochondrial DNA genome sequences (mitogenomes), population data remain limited. In this paper, we offer a new method, MitoFREQ, for estimating the population frequencies of mitogenomes. MitoFREQ uses the mitogenome resources HelixMTdb and gnomAD, harbouring information from 195,983 and 56,406 mitogenomes, respectively. Neither HelixMTdb nor gnomAD can be queried directly for individual mitogenome frequencies, but offers single nucleotide variant (SNV) allele frequencies for each of 30 "top-level" haplogroups (TLHG). We propose using the HelixMTdb and gnomAD resources by classifying a given mitogenome within the TLHG scheme and subsequently using the frequency of its rarest SNV within that TLHG weighted by the TLHG frequency. We show that this method is guaranteed to provide a higher population frequency estimate than if a refined haplogroup and its SNV frequencies were used. Further, we show that top-level haplogrouping can be achieved by using only 227 specific positions for 99.9% of the tested mitogenomes, potentially making the method available for low-quality samples. The method was tested on two types of datasets: high-quality forensic reference datasets and a diverse collection of scrutinised mitogenomes from GenBank. This dual evaluation demonstrated that the approach is robust across both curated forensic data and broader population-level sequences. This method produced likelihood ratios in the range of 100-100,000, demonstrating its potential to strengthen the statistical evaluation of forensic mtDNA evidence. We have developed an open-source R package `mitofreq` that implements our method, including a Shiny app where custom TLHG frequencies can be supplied.</description>

      <title>LCPan: efficient variation graph construction using Locally Consistent Parsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12205v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient and consistent string processing is critical in the exponentially growing genomic data era. Locally Consistent Parsing (LCP) addresses this need by partitioning an input genome string into short, exactly matching substrings (e.g., "cores"), ensuring consistency across partitions. Labeling the cores of an input string consistently not only provides a compact representation of the input but also enables the reapplication of LCP to refine the cores over multiple iterations, providing a progressively longer and more informative set of substrings for downstream analyses.
  We present the first iterative implementation of LCP with Lcptools and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying cores with minimal collisions. Experimental results show that the number of cores at the i^th iteration is O(n/c^i) for c ~ 2.34, while the average length and the average distance between consecutive cores are O(c^i). Compared to the popular sketching techniques, LCP produces significantly fewer cores, enabling a more compact representation and faster analyses. To demonstrate the advantages of LCP in genomic string processing in terms of computation and memory efficiency, we also introduce LCPan, an efficient variation graph constructor. We show that LCPan generates variation graphs &gt;10x faster than vg, while using &gt;13x less memory.</description>
