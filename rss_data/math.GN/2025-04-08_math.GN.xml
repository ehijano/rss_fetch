      <title>Separating domains from algebraic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04189v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every domain that fails to be algebraic admits the unit interval $[0, 1]$ as its Scott-continuous retract. As a result, every countable domain is algebraic.</description>

      <title>Hyperspace convergences, bornologies and geometric set functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a bornology $\mathcal{S}$ of subsets of a metric space $(X,d)$, we consider the following unified approaches of hyperspace convergence: convergence induced through uniform convergence of distance functionals ($\tau_{\mathcal{S},d}$-convergence); bornological convergence, and the weak convergence induced by a family of gap and excess functionals. An interesting problem regarding these convergences is to investigate when any two of them are equivalent. In this article, we investigate the relation of $\tau_{\mathcal{S},d}$-convergence with the other two convergences, which is not completely transparent. As a main tool for our investigation, we use the idea of pointwise enlargement of a set by a positive Lipschitz function. As applications of our results, we provide new proofs of some known results about Attouch-Wets convergence.</description>

      <title>Semiflows on finite topological spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study flows and semiflows defined on any given finite topological $T_0$-space $X$. We show that there exist non-trivial semiflows on $X$, unless $X$ is a minimal finite space. Specifically, non-trivial semiflows exist if and only if $X$ contains down beat points, and a non-trivial semiflow is essentially a strong deformation retraction. As a consequence of this result, we provide a new and concise proof that the only flow that can be defined on $X$ is the trivial flow. Finally, we discuss the number of different semiflows that can be defined on $X$ in terms of down beat points and other special points.</description>

      <title>A note on delay-inverse systems, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalization of an inverse system in a category was recently introduced, as well as that of the corresponding pro-category These so called the delay-inverse systems and delay-pro-category could potentially yield a new theory of (delay-) inverse systems as well as a kind of coarser abstract shape theory. However, we have proven that, whenever an indexing set has cardinality $\aleph_{n}, n\in\mathbb{N}_{0}$, the potential new theory reduces, in its essence (the classification and invariants), to the ordinary one.</description>

      <title>Bridging Graph-Theoretical and Topological Approaches: Connectivity and Jordan Curves in the Digital Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article explores the connections between graph-theoretical and topological approaches in the study of the Jordan curve theorem for grids. Building on the foundational work of Rosenfeld, who developed adjacency-based concepts on $\mathbb{Z}^2$, and the subsequent introduction of the topological digital plane $\mathbb{K}^2$ with the Khalimsky topology by Khalimsky, Kopperman, and Meyer, we investigate the interplay between these perspectives. Inspired by the work of Khalimsky, Kopperman, and Meyer, we define an operator $\Gamma^*$ transforming subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ into subsets of $\mathbb{K}^2$. This operator is essential for demonstrating how 8-paths, 4-connectivity, and other discrete structures in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ correspond to topological properties in $\mathbb{K}^2$. Moreover, we address whether the topological Jordan curve theorem for $\mathbb{K}^2$ can be derived from the graph-theoretical version on $\mathbb{Z}^2$. Our results illustrate the deep and intricate relationship between these two methodologies, shedding light on their complementary roles in digital topology.</description>

      <title>Definable convolution and idempotent Keisler measures III. Generic stability, generic transitivity, and revised Newelski's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study idempotent measures and the structure of the convolution semigroups of measures over definable groups. We isolate the property of generic transitivity and demonstrate that it is sufficient (and necessary) to develop stable group theory localizing on a generically stable type, including invariant stratified ranks and connected components. We establish generic transitivity of generically stable idempotent types in important new cases, including abelian groups in arbitrary theories and arbitrary groups in rosy theories, and characterize them as generics of connected type-definable subgroups. Using tools from Keisler's randomization theory, we generalize some of these results from types to generically stable Keisler measures, and classify idempotent generically stable measures in abelian groups as (unique) translation-invariant measures on type-definable fsg subgroups. This provides a partial definable counterpart to the classical work of Rudin, Cohen and Pym for locally compact topological groups. Finally, we provide an explicit construction of a minimal left ideal in the convolution semigroup of measures for an arbitrary countable NIP group, from a minimal left ideal in the corresponding semigroup on types and a canonical measure constructed on its ideal subgroup. In order to achieve it, we in particular prove the revised Ellis group conjecture of Newelski for countable NIP groups.</description>
