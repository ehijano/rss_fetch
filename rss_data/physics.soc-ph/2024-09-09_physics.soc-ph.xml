      <title>Multilayer networks describing interactions in urban systems: a digital twin of five cities in Spain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks specifying who interacts with whom are crucial for mathematical models of epidemic spreading. In the context of emerging diseases, these networks have the potential to encode multiple interaction contexts where non-pharmaceutical interventions can be introduced, allowing for proper comparisons among different intervention strategies in a plethora of contexts. Consequently, a multilayer network describing interactions in a population and detailing their contexts in different layers constitutes an appropriate tool for such descriptions. These approaches however become challenging in large-scale systems such as cities, particularly in a framework where data protection policies are enhanced. In this work, we present a methodology to build such multilayer networks and make those corresponding to five Spanish cities available. Our work uses approaches informed by multiple available datasets to create realistic digital twins of the citizens and their interactions and provides a playground to explore different pandemic scenario in realistic settings for better preparedness.</description>

      <title>Jam-absorption driving with data assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a data assimilation (DA) framework based on the extended Kalman filter-cell transmission model, designed to assist jam-absorption driving (JAD) operation to alleviate sag traffic congestion. To ascertain and demonstrate the effectiveness of the DA framework for JAD operation, in this paper, we initially investigated its impact on the motion and control performance of a single absorbing vehicle. Numerical results show that the DA framework effectively mitigated underestimated or overestimated control failures of JAD caused by misestimation of key parameters (e.g., free flow speed and critical density) of the traffic flow fundamental diagram. The findings suggest that the proposed DA framework can reduce control failures and prevent significant declines and deteriorations in JAD performance caused by changes in traffic characteristics, e.g., weather conditions or traffic composition.</description>

      <title>Simple fusion-fission quantifies Israel-Palestine violence and suggests multi-adversary solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Why humans fight has no easy answer. However, understanding better how humans fight could inform future interventions, hidden shifts and casualty risk. Fusion-fission describes the well-known grouping behavior of fish etc. fighting for survival in the face of strong opponents: they form clusters ('fusion') which provide collective benefits and a cluster scatters when it senses danger ('fission'). Here we show how similar clustering (fusion-fission) of human fighters provides a unified quantitative explanation for complex casualty patterns across decades of Israel-Palestine region violence, as well as the October 7 surprise attack -- and uncovers a hidden post-October 7 shift. State-of-the-art data shows this fighter fusion-fission in action. It also predicts future 'super-shock' attacks that will be more lethal than October 7 and will arrive earlier. It offers a multi-adversary solution. Our results -- which include testable formulae and a plug-and-play simulation -- enable concrete risk assessments of future casualties and policy-making grounded by fighter behavior.</description>

      <title>Language Understanding as a Constraint on Consensus Size in LLM Societies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) are going towards collaborative tasks where several agents interact with each other like in an LLM society. In such a setting, large groups of LLMs could reach consensus about arbitrary norms for which there is no information supporting one option over another, regulating their own behavior in a self-organized way. In human societies, the ability to reach consensus without institutions has a limit in the cognitive capacities of humans. To understand if a similar phenomenon characterizes also LLMs, we apply methods from complexity science and principles from behavioral sciences in a new approach of AI anthropology. We find that LLMs are able to reach consensus in groups and that the opinion dynamics of LLMs can be understood with a function parametrized by a majority force coefficient that determines whether consensus is possible. This majority force is stronger for models with higher language understanding capabilities and decreases for larger groups, leading to a critical group size beyond which, for a given LLM, consensus is unfeasible. This critical group size grows exponentially with the language understanding capabilities of models and for the most advanced models, it can reach an order of magnitude beyond the typical size of informal human groups.</description>

      <title>Emergence of condensation patterns in kinetic equations for opinion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we define a class of models to understand the impact of population size on opinion formation dynamics, a phenomenon usually related to group conformity. To this end, we introduce a new kinetic model in which the interaction frequency is weighted by the kinetic density. In the quasi-invariant regime, this model reduces to a Kaniadakis-Quarati-type equation with nonlinear drift, originally introduced for the dynamics of bosons in a spatially homogeneous setting. From the obtained PDE for the evolution of the opinion density, we determine the regime of parameters for which a critical mass exists and triggers blow-up of the solution. Therefore, the model is capable of describing strong conformity phenomena in cases where the total density of individuals holding a given opinion exceeds a fixed critical size. In the final part, several numerical experiments demonstrate the features of the introduced class of models and the related consensus effects.</description>

      <title>Modeling, Inference, and Prediction in Mobility-Based Compartmental Models for Epidemiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical compartmental models in epidemiology often assume a homogeneous population for simplicity, which neglects the inherent heterogeneity among individuals. This assumption frequently leads to inaccurate predictions when applied to real-world data. For example, evidence has shown that classical models overestimate the final pandemic size in the H1N1-2009 and COVID-19 outbreaks. To address this issue, we introduce individual mobility as a key factor in disease transmission and control. We characterize disease dynamics using mobility distribution functions for each compartment and propose a mobility-based compartmental model that incorporates population heterogeneity. Our results demonstrate that, for the same basic reproduction number, our mobility-based model predicts a smaller final pandemic size compared to the classical models, effectively addressing the common overestimation problem. Additionally, we infer mobility distributions from the time series of the infected population. We provide sufficient conditions for uniquely identifying the mobility distribution from a dataset and propose a machine-learning-based approach to learn mobility from both synthesized and real-world data.</description>
