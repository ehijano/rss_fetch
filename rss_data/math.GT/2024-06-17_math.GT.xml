      <title>Classification of Cellular Fake Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generic polyhedra are interesting mathematical objects to study in their own right. In this paper, we initialize a systematic study of two-dimensional generic polyhedra with an eye towards applications to low-dimensional topology, especially the Andrews-Curtis and Zeeman conjectures. After recalling the basic notions of generic polyhedra and fake surfaces, we derive some interesting properties of fake surfaces. Our main result is a complete classification of acyclic cellular fake surfaces up to complexity 4 and a classification of acyclic cellular fake surfaces without small disks of complexity 5. From this classification, we prove the contractibility conjecture for acyclic cellular fake surfaces of complexity 4, and the embedded disk conjecture up to complexity 5. We provide evidence for the conjectures that the probability of being a spine among fake surfaces is 0 and that every contractible fake surface has an embedded disk.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Multifiltering Functions Using Multiparameter Discrete Morse Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multiparameter filtration, or a multifiltration, may in many cases be seen as the collection of sublevel sets of a vector function, which we call a multifiltering function. The main objective of this paper is to obtain a better understanding of such functions through multiparameter discrete Morse (MDM) theory, which is an extension of Morse-Forman theory to vector-valued functions. Notably, we prove algorithmically that any multifiltering function defined on a simplicial complex can always be approximated by a compatible MDM function. Moreover, we define the Pareto set of a discrete multifiltering function and show that the concept links directly to that of critical simplices of a MDM function. Finally, we experiment with these notions using triangular meshes.</description>

      <title>Classification of differentiable structures on the non-Hausdorff line with two origins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify differentiable structures on a line $\mathbb{L}$ with two origins being a non-Hausdorff but $T_1$ one-dimensional manifold obtained by ``doubling'' $0$. For $k\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$ let $H$ be the group of homeomorphisms $h$ of $\mathbb{R}$ such that $h(0)=0$ and the restriction of $h$ to $\mathbb{R}\setminus0$ is a $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-diffeomorphism. Let also $D$ be the subgroup of $H$ consisting of $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-diffeomorphisms of $\mathbb{R}$ also fixing $0$. It is shown that there is a natural bijection between $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-structures on $\mathbb{L}$ (up to a $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-diffeomorphism fixing both origins) and double $D$-coset classes $D \setminus H / D = \{ D h D \mid h \in H\}$.
  Moreover, the set of all $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-structures on $\mathbb{L}$ (up to a $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-diffeomorphism which may also exchange origins) are in one-to-one correspondence with the set of double $(D,\pm)$-coset classes $D \setminus H^{\pm} / D = \{ D h D \cup D h^{-1} D \mid h \in H\}$.
  In particular, in contrast with the real line, the line with two origins $\mathbb{L}$ admits uncountably many pair-wise non-diffeomorphic $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-structures for each $k=1,2,\ldots,\infty$.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of 2-bridge link complements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reprove a necessary condition for the Sakuma-Weeks triangulation of a 2-bridge link complement to be minimal in terms of the mapping class describing its alternating 4-string braid construction. For the 2-bridge links satisfying this condition we construct explicit angle structures on the Sakuma-Weeks triangulations and compute both multiplicative and additive lower bounds on the complexity of the link complements via volume estimates. These lower bounds are an improvement on existing volume estimates for the 2-bridge links examined.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Generalized Augmented Braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalized augmented link of a knot $K$ is a link obtained by adding trivial components to $K$ that bound $n$-punctured disks. In this paper we consider that $K$ is given by a positive braid with at least one full twist. We characterize when the generalized augmented links of $K$ have hyperbolic geometry.</description>

      <title>Acylindrical hyperbolicity and the centers of Artin groups that are not free of infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charney and Morris-Wright showed acylindrical hyperbolicity of Artin groups of infinite type associated with graphs that are not joins, by studying clique-cube complexes and the actions on them. The authors developed their study and clarified when acylindrical hyperbolicity holds for Artin groups of infinite type associated with graphs that are not cones. In this paper, we introduce reduced clique-cube complexes. By using them, we show acylindrical hyperbolicity of irreducible Artin groups associated with graphs that are not cliques, that is, irreducible Artin groups that are not free of infinity. Such Artin groups contain infinite type Artin groups of type FC. As an application, we see that the centers of such Artin groups are finite, and that actually they are trivial in many cases.</description>

Abstract: A fullerene, or buckyball, is a trivalent graph on the sphere with only pentagonal and hexagonal faces. Building on ideas of Thurston, we use modular forms to give an exact formula for the number of oriented fullerenes with a given number of vertices.</description>

      <title>Automatic continuity of pure mapping class groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We completely classify the orientable infinite-type surfaces $S$ such that $\operatorname{PMap}(S)$, the pure mapping class group, has automatic continuity. This classification includes surfaces with noncompact boundary. In the case of surfaces with finitely many ends and no noncompact boundary components, we prove the mapping class group $\operatorname{Map}(S)$ does not have automatic continuity. We also completely classify the surfaces such that $\overline{\operatorname{PMap}_c(S)}$, the subgroup of the pure mapping class group composed of elements with representatives that can be approximated by compactly supported homeomorphisms, has automatic continuity. In some cases when $\overline{\operatorname{PMap}_c(S)}$ has automatic continuity, we show any homomorphism from $\overline{\operatorname{PMap}_c(S)}$ to a countable group is trivial.</description>

      <title>The length spectrum of random hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the length spectrum of a model of random hyperbolic 3-manifolds introduced by Petri and Raimbault. These are compact manifolds with boundary constructed by randomly gluing truncated tetrahedra along their faces. We prove that, as the volume tends to infinity, their length spectrum converge in distribution to a Poisson point process on $\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}$, with computable intensity $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>The space of immersed polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Schwarz-Christoffel formula to show that for every $n\geq 3$, the space of labelled immersed $n$-gons in the plane up to similarity is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{2n-4}$. We then prove that all immersed triangles, quadrilaterals, and pentagons are embedded, from which it follows that the space of labelled simple $n$-gons up to similarity is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{2n-4}$ if $n\in \{3,4,5\}$. This was first shown by Gonz\'ales and L\'opez-L\'opez for $n=4$ and conjectured to be true for every $n\geq 5$ by Gonz\'alez and Sedano-Mendoza.</description>

      <title>C^2-Morse Functions on the Deligne-Mumford compactification of the moduli space M_{g,n} bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a series of C^2-Morse functions on the Deligne-Mumford compactification M_{g,n} bar of the moduli space of genus g Riemann/hyperbolic surfaces with n punctures. This series of functions converges to the systole function, which is topologically Morse. We will show that the critical points of our functions approach those of systole sublinearly, stratum-wise, and with the same indices. These functions might be the first explicit examples of C^2-Morse functions on M_{g,n} bar, and the Morse handle decomposition may give rise to the first example of a natural cell decomposition of M_{g,n} bar, that works no matter if n is positive or equal to 0.</description>

      <title>The $L^1$-$L^\infty$-geometry of Teichm\"uller space -- Second order infinitesimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $L^1$-$L^\infty$ geometry is the Finsler geometry of the Teichm\"uller space by the Teichm\"uller metric and the $L^1$-norm function of holomorphic quadratic differentials. In this paper, aiming to develop the $L^1$-$L^\infty$-geometry and the differential geometry on the Teichm\"uller space, we formulate the second order infinitesimal structures (the infinitesimal structures on the (co)tangent bundles) over the Teichm\"uller space. We will give model spaces of the second order infinitesimal spaces.
  By applying our formulation, we give affirmative answers to two folklore. We first show that the map from the space of holomorphic quadratic differentials to the tangent bundle defined by Teichm\"uller Beltrami differentials is a real-analytic diffeomorphism on every stratum in the space of holomorphic quadratic differentials. Second, we show that the Teichm\"uller metric is real-analytic on the image of each stratum. We also observe a new duality between the Teichm\"uller metric and the $L^1$-norm function at the infinitesimal level.</description>
