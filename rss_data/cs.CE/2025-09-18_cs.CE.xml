      <title>Multi-Objective Loss Balancing in Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Fluid Flow Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising machine learning approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, PINNs face significant challenges in balancing multi-objective losses, as multiple competing loss terms such as physics residuals, boundary conditions, and initial conditions must be appropriately weighted. While various loss balancing schemes have been proposed, they have been implemented within neural network architectures with fixed activation functions, and their effectiveness has been assessed using simpler PDEs. We hypothesize that the effectiveness of loss balancing schemes depends not only on the balancing strategy itself, but also on the neural network's inherent function approximation capabilities, which are influenced by the choice of activation function. In this paper, we extend existing solutions by incorporating trainable activation functions within the neural network architecture and evaluate the proposed approach on complex fluid flow applications modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations. Our evaluation across diverse Navier-Stokes problems demonstrates that this proposed solution achieves root mean square error (RMSE) improvements ranging from 7.4\% to 95.2\% across different scenarios. These findings underscore the importance of carefully considering the interaction between activation function selection and balancing algorithms when designing loss balancing strategies.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian-Eulerian Multiscale Data Assimilation in Physical Domain based on Conditional Gaussian Nonlinear System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research aims to further investigate the process of Lagrangian-Eulerian Multiscale Data Assimilation (LEMDA) by replacing the Fourier space with the physical domain. Such change in the perspective of domain introduces the advantages of being able to deal in non-periodic system and more intuitive representation of localised phenomena or time-dependent problems. The context of the domain for this paper was set as sea ice floe trajectories to recover the ocean eddies in the Arctic regions, which led the model to be derived from two-layer Quasi geostrophic (QG) model. The numerical solution to this model utilises the Conditional Gaussian Nonlinear System (CGNS) to accommodate the inherent non-linearity in analytical and continuous manner. The normalised root mean square error (RMSE) and pattern correlation (Corr) are used to evaluate the performance of the posterior mean of the model. The results corroborate the effectiveness of exploiting the two-layer QG model in physical domain. Nonetheless, the paper still discusses opportunities of improvement, such as deploying neural network (NN) to accelerate the recovery of local particle of Lagrangian DA for the fine scale.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of conductive nonmagnetic objects in presence of the Lenz effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To model and predict the dynamics of conductive nonmagnetic objects within the MRI room under the influence of Lenz effect. Methods: The dynamics are described by an ordinary differential equation and the Lenz effect approximated by recognizing that the skin effect is negligible. This separated Lenz effect dependency on the object position and velocity, leading to a simple numerical procedure for objects of any shape. Results: The model and numerical procedure were validated with experimental data recording the rotation of an aluminum plate falling inside a 1.5 T MRI scanner. The model was also applied for studying the translation of an aluminum plate pushed with constant force towards the MRI bore through the fringe field. Conclusion: The collected results showed that it is possible to obtain accurate predictions of motion in the presence of Lenz effect by neglecting the skin effect while determining the electric currents induced in the metallic object during each infinitesimal motion step.</description>

      <title>Warp Quantification Analysis: A Framework For Path-based Signal Alignment Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic time warping (DTW) is widely used to align time series evolving on mismatched timescales, yet most applications reduce alignment to a scalar distance. We introduce warp quantification analysis (WQA), a framework that derives interpretable geometric and structural descriptors from DTW paths. Controlled simulations showed that each metric selectively tracked its intended driver with minimal crosstalk. Applied to large-scale fMRI, WQA revealed distinct network signatures and complementary associations with schizophrenia negative symptom severity, capturing clinically meaningful variability beyond DTW distance. WQA transforms DTW from a single-score method into a family of alignment descriptors, offering a principled and generalizable extension for richer characterization of temporal coupling across domains where nonlinear normalization is essential.</description>

      <title>A cell centered Galerkin method for miscible displacement in heterogeneous porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a cell centered Galerkin (CCG) method applied to miscible displacement problems in heterogeneous porous media. The CCG approach combines concepts from finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods to arrive at an efficient lowest-order approximation (one unknown per cell). We demonstrate that the CCG method can be defined using classical DG weak formulations, only requires one unknown per cell, and is able to deliver comparable accuracy and improved efficiency over traditional higher-order interior penalty DG methods. In addition, we prove that the CCG method for a model Poisson problem gives rise to a inverse-positive matrix in 1D. A plethora of computational experiments in 2D and 3D showcase the effectiveness of the CCG method for highly heterogeneous flow and transport problems in porous media. Comparisons between CCG and classical DG methods are included.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed GCN-LSTM Framework for Long-Term Forecasting of 2D and 3D Microstructure Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a physics-informed framework that integrates graph convolutional networks (GCN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture to forecast microstructure evolution over long time horizons in both 2D and 3D with remarkable performance across varied metrics. The proposed framework is composition-aware, trained jointly on datasets with different compositions, and operates in latent graph space, which enables the model to capture compositions and morphological dynamics while remaining computationally efficient. Compressing and encoding phase-field simulation data with convolutional autoencoders and operating in Latent graph space facilitates efficient modeling of microstructural evolution across composition, dimensions, and long-term horizons. The framework captures the spatial and temporal patterns of evolving microstructures while enabling long-range forecasting at reduced computational cost after training.</description>

      <title>Identifying companies and financial actors exposed to marine tipping points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Climate change and other anthropogenic pressures are likely to induce tipping points in marine ecosystems, potentially leading to declines in primary productivity and fisheries. Despite increasing attention to nature-related financial risks and opportunities within the ocean economy, the extent to which these tipping points could affect investors has remained largely unexplored. Here we used satellite data to track fishing vessels operating in areas prone to marine regime shifts, as identified by their loss of resilience and vulnerability to marine heatwaves, and uncovered their corporate beneficial owners and shareholders. Despite some data gaps, we identified key countries, companies, and shareholders exposed to tipping risk. We also outline the potential challenges and opportunities that these actors may face if marine ecosystems shift to less productive states.</description>
