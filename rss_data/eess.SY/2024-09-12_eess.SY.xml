      <title>Distributed Controller Design for Discrete-Time Systems Via the Integration of Extended LMI and Clique-Wise Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses a distributed controller design problem for discrete-time systems using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Sparsity constraints on control gains of distributed controllers result in conservatism via the convexification of the existing methods such as the extended LMI method. In order to mitigate the conservatism, we introduce a novel LMI formulation for this problem, utilizing the clique-wise decomposition method from our previous work on continuous-time systems. By reformulating the sparsity constraint on the gain matrix within cliques, this method achieves a broader solution set. Also, the analytical superiority of our method is confirmed through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Disturbance-Robust Backup Control Barrier Functions: Safety Under Uncertain Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining a controlled invariant set is crucial for safety-critical control with control barrier functions (CBFs) but is non-trivial for complex nonlinear systems and constraints. Backup control barrier functions allow such sets to be constructed online in a computationally tractable manner by examining the evolution (or flow) of the system under a known backup control law. However, for systems with unmodeled disturbances, this flow cannot be directly computed, making the current methods inadequate for assuring safety in these scenarios. To address this gap, we leverage bounds on the nominal and disturbed flow to compute a forward invariant set online by ensuring safety of an expanding norm ball tube centered around the nominal system evolution. We prove that this set results in robust control constraints which guarantee safety of the disturbed system via our Disturbance-Robust Backup Control Barrier Function (DR-BCBF) solution. Additionally, the efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated in simulation, applied to a double integrator problem and a rigid body spacecraft rotation problem with rate constraints.</description>

      <title>Resilient Learning-Based Control Under Denial-of-Service Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have proposed a resilient reinforcement learning method for discrete-time linear systems with unknown parameters, under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The proposed method is based on policy iteration that learns the optimal controller from input-state data amidst DoS attacks. We achieve an upper bound for the DoS duration to ensure closed-loop stability. The resilience of the closed-loop system, when subjected to DoS attacks with the learned controller and an internal model, has been thoroughly examined. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated on an inverted pendulum on a cart.</description>

      <title>Critical link identification of power system vulnerability based on modified graph attention network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the expansion of the power grid and the increase of the proportion of new energy sources, the uncertainty and random factors of the power grid increase, endangering the safe operation of the system. It is particularly important to find out the critical links of vulnerability in the power grid to ensure the reliability of the power grid operation. Aiming at the problem that the identification speed of the traditional critical link of vulnerability identification methods is slow and difficult to meet the actual operation requirements of the power grid, the improved graph attention network (IGAT) based identification method of the critical link is proposed. First, the evaluation index set is established by combining the complex network theory and the actual operation data of power grid. Secondly, IGAT is used to dig out the mapping relationship between various indicators and critical links of vulnerability during the operation of the power grid, establish the identification model of critical links of vulnerability, and optimize the original graph attention network considering the training accuracy and efficiency. Thirdly, the original data set is obtained through simulation, and the identification model is trained, verified and tested. Finally, the model is applied to the improved IEEE 30-node system and the actual power grid, and the results show that the proposed method is feasible, and the accuracy and speed are better than that of traditional methods. It has certain engineering utilization value.</description>

      <title>Covariance Intersection-based Invariant Kalman Filtering(DInCIKF) for Distributed Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to distributed pose estimation in the multi-agent system based on an invariant Kalman filter with covariance intersection. Our method models uncertainties using Lie algebra and applies object-level observations within Lie groups, which have practical application value. We integrate covariance intersection to handle estimates that are correlated and use the invariant Kalman filter for merging independent data sources. This strategy allows us to effectively tackle the complex correlations of cooperative localization among agents, ensuring our estimates are neither too conservative nor overly confident. Additionally, we examine the consistency and stability of our algorithm, providing evidence of its reliability and effectiveness in managing multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Communities from Equilibria of Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies community detection for a nonlinear opinion dynamics model from its equilibria. It is assumed that the underlying network is generated from a stochastic block model with two communities, where agents are assigned with community labels and edges are added independently based on these labels. Agents update their opinions following a nonlinear rule that incorporates saturation effects on interactions. It is shown that clustering based on a single equilibrium can detect most community labels (i.e., achieving almost exact recovery), if the two communities differ in size and link probabilities. When the two communities are identical in size and link probabilities, and the inter-community connections are denser than intra-community ones, the algorithm can achieve almost exact recovery under negative influence weights but fails under positive influence weights. Utilizing the fixed point equation and spectral methods, we also propose a detection algorithm based on multiple equilibria, which can detect communities with positive influence weights. Numerical experiments demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Linear energy storage and flexibility model with ramp rate, ramping, deadline and capacity constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power networks are evolving with increased active components such as energy storage and flexibility derived from loads such as electric vehicles, heat pumps, industrial processes, etc. Better models are needed to accurately represent these assets; otherwise, their true capabilities might be over or under-estimated. In this work, we propose a new energy storage and flexibility arbitrage model that accounts for both ramp (power) and capacity (energy) limits, while accurately modelling the ramp rate constraint. The proposed models are linear in structure and efficiently solved using off-the-shelf solvers as a linear programming problem. We also provide an online repository for wider application and benchmarking. Finally, numerical case studies are performed to quantify the sensitivity of ramp rate constraint on the operational goal of profit maximization for energy storage and flexibility. The results are encouraging for assets with a slow ramp rate limit. We observe that for resources with a ramp rate limit of 10% of the maximum ramp limit, the marginal value of performing energy arbitrage using such resources exceeds 65% and up to 90% of the maximum profit compared to the case with no ramp rate limitations.</description>

      <title>Impacts of EPA Power Plant Emissions Regulations on the US Electricity Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking aim at one of the largest greenhouse gas emitting sectors, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized new regulations on power plant greenhouse gas emissions in May 2024. These rules take the form of different emissions performance standards for different classes of power plant technologies, creating a complex set of regulations that make it difficult to understand their consequential impacts on power system capacity, operations, and emissions without dedicated and sophisticated modeling. Here, we enhance a state-of-the-art power system capacity expansion model by incorporating new detailed operational constraints tailored to different technologies to represent the EPA's rules. Our results show that adopting these new regulations could reduce US power sector emissions in 2040 to 51% below the 2022 level (vs 26% without the rules). Regulations on coal-fired power plants drive the largest share of reductions. Regulations on new gas turbines incrementally reduce emissions but lower overall efficiency of the gas fleet, increasing the average cost of carbon mitigation. Therefore, we explore several alternative emission mitigation strategies. By comparing these alternatives with regulations finalized by EPA, we highlight the importance of accelerating the retirement of inefficient fossil fuel-fired generators and applying consistent and strict emissions regulations to all gas generators, regardless of their vintage, to cost-effectively achieve deep decarbonization and avoid biasing investment decisions towards less efficient generators.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Falsification for Learning-Based Control Systems: A Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Testing controllers in safety-critical systems is vital for ensuring their safety and preventing failures. In this paper, we address the falsification problem within learning-based closed-loop control systems through simulation. This problem involves the identification of counterexamples that violate system safety requirements and can be formulated as an optimization task based on these requirements. Using full-fidelity simulator data in this optimization problem can be computationally expensive. To improve efficiency, we propose a multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization falsification framework that harnesses simulators with varying levels of accuracy. Our proposed framework can transition between different simulators and establish meaningful relationships between them. Through multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization, we determine both the optimal system input likely to be a counterexample and the appropriate fidelity level for assessment. We evaluated our approach across various Gym environments, each featuring different levels of fidelity. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization is more computationally efficient than full-fidelity Bayesian optimization and other baseline methods in detecting counterexamples. A Python implementation of the algorithm is available at https://github.com/SAILRIT/MFBO_Falsification.</description>

      <title>Value of Communication: Data-Driven Topology Optimization for Distributed Linear Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication topology is a crucial part of a distributed control implementation for cyber-physical systems, yet is typically treated as a constraint within control design problems rather than a design variable. We propose a data-driven method for designing an optimal topology for the purpose of distributed control when a system model is unavailable or unaffordable, via a mixed-integer second-order conic program. The approach demonstrates improved control performance over random topologies in simulations and efficiently drops links which have a small effect on predictor accuracy, which we show correlates well with closed-loop control cost.</description>

      <title>Optimal Management of Grid-Interactive Efficient Buildings via Safe Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have achieved significant success in managing grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEBs). However, RL does not carry intrinsic guarantees of constraint satisfaction, which may lead to severe safety consequences. Besides, in GEB control applications, most existing safe RL approaches rely only on the regularisation parameters in neural networks or penalty of rewards, which often encounter challenges with parameter tuning and lead to catastrophic constraint violations. To provide enforced safety guarantees in controlling GEBs, this paper designs a physics-inspired safe RL method whose decision-making is enhanced through safe interaction with the environment. Different energy resources in GEBs are optimally managed to minimize energy costs and maximize customer comfort. The proposed approach can achieve strict constraint guarantees based on prior knowledge of a set of developed hard steady-state rules. Simulations on the optimal management of GEBs, including heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), solar photovoltaics, and energy storage systems, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Disinfectant Control in Drinking Water Networks: Integrating Advection-Dispersion-Reaction Models and Byproduct Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective disinfection is essential for maintaining water quality standards in distribution networks. Chlorination, as the most used technique, ensures safe water by maintaining sufficient chlorine residuals but also leads to the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs). These DBPs pose health risks, highlighting the need for chlorine injection control (CIC) by booster stations to balance safety and DBPs formation. Prior studies have followed various approaches to address this research problem. However, most of these studies overlook the changing flow conditions and their influence on the evolution of the chlorine and DBPs concentrations by integrating simplified transport-reaction models into CIC. In contrast, this paper proposes a novel CIC method that: (i) integrates multi-species dynamics, (ii) allows for a more accurate representation of the reaction dynamics of chlorine, other substances, and the resulting DBPs formation, and (iii) optimizes for the regulation of chlorine concentrations subject to EPA mandates thereby mitigating network-wide DBPs formation. The novelty of this study lies in its incorporation of time-dependent controllability analysis that captures the control coverage of each booster station. The effectiveness of the proposed CIC method is demonstrated through its application and validation via numerical case studies on different water networks with varying scales, initial conditions, and parameters.</description>

      <title>Optimal Operation of Distribution System Operator and the Impact of Peer-to-Peer Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading, commonly recognized as a decentralized approach, has emerged as a popular way to better utilize distributed energy resources (DERs). In order to better manage this user-side decentralized approach from a system operator's point of view, this paper proposes an optimal operation approach for distribution system operators (DSO), comprising internal prosumers who engage in P2P transactions. The DSO is assumed to be a financial neutral entity, holding the responsibility of aggregating the surplus energy and deficit demand of prosumers after their P2P transactions while dispatching DERs and considering network integrity. Impacts of P2P transactions on DSO's optimal operation have been studied. Results indicate that energy matching P2P trading where only the total amount of energy over a given period of time is defined may affect quantities of energy exchanged between the DSO and the wholesale market, but not internal dispatch decisions of the DSO. Different levels of real-time power consistency may lead to different total surpluses in the distribution network. For the real-time power matching P2P trading, as a special case of energy matching P2P trading, the provided energy and total surplus are not affected. In other words, DSO can safely ignore P2P transactions if they follow the format defined in this paper. Case studies verify these conclusions and further demonstrate that P2P trading will not affect physical power flow of the whole system, but the financial distribution between the DSO and prosumers.</description>

      <title>Improving Initial Transients of Online Learning Echo State Network Control System via Feedback Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Echo state networks (ESNs) have gained popularity in online learning control systems due to their easy training. However, online learning ESN controllers often undergo slow convergence and produce unexpected outputs during the initial transient phase. Existing solutions, such as prior training or control mode switching, can be complex and have drawbacks. This work offers a simple yet effective method to address these initial transients by integrating a feedback proportional-differential (P-D) controller. Simulation results show that the proposed control system exhibits fast convergence and strong robustness against plant dynamics and hyperparameter changes. This work is expected to offer practical benefits for engineers seeking to implement online learning ESN control systems.</description>

      <title>MPPI-Generic: A CUDA Library for Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new C++/CUDA library for GPU-accelerated stochastic optimization called MPPI-Generic. It provides implementations of Model Predictive Path Integral control, Tube-Model Predictive Path Integral Control, and Robust Model Predictive Path Integral Control, and allows for these algorithms to be used across many pre-existing dynamics models and cost functions. Furthermore, researchers can create their own dynamics models or cost functions following our API definitions without needing to change the actual Model Predictive Path Integral Control code. Finally, we compare computational performance to other popular implementations of Model Predictive Path Integral Control over a variety of GPUs to show the real-time capabilities our library can allow for.

      <title>Scoping Sustainable Collaborative Mixed Reality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed Reality (MR) is becoming ubiquitous as it finds its applications in education, healthcare, and other sectors beyond leisure. While MR end devices, such as headsets, have low energy intensity, the total number of devices and resource requirements of the entire MR ecosystem, which includes cloud and edge endpoints, can be significant. The resulting operational and embodied carbon footprint of MR has led to concerns about its environmental implications. Recent research has explored reducing the carbon footprint of MR devices by exploring hardware design space or network optimizations. However, many additional avenues for enhancing MR's sustainability remain open, including energy savings in non-processor components and carbon-aware optimizations in collaborative MR ecosystems. In this paper, we aim to identify key challenges, existing solutions, and promising research directions for improving MR sustainability. We explore adjacent fields of embedded and mobile computing systems for insights and outline MR-specific problems requiring new solutions. We identify the challenges that must be tackled to enable researchers, developers, and users to avail themselves of these opportunities in collaborative MR systems.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning of Dynamic Systems using System Identification Toolbox(TM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MATLAB(R) releases over the last 3 years have witnessed a continuing growth in the dynamic modeling capabilities offered by the System Identification Toolbox(TM). The emphasis has been on integrating deep learning architectures and training techniques that facilitate the use of deep neural networks as building blocks of nonlinear models. The toolbox offers neural state-space models which can be extended with auto-encoding features that are particularly suited for reduced-order modeling of large systems. The toolbox contains several other enhancements that deepen its integration with the state-of-art machine learning techniques, leverage auto-differentiation features for state estimation, and enable a direct use of raw numeric matrices and timetables for training models.</description>

      <title>An Open-Source Soft Robotic Platform for Autonomous Aerial Manipulation in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aerial manipulation combines the versatility and speed of flying platforms with the functional capabilities of mobile manipulation, which presents significant challenges due to the need for precise localization and control. Traditionally, researchers have relied on offboard perception systems, which are limited to expensive and impractical specially equipped indoor environments. In this work, we introduce a novel platform for autonomous aerial manipulation that exclusively utilizes onboard perception systems. Our platform can perform aerial manipulation in various indoor and outdoor environments without depending on external perception systems. Our experimental results demonstrate the platform's ability to autonomously grasp various objects in diverse settings. This advancement significantly improves the scalability and practicality of aerial manipulation applications by eliminating the need for costly tracking solutions. To accelerate future research, we open source our ROS 2 software stack and custom hardware design, making our contributions accessible to the broader research community.</description>

      <title>Critically Damped Third-Order Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While systems analysis has been studied for decades in the context of control theory, it has only been recently used to improve the convergence of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models. This work describes a novel improvement to Third- Order Langevin Dynamics (TOLD), a recent diffusion method that performs better than its predecessors. This improvement, abbreviated TOLD++, is carried out by critically damping the TOLD forward transition matrix similarly to Dockhorn's Critically-Damped Langevin Dynamics (CLD). Specifically, it exploits eigen-analysis of the forward transition matrix to derive the optimal set of dynamics under the original TOLD scheme. TOLD++ is theoretically guaranteed to converge faster than TOLD, and its faster convergence is verified on the Swiss Roll toy dataset and CIFAR-10 dataset according to the FID metric.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Aleatoric and Epistemic Dynamics Uncertainty via Local Conformal Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether learned, simulated, or analytical, approximations of a robot's dynamics can be inaccurate when encountering novel environments. Many approaches have been proposed to quantify the aleatoric uncertainty of such methods, i.e. uncertainty resulting from stochasticity, however these estimates alone are not enough to properly estimate the uncertainty of a model in a novel environment, where the actual dynamics can change. Such changes can induce epistemic uncertainty, i.e. uncertainty due to a lack of information/data. Accounting for both epistemic and aleatoric dynamics uncertainty in a theoretically-grounded way remains an open problem. We introduce Local Uncertainty Conformal Calibration (LUCCa), a conformal prediction-based approach that calibrates the aleatoric uncertainty estimates provided by dynamics models to generate probabilistically-valid prediction regions of the system's state. We account for both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty non-asymptotically, without strong assumptions about the form of the true dynamics or how it changes. The calibration is performed locally in the state-action space, leading to uncertainty estimates that are useful for planning. We validate our method by constructing probabilistically-safe plans for a double-integrator under significant changes in dynamics.</description>

      <title>Data Driven based Dynamic Correction Prediction Model for NOx Emission of Coal Fired Boiler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.15600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The real-time prediction of NOx emissions is of great significance for pollutant emission control and unit operation of coal-fired power plants. Aiming at dealing with the large time delay and strong nonlinear characteristics of the combustion process, a dynamic correction prediction model considering the time delay is proposed. First, the maximum information coefficient (MIC) is used to calculate the delay time between related parameters and NOx emissions, and the modeling data set is reconstructed; then, an adaptive feature selection algorithm based on Lasso and ReliefF is constructed to filter out the high correlation with NOx emissions. Parameters; Finally, an extreme learning machine (ELM) model combined with error correction was established to achieve the purpose of dynamically predicting the concentration of nitrogen oxides. Experimental results based on actual data show that the same variable has different delay times under load conditions such as rising, falling, and steady; and there are differences in model characteristic variables under different load conditions; dynamic error correction strategies effectively improve modeling accuracy; proposed The prediction error of the algorithm under different working conditions is less than 2%, which can accurately predict the NOx concentration at the combustion outlet, and provide guidance for NOx emission monitoring and combustion process optimization.</description>

      <title>Secondary frequency control of islanded microgrid considering wind and solar stochastics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposed a model predictive control (MPC) secondary frequency control method considering wind and solar power generation stochastics. The extended state-space matrix including unknown stochastic power disturbance is established, and a Kalman filter is used to observe the unknown disturbance. The maximum available power of wind and solar DGs is estimated for establishing real-time variable constraints that prevent DGs output power from exceeding the limits. Through setting proper weight coefficients, wind and photovoltaic DGs are given priority to participate in secondary frequency control. The distributed restorative power of each DG is obtained by solving the quadratic programming (QP) optimal problem with variable constraints. Finally, a microgrid simulation model including multiple PV and wind DGs is built and performed in various scenarios compared to the traditional secondary frequency control method. The simulation results validated that the proposed method can enhance the frequency recovery speed and reduce the frequency deviation, especially in severe photovoltaic and wind fluctuations scenarios.</description>

      <title>Network-Aware and Welfare-Maximizing Dynamic Pricing for Energy Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of behind-the-meter (BTM) distributed energy resources (DER) within the electrical distribution network presents significant supply and demand flexibilities, but also introduces operational challenges such as voltage spikes and reverse power flows. In response, this paper proposes a network-aware dynamic pricing framework tailored for energy-sharing coalitions that aggregate small, but ubiquitous, BTM DER downstream of a distribution system operator's (DSO) revenue meter that adopts a generic net energy metering (NEM) tariff. By formulating a Stackelberg game between the energy-sharing market leader and its prosumers, we show that the dynamic pricing policy induces the prosumers toward a network-safe operation and decentrally maximizes the energy-sharing social welfare. The dynamic pricing mechanism involves a combination of a locational ex-ante dynamic price and an ex-post allocation, both of which are functions of the energy sharing's BTM DER. The ex-post allocation is proportionate to the price differential between the DSO NEM price and the energy-sharing locational price. Simulation results using real DER data and the IEEE 13-bus test systems illustrate the dynamic nature of network-aware pricing at each bus, and its impact on voltage.</description>

      <title>Analytical Optimized Traffic Flow Recovery for Large-scale Urban Transportation Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The implementation of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) has enhanced data collection in urban transportation through advanced traffic sensing devices. However, the high costs associated with installation and maintenance result in sparse traffic data coverage. To obtain complete, accurate, and high-resolution network-wide traffic flow data, this study introduces the Analytical Optimized Recovery (AOR) approach that leverages abundant GPS speed data alongside sparse flow data to estimate traffic flow in large-scale urban networks. The method formulates a constrained optimization framework that utilizes a quadratic objective function with l2 norm regularization terms to address the traffic flow recovery problem effectively and incorporates a Lagrangian relaxation technique to maintain non-negativity constraints. The effectiveness of this approach was validated in a large urban network in Shenzhen's Futian District using the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) platform. Analytical results indicate that the method achieves low estimation errors, affirming its suitability for comprehensive traffic analysis in urban settings with limited sensor deployment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to improve energy utilization and reduce carbon emissions, this paper presents a comprehensive energy system economic operation strategy of Incineration power plant Power-to-gas (P2G) with waste heat recovery. First, consider the coordinated operation of Incineration power plant - P2G, introduce the refined Power-to-gas two-stage operation process, add Hydrogen fuel cells on the basis of traditional Power-to-gas to reduce the energy ladder loss, and recycle the Methanation reaction heat; Secondly, in order to improve the energy utilization efficiency of Incineration, it is considered to install a waste heat recovery device containing a water source heat pump to recover the waste heat of flue gas and consume some electric energy, sourced from wind power, and add a CO2 separation device to combine the recovered CO2 with P2G to synthesize CH4 to achieve carbon recycling. Finally, within the framework of a tiered carbon trading mechanism an IES optimization model for electricity-heat with the goal of minimizing the system operating cost is constructed, and the GUROBI modeling optimization engine is used to solve this model. The results verify the effectiveness of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.01240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aiming at the problem that delay time is difficult to determine and prediction accuracy is low in building prediction model of SCR system, a dynamic modeling scheme based on a hybrid of multiple data-driven algorithms was proposed. First, processed abnormal values and normalized the data. To improve the relevance of the input data, used MIC to estimate delay time and reconstructed production data. Then used combined feature selection method to determine input variables. To further mine data information, VMD was used to decompose input time series. Finally, established NOx emission prediction model combining ELM and EC model. Experimental results based on actual historical operating data show that the MAPE of predicted results is 2.61%. Model sensitivity analysis shows that besides the amount of ammonia injection, the inlet oxygen concentration and the flue gas temperature have a significant impact on NOx emission, which should be considered in SCR process control and optimization.</description>

      <title>Guided Safe Shooting: model based reinforcement learning with safety constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.09743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, reinforcement learning successfully solved complex control tasks and decision-making problems, like the Go board game. Yet, there are few success stories when it comes to deploying those algorithms to real-world scenarios. One of the reasons is the lack of guarantees when dealing with and avoiding unsafe states, a fundamental requirement in critical control engineering systems. In this paper, we introduce Guided Safe Shooting (GuSS), a model-based RL approach that can learn to control systems with minimal violations of the safety constraints. The model is learned on the data collected during the operation of the system in an iterated batch fashion, and is then used to plan for the best action to perform at each time step. We propose three different safe planners, one based on a simple random shooting strategy and two based on MAP-Elites, a more advanced divergent-search algorithm. Experiments show that these planners help the learning agent avoid unsafe situations while maximally exploring the state space, a necessary aspect when learning an accurate model of the system. Furthermore, compared to model-free approaches, learning a model allows GuSS reducing the number of interactions with the real-system while still reaching high rewards, a fundamental requirement when handling engineering systems.</description>

      <title>Short-term power load forecasting method based on CNN-SAEDN-Res</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In deep learning, the load data with non-temporal factors are difficult to process by sequence models. This problem results in insufficient precision of the prediction. Therefore, a short-term load forecasting method based on convolutional neural network (CNN), self-attention encoder-decoder network (SAEDN) and residual-refinement (Res) is proposed. In this method, feature extraction module is composed of a two-dimensional convolutional neural network, which is used to mine the local correlation between data and obtain high-dimensional data features. The initial load fore-casting module consists of a self-attention encoder-decoder network and a feedforward neural network (FFN). The module utilizes self-attention mechanisms to encode high-dimensional features. This operation can obtain the global correlation between data. Therefore, the model is able to retain important information based on the coupling relationship between the data in data mixed with non-time series factors. Then, self-attention decoding is per-formed and the feedforward neural network is used to regression initial load. This paper introduces the residual mechanism to build the load optimization module. The module generates residual load values to optimize the initial load. The simulation results show that the proposed load forecasting method has advantages in terms of prediction accuracy and prediction stability.</description>

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are a versatile method that enables different approaches towards learning for dynamics and control. Gaussianity assumptions appear in two dimensions in GPs: The positive semi-definite kernel of the underlying reproducing kernel Hilbert space is used to construct the co-variance of a Gaussian distribution over functions, while measurement noise (i.e. data corruption) is usually modeled as i.i.d. additive Gaussians. In this note, we generalize the setting and consider kernel ridge regression with additive i.i.d. non-Gaussian measurement noise. To apply the usual kernel trick, we rely on the representation of the uncertainty via polynomial chaos expansions, which are series expansions for random variables of finite variance introduced by Norbert Wiener. We derive and discuss the analytic $\mathcal{L}^2$ solution to the arising Wiener kernel regression. Considering a polynomial dynamic system as a numerical example, we show that our approach allows us to distinguish the uncertainty that stems from the noise in the data samples from the total uncertainty encoded in the GP posterior distribution.</description>

      <title>Structured Deep Neural Network-Based Backstepping Trajectory Tracking Control for Lagrangian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00381</link>

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNN) are increasingly being used to learn controllers due to their excellent approximation capabilities. However, their black-box nature poses significant challenges to closed-loop stability guarantees and performance analysis. In this paper, we introduce a structured DNN-based controller for the trajectory tracking control of Lagrangian systems using backing techniques. By properly designing neural network structures, the proposed controller can ensure closed-loop stability for any compatible neural network parameters. In addition, improved control performance can be achieved by further optimizing neural network parameters. Besides, we provide explicit upper bounds on tracking errors in terms of controller parameters, which allows us to achieve the desired tracking performance by properly selecting the controller parameters. Furthermore, when system models are unknown, we propose an improved Lagrangian neural network (LNN) structure to learn the system dynamics and design the controller. We show that in the presence of model approximation errors and external disturbances, the closed-loop stability and tracking control performance can still be guaranteed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulations.</description>

      <title>Regret Minimization in Scalar, Static, Non-linear Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of determining an effective exploration strategy in static and non-linear optimization problems, which depend on an unknown scalar parameter to be learned from online collected noisy data. An optimal trade-off between exploration and exploitation is crucial for effective optimization under uncertainties, and to achieve this we consider a cumulative regret minimization approach over a finite horizon, with each time instant in the horizon characterized by a stochastic exploration signal, whose variance is to be designed. We aim to extend the well-established concepts of regret minimization from linear to non-linear systems, with a focus on the subsequent conceptual differences and challenges. Thus, under an idealized assumption on an appropriately defined information function associated with the excitation, we are able to show that an optimal exploration strategy is either to use no exploration at all (called lazy exploration) or adding an exploration excitation only at the first time instant of the horizon (called immediate exploration). A quadratic numerical example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description>

      <title>Auto-Multilift: Distributed Learning and Control for Cooperative Load Transportation With Quadrotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04858v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing motion control and planning algorithms for multilift systems remains challenging due to the complexities of dynamics, collision avoidance, actuator limits, and scalability. Existing methods that use optimization and distributed techniques effectively address these constraints and scalability issues. However, they often require substantial manual tuning, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes Auto-Multilift, a novel framework that automates the tuning of model predictive controllers (MPCs) for multilift systems. We model the MPC cost functions with deep neural networks (DNNs), enabling fast online adaptation to various scenarios. We develop a distributed policy gradient algorithm to train these DNNs efficiently in a closed-loop manner. Central to our algorithm is distributed sensitivity propagation, which is built on fully exploiting the unique dynamic couplings within the multilift system. It parallelizes gradient computation across quadrotors and focuses on actual system state sensitivities relative to key MPC parameters. Extensive simulations demonstrate favorable scalability to a large number of quadrotors. Our method outperforms a state-of-the-art open-loop MPC tuning approach by effectively learning adaptive MPCs from trajectory tracking errors. It also excels in learning an adaptive reference for reconfiguring the system when traversing multiple narrow slots.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport-Assisted Risk-Sensitive Q-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11774</link>

Abstract: The primary goal of reinforcement learning is to develop decision-making policies that prioritize optimal performance without considering risk or safety. In contrast, safe reinforcement learning aims to mitigate or avoid unsafe states. This paper presents a risk-sensitive Q-learning algorithm that leverages optimal transport theory to enhance the agent safety. By integrating optimal transport into the Q-learning framework, our approach seeks to optimize the policy's expected return while minimizing the Wasserstein distance between the policy's stationary distribution and a predefined risk distribution, which encapsulates safety preferences from domain experts. We validate the proposed algorithm in a Gridworld environment. The results indicate that our method significantly reduces the frequency of visits to risky states and achieves faster convergence to a stable policy compared to the traditional Q-learning algorithm.</description>

      <title>Conformal Wide-Angle Scanning Leaky-Wave Antenna for V-Band On-Body Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wearable on-body millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars can provide obstacle detection and guidance for visually impaired people. However, their everyday performance is hindered by the rigid form factor and limited scanning range. In this article, we propose a low-profile, fast-scanning leaky-wave antenna (LWA) operating in the unlicensed V-band (57-64 GHz) to be integrated for on-body applications such as lightweight portable frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars. The proposed LWA consists of meandering microstrips that can conform to the human body curvatures while maintaining beam-forming and beam-scanning properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the planar LWA achieves a realized gain above 10 dB with a fan-beam steering range in the H-plane from -40{\deg} to 43{\deg} over the operating frequency band while the half power beam-width (HPBW) is within 20{\deg}. Since for the foreseen application the antenna is supposed to conform to the user's body, the performance is also analyzed for a bent condition. The beam steering range changes to -32{\deg} to 50{\deg} when placed on the knee (corresponding to 80 mm radius). Under bending conditions, the LWA exhibits a maximum degradation of 1.75 dB, while the HPBW increases to 25{\deg}. This shows that due to the small size of the antenna, the impact of bending is low and the beam-forming and beam-scanning property of the designed LWA remain intact. Furthermore, we enable 2-D spatial scanning by employing an array of twelve LWAs with phased excitation, extending the scanning range in the E-plane from -40{\deg} to 40{\deg}, while the HPBW remains below 20{\deg} across the operational frequency range.</description>
