      <title>Flop between algebraically integrable foliations on potentially klt varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any two minimal models of an lc algebraically integrable foliated triple on potentially klt varieties, there exist small birational models that are connected by a sequence of flops. In particular, any two minimal models of lc algebraically integrable foliated triples on $\mathbb Q$-factorial klt varieties are connected by a sequence of flops. We also discuss the connection between minimal models for possibly non-algebraically integrable foliations on threefolds, assuming the minimal model program for generalized foliated quadruples.</description>

      <title>Equivariant aspects of de-completing cyclic homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Derived de Rham cohomology turns out to be important in p-adic geometry, following Bhatt's discovery [Bha12] of conjugate filtration in char p, de-Hodge-completing results in [Bei12]. In [Kal18], Kaledin introduced an analogous de-completion of the periodic cyclic homology, called the polynomial periodic cyclic homology, equipped with a conjugate filtration in char p, and expected to be related to derived de Rham cohomology. In this article, using genuine equivariant homotopy structure on Hochschild homology as in [ABG+18, BHM22], we give an equivariant description of Kaledin's polynomial periodic cyclic homology. This leads to Morita invariance without any Noetherianness assumption as in [Kal18], and the comparison to derived de Rham cohomology becomes transparent. Moreover, this description adapts directly to "topological" analogues, which gives rise to a de-Nygaard-completion of the topological periodic cyclic homology over a perfectoid base. We compare it to topological Hochschild homology over $\mathbb F_p$, and produce a conjugate filtration in char p from our description.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative relative de Rham--Witt complex via the norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [Ill79], Illusie constructed de Rham-Witt complex of smooth $\mathbb F_p$-algebras R, which computes the crystalline cohomology of R, a $\mathbb Z_p$-lift of the de Rham cohomology of R. There are two different extensions of de Rham-Witt complex: a relative version discovered by Langer-Zink, and a noncommutative version, called Hochschild-Witt homology, constructed by Kaledin. The key to Kaledin's construction is his polynomial Witt vectors. In this article, we introduce a common extension of both: relative Hochschild-Witt homology. It is simply defined to be topological Hochschild homology relative to the Tambara functor $W(\mathbb F_p)$. Adopting Hesselholt's proof of his HKR theorem, we deduce an HKR theorem for relative Hochschild-Witt homology, which relates its homology groups to relative de Rham-Witt complex. We also identify Kaledin's polynomial Witt vectors as the relative Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel norm, which allows us to identify our Hochschild-Witt homology relative to $\mathbb F_p$ with Kaledin's Hochschild-Witt homology. As a consequence, we deduce a comparison between Hochschild-Witt homology and topological restriction homology, fulfilling a missing part of [Kal19].</description>

      <title>On Brauer groups of tame stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop some general tools for computing the Brauer group of a tame algebraic stack $\mathscr X$ by studying the difference between it and the Brauer group of the coarse space $X$ of $\mathscr X$. It is our hope that these tools will be used to simplify future computations of Brauer groups of stacks. Informally, we show that $\operatorname{Br}\mathscr X$ if often built from $\operatorname{Br} X$ and ``information about the Picard groups of the fibers of $\mathscr X\to X$''. Along these lines, we compute, for example, the Brauer group of the moduli stack $\mathscr Y(1)_S$ of elliptic curves, over any regular noetherian $\mathbb Z[1/2]$-scheme $S$ as well as the Brauer groups of (many) stacky curves (allowing generic stabilizers) over algebraically closed fields.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck Galois theory and \'etale exodromy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite \'etale covers of a connected scheme $X$ are parametrised by the \'etale fundamental group via the monodromy correspondence. This was generalised to an exodromy correspondence for constructible sheaves, first in the topological setting by MacPherson, Treumann, Lurie, and others, and recently also for \'etale and pro-\'etale sheaves by Barwick--Glasman--Haine and Wolf. The proof of the \'etale exodromy theorem is long and technical, using many new definitions and constructions in the $(\infty,2)$-category of $\infty$-topoi. This paper gives a quick proof of the \'etale exodromy theorem for constructible sheaves of sets (with respect to a fixed stratification), in the style of Grothendieck's Galois theory.</description>

      <title>Constructible sheaves on toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper gives an explicit computation of the category of constructible sheaves on a toric variety (with respect to the stratification by torus orbits). Over the complex numbers, this simplifies a description due to Braden and Lunts. The same computation is carried out for split toric varieties over an arbitrary field, for constructible \'etale sheaves whose restriction to each stratum is locally constant and tamely ramified. This gives the first explicit computation of an \'etale exodromy theorem in positive characteristic for a stratification over a partially ordered set of height greater than 1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a smooth quasi-projective complex algebraic variety $\mathcal{S}$, we prove that there are only finitely many Hodge-generic non-isotrivial families of smooth projective hypersurfaces over $\mathcal{S}$ of degree $d$ in $\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb C}^{n+1}$. We prove that the finiteness is uniform in $\mathcal{S}$ and we give examples where the result is sharp. We also prove similar results for certain complete intersections in $\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb C}^{n+1}$ of higher codimension and more generally for algebraic varieties whose moduli space admits a period map that satisfies the infinitesimal Torelli theorem.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Lang's Conjectural Characterisation of Hyperbolicity of Projective Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: S. Lang conjectured that the only obstructions to a projective manifold being hyperbolic come from the presence of rational curves or Abelian varieties. We show that this conjecture follows from the abundance conjecture and the conjectural existence of enough rational curves on terminal Calabi--Yau and hyperk\"ahler varieties. Assuming, in addition, Lang's second conjecture on the absence of Zariski dense entire curves on general type manifolds, we show that a weakly special manifold with no rational curves is an \'etale quotient of an Abelian variety. We then illustrate Lang's first conjecture by producing examples of canonically polarised submanifolds of abelian varieties containing no subvariety of general type, except for a finite number of disjoint copies of some simple abelian variety, which can be chosen arbitrarily. We also show, more generally, that any projective manifold containing a Zariski dense entire curve appears as the `exceptional set' in Lang's sense of some general type manifold.</description>

      <title>Fano visitor problem for K3 surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a K3 surface with Picard number 1 and genus $g$, such that $g\not\equiv 3 \mod 4$. In this paper, we show that $X$ is a Fano visitor, i.e., there is a smooth Fano variety $Y$ and an embedding $D^b(X)\hookrightarrow D^b(Y)$ given by a fully faithful functor. If $g\equiv 3\mod 4$, we construct a smooth weak Fano variety $Y$. Our proof is based on several results concerning a sequence of flips associated with a K3 surface and an ample line bundle. This sequence is contructed by using the work of Bayer and Macr\`i on the description of the birational geometry of a moduli space of sheaves on a K3 surface through Bridgeland stability conditions, and the study of the fixed locus of antisymplectic involutions on hyperk\"ahler manifolds by Sacc\`a, Macr\`i, O'Grady, and Flapan.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a perfect field of characteristic $p$, $X/k$ be a smooth variety and $T_{X/k}$ be its tangent bundle. Bhatt and Lurie defined a $\mathbf{fpqc}$-group $T_{X/k}^{\sharp}$ as well as a gerbe $X^{\mathrm{HT}}$, which is called the Hodge--Tate gerbe of $X$. It is conjectured by Bhatt and Lurie that the image of the obstruction of $X^{\mathrm{HT}}$ in $\mathrm{H}^{2}(X_{\mathbf{fpqc}},T_{X/k}\otimes \alpha_p)$ coincides with the obstruction of Frobenius lifting. We will prove this conjecture in this paper.</description>

      <title>The Weakly Special Conjecture contradicts orbifold Mordell, and thus abc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from an Enriques surface over $\mathbb{Q}(t)$ constructed by Lafon, we give the first examples of smooth projective weakly special threefolds which fiber over the projective line in Enriques surfaces (resp. K3 surfaces) with nowhere reduced, but non-divisible, fibres and general type orbifold base. We verify that these families of Enriques surfaces (resp. K3 surfaces) are non-isotrivial by computing their fundamental groups and studying the behaviour of local points along certain \'etale covers. The existence of the above threefolds implies that the Weakly Special Conjecture formulated in 2000 contradicts the Orbifold Mordell Conjecture, and hence the abc conjecture. Using these examples, we can also easily disprove several complex-analytic analogues of the Weakly Special Conjecture. Finally, the existence of such threefolds shows that Enriques surfaces and K3 surfaces can have non-divisible but nowhere reduced degenerations, thereby answering a question raised in 2005.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unify problems about the equivariant geometry of symmetric quiver representation varieties, in the finite type setting, with the corresponding problems for symmetric varieties $GL(n)/K$ where $K$ is an orthogonal or symplectic group. In particular, we translate results about singularities of orbit closures; combinatorics of orbit closure containment; and torus equivariant cohomology and K-theory between these classes of varieties. We obtain these results by constructing explicit embeddings with nice properties of homogeneous fiber bundles over type $A$ symmetric quiver representation varieties into symmetric varieties.</description>

      <title>On automorphisms of affine superspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we propose a super version of Jacobian conjecture on the automorphisms of affine superspaces over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $0$, which predicts that for a homomorphism $\varphi$ of the polynomial superalgebra $\mathcal{R}:=\mathbb{F}[x_1,\ldots,x_m; \xi_1,\ldots,\xi_m]$ over $\mathbb{F}$, if $\varphi$ satisfies the super version of Jacobian condition (SJ for short), then $\varphi$ gives rise to an automorphism of the affine superspace $\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{F}}^{m|n}$. We verify the conjecture if additionally, the set $\mathscr{M}$ of maximal $\mathbb{Z}_2$-homogeneous ideals of $\mathcal{R}$ is assumed to be preserved under $\varphi$. The statement is actually proved in any characteristic, i.e. a homomorphism $\varphi$ gives rise to an automorphism of $\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{F}}^{m|n}$ if SJ is satisfied with $\varphi$ and the set $\mathscr{M}$ is preserved under $\varphi$ for an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{F}$ of any characteristic.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Generalized Fermat Groups in positive characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X\subset {\mathbb P}_{K}^{m}$ be a smooth irreducible projective algebraic variety of dimension $d$, defined over an algebraically closed field $K$ of characteristic $p&gt;0$. We say that $X$ is a generalized Fermat variety of type $(d;k,n)$, where $n \geq d+1$ and $k \geq 2$ is relatively prime to $p$, if there is a Galois branched covering $\pi\colon X\to {\mathbb P}_{K}^{d}$, with deck group ${\mathbb Z}_k^n\cong H&lt;\rm{Aut}(X)$, whose branch divisor consists of $n+1$ hyperplanes in general position (each one of branch order $k$). In this case, the group $H$ is called a generalized Fermat group of type $(d;k,n)$. We prove that, if $k-1$ is not a power of $p$ and either (i) $p=2$ or (ii) $p&gt;2$ and $(d;k,n) \notin \{(2;2,5), (2;4,3)\}$, then a generalized Fermat variety of type $(d;k,n)$ has a unique generalized Fermat group of that type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a given number field $K$, we give a $\forall\exists\forall$-first order description of affine Darmon points over $\mathbb{P}^1_K$, and show that this can be improved to a $\forall\exists$-definition in a remarkable particular case. Darmon points, which are a geometric generalization of perfect powers, constitute a non-linear set-theoretical filtration between $K$ and its ring of $S$-integers, the latter of which can be defined with universal formulas, as has been progressively proven by Koenigsmann, Park, and Eisentr\"ager &amp; Morrison. We also show that our formulas are uniform with respect to all possible $S$, with a parameter-free uniformity, and we compute the number of quantifiers and a bound for the degree of the defining polynomial.</description>

      <title>Exact sensitivity analysis of Markov reward processes via algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for deterministic sensitivity analysis of Markov reward processes, commonly used in cost-effectiveness analyses, via reformulation into a polynomial system. Our approach leverages cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD), a technique arising from algebraic geometry that provides an exact description of all solutions to a polynomial system. While it is typically intractable to build a CAD for systems with more than a few variables, we show that a special class of polynomial systems, which includes the polynomials arising from Markov reward processes, can be analyzed much more tractably. We establish several theoretical results about such systems and develop a specialized algorithm to construct their CAD, which allows us to perform exact, multi-way sensitivity analysis for common health economic analyses. We develop an open-source software package that implements our algorithm. Finally, we apply it to two case studies, one with synthetic data and one that re-analyzes a previous cost-effectiveness analysis from the literature, demonstrating advantages of our approach over standard techniques. Our software and code are available at: \url{https://github.com/mmaaz-git/markovag}.</description>

      <title>Regular $\mathbb{Z}$-graded local rings and Graded Isolated Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we first study regular $\mathbb{Z}$-graded local rings. We characterize commutative noetherian regular $\mathbb{Z}$-graded local rings in similar ways as in the usual local case. The characterization by the length of (homogeneous) regular sequences fails in the graded case in general. Then, we characterize graded isolated singularity for commutative $\mathbb{Z}$-graded semilocal algebra in terms of the global dimension of its associated noncommutative projective scheme. As a corollary, we obtain that a commutative affine $\mathbb{N}$-graded algebra generated in degree $1$ is a graded isolated singularity if and only if its associated projective scheme is smooth; if and only if the category of coherent sheaves on its projective scheme has finite global dimension, which are known in literature.</description>

      <title>Zero entropy on entire Grauert tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a real analytic Riemannian manifold a Grauert tube is an uniquely adapted complex structure defined on the tangent bundle. It is called entire if it may be defined on the whole tangent bundle. Here, we show that the geodesic flow of an analytic manifold with entire Grauert tube has zero topological entropy. Several consequences then follow. We find that Grauert tubes of convex analytic hypersurfaces of ${\bf R}^3$ are generically finite. We give a complete classification of 3-manifolds with entire Grauert tube, showing that these are precisely the 3-manifolds that admit good complexifications. Assuming a manifold has entire Grauert tube, we offer classification statements for several families of smooth 4-manifolds, determine all such simply connected 5-manifolds, and offer new topological restrictions for certain manifolds with infinite fundamental groups. Using these results we present an example of a simply connected and rationally elliptic 5-manifold which nonetheless does not admit any metric with entire Grauert tube.</description>

      <title>Twisted triple product root numbers and a cycle of Darmon-Rotger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an algebraic cycle on the triple product of the prime level modular curve $X_0(p)$ with origins in work of Darmon and Rotger. It is defined over the quadratic extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ ramified only at $p$ whose associated quadratic character $\chi$ is the Legendre symbol at $p$. We prove that it is null-homologous and describe actions of various groups on it. For any three normalised cuspidal eigenforms $f_1, f_2, f_3$ of weight $2$ and level $\Gamma_0(p)$, we prove that the global root number of the twisted triple product $L$-function $L(f_1\otimes f_2\otimes f_3\otimes \chi, s)$ is $-1$. Assuming conjectures of Beilinson and Bloch, and guided by the Gross-Zagier philosophy, this suggests that the Darmon-Rotger cycle could be non-torsion, although we do not currently have a proof of this.</description>

      <title>Towards the Nerves of Steel Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a local $\otimes$-triangulated category, and a fiber sequence $y\to 1 \to x$, one may ask if there is always a nonzero object $z$ such that either $z\otimes f$ or $z\otimes g$ is $\otimes$-nilpotent. The claim that this property holds for all local $\otimes$-triangulated categories is equivalent to Balmer's "nerves of steel conjecture" from arXiv:2001.00284. In the present paper, we will see how this property can fail if the category we start with is not rigid, discuss a large class of categories where the property holds, and ultimately prove that the nerves of steel conjecture is equivalent to a stronger form of this property.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we revisit the likelihood geometry of Gaussian graphical models. We give a detailed proof that the ML-degree behaves monotonically on induced subgraphs. Furthermore, we complete a missing argument that the ML-degree of the $n$-th cycle is larger than one for any $n\geq 4$, therefore completing the characterization that the only Gaussian graphical models with rational maximum likelihood estimator are the ones corresponding to chordal (decomposable) graphs. Finally, we prove that the formula for the ML-degree of a cycle conjectured by Drton, Sturmfels and Sullivant provides a correct lower bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study the $p$-complete topological cyclic homology of the affine line relative to a ring $A$ which is smooth over a perfectoid ring $R$. Denoting by $NTC(A; \mathbb{Z}_p)$ the spectrum which measures the failure of $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariance on $A$, we observe a kind of Quillen-Lichtenbaum phenomena for $NTC(A; \mathbb{Z}_p)$ -- that it is isomorphic to its own $K(1)$-localization in a specified range of degrees which depends on the relative dimension of $A$. Somewhat surprisingly, this range is better than considerations following from a theorem of Bhatt-Mathew and \'etale-to-syntomic comparisons. Via the Dundas-Goodwillie-McCarthy theorem, we obtain a description of the algebraic $K$-theory of $p$-completed affine line over such rings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1512.04076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the intersection cohomology of the moduli spaces $M_{r,d}$ of semistable vector bundles having rank $r$ and degree $d$ over a curve. We do this by relating the Hodge-Deligne polynomial of the intersection cohomology of $M_{r,d}$ to the Donaldson-Thomas invariants of the curve. These invariants can be computed by methods going back to Harder, Narasimhan, Desale and Ramanan. More generally, we introduce Donaldson-Thomas classes in the Grothendieck group of mixed Hodge modules over $M_{r,d}$ and relate them to the class of the intersection complex of $M_{r,d}$. Our methods can be applied to the moduli spaces of semistable objects in arbitrary hereditary categories.</description>

      <title>Generalized cohomology theories for algebraic stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.15001v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the stable motivic homotopy category of Voevodsky to the class of scalloped algebraic stacks, and show that it admits the formalism of Grothendieck's six operations. Objects in this category represent generalized cohomology theories for stacks like algebraic K-theory, as well as new examples like genuine motivic cohomology and algebraic cobordism. These cohomology theories admit Gysin maps and satisfy homotopy invariance, localization, and Mayer-Vietoris. For example, we deduce that homotopy K-theory satisfies cdh descent on scalloped stacks. We also prove a fixed point localization formula for torus actions.
  Finally, the construction is contrasted with a "lisse-extended" stable motivic homotopy category, defined for arbitrary stacks: we show for example that lisse-extended motivic cohomology of quotient stacks is computed by the equivariant higher Chow groups of Edidin-Graham, and we also get a good new theory of Borel-equivariant algebraic cobordism. Moreover, the lisse-extended motivic homotopy type is shown to recover all previous constructions of motives of stacks.</description>

Abstract: We establish a McKay correspondence for finite and linearly reductive subgroup schemes of $\mathrm{SL}_2$ in positive characteristic. As an application, we obtain a McKay correspondence for all rational double point singularities in characteristic $p\geq7$. We discuss linearly reductive quotient singularities and canonical lifts over the ring of Witt vectors. In dimension 2, we establish simultaneous resolutions of singularities of these canonical lifts via $G$-Hilbert schemes. In the appendix, we discuss several approaches towards the notion of conjugacy classes for finite group schemes: This is an ingredient in McKay correspondences, but also of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We prove that any compactified universal Jacobian over any stack of stable maps, defined using torsion-free sheaves which are Gieseker semistable with respect to a relatively ample invertible sheaf over the universal curve, admits a projective good moduli space which can be constructed using GIT, and that the same is true for analogues parametrising semistable sheaves of higher rank. We also prove that for different choices of invertible sheaves, the corresponding good moduli spaces are related by a finite number of "Thaddeus flips". As a special case of our methods, we provide a new GIT construction of the universal Picard variety of Caporaso and Pandharipande.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kleiman's criterion states that, for $X$ a projective scheme, a divisor $D$ is ample if and only if it pairs positively with every non-zero element of the closure of the cone of curves. In other words, the cone of ample divisors in $N^1(X)$ is the interior of the nef cone. In this paper we present an analogous statement for a variety $X$ acted on by a reductive group $G$ with a choice of $G$-linearization $L \to X$. In this new context, the ample cone of $X$ is replaced by a cell in the variation of GIT decomposition of the G-ample cone, and curves in $X$ are replaced by quasimaps to $[X/G]$.</description>

Abstract: In the Hilbert scheme of curves of degree $d_{r}=\frac{r(r+1)}{2}$ and arithmetic genus $g_{r}=\frac{r(r+1)(2r-5)}{6}+1$ in $\mathbb{P}^{3}$ we prove that there exists a unique component of arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay curves denoted by $\overline{\mathscr{C}_{r}}$. For $r\geq 3$, we verify that the subvariety of curves in $\overline{\mathscr{C}_{r}}$ with Rao module of rank one always contains a reducible divisor. In particular, in the case of curves of degree $6$ and genus $3$ we prove that this subvariety is a reducible divisor. Furthermore, the components of such divisor are linearly independent and each component generates an extremal ray of the effective cone $\overline{\text{Eff}(\mathscr{C}_{3})}$.</description>

      <title>$L$-functions of Kloosterman sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study a family of motives $\mathrm{M}_{n+1}^k$ associated with the symmetric power of Kloosterman sheaves, as constructed by Fres\'an, Sabbah, and Yu. They demonstrated that for $n=1$, the motivic $L$-functions of $\mathrm{M}_{2}^k$ extend meromorphically to $\mathbb{C}$ and satisfy the functional equations conjectured by Broadhurst and Roberts. Our work aims to extend these results to the motivic $L$-functions of some of the motives $\mathrm{M}_{n+1}^k$, with $n&gt;1$, as well as other related $2$-dimensional motives. In particular, we prove several conjectures of Evans type, which relate traces of Kloosterman sheaves and Fourier coefficients of modular forms.</description>

      <title>Strong desingularization of semialgebraic sets and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hironaka's resolution of singularities is a celebrated discipline that has many applications in many areas of Mathematics. In this work we approach the desingularization of semialgebraic sets ${\mathcal S}\subset{\mathbb R}^n$. We prove the counterpart to `Hironaka's desingularization of real algebraic sets' in the semialgebraic setting. It involves Nash manifolds with corners instead of non-singular real algebraic sets. The obtained results are optimal when ${\mathcal S}$ is a closed semialgebraic set. The main tools involved are: Hironaka's desingularization of real algebraic sets, Hironaka's embedded desingularization of real algebraic subsets of non-singular real algebraic sets and drilling blow-ups of Nash manifolds with centers closed Nash submanifolds.
  We show how to `build' a Nash manifold with corners ${\mathcal Q}\subset{\mathbb R}^n$ from a suitable Nash manifold $M\subset{\mathbb R}^n$ (of its same dimension), which contains ${\mathcal Q}$ as a closed subset, by folding $M$ along the irreducible components of a normal-crossings divisor of $M$, which is the smallest Nash subset of $M$ that contains the boundary $\partial{\mathcal Q}$ of ${\mathcal Q}$. One can choose as the Nash manifold $M$ the Nash `double' $D({\mathcal Q})$ of ${\mathcal Q}$, which is analogous to the Nash double of a Nash manifold with boundary, but $D({\mathcal Q})$ takes into account the peculiarities of the boundary of a Nash manifold with corners.
  We include several applications: (1) Weak desingularization of closed semialgebraic sets using Nash manifolds with boundary, (2) Representation of compact semialgebraic sets connected by analytic paths as images under Nash maps of closed unit balls, (3) Construction of Nash models for compact orientable smooth surfaces of genus $g\geq0$, and (4) Nash approximation of continuous semialgebraic maps whose target spaces are Nash manifolds with corners.</description>

Abstract: We study a derived version of Laumon's homogeneous Fourier transform, which exchanges G_m-equivariant sheaves on a derived vector bundle and its dual. In this context, the Fourier transform exhibits a duality between derived and stacky phenomena. This is the first in a series of papers on derived microlocal sheaf theory.</description>

      <title>Resonance, syzygies, and rank-$3$ Ulrich bundles on the del Pezzo threefold $V_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a geometric criterion for a smooth curve $C$ of genus $14$ and degree $18$ to be described as the zero locus of sections in an Ulrich bundle of rank $3$ on a del Pezzo threefold $V_5 \subset \mathbb{P}^6$. The main challenge is to read off the Pfaffian quadrics defining $V_5$ from geometric structures of $C$. We find that this problem is related to the existence of a special rank-two vector bundle on $C$ with trivial resonance. It gives a description of the image of the rational map that appeared in a work of Ciliberto-Flamini-Knutsen, for the case of degree $5$ del Pezzo threefolds. From an explicit calculation of the Betti table of such a curve, we also deduce the uniqueness of the del Pezzo threefold containing a given curve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06114v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, for a polarised smooth projective variety $B \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^n_k$ of dimension $\geq 2$ over an infinite field $k$ and an abelian variety $A$ over the function field of $B$, there exists a dense Zariski open set of smooth geometrically connected hyperplane sections $h$ of $B$ such that $A$ has good reduction at $h$ and the specialisation homomorphism of Lang-N\'eron groups at $h$ is injective (up to a finite $p$-group in positive characteristic $p$). This gives a positive answer to a conjecture of the first author, which is used to deduce a negative definiteness result on his refined height pairing. This also sheds a new light on N\'eron's specialisation theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a holomorphically symplectic manifold, equipped with a Lagrangian fibration $\pi:\; M \to X$. A degenerate twistor deformation (sometimes also called ``a Tate-Shafarevich twist'') is a family of holomorphically symplectic structures on $M$ parametrized by $H^{1,1}(X)$. All members of this family are equipped with a holomorphic Lagrangian projection to $X$, and their fibers are isomorphic to the fibers of $\pi$. Assume that $M$ is a compact hyperkahler manifold of maximal holonomy, and the general fiber of the Lagrangian projection $\pi$ is primitive (that is, not divisible) in integer homology. We prove that $M$ has a degenerate twistor deformation $M'$ such that the Lagrangian projection $\pi:\; M' \to X$ admits a meromorphic section.</description>

      <title>Explicit desingularisation of Kummer surfaces in characteristic two via specialisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the birational geometry of the Kummer surfaces associated to the Jacobian varieties of genus two curves, with a particular focus on fields of characteristic two. In order to do so, we explicitly compute a projective embedding of the Jacobian of a general genus two curve and, from this, we construct its associated Kummer surface. This explicit construction produces a model for desingularised Kummer surfaces over any field of characteristic not two, and specialising these equations to characteristic two provides a model of a partial desingularisation. Adapting the classic description of the Picard lattice in terms of tropes, we also describe how to explicitly find completely desingularised models of Kummer surfaces whenever the $p$-rank is not zero. In the final section of this paper, we compute an example of a Kummer surface with everywhere good reduction over a quadratic number field, and draw connections between the models we computed and a criterion that determines when a Kummer surface has good reduction at two.</description>

Abstract: We give an explicit formula for the descendent stable pair invariants of all (absolute) local curves in terms of certain power series called Bethe roots, which also appear in the physics/representation theory literature. We derive new explicit descriptions for the Bethe roots which are of independent interest. From this we derive rationality, functional equation and a characterization of poles for the full descendent stable pair theory of local curves as conjectured by Pandharipande and Pixton. We also sketch how our methods give a new approach to the spectrum of quantum multiplication on $\mathsf{Hilb}^n(\mathbf{C}^2)$.</description>

Abstract: We prove a general result on the existence of irreducible symplectic compactifications of non-compact Lagrangian fibrations. As an application, we show that the relative Jacobian fibration of cubic fivefolds containing a fixed cubic fourfold can be compactified by a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial terminal irreducible symplectic variety with the second Betti number at least 24, and admits a Lagrangian fibration whose base is a weighted projective space. In particular, it belongs to a new deformation type of irreducible symplectic varieties.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the Serre spectral sequence of the fibration $\overline{\mathcal M}_{0, 1+p} \to E\mathbb Z/p \times_{\mathbb Z/p} \overline{\mathcal M}_{0, 1+p} \to B \mathbb Z/p$ collapses at the $E_2$ page. We use this to prove that: for any element of the $\mathbb Z/p$-equivariant cohomology with $\mathbb F_p$-coefficients of genus zero Deligne-Mumford space with $1+p$ marked points, if this element is torsion then it is non-equivariant. This concludes that the only "interesting" $\mathbb Z/p$-equivariant operations are quantum Steenrod power operations.</description>

Abstract: Affine Lusztig varieties encode the orbital integrals of Iwahori--Hecke functions and serve as building blocks for the (conjectural) theory of affine character sheaves. We establish a close relationship between affine Lusztig varieties and affine Deligne--Lusztig varieties. Consequently, we give an explicit nonemptiness pattern and dimension formula for affine Lusztig varieties in most cases.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a quasi projective scheme over a noetherian affine scheme $Spec(A)$, $U\subseteq X$ be an open subset, and $Z=X-U$.Assume that $Z$ is complete intersection, with $k=codim Z$. Consider the map
  $$
  q:{\mathbb K}\left({\mathscr V}(X)\right) \rightarrow {\mathbb K}\left({\mathscr V}(U)\right)
  $$
  of the ${\mathbb K}$-theory spectra. We give a description of the homotopy fiber of $q$.
  Let $C{\mathbb M}^Z\left(X\right)$ denote the full subcategory of perfect modules ${\mathscr F} \in Coh(X)$ such that(1) ${\mathscr F} _{|U}=0$, (2) $grade({\mathscr F} )=\dim_{{\mathscr V}(X)}{\mathscr F}=k $. It turns out that the homotopy fiber of $q$ is the ${\mathbb K}$-theory spectra
  ${\mathbb K}\left(C{\mathbb M}^Z\left(X\right)\right)$.
  Likewise, we compute the homotopy fiber of the pullback map
  $$
  g: {\mathbb G}W\left({\mathscr V}(X)\right) \rightarrow {\mathbb G}W\left({\mathscr V}(U)\right)
  $$
  of Karoubi Grothendieck-Witt bispectra. Consequently, we obtain long exact sequences of ${\mathbb K}$-groups and of ${\mathbb G}W$-groups. These results settle some of the long standing open problems. We also inserted a conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that Shimura varieties of abelian type satisfy a $p$-adic Borel-extension property over discretely valued fields. More precisely, let $\mathsf{D}$ denote the rigid-analytic closed unit disc and $\mathsf{D}^{\times} = \mathsf{D} \setminus \{0\}$, let $X$ be a smooth rigid-analytic variety, and let $S(G,\mathcal{H})_{\mathsf{K}}$ denote a Shimura variety of abelian type with torsion-free level structure. We prove every rigid-analytic map defined over a discretely valued $p$-adic field $\mathsf{D}^{\times} \times X \rightarrow S(G,\mathcal{H})_{\mathsf{K}}^{\textrm{an}}$ extends to an analytic map $\mathsf{D} \times X \rightarrow (S(G,\mathcal{H})_{\mathsf{K}}^{\textrm{BB}})^{\textrm{an}}$, where $S(G,\mathcal{H})_{\mathsf{K}}^{\textrm{BB}}$ is the Baily-Borel compactification of $S(G,\mathcal{H})_{\mathsf{K}}$. We also deduce various applications to algebraicity of analytic maps, degenerations of families of abeloids, and to $p$-adic notions of hyperbolicity. Along the way, we also prove an extension result for Rapoport-Zink spaces.</description>

      <title>Semi-Local Exotic Lagrangian Tori in Dimension Four</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study exotic Lagrangian tori in dimension four. In certain Stein domains $B_{dpq}$ (which naturally appear in almost toric fibrations) we find $d+1$ families of monotone Lagrangian tori which are mutually distinct, up to symplectomorphisms. We prove that these remain distinct under embeddings of $B_{dpq}$ into geometrically bounded symplectic four-manifolds. We show that there are infinitely many different such embeddings when $X$ is compact and (almost) toric and hence conclude that $X$ contains arbitrarily many Lagrangian tori which are distinct up to symplectomorphisms of $X$. In dimension four arbitrarily many different Lagrangian tori were previously known only in del Pezzo surfaces.
  Neither the embedded tori, nor the ambient space $X$ needs to be monotone for our methods to work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1976, Deligne and Lusztig realized the representation theory of finite groups of Lie type inside \'etale cohomology of certain algebraic varieties. Recently, a $p$-adic version of this theory started to emerge: there are $p$-adic Deligne-Lusztig spaces, whose cohomology encodes representation theoretic information for $p$-adic groups - for instance, it partially realizes local Langlands correspondence with characteristic zero coefficients. However, the parallel case of coefficients of positive characteristic $\ell \neq p$ has not been inspected so far. The purpose of this article is to initiate such an inspection. In particular, we relate cohomology of certain $p$-adic Deligne-Lusztig spaces to Vign\'eras's modular local Langlands correspondence for $\mathbf{GL}_n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an algebraic geometric framework to study the expressivity of linear activation neural networks. A particular quantity of neural networks that has been actively studied is the number of linear regions, which gives a quantification of the information capacity of the architecture. To study and evaluate information capacity and expressivity, we work in the setting of tropical geometry - a combinatorial and polyhedral variant of algebraic geometry - where there are known connections between tropical rational maps and feedforward neural networks. Our work builds on and expands this connection to capitalize on the rich theory of tropical geometry to characterize and study various architectural aspects of neural networks. Our contributions are threefold: we provide a novel tropical geometric approach to selecting sampling domains among linear regions; an algebraic result allowing for a guided restriction of the sampling domain for network architectures with symmetries; and a new open source OSCAR library to analyze neural networks symbolically using their tropical representations, where we present a new algorithm that computes the exact number of their linear regions. We provide a comprehensive set of proof-of-concept numerical experiments demonstrating the breadth of neural network architectures to which tropical geometric theory can be applied to reveal insights on expressivity characteristics of a network. Our work provides the foundations for the adaptation of both theory and existing software from computational tropical geometry and symbolic computation to neural networks and deep learning</description>

      <title>Finite group actions on dg categories and Hochschild homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a decomposition of the Hochschild homology groups of the equivariant dg category $\mathscr{C}^G$ associated to a small dg category $\mathscr{C}$ with direct sums on which a finite group $G$ acts. When the ground field is $\mathbb{C}$ this decomposition is related to a categorical action of $\text{Rep}(G)$ on $\mathscr{C}^G$ and the resulting action of the representation ring $R_\mathbb{C}(G)$ on $HH_\bullet(\mathscr{C}^G)$.</description>

      <title>Geometric Langlands for Irregular Theta Connections and Epipelagic Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From a stable vector of a stable grading on a simple Lie algebra, Yun defined a rigid automorphic datum that encodes a epipelagic representation, and also an irregular connection on the projective line called $\theta$-connection. We show that under geometric Langlands correspondence, $\theta$-connection corresponds to the Hecke eigensheaf attached the rigid automorphic datum, assuming the stable grading is inner and its Kac coordinate $s_0$ is positive. We provide numerous applications of the main result including physical and cohomological rigidity of $\theta$-connections, global oper structures, and a de Rham analog of Reeder-Yu's predictions on epipelagic Langlands parameters.</description>
