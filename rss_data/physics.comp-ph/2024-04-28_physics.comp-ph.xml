      <title>Atomistic Modelling and Performance Analysis of High-Entropy Layered Anodes and Electrode Electrolyte Interface Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have attracted intense interest worldwide that offers several routes to design materials with novel features which can be served various applications. Unfortunately, at present, this method is restricted to a small number of stackable layers. In this work, we report a bulk vdW material consisting of alternative TiS2 and TiSe2 layers vertically arranged as a potential candidate for anode applications. Moreover, with density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, we explored the effect of high entropy on electrochemical performance of the bulk heterostructure (TSS-HS) by substituting Mo6+ and Al3+ at transition metal site (Ti4+). Solvation shell formation at the electrode-electrolyte interface (EEI) was also studied using AIMD to determine the Li-coordination. Our DFT and AIMD analysis showed considerable improvement in the performance of high entropy TSS-HS (TSS-HE) as compared to TSS-HS. Factors responsible for enhanced performance of TSS-HE were 1) Less structural deformation, 2) Strong bonding (Metal-Chalcogen), 3) Better ionic mobility, 4) Higher theoretical specific capacity, 5) Wider operational voltage window, and 6) Faster Li-ion diffusion. Our observations suggests that 'high entropy' can be an effective strategy to design new anode materials for improving electrochemical performance of Li-ion batteries.</description>

      <title>Portable, Massively Parallel Implementation of a Material Point Method for Compressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent evolution of software and hardware technologies is leading to a renewed computational interest in Particle-In-Cell (PIC) methods such as the Material Point Method (MPM). Indeed, provided some critical aspects are properly handled, PIC methods can be cast in formulations suitable to the requirements of data locality and fine-grained parallelism of modern hardware accelerators as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Such a rapid and continuous technological development increases also the importance of generic and portable implementations. While continuum mechanics simulations have already shown the capabilities of MPM on a wide range of phenomena, the use of the method in compressible fluid dynamics is less frequent, especially in the supersonic regime. In this paper we present a portable, highly parallel, GPU based MPM solver for compressible gas dynamics. The implementation aims to reach a good compromise between portability and efficiency and to give a first assessment of the potential of this approach in reproducing high speed gas flows, also taking into account solid obstacles. The proposed model constitutes a new step towards the realization of a monolithic MPM solver for Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) problems at all Mach numbers up to the supersonic regime.</description>

      <title>FTL: Transfer Learning Nonlinear Plasma Dynamic Transitions in Low Dimensional Embeddings via Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning algorithms provide a new paradigm to study high-dimensional dynamical behaviors, such as those in fusion plasma systems. Development of novel model reduction methods, coupled with detection of abnormal modes with plasma physics, opens a unique opportunity for building efficient models to identify plasma instabilities for real-time control. Our Fusion Transfer Learning (FTL) model demonstrates success in reconstructing nonlinear kink mode structures by learning from a limited amount of nonlinear simulation data. The knowledge transfer process leverages a pre-trained neural encoder-decoder network, initially trained on linear simulations, to effectively capture nonlinear dynamics. The low-dimensional embeddings extract the coherent structures of interest, while preserving the inherent dynamics of the complex system. Experimental results highlight FTL's capacity to capture transitional behaviors and dynamical features in plasma dynamics -- a task often challenging for conventional methods. The model developed in this study is generalizable and can be extended broadly through transfer learning to address various magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) modes.</description>

      <title>A mesh-constrained discrete point method for incompressible flows with moving boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle-based methods are a practical tool in computational fluid dynamics, and novel types of methods have been proposed. However, widely developed Lagrangian-type formulations suffer from the nonuniform distribution of particles, which is enhanced over time and result in problems in computational efficiency and parallel computations. To mitigate these problems, a mesh-constrained discrete point (MCD) method was developed for stationary boundary problems (Matsuda et al., 2022). Although the MCD method is a meshless method that uses moving least-squares approximation, the arrangement of particles (or discrete points (DPs)) is specialized so that their positions are constrained in background meshes to obtain a closely uniform distribution. This achieves a reasonable approximation for spatial derivatives with compact stencils without encountering any ill-posed condition and leads to good performance in terms of computational efficiency. In this study, a novel meshless method based on the MCD method for incompressible flows with moving boundaries is proposed. To ensure the mesh constraint of each DP in moving boundary problems, a novel updating algorithm for the DP arrangement is developed so that the position of DPs is not only rearranged but the DPs are also reassigned the role of being on the boundary or not. The proposed method achieved reasonable results in numerical experiments for well-known moving boundary problems.</description>

      <title>Excitation signatures of isochorically heated electrons in solids at finite wavenumber explored from first principles</title>

Abstract: Ultrafast heating of solids with modern X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) leads to a unique set of conditions that is characterized by the simultaneous presence of heated electrons in a cold ionic lattice. In this work, we analyze the effect of electronic heating on the dynamic structure factor (DSF) in bulk Aluminium (Al) with a face-centered cubic lattice and in silicon (Si) with a crystal diamond structure using first-principles linear-response time-dependent density functional theory simulations. We find a thermally induced red shift of the collective plasmon excitation in both materials. In addition, we show that the heating of the electrons in Al can lead to the formation of a double-plasmon peak due to the extension of the Landau damping region to smaller wavenumbers. Finally, we demonstrate that thermal effects generate a measurable and distinct signature (peak-valley structure) in the DSF of Si at small frequencies. Our simulations indicate that there is a variety of new features in the spectrum of X-ray-driven solids, specifically at finite momentum transfer, which can probed in upcoming X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) experiments at various XFEL facilities.</description>

      <title>Toward Routing River Water in Land Surface Models with Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning is playing an increasing role in hydrology, supplementing or replacing physics-based models. One notable example is the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for forecasting streamflow given observed precipitation and geographic characteristics. Training of such a model over the continental United States has demonstrated that a single set of model parameters can be used across independent catchments, and that RNNs can outperform physics-based models. In this work, we take a next step and study the performance of RNNs for river routing in land surface models (LSMs). Instead of observed precipitation, the LSM-RNN uses instantaneous runoff calculated from physics-based models as an input. We train the model with data from river basins spanning the globe and test it in streamflow hindcasts. The model demonstrates skill at generalization across basins (predicting streamflow in unseen catchments) and across time (predicting streamflow during years not used in training). We compare the predictions from the LSM-RNN to an existing physics-based model calibrated with a similar dataset and find that the LSM-RNN outperforms the physics-based model. Our results give further evidence that RNNs are effective for global streamflow prediction from runoff inputs and motivate the development of complete routing models that can capture nested sub-basis connections.</description>

      <title>Fast Exact Algorithm for Neutrino Oscillation in Constant Matter Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06900v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recently published method for solving the neutrino evolution equation with constant matter density is further refined and used to lay out an exact algorithm for computing oscillation probabilities, which is moderately faster than previous methods when looping through neutrinos of different energies. In particular, the three examples of $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle{(-)}}{\nu}_e$ survival, $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle{(-)}}{\nu}_\mu$ survival and $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle{(-)}}{\nu}_e$ appearance probabilities are written in terms of mixing angles, mass differences and matter electron density. A program based on this new method is found to be roughly twice as fast as, and in agreement with, the leading GLoBES package. Furthermore, the behaviour of all relevant effective parameters is sketched out in terms of a range of neutrino energies, or matter electron densities. For instance, the $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle{(-)}}{\nu}_e$ survival probability in constant matter density is found to have no dependence on the mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ or the CP-violating phase $\delta_{13}$.</description>

      <title>A Test Problem for Flow Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a test problem for Navier-Stokes solvers based on the flow around a cylinder. We choose a range of Reynolds numbers for which the flow is time-dependent but can be characterized as essentially two-dimensional. The test problem requires accurate resolution of chaotic dynamics over a long time interval. It also requires the use of a relatively large computational domain, part of which is curved, and it requires evaluation of derivatives of the solution and pressure on the curved boundary. We review the performance of different finite element methods for the proposed range of Reynolds numbers. These tests indicate that some of the most established methods do not capture the correct behavior.</description>
