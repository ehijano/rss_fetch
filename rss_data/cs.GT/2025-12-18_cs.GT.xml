      <title>A Joint Auction Framework with Externalities and Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, joint advertising has gained significant attention as an effective approach to enhancing the efficiency and revenue of advertising slot allocation. Unlike traditional advertising, which allocates advertising slots exclusively to a single advertiser, joint advertising displays advertisements from brands and stores that have established a joint selling relationship within the same advertising slot. However, existing approaches often struggle to accommodate both joint and traditional advertising frameworks, thereby limiting the revenue potential and generalizability of joint advertising. Furthermore, these methods are constrained by two critical limitations: they generally neglect the influence of global externalities, and they fail to address the bidding variability stemming from multi-party advertiser participation. Collectively, these limitations present substantial challenges to the design of joint auction mechanisms. To address these challenges, we propose a Joint Auction Framework incorporating Externalities and Adaptation, and leverage the automated mechanism design (AMD) method through our proposed JEANet to compute joint auction mechanisms that satisfy the conditions of individual rationality (IR) and approximate dominant strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC). As the first AMD method to integrate global externalities into joint auctions, JEANet dynamically adapts to the bidding characteristics of multi-party advertiser and enables unified auctions that integrate both joint and traditional advertising. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that JEANet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in multi-slot joint auctions.</description>

      <title>A Decision-Theoretic Approach for Managing Misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When should we delegate decisions to AI systems? While the value alignment literature has developed techniques for shaping AI values, less attention has been paid to how to determine, under uncertainty, when imperfect alignment is good enough to justify delegation. We argue that rational delegation requires balancing an agent's value (mis)alignment with its epistemic accuracy and its reach (the acts it has available). This paper introduces a formal, decision-theoretic framework to analyze this tradeoff precisely accounting for a principal's uncertainty about these factors. Our analysis reveals a sharp distinction between two delegation scenarios. First, universal delegation (trusting an agent with any problem) demands near-perfect value alignment and total epistemic trust, conditions rarely met in practice. Second, we show that context-specific delegation can be optimal even with significant misalignment. An agent's superior accuracy or expanded reach may grant access to better overall decision problems, making delegation rational in expectation. We develop a novel scoring framework to quantify this ex ante decision. Ultimately, our work provides a principled method for determining when an AI is aligned enough for a given context, shifting the focus from achieving perfect alignment to managing the risks and rewards of delegation under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>The evolution of trust as a cognitive shortcut in repeated interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trust is often thought to increase cooperation. However, game-theoretic models often fail to distinguish between cooperative behaviour and trust. This makes it difficult to measure trust and determine its effect in different social dilemmas. We address this here by formalising trust as a cognitive shortcut in repeated games. This functions by avoiding checking a partner's actions once a threshold level of cooperativeness has been observed. We consider trust-based strategies that implement this heuristic, and systematically analyse their evolution across the space of two-player symmetric social dilemma games. We find that where it is costly to check whether another agent's actions were cooperative, as is the case in many real-world settings, then trust-based strategies can outcompete standard reciprocal strategies such as Tit-for-Tat in many social dilemmas. Moreover, the presence of trust increases the overall level of cooperation in the population, especially in cases where agents can make unintentional errors in their actions. This occurs even in the presence of strategies designed to build and then exploit trust. Overall, our results demonstrate the individual adaptive benefit to an agent of using a trust heuristic, and provide a formal theory for how trust can promote cooperation in different types of social interaction. We discuss the implications of this for interactions between humans and artificial intelligence agents.</description>

      <title>Satisficing Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce satisficing equilibrium, where each agent chooses one of her top $k_i$ actions. The concept unifies models of bounded rationality and yields predictions that differ from canonical solution concepts. We study its precision, existence, epistemic and dynamic foundations, as well as its empirical content.</description>
