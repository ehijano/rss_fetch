      <title>Evolving Dark Energy or Supernovae Systematics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration have been interpreted as evidence for evolving dark energy. However, this interpretation is strongly dependent on which Type Ia supernova (SN) sample is combined with DESI measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. The strength of the evidence for evolving dark energy ranges from ~3.9 sigma for the Dark Energy 5 year (DES5Y) SN sample to ~ 2.5 sigma for the Pantheon+ sample. Here I compare SN common to both the DES5Y and Pantheon+ compilations finding evidence for an offset of ~0.04 mag. between low and high redshifts. Correcting for this offset brings the DES5Y sample into very good agreement with the Planck LCDM cosmology. Given that most of the parameter range favoured by the uncorrected DES5Y sample is discrepant with many other cosmological datasets, I conclude that the evidence for evolving dark energy is most likely a result of systematics in the DES5Y sample.</description>

      <title>Probing cluster magnetism with embedded and background radio sources in Planck clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields remain an enigmatic part of the content of galaxy clusters. Faraday rotation and depolarisation of extragalactic radio sources are useful probes, but the limited availability of polarised radio sources necessitates stacking clusters to study average magnetic field profiles and correlation scales. We recently presented a VLA survey of the 124 most massive Planck clusters at low redshift ($z&lt;0.35$), where a clear depolarisation trend with the cluster impact parameter was found. In this study, we combine the depolarisation information with the observed rotation measure (RM) and present an investigation into the average magnetic field properties of the sample, using both background sources and sources embedded in clusters. We observe a significant increase in the RM scatter, $\sigma_\mathrm{RRM}$, closer to the cluster centres. Averaging all 124 clusters, we find a scatter within $R_\mathrm{500}$ of $\sigma_\mathrm{RRM}=209\pm37$ rad m$^{-2}$, with background sources and cluster members showing similar values ($200\pm33$ and $219\pm66$ rad m$^{-2}$, respectively). In the simple assumption of a uniform magnetic field with a single fluctuation scale $\Lambda_c$, this translates to an average magnetic field strength of $2\,(\Lambda_c/10\mathrm{kpc})^{-0.5}\, \mu$G. The profile of $\sigma_\mathrm{RRM}$ as a function of projected radius is inconsistent with a model that has a simple scaling $B \propto n_e^\eta$, with an observed deficit near the centre of clusters possibly caused by the fact that the highest RM sources near the centre of clusters are depolarised. In a full forward model, we find that the magnetic field power spectrum agrees with the Kolmogorov value, but that none of the Gaussian random field models can fully explain the observed relatively flat profiles. This implies that more sophisticated models of cluster magnetic fields in a cosmological context are needed.</description>

      <title>Ellipticities of Galaxy Cluster Halos from Halo-Shear-Shear Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first detection of the halo ellipticities of galaxy clusters by applying the halo-shear-shear correlations (HSSC), without the necessity of major axis determination. We use the Fourier\_Quad shear catalog based on the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey and the group catalog from the DESI Legacy Surveys for the measurement of group/cluster lensing and HSSC. Our analysis includes the off-centering effects. We obtain the average projected ellipticity of dark matter halos with mass $13.5 &lt; {\rm log} (M_G h/ M_\odot) &lt; 14.5$ within 1.3 virial radius to be $0.48^{+0.12}_{-0.19}$. We divide the sample into two groups based on mass and redshift, and we find that halos with higher mass tend to exhibit increased ellipticity. We also reveal that high-richness halos have larger ellipticities, confirming the physical picture from numerical simulation that high-richiness halos have a dynamical youth and more active mass accretion phase.</description>

      <title>Field-level Emulation of Cosmic Structure Formation with Cosmology and Redshift Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a field-level emulator for large-scale structure, capturing the cosmology dependence and the time evolution of cosmic structure formation. The emulator maps linear displacement fields to their corresponding nonlinear displacements from N-body simulations at specific redshifts. Designed as a neural network, the emulator incorporates style parameters that encode dependencies on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and the linear growth factor $D(z)$ at redshift $z$. We train our model on the six-dimensional N-body phase space, predicting particle velocities as the time derivative of the model's displacement outputs. This innovation results in significant improvements in training efficiency and model accuracy. Tested on diverse cosmologies and redshifts not seen during training, the emulator achieves percent-level accuracy on scales of $k\sim~1~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}~h$ at $z=0$, with improved performance at higher redshifts. We compare predicted structure formation histories with N-body simulations via merger trees, finding consistent merger event sequences and statistical properties.</description>

      <title>Profile Likelihoods in Cosmology: When, Why and How illustrated with $\Lambda$CDM, Massive Neutrinos and Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequentist parameter inference using profile likelihoods has received increased attention in the cosmology literature recently since it can give important complementary information to Bayesian credible intervals. Here, we give a pedagogical review to frequentist parameter inference in cosmology with particular focus on when the graphical profile likelihood construction gives meaningful constraints, i.e.\ confidence intervals with correct coverage. This construction rests on the assumption of the asymptotic limit of a large data set such as in \textit{Wilks' theorem}. We assess the validity of this assumption in the context of three cosmological models with \textit{Planck} 2018 \texttt{Plik\_lite} data: While our tests for the $\Lambda$CDM model indicate that the profile likelihood method gives correct coverage, $\Lambda$CDM with the sum of neutrino masses as a free parameter appears consistent with a Gaussian near a boundary motivating the use of the boundary-corrected or Feldman-Cousins graphical method; for $w_0$CDM with the equation of state of dark energy, $w_0$, as a free parameter, we find indication of a violation of the assumptions. Finally, we compare frequentist and Bayesian constraints of these models. Our results motivate care when using the graphical profile likelihood method in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Denser Environments Cultivate Larger Galaxies: A Comprehensive Study beyond the Local Universe with 3 Million Hyper Suprime-Cam Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between galaxy size and environment has remained enigmatic, with over a decade of conflicting results. We present one of the first comprehensive studies of the variation of galaxy radius with environment beyond the local Universe and demonstrate that large-scale environmental density is correlated with galaxy radius independent of stellar mass and galaxy morphology. We confirm with $&gt;5\sigma$ confidence that galaxies in denser environments are up to $\sim25\%$ larger than their equally massive counterparts with similar morphology in less dense regions of the Universe. We achieve this result by correlating projected two-dimensional densities over $\sim360$ deg$^2$ with the structural parameters of $\sim3$ million Hyper Suprime-Cam galaxies at $0.3 \leq z &lt; 0.7$ with $\log M/M_{\odot} \geq 8.9$. Compared to most previous studies, this sample is $\sim100-10,000$ times larger and goes $\sim1$ dex deeper in mass-completeness. We demonstrate that past conflicting results have been driven by small sample sizes and a lack of robust measurement uncertainties. We verify the presence of the above correlation separately for disk-dominated, bulge-dominated, star-forming, and quiescent subpopulations. We find the strength of the correlation to be dependent on redshift, stellar mass, and morphology. The correlation is strongest at lower redshifts and systematically weakens or disappears beyond $z \geq 0.5$. At $z\geq0.5$, more massive galaxies still display a statistically significant correlation. Although some existing theoretical frameworks can be selectively invoked to explain some of the observed correlations, our work demonstrates the need for more comprehensive theoretical investigations of the correlation between galaxy size and environment.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity from Weyl conformal geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent developments in physical implications of Weyl conformal geometry. The associated Weyl quadratic gravity is a gauge theory of the Weyl group of dilatations and Poincar\'e symmetry. Weyl geometry is defined by equivalence classes of the metric and Weyl gauge field ($\omega_\mu$), related by Weyl gauge transformations. Weyl geometry can be seen as a covariantised version of Riemannian geometry with respect to Weyl gauge symmetry (of dilatations). This Weyl gauge-covariant formulation of Weyl geometry is metric, which avoids long-held criticisms on the physical relevance of this geometry. Weyl quadratic gravity and its geometry have interesting properties: Weyl gauge symmetry spontaneously broken to Einstein-Hilbert gravity (Riemannian geometry) respectively, with $\Lambda&gt;0$; this is the only true gauge theory of a space-time symmetry i.e. with a physical Weyl gauge boson and is Weyl-anomaly free; all fields and masses have geometric origin, with no added scalar compensators; the theory is the leading order of a Weyl gauge invariant DBI action of conformal geometry that gives a natural analytical continuation of the former to $d$ dimensions; Weyl anomaly is recovered in the broken phase; in the limit of vanishing Weyl gauge current, one obtains conformal gravity and Riemannian geometry; SM has a natural embedding in Weyl conformal geometry with no new degrees of freedom, with a successful Starobinsky-Higgs inflation. Briefly, Weyl conformal geometry alone generates a (quantum) gauge theory of gravity, leading to a unified description by the gauge principle of Einstein-Hilbert gravity and SM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion Like Particles (ALPs) can be produced in Gamma Ray Bursts, altering the polarization of the electromagnetic emission in these events. For the first time, we derive bounds on the axion-photon coupling from polarization measurements of GRB 221009A, performing a full calculation of the Stokes parameters, as it is typically done in the astrophysics community. Within astrophysical uncertainties, our limits on the axion-photon coupling are competitive with complementary probes in the axion mass range $10^{-9}$ eV $\lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-8}$ eV, further allowing to probe motivated parameter space of ALP dark matter.</description>

      <title>TeV scale Leptogenesis with triplet Fermion in Connection to Muon $g-2$ and W mass anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose extending the minimal scotogenic model with a triplet fermion and a singlet scalar. All the fields change non-trivially under an additional $Z_{4}\times Z_{2}$ symmetry. The $Z_{4}\times Z_{2}$ symmetry allows only diagonal Yukawa couplings among different generations of SM leptons and right-handed singlet neutrinos. The one-loop radiative diagrams generate neutrino mass. The Yukawa coupling of the triplet fermion with the inert doublet positively contributes to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. The imposed $Z_{4}\times Z_{2}$ symmetry forbids the conventional leptogenesis from the right-handed neutrino decay. A net lepton asymmetry can be generated in the muonic sector from triplet fermion decay. Involvement of the Yukawa coupling both in leptogenesis and in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon results in a strong correlation between leptogenesis and the recent Fermi lab result. We show a viable parameter space for TeV scale leptogenesis while explaining the Fermi lab results. The inert scalar is the dark matter candidate in this model. The model also poses the potential to explain the latest results on W boson mass from the CDF-II experiment.</description>

Abstract: This set of notes was designed to accompany two hours of lectures and practical exercises at the New Horizons for Psi workshop in Lisbon in July 2024 entitled "Studying fundamental fields with numerical relativity". Numerical relativity is a tool used to help understand the behaviours of metric and matter fields in dynamical, strong gravity situations. It has been used to study a range of situations involving fundamental fields, including superradiance, modified gravity, dynamical friction, dark matter accretion and early universe cosmology. The purpose of this course is to provide some background and hands-on experience in numerical relativity that will help students to better understand the possibilities provided by this tool, as well as its limitations.</description>

      <title>Testing the assumptions of the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) attempts to amend some of the shortcomings of the traditional perturbative methods used in cosmology. It models the evolution of long-wavelength perturbations above a cutoff scale without the need for a detailed description of the short-wavelength ones. Short-scale physics is encoded in the coefficients of a series of operators composed of the long-wavelength fields, and ordered in a systematic expansion. As applied in the literature, the EFTofLSS corrects a summary statistic (such as the power spectrum) calculated from standard perturbation theory by matching it to $N$-body simulations or observations. This `bottom-up' construction is remarkably successful in extending the range of validity of perturbation theory. In this work, we compare this framework to a `top-down' approach, which estimates the EFT coefficients from the stress tensor of an $N$-body simulation, and propagates the corrections to the summary statistic. We consider simple initial conditions, viz. two sinusoidal, plane-parallel density perturbations with substantially different frequencies and amplitudes. We find that the leading EFT correction to the power spectrum in the top-down model is in excellent agreement with that inferred from the bottom-up approach which, by construction, provides an exact match to the numerical data. This result is robust to changes in the wavelength separation between the two linear perturbations. However, in our setup, the leading EFT coefficient does not always grow linearly with the cosmic expansion factor as assumed in the literature based on perturbative considerations. Instead, it decreases after orbit crossing takes place.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated a possible interaction between cold dark matter and dark energy, corresponding to a well-known interacting dark energy model discussed in the literature within the context of resolving the Hubble tension. We put constraints on it in a novel way, by creating new likelihoods with an analytical marginalization over the Hubble parameter $H_0$, the sound horizon $r_d$, and the supernova absolute magnitude $M_B$. Our aim is to investigate the impacts on the coupling parameter of the interacting model, $\xi$, and the equation of state of dark energy $w$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{m,0}$. The late-time cosmological probes used in our analysis include the PantheonPlus (calibrated and uncalibrated), cosmic chronometers, and baryon acoustic oscillation samples and the Pantheon for comparison. Through various combinations of these datasets, we demonstrate hints of an up to $2\sigma$ deviation from the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model.</description>

      <title>Consistent extinction model for type Ia supernovae in Cepheid-based calibration galaxies and its impact on $H_{0}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most recent SH0ES measurement of the Hubble constant employs corrections of type Ia supernova magnitudes due to extinction in their host galaxies. These corrections are estimated using a probabilistic model which is trained on Hubble flow (z&gt;0.03) supernovae and extrapolated to the calibration galaxies (those with observed Cepheids), despite the fact that the latter are selected based on criteria favouring disky and dust-rich systems. We show that this standard approach underestimates the brightness of reddened supernovae in the high stellar-mass ($M_{\star}&gt;10^{10}M_{\odot}$) calibration galaxies. This can be traced back to the fact that for these galaxies, a low total-to-selective extinction coefficient (R_B~3) is assumed, while for the low stellar-mass analogues a more standard R_ B~4 is adopted. We propose a minimalistic modification of the extinction model in the calibration galaxies in order to alleviate this systematic effect. The modification is twofold and it involves: (i) the same, Milky Way-like distribution of R_B (with mean R_B of 4.3 -- consistent with the extinction curve used for colour corrections of the Cepheids -- and scatter 0.4) and (ii) a modified shape of the E(B-V) reddening distribution while keeping the same effective slope of the supernova peak magnitude-colour relation and the same mean E(B-V) reddening as measured for supernovae in the Hubble flow. We show that this new approach yields a significantly better fit ($\Delta BIC=-11$) to the calibration data and results in a lower value of $H_{0}$. Our result is $H_{0}=70.5\pm1$ km/s/Mpc implying a reduction of the Hubble constant tension from $5.2\sigma$ to $2.8\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the recombination history by combining early and late cosmological probes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and apply a new framework for reconstructing the ionization history during the epoch of recombination with combinations of cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and supernova data. We find a wide range of ionization histories that are consistent with current CMB data, and also that cosmological parameter constraints are significantly weakened once freedom in recombination is introduced. BAO data partially break the degeneracy between cosmological parameters and the recombination model, and are therefore important in these reconstructions. The 95% confidence upper limits on H0 are 80.1 (70.7) km/s/Mpc given CMB (CMB+BAO) data, assuming no other changes are made to the standard cosmological model. Including Cepheid-calibrated supernova data in the analysis drives a preference for non-standard recombination histories with visibility functions that peak early and exhibit appreciable skewness.

      <title>Modeling parity-violating spectra in Galactic dust polarization with filaments and its applications to cosmic birefringence searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the dust-filament-based model presented in Herv\'ias-Caimapo &amp; Huffenberger 2022 to produce parity-violating foreground spectra by manipulating the filament orientations relative to the magnetic field. We calibrate our model to observations of the misalignment angle using cross-correlations of Planck and HI 21-cm line data, producing a fiducial model that predicts a $\mathcal{D}_{\ell}^{EB}\sim$few $\mu$K$^2$ dust signal at 353 GHz and where $\sim 56$% of filaments have a positive misalignment angle. The main purpose of this model is to be used as dust with non-zero parity-violating emission in forecasting a measurement of cosmic birefringence by upcoming experiments. Here, we also use our fiducial model to assess the impact of dust in measurements of the isotropic cosmic birefringence angle $\beta$ with Planck data by measuring the misalignment angle as a function of scale, as well as directly using our model's $\mathcal{D}_{\ell}^{EB}$ prediction as a template. In both cases, we measure $\beta$ to be consistent within $0.83\sigma$ of the equivalent measurements with Planck data and its derivatives.</description>

      <title>Null energy condition violation during inflation and pulsar timing array observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10685v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, evidence of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) signals observed by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations, has prompted investigations into their origins. We explore the compatibility of a proposed inflationary scenario, incorporating an intermediate null energy condition (NEC)-violating phase, with the PTA observations. The NEC violation potentially amplifies the primordial tensor power spectrum, offering a promising explanation for PTA observations. Numerical analyses, primarily focused on NANOGrav's 15-year results, reveal the model's compatibility with PTA data. Notably, the model predicts a nearly scale-invariant GW spectrum in the mHz frequency range, which sets our scenario apart from other interpretations predicting a red primordial GW spectrum on smaller scales.</description>

      <title>Holographic phenomenology via overlapping degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11016v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The holographic principle suggests that regions of space contain fewer physical degrees of freedom than would be implied by conventional quantum field theory. Meanwhile, in Hilbert spaces of large dimension $2^n$, it is possible to define $N \gg n$ Pauli algebras that are nearly anti-commuting (but not quite) and which can be thought of as "overlapping degrees of freedom". We propose to model the phenomenology of holographic theories by allowing field-theory modes to be overlapping, and derive potential observational consequences. In particular, we build a Fermionic quantum field whose effective degrees of freedom approximately obey area scaling and satisfy a cosmic Bekenstein bound, and compare predictions of that model to cosmic neutrino observations. Our implementation of holography implies a finite lifetime of plane waves, which depends on the overall UV cutoff of the theory. To allow for neutrino flux from blazar TXS 0506+056 to be observable, our model needs to have a cutoff $k_{\mathrm{UV}} \lesssim 500\, k_{\mathrm{LHC}}\,$. This is broadly consistent with current bounds on the energy spectrum of cosmic neutrinos from IceCube, but high energy neutrinos are a potential challenge for our model of holography. We motivate our construction via quantum mereology, i.e. using the idea that EFT degrees of freedom should emerge from an abstract theory of quantum gravity by finding quasi-classical Hilbert space decompositions. We also discuss how to extend the framework to Bosons. Finally, using results from random matrix theory we derive an analytical understanding of the energy spectrum of our theory.

      <title>High-redshift halo-galaxy connection via constrained simulations</title>

Abstract: The evolution of halos with masses around $M_\textrm{h} \approx 10^{11}\; \textrm{M}_\odot$ and $M_\textrm{h} \approx 10^{12}\; \textrm{M}_\odot$ at redshifts $z&gt;9$ is examined using constrained N-body simulations. {The average specific mass accretion rates, $\dot{M}_\textrm{h} / M_\textrm{h}$, exhibit minimal mass dependence and generally agree with existing literature. Individual halo accretion histories, however, vary substantially. } About one-third of simulations reveal an increase in $\dot{M}_\textrm{h}$ around $z\approx 13$. Comparing simulated halos with observed galaxies having spectroscopic redshifts, we find that for galaxies at $z\gtrsim9$, the ratio between observed star formation rate (SFR) and $\dot{M}_\textrm{h}$ is approximately $2\%$. This ratio remains consistent for the stellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR) but only for $z\gtrsim 10$. At $z\simeq 9$, the SHMR is notably lower by a factor of a few. At $z\gtrsim10$, there is an agreement between specific star formation rates (sSFRs) and $\dot{M}_\textrm{h} / M_\textrm{h}$. However, at $z\simeq 9$, observed sSFRs exceed simulated values by a factor of two. It is argued that the mildly elevated SHMR in high-$z$ halos with $M_\textrm{h} \approx 10^{11} M_{\odot}$, can be achieved by assuming the applicability of the local Kennicutt-Schmidt law and a reduced effectiveness of stellar feedback due to deeper gravitational potential of high-$z$ halos of a fixed mass.</description>

      <title>Sliding into DM: Determining the local dark matter density and speed distribution using only the local circular speed of the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use FIRE-2 zoom simulations of Milky Way size disk galaxies to derive easy-to-use relationships between the observed circular speed of the Galaxy at the Solar location, $v_\mathrm{c}$, and dark matter properties of relevance for direct detection experiments: the dark matter density, the dark matter velocity dispersion, and the speed distribution of dark matter particles near the Solar location. We find that both the local dark matter density and 3D velocity dispersion follow tight power laws with $v_\mathrm{c}$. Using this relation together with the observed circular speed of the Milky Way at the Solar radius, we infer the local dark matter density and velocity dispersion near the Sun to be $\rho = 0.42\pm 0.06\ \mathrm{GeV}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ and $\sigma_{\rm 3D} = 280^{+19}_{-18}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. We also find that the distribution of dark matter particle speeds is well-described by a modified Maxwellian with two shape parameters, both of which correlate with the observed $v_{\rm c}$. We use that modified Maxwellian to predict the speed distribution of dark matter near the Sun and find that it peaks at a most probable speed of $257\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and begins to truncate sharply above $470\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. This peak speed is somewhat higher than expected from the standard halo model, and the truncation occurs well below the formal escape speed to infinity, with fewer very-high-speed particles than assumed in the standard halo model.</description>
