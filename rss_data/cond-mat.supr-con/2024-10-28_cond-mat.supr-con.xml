      <title>A Time-Dependent Ginzburg-Landau Framework for Sample-Specific Simulation of Superconductors for SRF Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern superconducting radio frequency (SRF) applications require precise control of a wide range of material properties, from microscopic material parameters to mesoscopic/macroscopic surface structures. Mesoscopic simulation of superconductors has proven itself to be a powerful tool in SRF development, connecting microscopic properties to the mesoscopic structures of the material. We outline a Time-Dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) framework which combines both experimental measurements and theoretical estimations of the properties of realistic sample materials into spatially varying TDGL parameters. We also derive a way to estimate SRF quality factors from TDGL solutions. We demonstrate an application of this framework by modeling Sn-deficient islands in Nb$_3$Sn samples. We calculate the dissipation due to interactions of the superconducting order parameter and electromagnetic fields with these defects and estimate the impact to SRF cavity quality factor.</description>

      <title>Data-driven design of high-temperature superconductivity among ternary hydrides under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, ternary clathrate hydrides are promising candidates for high-temperature superconductor. However, it is a formidable challenge to effectively hunt high-temperature superconductivity among multinary hydrides due to the expensive computational cost associated with large unit cells and huge stoichiometric choices. Here we present an efficiently data-driven strategy, including generated clathrate frameworks, the quick estimation of stability for each framework and superconducting critical temperature (Tc) for each hydride structure, to accelerate the discovery of high-temperature superconducting hydrides. Our strategy was initialized with more than one million input structures via zeolite databases and our generated dataset. As a result, such a strategy hitherto uncovered 14 prototypical hydrogen frameworks for clathrate hydrides, which is 1.5 times greater than the number (9) of previously reported prototypes. Remarkably, eleven ternary clathrate structures were predicted to have Tcs above 250 K at 300 GPa. Further extensive global structure-searching simulations support that Li2NaH17 and ThY2H24 are thermodynamically stable at 220 and 150 GPa, respectively, with Tcs approaching room temperature of 297 K and 303 K, which are promising for future synthesis. These results offer a platform to explore high-temperature superconductors via a great number of databases.</description>

      <title>Magnet-superconductor hybrid quantum systems: a materials platform for topological superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnet-superconductor hybrid (MSH) systems have recently emerged as one of the most significant developments in condensed matter physics. This has generated, in the last decade, a steadily rising interest in the understanding of their unique properties. They have been proposed as one of the most promising platforms for the establishment of topological superconductivity, which holds high potential for application in future quantum information technologies. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) plays a crucial role in the race to unveil the fundamental origin of the unique properties of MSH systems, with the aim to discover new hybrid quantum materials capable of hosting topologically non-trivial unconventional superconducting phases. In particular, the combination of STM studies with tight-binding model calculations have represented, so far, the most successful approach to unveil and explain the emergent electronic properties of MSHs. The scope of this review is to offer a broad perspective on the field of MSHs from an atomic-level investigation point-of-view. The focus is on discussing the link between the magnetic ground state hosted by the hybrid system and the corresponding emergent superconducting phase. This is done for MSHs with both one-dimensional (atomic chains) and two-dimensional (atomic lattices and thin films) magnetic systems proximitized to conventional s-wave superconductors. We present a systematic categorization of the experimentally investigated systems with respect to defined experimentally accessible criteria to verify or falsify the presence of topological superconductivity and Majorana edge modes. Given the vast number of publications on the topic, we limit ourselves to discuss works which are most relevant to the search for topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Spin-Orbit Effects in Superconductors In$_5$Bi$_3$ and In$_5$Sb$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a first principles computational analysis of two phonon-mediated superconductors, In$_{5}$Bi$_{3}$ and In$_{5}$Sb$_{3}$. We show that spin-orbit coupling leads to splitting of electron bands around the Fermi energy, resulting in a suppression of the electronic density of states in both compounds. In In$_{5}$Bi$_{3}$, the spin-orbit coupling is essential for the dynamical stability of the experimentally observed phase, and the calculated superconducting critical temperature is in close agreement with measurements. In In$_{5}$Sb$_{3}$, the spin-orbit coupling significantly reduces the calculated superconducting critical temperature compared to calculations neglecting relativistic effects. Our work emphasises the subtle interplay between spin-orbit interactions and phonon-mediated superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and strain-enhanced phase stability of Janus tungsten chalcogenide hydride monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Janus transition metal-dichalcogenide (JTMD) materials have attracted a great deal of attention due to their remarkable physical properties arising from the two-dimensional geometry and the breakdown of the out-of-plane symmetry. Using first-principles density functional theory, we investigated the phase stability, strain-enhanced phase stability, and superconductivity of Janus WSeH and WSH. In addition, we investigated the contribution of the phonon linewidths from the phonon energy spectrum responsible for the superconductivity, and the electron-phonon coupling as a function of phonon wave vectors and modes. Previous work has examined hexagonal 2H and tetragonal 1T structures, but we found that neither is a ground state structure. The metastable 2H phase of WSeH is dynamically stable with Tc around 11.60K, similar to WSH. Compressive biaxial strain - the 2D equivalent of pressure - can stabilize the 1T structures of WSeH and WSH with Tc around 9.23K and 10.52K, respectively.</description>

      <title>Polar charge density wave in a superconductor with crystallographic chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry plays an important role in determining the physical properties in condensed matter physics, as the symmetry operations of any physical property must include the symmetry operations of the point group of the crystal. As a consequence, crystallographic polarity and chirality are expected to have an impact on the Cooper pairing in a superconductor. While superconductivity with crystallographic polarity and chirality have both been found in a few crystalline phases separately; however, their coexistence and material realizations have not been studied. Here, by utilizing transport, Raman scattering, and transmission electron microscopy, we unveil a unique realization of superconductivity in single-crystalline Mo3Al2C (superconducting Tc=8K) with a polar charge-density-wave phase and well-defined crystallographic chirality. We show that the intriguing charge density wave order leads to a noncentrosymmetric-nonpolar to polar transition below T*=155K via breaking both the translational and rotational symmetries. Superconductivity emerges in this polar and chiral crystal structure below Tc=8K. Our results establish that Mo3Al2C is a superconductor with crystallographic polarity and chirality simultaneously, and motivate future studies of unconventional superconductivity in this category.</description>

Abstract: In recent years there have emerged various ideas to create and control topological excitations in superconducting devices. Notably, nontrivial Chern bands were predicted to exist in conventional multiterminal Josephson junctions, but the Chern number is yet to be experimentally verified, and the pathway towards feasible quantum hardware applications is unclear. Here we show how generic multiterminal circuits can be expressed as gyrator networks with quantized gyration conductance, giving rise to anyonic excitations carrying $q/p$ fractional fluxes ($q,p$ integer), measurable via a fractional Aharonov-Casher phase. The magnitude of interactions between the anyons depends on the flatness of the topological bands, prompting us to investigate circuit-specific band-engineering techniques. Circular scattering in three-terminal quantum dot chains gives rise to a flat topological ground state, where disorder mitigates Chern number fluctuations and the quasiparticle continuum provides a work-around for known limitations to create nontrivial flat bands. Further band-engineering strategies are presented where the superconducting phase is scrambled either via parallelization or dissipative phase transitions. We provide concepts for error correction protocols, and quantum simulations of interacting fermionic (or generally anyonic) many-body systems -- notably, introducing the possibility to mimic fractional quantum Hall physics or to implement local fermionic models that explicitly break the Wigner superselection rule. The latter indicates that a full understanding of multiterminal circuits will require grappling with a virtually unexplored class of parity-breaking quantum field theories.</description>

Abstract: Pair-density-wave (PDW) is a long-sought exotic state with oscillating superconducting order without external magnetic field. So far it has been rare in establishing a 2D microscopic model with PDW long-range order in its ground state. Here we propose to study PDW superconductivity in a minimal model of spinless fermions on the honeycomb lattice with nearest-neighbor (NN) and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interaction $V_1$ and $V_2$, respectively. By performing a state-of-the-art density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) study of this $t$-$V_1$-$V_2$ model at finite doping on six-leg and eight-leg honeycomb cylinders, we showed that the ground state exhibits PDW ordering (namely quasi-long-range order with a divergent PDW susceptibility). Remarkably this PDW state persists on the wider cylinder with 2D-like Fermi surfaces (FS). To the best of our knowledge, this is probably the first controlled numerical evidence of PDW in systems with 2D-like FS.</description>

Abstract: Among known materials, hydride superconductors have the highest critical temperatures and are very promising as a basis for electronic sensors. Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUID), due to its unique sensitivity to magnetic fields, are the most important applications of superconductors in microelectronics. In this work, we describe a direct current SQUID made of lanthanum-cerium superhydride (La, Ce)H$_{10+x}$ at a pressure of 148 GPa, with an operating temperature of 179 K and a bias current of about 2 mA. When placing (La, Ce)H$_{10+x}$ in a modulated magnetic field (0.1-0.005 Hz, 5 G), we observed the generation of higher harmonics up to 18${\nu}$$_0$ and a periodic dependence of the sample resistance on the magnetic flux density R ${\propto}$ sin(${\pi}$${\Phi}$/${\Phi}$$_0$). We demonstrate that the (La, Ce)H$_{10+x}$ SQUID with a size of about 6 ${\mu}$m, operates in the mode of low thermal fluctuations and can be used to detect magnetic fields below 0.1 G. Our findings pave the road to more advanced applications of the Josephson effect and SQUIDs made of hydride superconductors.</description>

Abstract: We explore the possibility of obtaining new superconductor candidates from functionalized MXene compounds Zr$_2$NS$_2$, Zr$_2$NCl$_2$, and Sc$_2$NCl$_2$ based on $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations with density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT). The predicted superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ at ambient pressure may reach up to 9.48 K (Zr$_2$NS$_2$). Strain-induced $T_c$ enhancement is demonstrated with an example case for Zr$_2$NCl$_2$. We note a correlation between the profiles of superconducting gap $\Delta$ and the electron-phonon coupling $\lambda$ across the Fermi surface for all compounds, which are likely influenced by their modified electronic bandstructure components.</description>

      <title>Strange metal in the doped Hubbard model via percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18626v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many strongly correlated systems exhibit strange metallic behavior in certain parameter regimes characterized by anomalous transport properties that are irreconcilable with a Fermi-liquid-like description in terms of quasiparticles. The Hubbard model is a standard theoretical starting point to examine the properties of such systems and also exhibits non-Fermi-liquid behavior in simulations. Here we analytically study the two-dimensional hole-doped Hubbard model in the large $U$ limit, first identifying a doping-induced percolation transition in the low-energy sector occurring at a definite critical doping $p_c$ depending on lattice structure. Using the critical properties near this transition we rewrite the Hubbard Hamiltonian and motivate a low-energy lattice-independent large-$N$ model with distinct non-Fermi-liquid properties. We show that this model has linear-in-$T$ resistivity with doping-dependent slope maximized at $p=p_c$ and power-law optical conductivity $\sim |\omega|^{-2/3}$. Though the parameters used in developing this theory mean it cannot be directly applied to the cuprate superconductors, we nevertheless reproduce several important phenomena observed in their strange metal phase, and also predict these same qualitative behaviors to manifest in other lattices near concrete hole dopings.</description>

      <title>Superconducting resonator parametric amplifiers with intrinsic separation of pump and signal tones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02455v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting resonator parametric amplifiers achieve ultra-low-noise amplification through the nonlinear kinetic inductance of thin-film superconductors. One of the main challenges to the operation of these devices is the separation of the strong pump tone from the signal tone after amplification has been achieved. In this paper, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a pump separation method based on operating a half-wave superconducting resonator amplifier behind a cryogenic circulator. Our pump separation scheme does not involve post-amplification interference, and thereby avoids the delicate phase matching of two different pump paths. We demonstrate the scheme using two-port half-wave resonator amplifiers based on superconducting NbN thin-films. We present measurements of gain profiles and degrees of pump separation for amplifiers having different coupling quality factors. On an amplifier having a coupling quality factor of $\sim2000$, we measured a peak signal gain of $15\,\mathrm{dB}$ whilst achieving pump separation of $12\,\mathrm{dB}$. The amplifier was stable for continuous measurements, and the gain drift was measured to be $0.15\,\mathrm{dB}$ over an hour. The same amplifier was operated at $3.2\,\mathrm{K}$ and achieved a peak signal gain of $11\,\mathrm{dB}$ whilst having a pump separation factor of $10.5\,\mathrm{dB}$. The pump separation scheme, and these promising results, will advance the development of superconducting resonator amplifiers as an important technology in quantum sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study novel itinerant phases that can be accessed by doping a fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) insulator, with a focus on the experimentally observed Jain states at lattice filling $\nu = p/(2p+1)$. Unlike in the lowest Landau level, where charge motion is confined into cyclotron orbits, the charged excitations in the FQAH occupy Bloch states with well-defined crystal momenta. At a non-zero doping density, this enables the formation of itinerant states of the doped anyons just beyond the FQAH plateau region. Specializing to the vicinity of $\nu = 2/3$, we describe a few possible such itinerant states. These include a topological superconductor with chiral neutral fermion edge modes as well as a more exotic Pair Density Wave (PDW) superconductor with non-trivial non-Abelian topological order. A Fermi liquid metal with a doping-induced period-3 charge density wave also occurs naturally in our analysis. This Fermi liquid (as well as the PDW) arises from pairing instabilities of a composite Fermi liquid metal that can emerge near filling $2/3$. Though inspired by the theory of anyon superconductivity, we explain how our construction is qualitatively different. At a general Jain filling $\nu = p/(2p+1)$, the same analytical framework leads to a wider variety of phases including higher-charge superconductors and generalized composite Fermi liquids. We predict unusual physical signatures associated with each phase and analyze the crossover between different temperature regimes. These results provide a proof-of-principle that exotic itinerant phases can be stabilized by correlations intrinsic to the FQAH setup.</description>

Abstract: First-principles calculations combined with the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation reveal significant effects of the quantum ionic fluctuations and lattice anharmonicity on the dynamical stability of NbH3 under high pressures. Previous theoretical predictions, which ignored ionic fluctuations and relied on the harmonic approximation, suggested that the I43d phase is the most thermodynamically favorable structure between 33 and 400 GPa, with the Fm3m phase considered thermodynamically metastable. However, recent experiments at 187 GPa identified the Fm3m phase, conflicting with the prediction. In contrast, the present study indicates that the Fm3m phase remains dynamically stable down to at least 145 GPa, approximately 145 GPa lower than harmonic estimates, while the I43d phase is dynamically unstable at 187 GPa, consistent with the experimental findings. Furthermore, systematic calculations are performed on the structural, vibrational and superconducting properties of Fm3m NbH3 under pressures ranging from 100 to 300 GPa, revealing dramatic modifications due to the quantum and anharmonic effects. The calculated superconducting critical temperature (Tc) from the McMillan equation for Fm3m NbH3 at 187 GPa is 44 K, with mu set at 0.15, close to the measured value. These findings highlight the crucial role of quantum anharmonic effects in stabilizing the Fm3m phase.</description>
