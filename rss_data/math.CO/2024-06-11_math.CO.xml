      <title>Unifying adjacency, Laplacian, and signless Laplacian theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph with associated diagonal matrix of vertex degrees $D(G)$, adjacency matrix $A(G)$, Laplacian matrix $L(G)$ and signless Laplacian matrix $Q(G)$. Recently, Nikiforov proposed the family of matrices $A_\alpha(G)$ defined for any real $\alpha\in [0,1]$ as $A_\alpha(G):=\alpha\,D(G)+(1-\alpha)\,A(G)$, and also mentioned that the matrices $A_\alpha(G)$ can underpin a unified theory of $A(G)$ and $Q(G)$. Inspired from the above definition, we introduce the $B_\alpha$-matrix of $G$, $B_\alpha(G):=\alpha A(G)+(1-\alpha)L(G)$ for $\alpha\in [0,1]$. Note that $ L(G)=B_0(G), D(G)=2B_{\frac{1}{2}}(G), Q(G)=3B_{\frac{2}{3}}(G), A(G)=B_1(G)$. In this article, we study several spectral properties of $ B_\alpha $-matrices to unify the theories of adjacency, Laplacian, and signless Laplacian matrices of graphs. In particular, we prove that each eigenvalue of $ B_\alpha(G) $ is continuous on $ \alpha $. Using this, we characterize positive semidefinite $ B_\alpha $-matrices in terms of $\alpha$. As a consequence, we provide an upper bound of the independence number of $ G $. Besides, we establish some bounds for the largest and the smallest eigenvalues of $B_\alpha(G)$. As a result, we obtain a bound for the chromatic number of $G$ and deduce several known results. In addition, we present a Sachs-type result for the characteristic polynomial of a $ B_\alpha $-matrix.</description>

      <title>Operadic structure on Hamiltonian paths and cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Hamiltonian paths and cycles in undirected graphs from an operadic viewpoint. We show that the graphical collection $\mathsf{Ham}$ encoding directed Hamiltonian paths in connected graphs admits an operad-like structure, called a contractad. Similarly, we construct the graphical collection of Hamiltonian cycles $\mathsf{CycHam}$ that forms a right module over the contractad $\mathsf{Ham}$. We use the machinery of contractad generating series for counting Hamiltonian paths/cycles for particular types of graphs.</description>

      <title>Random Shadows of Fixed Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the number of vertices of a two dimensional projection, called a shadow, of a polytope is a fundamental tool for understanding the performance of the shadow simplex method for linear programming among other applications. We prove multiple upper bounds on the expected number of vertices of a random shadow of a fixed polytope. Our bounds are in terms of various parameters in the literature including geometric diameter and edge lengths, minimal and maximal slack, maximal coordinates for lattice polytopes, and maximum absolute values of subdeterminants. For the case of geometric diameter and edge lengths, we prove lower bounds and argue that our upper and lower bounds are both tight for zonotopes.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic degenerate Stirling numbers of the first kind and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let Y be a random variable whose degenerate moment generating functions exist in some neighborhoods of the origin. The aim of this paper is to study the probabilistic degenerate Stirling numbers of the first kind associated with Y which are constructed from the degenerate cumulant generating function of Y. They are a degenerate version of the probabilistic Stirling numbers of the first kind associated with Y, which were recently introduced by Adell-Benyi. We investigate some properties, related identities, recurrence relations and explicit expressions for those numbers. In addition, we apply our results to the special cases of normal and gamma random variables.</description>

      <title>Constructions, bounds, and algorithms for peaceable queens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The peaceable queens problem asks to determine the maximum number $a(n)$ such that there is a placement of $a(n)$ white queens and $a(n)$ black queens on an $n \times n$ chessboard so that no queen can capture any queen of the opposite color.
  In this paper, we consider the peaceable queens problem and its variant on the toroidal board. For the toroidal board, we provide new upper and lower bounds. Somewhat surprisingly, our bounds show that there is a sharp contrast in behaviour between the odd torus and the even torus. Our lower bounds are given by explicit constructions. For the upper bounds, we formulate the problem as a quadratic optimization problem with at most $70$ variables, regardless of the size of the board. We solve our quadratic program exactly using modern optimization software. Our method is quite robust. For example, with very minor changes, it also provides upper bounds for the regular board. In particular, we show that $a(n) \leq 0.1641n^2$, for all $n$. This improves on the bound $a(n) \leq 0.25n^2$ of van Bommel and MacEachern.
  We also provide a local search algorithm and a software implementation which converges very rapidly to solutions which appear optimal. Our algorithm is sufficiently robust that it works on both the classical and toroidal boards. For example, for the classical board, the algorithm quickly finds the so-called Ainley construction. Thus, our work provides some further evidence that the Ainley construction is indeed optimal.</description>

      <title>Rational Delsarte designs and Galois fusions of association schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delsarte theory, more specifically the study of codes and designs in association schemes, has proved invaluable in studying an increasing assortment of association schemes in recent years. Tools motivated by the study of error-correcting codes in the Hamming scheme and combinatorial $t$-designs in the Johnson scheme apply equally well in association schemes with irrational eigenvalues. We assume here that we have a commutative association scheme with irrational eigenvalues and wish to study its Delsarte $T$-designs. We explore when a $T$-design is also a $T'$-design where $T'\supseteq T$ is controlled by the orbits of a Galois group related to the splitting field of the association scheme. We then study Delsarte designs in the association schemes of finite groups, with a detailed exploration of the dicyclic groups.</description>

      <title>Edge Metric Dimension of Silicate Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metric dimension is an essential parameter in graph theory that aids in addressing issues pertaining to information retrieval, localization, network design, and chemistry through the identification of the least possible number of elements necessary to identify the distances between vertices in a graph uniquely. A variant of metric dimension, called the edge metric dimension focuses on distinguishing the edges in a graph $G$, with a vertex subset. The minimum possible number of vertices in such a set is denoted as $\dim_E(G)$. This paper presents the precise edge metric dimension of silicate networks.</description>

      <title>Majority Dynamics and Internal Partitions of Random Regular Graphs: Experimental Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on Majority Dynamics in sparse graphs, in particular, as a tool to study internal cuts. It is known that, in Majority Dynamics on a finite graph, each vertex eventually either comes to a fixed state, or oscillates with period two. The empirical evidence acquired by simulations suggests that for random odd-regular graphs, approximately half of the vertices end up oscillating with high probability. We notice a local symmetry between oscillating and non-oscillating vertices, that potentially can explain why the fraction of the oscillating vertices is concentrated around $\frac{1}{2}$. In our simulations, we observe that the parts of random odd-regular graph under Majority Dynamics with high probability do not contain $\lceil \frac{d}{2} \rceil$-cores at any timestep, and thus, one cannot use Majority Dynamics to prove that internal cuts exist in odd-regular graphs almost surely. However, we suggest a modification of Majority Dynamics, that yields parts with desired cores with high probability.</description>

      <title>Transitive regular $q$-analogs of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1976, Delsarte introduced the notion of $q$-analogs of designs, and $q$-analogs of graphs were introduced recently by M. Braun et al. In this paper, we extend that study by giving a method for constructing transitive regular $q$-analogs of graphs. Further, we illustrate the method by giving some examples. Additionally, we introduced the notion of $q$-analogs of quasi-strongly regular graphs and give examples of transitive $q$-analogs of quasi-strongly regular graphs coming from spreads.</description>

      <title>Spanning trees and signless Laplacian spectral radius in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph and let $k$ be a positive integer. Let $T$ be a spanning tree of $G$. The leaf degree of a vertex $v\in V(T)$ is defined as the number of leaves adjacent to $v$ in $T$. The leaf degree of $T$ is the maximum leaf degree among all the vertices of $T$. Let $A(G)$ be the adjacency matrix of $G$ and $D(G)$ be the diagonal degree matrix of $G$. Let $Q(G)=D(G)+A(G)$ be the signless Laplacian matrix of $G$. The largest eigenvalue of $Q(G)$, denoted by $q(G)$, is called the signless Laplacian spectral radius of $G$. In this paper, we investigate the connection between the spanning tree and the signless Laplacian spectral radius of $G$, and put forward a sufficient condition based upon the signless Laplacian spectral radius to guarantee that a graph $G$ contains a spanning tree with leaf degree at most $k$. Finally, we construct some extremal graphs to claim all the bounds obtained in this paper are sharp.</description>

Abstract: Let $ G_1 \circledast G_2$,$ G_1 \sqcupdot G_2 $ and $ G_1 \sqcupplus G_2$ denote the total corona, $Q$-vertex corona and $Q$-edge corona of two graphs $ G_1$ and $ G_2 $, respectively. In this paper, we compute the $A_\alpha$-spectrum of $ G_1 \circledast G_2$,$ G_1 \sqcupdot G_2 $ and $ G_1 \sqcupplus G_2$ for regular graphs $ G_1$ and $ G_2$. As an application, we construct infinitely many pairs of $A_\alpha$-cospectral graphs.</description>

      <title>Pattern containment in random permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies permutation statistics that count occurrences of patterns. Their expected values on a product of $t$ permutations chosen randomly from $\Gamma \subseteq S_{n}$, where $\Gamma$ is a union of conjugacy classes, are considered. Hultman has described a method for computing such an expected value, denoted $\mathbb{E}_{\Gamma}(s,t)$, of a statistic $s$, when $\Gamma$ is a union of conjugacy classes of $S_{n}$. The only prerequisite is that the mean of $s$ over the conjugacy classes is written as a linear combination of irreducible characters of $S_{n}$. Therefore, the main focus of this article is to express the means of pattern-counting statistics as such linear combinations. A procedure for calculating such expressions for statistics counting occurrences of classical and vincular patterns of length 3 is developed, and is then used to calculate all these expressions. The results can be used to compute $\mathbb{E}_{\Gamma}(s,t)$ for all the above statistics, and for all functions on $S_{n}$ that are linear combinations of them.</description>

      <title>Operad of posets 101: The Wixarika posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study objects whose definition is linked to partial orders. An algebra over the operad of posets is a set whose endomorphisms contain the endomorphisms of posets. Notable examples of such algebras include the zeta values, order polytopes, and shuffle series. The language of operads provides us with tools to better understand the combinatorics of these objects.
  In these notes we describe a non-trivial example of a suboperad ``The Wixarika posets'', alongside its associated algebras. This example is rich enough to showcase the particularities of the field, without delving into technicalities.
  An old version of these notes were used to give a minicourse in Govt. College University Lahore in Pakistan 2022, and at the BIRS-CMO workshop ``6th meeting of the Mexican Mathematicians in the World'' 2024.</description>

      <title>Constructions of Tur\'an systems that are tight up to a multiplicative constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For positive integers $n\ge s&gt; r$, the Tur\'an function $T(n,s,r)$ is the smallest size of an r-graph with n vertices such that every set of s vertices contains at least one edge. Also, define the Tur\'an density $t(s,r)$ as the limit of $T(n,s,r)/ {n\choose r}$ as $n\to\infty$. The question of estimating these parameters received a lot of attention after it was first raised by Tur\'an in 1941. A trivial lower bound is $t(s,r)\ge 1/{s\choose s-r}$. In the early 1990s, de Caen conjectured that $r\cdot t(r+1,r)\to\infty$ as $r\to\infty$.
  We disprove this conjecture by showing more strongly that for every integer $R\ge1$ there is $\mu_R$ (in fact, $\mu_R$ can be taken to grow as $(1+o(1))\, R\ln R$) such that
  $t(r+R,r)\le (\mu_R+o(1))/ {r+R\choose R}$ as $r\to\infty$, that is, the trivial lower bound is tight for every $R$ up to a multiplicative constant $\mu_R$.</description>

Abstract: Multiple harmonic-like numbers are studied using the generating function approach. A closed form is stated for binomial sums involving these numbers and two additional parameters. Several corollaries and examples are presented which are immediate consequences of the main result. Finally, combinatorial identities involving harmonic-like numbers and other prominent sequences like hyperharmonic numbers and odd harmonic numbers are offered.</description>

      <title>Reality determining subgraphs and strongly real modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of pseudo q-factorization graphs was recently introduced by the last two authors as a combinatorial language which is suited for capturing certain properties of Drinfeld polynomials. Using certain known representation theoretic facts about tensor products of Kirillov Reshetikhin modules and qcharacters, combined with special topological/combinatorial properties of the underlying q-factorization graphs, the last two authors showed that, for algebras of type A, modules associated to totally ordered graphs are prime, while those associated to trees are real. In this paper, we extend the latter result. We introduce the notions of strongly real modules and that of trees of modules satisfying certain properties. In particular, we can consider snake trees, i.e., trees formed from snake modules. Among other results, we show that a certain class of such generalized trees, which properly contains the snake trees, give rise to strongly real modules.</description>

      <title>Open Packing in Graphs: Bounds and Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G(V,E)$, a vertex subset S of G is called an open packing in G if no pair of distinct vertices in S have a common neighbour in G. The size of a largest open packing in G is called the open packing number of G and is denoted by $\rho^o(G)$. It would be interesting to note that the open packing number is a lower bound for the total domination number in graphs with no isolated vertices [Henning and Slater, 1999]. Given a graph G and a positive integer k, the decision problem OPEN PACKING tests whether G has an open packing of size at least k. The optimization problem MAX-OPEN PACKING takes a graph G as input and finds the open packing number of G. It is known that OPEN PACKING is NP-complete on split graphs (i.e., the class of $\{2K_2,C_4,C_5\}$-free graphs) [Ramos et al., 2014]. In this work, we complete the study on the complexity (P vs NPC) of OPEN PACKING on H-free graphs for every graph H with at least three vertices by proving that OPEN PACKING is (i) NP-complete on $K_{1,3}$-free graphs and (ii) polynomial time solvable on $(P_4\cup rK_1)$-free graphs for every $r\geq 1$. In the course of proving (ii), we show that for every $t\in {2,3,4}$ and $r\geq 1$, if G is a $(P_t\cup rK_1)$-free graph, then $\rho^o(G)$ is bounded above by a linear function of r. Moreover, we show that OPEN PACKING parameterized by solution size is W[1]-complete on $K_{1,3}$-free graphs and MAX-OPEN PACKING is hard to approximate within a factor of $n^{(\frac{1}{2}-\delta)}$ for any $\delta&gt;0$ on $K_{1,3}$-free graphs unless P=NP. Further, we prove that OPEN PACKING is (a) NP-complete on $K_{1,4}$-free split graphs and (b) polynomial time solvable on $K_{1,3}$-free split graphs. We prove a similar dichotomy result on split graphs with degree restrictions on the vertices in the independent set of the clique-independent set partition of the split graphs.</description>

Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Graham found it conceivable that the best $n$-term Egyptian underapproximation of almost every positive number for sufficiently large $n$ gets constructed in a greedy manner, i.e., from the best $(n-1)$-term Egyptian underapproximation. We show that the opposite is true: the set of real numbers with this property has Lebesgue measure zero. [This note solves Problem 206 on Bloom's website "Erd\H{o}s problems".]</description>

Abstract: We show that in any $d$-dimensional real normed space, unit balls can be packed with density at least \[\frac{(1-o(1))d\log d}{2^{d+1}},\] improving a result of Schmidt from 1958 by a logarithmic factor and generalizing the recent result of Campos, Jenssen, Michelen, and Sahasrabudhe in the $\ell_2$ norm. Our main tools are the graph-theoretic result used in the $\ell_2$ construction and recent progress on the Bourgain slicing problem.</description>

      <title>The canonical trace of Cohen-Macaulay algebras of codimension 2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we investigate a conjecture of J\"urgen Herzog. Let $S$ be a local regular ring with residue field $K$ or a positively graded $K$-algebra, $I\subset S$ be a perfect ideal of grade two, and let $R=S/I$ with canonical module $\omega_R$. Herzog conjectured that the canonical trace $\text{tr}(\omega_R)$ is obtained by specialization from the generic case of maximal minors. We prove this conjecture in several cases, and present a criterion that guarantees that the canonical trace specializes under some additional assumptions. As the final conclusion of all of our results, we classify the nearly Gorenstein monomial ideals of height two.</description>

Abstract: An amply regular graph is a regular graph such that any two adjacent vertices have $\alpha$ common neighbors and any two vertices with distance $2$ have $\beta$ common neighbors. We prove a sharp lower bound estimate for the Lin--Lu--Yau curvature of any amply regular graph with girth $3$ and $\beta&gt;\alpha$. The proof involves new ideas relating discrete Ricci curvature with local matching properties: This includes a novel construction of a regular bipartite graph from the local structure and related distance estimates. As a consequence, we obtain sharp diameter and eigenvalue bounds for amply regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of local face distributions and the face distribution of the complete graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02774v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in the distribution of the number of faces across all the $2-$cell embeddings of a graph, which is equivalent to the distribution of genus by Euler's formula. In order to study this distribution, we consider the local distribution of faces at a single vertex. We show an asymptotic uniformity on this local face distribution which holds for any graph with large vertex degrees.
  We use this to study the usual face distribution of the complete graph. We show that in this case, the local face distribution determines the face distribution for almost all of the whole graph. We use this result to show that a portion of the complete graph of size $(1-o(1))|K_n|$ has the same face distribution as the set of all permutations, up to parity. Along the way, we prove new character bounds and an asymptotic uniformity on conjugacy class products.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clar number and Fries number are two thoroughly investigated parameters of plane graphs emerging from mathematical chemistry to measure stability of organic molecules. We consider first a common generalization of these two concepts for bipartite plane graphs, and then extend it to a framework on general (not necessarily planar) directed graphs. The corresponding optimization problem can be transformed into a maximum weight feasible tension problem which is the linear programming dual of a minimum cost network flow (or circulation) problem. Therefore the approach gives rise to a min-max theorem and to a strongly polynomial algorithm that relies exclusively on standard network flow subroutines. In particular, we give the first network flow based algorithm for an optimal Fries structure and its variants.</description>

      <title>Local central limit theorem for triangle counts in sparse random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X_H$ be the number of copies of a fixed graph $H$ in $G(n,p)$. In 2016, Gilmer and Kopparty conjectured that a local central limit theorem should hold for $X_H$ as long as $H$ is connected, $p \gg n^{-1/m(H)}$ and $n^2(1-p)\gg 1$. Recently, Sah and Sahwney showed that the Gilmer--Kopparty conjecture holds for constant $p$. In this paper, we show that the Gilmer--Kopparty conjecture holds for triangle counts in the sparse range. More precisely, if $p \in (4n^{-1/2}, 1/2)$, then \[\sup_{x\in \mathcal{L}}\left| \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-x^2/2}-\sigma\cdot \mathbb{P}(X^* = x)\right|=n^{-1/2+o(1)}p^{1/2},\] where $\sigma^2 = \mathbb{V}\text{ar}(X_{K_3})$, $X^{*}=(X_{K_3}-\mathbb{E}(X_{K_3}))/\sigma$ and $\mathcal{L}$ is the support of $X^*$. By combining our result with the results of R\"ollin--Ross and Gilmer--Kopparty, this establishes the Gilmer--Kopparty conjecture for triangle counts for $n^{-1}\ll p &lt; c$, for any constant $c\in (0,1)$. Our quantitative result is enough to prove that the triangle counts converge to an associated normal distribution also in the $\ell_1$-distance. This is the first local central limit theorem for subgraph counts above the $m_2$-density.</description>

      <title>The power of many colours</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical problem, due to Gerencs\'er and Gy\'arf\'as from 1967, asks how large a monochromatic connected component can we guarantee in any $r$-edge colouring of $K_n$? We consider how big a connected component can we guarantee in any $r$-edge colouring of $K_n$ if we allow ourselves to use up to $s$ colours. This is actually an instance of a more general question of Bollob\'as from about 20 years ago which asks for a $k$-connected subgraph in the same setting. We complete the picture in terms of the approximate behaviour of the answer by determining it up to a logarithmic term, provided $n$ is large enough. We obtain more precise results for certain regimes which solve a problem of Liu, Morris and Prince from 2007, as well as disprove a conjecture they pose in a strong form.
  We also consider a generalisation in a similar direction of a question first considered by Erd\H{o}s and R\'enyi in 1956, who considered given $n$ and $m$, what is the smallest number of $m$-cliques which can cover all edges of $K_n$? This problem is essentially equivalent to the question of what is the minimum number of vertices that are certain to be incident to at least one edge of some colour in any $r$-edge colouring of $K_n$. We consider what happens if we allow ourselves to use up to $s$ colours. We obtain a more complete understanding of the answer to this question for large $n$, in particular determining it up to a constant factor for all $1\le s \le r$, as well as obtaining much more precise results for various ranges including the correct asymptotics for essentially the whole range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We expand the affine Weyl denominator formulas as signed $q$-series of ordinary Weyl characters running over the affine Grassmannian. Here the grading in $q$ coincides with the (dual) atomic length of the root system considered as introduced by Chapelier-Laget and Gerber. Next, we give simple expressions of the atomic lengths in terms of self-conjugate core partitions. This permits in particular to rederive, from the general theory of affine root systems, some results of the second author obtained by case-by-case computations on determinants and the use of particular families of self-conjugate or doubled distinct partitions. These families are proved to be in simple one-to-one correspondences with families of distinct partitions and thus with the previous core partition model and, through this correspondence, the atomic length on cores equates the rank of the strict partitions considered. Finally, we make explicit some interactions between the affine Grassmannian elements and the Nekrasov--Okounkov type formulas. For the affine Weyl group of type A, this connection permits to count the cardinalities of some refinements of the inversion sets by using the hook lengths of the corresponding cores.</description>

Abstract: The mean color number of an $n$-vertex graph $G$, denoted by $\mu(G)$, is the average number of colors used in all proper $n$-colorings of $G$. For any graph $G$ and a vertex $w$ in $G$, Dong (2003) conjectured that if $H$ is a graph obtained from a graph $G$ by deleting all but one of the edges which are incident to $w$, then $\mu(G)\geq \mu(H)$; and also conjectured that $\mu(G)\geq \mu((G-w)\cup K_1)$. We prove that there is an infinite family of counterexamples to these two conjectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In \cite{Fi} A. Fish proved that if $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ are two subsets of $\mathbb{Z}$ of positive upper Banach density, then there exists $k\in\mathbb{Z}\setminus{0}$ such that $k\cdot\mathbb{Z}\subset\left(E_{1}-E_{1}\right)\cdot\left(E_{2}-E_{2}\right)$. In \cite{G}, S. Goswami proved the same but a fundamental result on the set of prime numbers $\mathbb{P}$ in $\mathbb{N}$ and proved that for some $k\in\mathbb{N}$, $k\cdot\mathbb{N}\subset\left(\mathbb{P}-\mathbb{P}\right)\cdot\left(\mathbb{P}-\mathbb{P}\right)$. To do so, Goswami mainly proved that the product of an $IP^{\star}$-set with an $IP_{r}^{\star}$-set contains $k\mathbb{N}$. This result is very important and surprising to mathematicians who are aware of combinatorially rich sets. In this article, we extend Goswami's result to large Lntegral Domain, that behave like $\mathbb{N}$ in the sense of some combinatorics. We prove that for a combinatorially rich ($CR$-set) set, $A$, for some $k\in\mathbb{N}$, $k\cdot\mathbb{N}\subset\left(A-A\right)\cdot\left(A-A\right)$. We provide a new proof that if we partition a large Integral Domain, $R$, into finitely many cells, then at least one cell is both additive and multiplicative central, and we prove the converse part, which is a new and unknown result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a closure technique for Hamilton-connectedness of $\{K_{1,3},\Gamma_3\}$-free graphs, where $\Gamma_3$ is the graph obtained by joining two vertex-disjoint triangles with a path of length $3$. The closure turns a claw-free graph into a line graph of a multigraph while preserving its (non)-Hamilton-connectedness. The most technical parts of the proof are computer-assisted.
  The main application of the closure is given in a subsequent paper showing that every $3$-connected $\{K_{1,3},\Gamma_3\}$-free graph is Hamilton-connected, thus resolving one of the two last open cases in the characterization of pairs of connected forbidden subgraphs implying Hamilton-connectedness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a given hypergraph $H$ and a vertex $v\in V(H)$, consider a random matching $M$ chosen uniformly from the set of all matchings in $H.$ In $1995,$ Kahn conjectured that if $H$ is a $d$-regular linear $k$-uniform hypergraph, the probability that $M$ does not cover $v$ is $(1 + o_d(1))d^{-1/k}$ for all vertices $v\in V(H).$ This conjecture was proved for $k = 2$ by Kahn and Kim in $1998.$
  In this paper, we disprove this conjecture for all $k \geq 3.$ For infinitely many values of $d,$ we construct $d$-regular linear $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ containing two vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$ such that $\mathcal{P}(v_1 \notin M) = 1 - \frac{(1 + o_d(1))}{d^{k-2}}$ and $\mathcal{P}(v_2 \notin M) = \frac{(1 + o_d(1))}{d+1}.$ The gap between $\mathcal{P}(v_1 \notin M)$ and $\mathcal{P}(v_2 \notin M)$ in this $H$ is best possible. In the course of proving this, we also prove a hypergraph analog of Godsil's result on matching polynomials and paths in graphs, which is of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: In a recent study, Bryant, Francis and Steel investigated the concept of \enquote{future-proofing} consensus methods in phylogenetics. That is, they investigated if such methods can be robust against the introduction of additional data like added trees or new species. In the present manuscript, we analyze consensus methods under a different aspect of introducing new data, namely concerning the discovery of new clades. In evolutionary biology, often formerly unresolved clades get resolved by refined reconstruction methods or new genetic data analyses. In our manuscript we investigate which properties of consensus methods can guarantee that such new insights do not disagree with previously found consensus trees, but merely refine them, a property termed \emph{monotonicity}. Along the lines of analyzing monotonicity, we also study two {established} supertree methods, namely Matrix Representation with Parsimony (MRP) and Matrix Representation with Compatibility (MRC), which have also been suggested as consensus methods in the literature. While we (just like Bryant, Francis and Steel in their recent study) unfortunately have to conclude some negative answers concerning general consensus methods, we also state some relevant and positive results concerning the majority rule ($\mathtt{MR}$) and strict consensus methods, which are amongst the most frequently used consensus methods. Moreover, we show that there exist infinitely many consensus methods which are monotonic and have some other desirable properties.

      <description>arXiv:2305.17974v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polygon equations generalize the prominent pentagon equation in very much the same way as simplex equations generalize the famous Yang-Baxter equation. In particular, they appeared as ''cocycle equations'' in Street's category theory associated with oriented simplices. Whereas the $(N-1)$-simplex equation can be regarded as a realization of the higher Bruhat order $B(N,N-2)$, the $N$-gon equation is a realization of the higher Tamari order $T(N,N-2)$. The latter and its dual $\tilde T(N,N-2)$, associated with which is the dual $N$-gon equation, have been shown to arise as suborders of $B(N,N-2)$ via a ''three-color decomposition''. There are two different reductions of $T(N,N-2)$ and $\tilde T(N,N-2)$, to ${T(N-1,N-3)}$, respectively $\tilde T(N-1,N-3)$. In this work, we explore the corresponding reductions of (dual) polygon equations, which lead to relations between solutions of neighboring (dual) polygon equations. We also elaborate (dual) polygon equations in this respect explicitly up to the octagon equation.</description>

Abstract: Tautological bundles of realizations of matroids were introduced in [BEST23] as a unifying geometric model for studying matroids. We compute the cohomologies of exterior and symmetric powers of these vector bundles, and show that they depend only on the matroid of the realization. As an application, we show that the log canonical bundle of a wonderful compactification of a hyperplane arrangement complement, in particular the moduli space of pointed rational curves, has vanishing higher cohomologies.</description>

      <title>Limiting Moments of Autocorrelation Demerit Factors of Binary Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An aperiodic binary sequence of length $\ell$ is a doubly infinite sequence $f=\ldots,f_{-1},f_0,f_1,\ldots$ with $f_j \in \{-1,1\}$ when $0 \leq j &lt; \ell$ and and $f_j=0$ otherwise. Various problems in engineering and natural science demand binary sequences that do not resemble translates of themselves. The autocorrelation of $f$ at shift $s$ is the dot product of $f$ with the sequence obtained by translating $f$ by $s$ places. The demerit factor of $f$ is the sum of the squares of the autocorrelations at all nonzero shifts for the sequence obtained by normalizing $f$ to unit Euclidean norm. Low demerit factor therefore indicates low self-similarity under translation. We endow the $2^\ell$ binary sequences of length $\ell$ with uniform probability measure and consider the distribution of their demerit factors. Earlier works used combinatorial techniques to find exact formulas for the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the distribution as a function of $\ell$. These revealed that for $\ell \geq 4$, the $p$th central moment of this distribution is strictly positive for every $p \geq 2$. This article shows that every $p$th central moment is a quasi-polynomial function of $\ell$ with rational coefficients divided by $\ell^{2 p}$. It also shows that, in the limit as $\ell$ tends to infinity, the $p$th standardized moment is the same as that of the standard normal distribution.</description>

      <title>Realizability of Rectangular Euler Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Euler diagrams are a tool for the graphical representation of set relations. Due to their simple way of visualizing elements in the sets by geometric containment, they are easily readable by an inexperienced reader. Euler diagrams where the sets are visualized as aligned rectangles are of special interest. In this work, we link the existence of such rectangular Euler diagrams to the order dimension of an associated order relation. For this, we consider Euler diagrams in one and two dimensions. In the one-dimensional case, this correspondence provides us with a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the Euler diagrams, while the two-dimensional case is linked to an NP-complete problem which we approach with an exponential-time algorithm.</description>

      <title>A canonical tree decomposition for order types, and some applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a notion of decomposition of planar point sets (or rather of their chirotopes) as trees decorated by smaller chirotopes. This decomposition is based on the concept of mutually avoiding sets (which we rephrase as \emph{modules}), and adapts in some sense the modular decomposition of graphs in the world of chirotopes. The associated tree always exists and is unique up to some appropriate constraints. We also show how to compute the number of triangulations of a chirotope efficiently, starting from its tree and the (weighted) numbers of triangulations of its parts.</description>

      <title>Fringe trees of Patricia tries and compressed binary search trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most of the results in the paper for Patricia tries have earlier been proved by Jaspar Ischebeck.
  We study the distribution of fringe trees in Patricia tries and compressed binary search trees; both cases are random binary trees that have been compressed by deleting vertices of outdegree 1 so that they are random full binary trees. The main results are central limit theorems for the number of fringe trees of a given type, which imply quenched and annealed limit results for the fringe tree distribution; for Patricia tries, this is complicated by periodic oscillations in the usual manner. We also consider extended fringe trees. The results are derived from earlier results for uncompressed tries and binary search trees. In the case of compressed binary search trees, it seems difficult to give a closed formula for the asymptotic fringe tree distribution, but we provide a recursion and give examples.</description>
