      <title>On the Applicability Ranges of Tc Formulas for Proximity-Coupled Thin SN and SS Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This brief note revisits the well-established $T_c$ formulas for proximity-coupled thin superconductor-normal conductor (SN) and superconductor-superconductor (SS) bilayers, highlighting their relationships and clarifying their ranges of applicability. Since these formulas are often misapplied in practical contexts, this note provides guidance for their correct use in experimental and applied settings. For SN bilayers, McMillan's formula is recommended for its broad applicability, with its SS counterpart offering similar reliability.</description>

      <title>Berry monopoles and divergent quantum metric in systems with non-integer band dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum geometric tensor, which is comprised of the Berry curvature and quantum metric, in a generalized Dirac two-band system with non-integer dispersion, $E(\mathbf{k})\sim k^{\alpha}$. Our analysis reveals that this type of dispersion introduces significant and novel effects on band geometry and topology. We calculate the Berry curvature and observe its redistribution in momentum space as $\alpha$ varies. Notably, despite this redistribution, the change in Chern number across topological transitions remains quantized as an integer, even for non-integer $\alpha$. We illustrate the physical implications of this redistribution by computing the orbital magnetization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Berry curvature and quantum metric can become concentrated and even diverge in regions of momentum space where the energy band exhibits high curvature or non-analytic behavior. While it is well established that Berry curvature monopoles form at band touchings, our findings indicate that they can also emerge at sharp band corners, even in the absence of band touchings.</description>

      <title>Purely two-dimensional vortex matter in infinite-layer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the dimensionality of the superconducting state in the infinite-layer (IL) nickelates is crucial to understand its nature. Most studies have addressed the problem by studying the anisotropy of the upper critical fields. Yet, the dominance of Pauli-paramagnetism effects over orbital ones makes it challenging to interpret the experiments in terms of dimensionality. Here we address the question from a different perspective, by investigating the vortex phase diagram in the mixed-state. We demonstrate that superconducting Pr0.8Sr0.2NiO2 thin films present a vortex liquid-to-glass transition of a purely two-dimensional nature. The obtained results suggest that bidimensionality is an intrinsic property, and that superconductivity resides in fully-decoupled NiO2 planes. In this scenario, the coherence length along the c-axis must be shorter than the distance between those planes, while Josephson and magnetostatic coupling between them must be negligible. We believe that these conclusions are relevant for theories on the origin of superconductivity in the IL-nickelates.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamics of superconductivity in the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of the superconducting order parameter in the Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model. In the absence of superconductivity, its ground state is a non-Fermi liquid, whose properties are controlled by the HK interaction. Our protocol involves quantum quenching the HK interaction but leaving the interaction responsible for superconductivity unchanged. We map out the non-equilibrium dynamical phase diagram of the interacting model which contains three phases where, at long times, the order parameter amplitude vanishes, approaches a constant value or persistently oscillates. We also investigate the Loschmidt echo in searching for dynamical quantum phase transition, and find no significant correlation between the three phases and the non-analytic temporal behaviour of the Loschmidt echo. The momentum space entanglement entropy between positive and negative momentum modes, relevant for Coopair pairing, is calculated. Counterintuitively, this momentum space entanglement does not change significantly during the quench dynamics and its value remains reasonably large even for vanishing superconducting order parameter. Nevertheless, its derivative with respect to the HK interaction signals the dynamical phase transition associated to the late time vanishing of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Side-gate modulation of supercurrent in InSb nanoflag-based Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: InSb nanoflags, due to their intrinsic spin-orbit interactions, are an interesting platform in the study of planar Josephson junctions. Ballistic transport, combined with high transparency of the superconductor/semiconductor interfaces, was reported to lead to interesting phenomena such as the Josephson diode effect. The versatility offered by the planar geometry can be exploited to manipulate both carrier concentration and spin-orbit strength by electrical means. Here we present experimental results on InSb nanoflag-based Josephson junctions fabricated with side-gates placed in close proximity to the junction. We show that side-gates can efficiently modulate the current through the junction, both in the dissipative and in the dissipation-less regimes, similarly to what obtained with a conventional back-gate. Furthermore, the side-gates can be used to influence the Fraunhofer interference pattern induced by the presence of an external out-of-plane magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Tilt and Axion Fields in Topological Superconductors: Anisotropy in the Meissner Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface states of topological superconductors significantly influence electromagnetic fields within these materials. The interaction between gapless boundary states and electromagnetic fields induces a Berry phase, coupling electric and magnetic fields and introducing the axion term into the effective Lagrangian . In this paper, we utilize a model of a topological superconductor, represented as a Weyl superconductor-topological insulator-Weyl superconductor structure with a {\pi} phase difference between superconductors. By incorporating tilting of Weyl cones, we study the Meissner effect, demonstrating that the interplay between tilt and the axion field enhances surface state contributions. Furthermore, we show that an anisotropy in the Meissner effect arises from the anisotropic nature of the tilt vector. This anisotropy manifests as directional dependence in the magnetic response of the material. We derive a universal equation for magnetic penetration in topological superconductors and explore the impact of tilt on the planar Hall current at the surface.</description>

      <title>Influence of oxygen orbitals and boundary conditions on the pairing behavior in the Emery model for doped ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Emery model on several ladder-like lattices including two legs of copper d-orbitals and various numbers of oxygen p-orbitals. Pair binding energy, pair spatial structure, density distribution, and pairing correlation functions are calculated using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). We show that a Luther-Emery phase with enhanced pairing correlations can be found for hole doping as well as for electron doping with realistic model parameters. Ladder properties depend sensitively on model parameters, the oxygen p-orbitals taken into account, and boundary conditions. The pair binding energy is a more reliable quantity than correlation functions for studying pairing in ladders. Overall, our results for two-leg Emery ladders support the possibility of superconductivity in the hole-doped 2D model. The issue is rather to determine which of the various ladder structures and model parameters are appropriate to approximate the two-dimensional cuprates.</description>

      <title>Metastability in individual magnetic vortices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic nanoparticles play a crucial role in different fields such as biomedicine or information and quantum technologies. These applications require nanoparticles with a single, well-defined energy minimum, free of metastable states, and characterized by narrow switching field distributions. Here, we demonstrate that high-transition-temperature nanoSQUIDs can be successfully applied to the characterization of individual nanodiscs hosting magnetic vortices. We present measurements performed under varying temperature and external magnetic field, revealing signatures of ubiquitous, multiple metastable configurations. We also demonstrate that metastability can be reduced by introducing an intended asymmetry. NanoSQUID measurements can be applied to optimize the fabrication of on-demand spin-texture states, such as degenerated vortices or particles with fixed circulation and deterministic and narrow switching probabilities.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in Two-Dimensional Systems with Unconventional Rashba Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05051v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two-dimensional system with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, it is well-known that superconductivity can have mixed spin-singlet and -triplet parity, and the $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector of spin-triplet pairing is parallel to $\boldsymbol{g}$-vector of Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Here, we propose a model to describe a two-dimensional system with unconventional Rashba bands and study its superconductivity. We show that the $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector of spin-triplet pairing can be either parallel or perpendicular to $\boldsymbol{g}$-vector of Rashba spin-orbit coupling depending on the different pairing interaction. We also propose a junction to generate tunneling current depending on the direction of $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector. It provides a detectable evidence to distinguish these two different but very similar pairing channels. Furthermore, we find this model can give arise to a subleading spin-singlet chiral $p$-wave topological superconducting state. More significantly, we find that such unconventional Rashba bands and unconventional superconudcting pairings can be realized on surface of some superconducting topological materials, such as trigonal layered PtBi$_{2}$.</description>

      <title>Evolution of pairing symmetry in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ as probed by uniaxial-strain tuning of $T_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In iron-based superconductors (FeSCs), the interplay between electronic nematicity and superconductivity is essential for understanding the exotic superconducting ground state. In the nematic regime, uniaxial-strain ($\varepsilon$) tuning of the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ [$\Delta T_c(\varepsilon)=\alpha\varepsilon+\beta\varepsilon^2$] offers a unique approach to investigating the evolution of pairing symmetry if both $s$ and $d$ wave pairing instabilities are relevant. Here, we employ uniaxial strain to tune the $T_c$ of FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$, in which both nematicity and superconductivity undergo significant changes with doping. While $T_c$ is usually suppressed quadratically with $\varepsilon$ in optimally doped BaFe$_2$As$_2$, $\Delta T_c(\varepsilon)$ in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ dominated by $\Delta T_c(\varepsilon)=\beta\varepsilon^2$ changes its sign from $\beta$ &lt; $0$ in FeSe to $\beta$ &gt; $0$ in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ ($x\gtrsim0.10$), indicating an evolution of the pairing symmetry from an $s_{\pm}$ state towards an $s+d$ wave state. These findings highlight the $\Delta T_c(\varepsilon)$ as a powerful probe for elucidating the superconducting pairing symmetry in the nematic regime of FeSCs and provide new insights into the evolution of pairing symmetry in FeSCs.</description>

      <title>Flux qubit-based detector of microwave photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A theory of detection of microwave photons with a flux qubit-based detector is presented. We consider semiclassical approximation with the electromagnetic field being in a coherent state. Flux qubit is considered as a multilevel quantum system (qudit). By solving the Lindblad equation, we describe the time evolution of occupations of the qudit's levels for readout and reset stages of detection. When considering the reset stage, the time evolution is described by multiple avoided-level crossings, thus providing a multilevel Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) problem. In addition to numerical calculations, we present an approximate solution for the description of the reset stage dynamics based on the adiabatic-impulse approximation and rate equation approach. Our theory may be useful for the theoretical description of driven-dissipative dynamics of qudits, including applications such as single-photon detection.</description>

      <title>Circuit QED theory of direct and dual Shapiro steps with finite-size transmission line resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the occurrence of direct and dual Shapiro steps for a Josephson junction coupled to a finite-size transmission line resonator. We treat both problems through a circuit QED approach with a large, but finite number of photon modes. For the dual case, we do not assume the (approximate) charge-phase duality, but include the full multi-band dynamics for the Josephson junction. Mean-field equations within such Hamiltonian approach reproduce the result obtained through a dissipative classical equation when the number of transmission line modes is large enough. To account for quantum and thermal fluctuations, we go beyond the mean-field treatment within a truncated Wigner approach. The fluctuations are shown to modify both the direct and the dual steps. We show how the dual steps are very sensitive to these fluctuations and identify the key physical parameters for the junction and the transmission line controlling their robustness, which is essential for applications to close the quantum metrological triangle.</description>
