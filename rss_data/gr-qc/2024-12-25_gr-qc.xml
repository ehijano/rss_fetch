      <title>Construction of eccentricity reduced initial data for neutron star binaries with the entropy based flux limiting scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of high-resolution shock-capturing schemes is vital in producing highly accurate gravitational waveforms from neutron star binaries. The entropy based flux limiting (EFL) scheme is able to perform fast converging binary neutron star merger simulations reaching up to fourth-order convergence in the gravitational waveform phase. In these results the EFL method was used only in the dynamical evolution of initial data constructed with the Lorene library. Here, we extend the use of the EFL method to the construction of eccentricity reduced initial data for neutron star binaries and present several new BNS simulations resulting from such initial data and show for the first time up to optimal fifth-order convergence in the gravitational waveform phase.</description>

      <title>Teukolsky-like equations with various spins in a deformed Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the wave equations with the various spins on the background of the Kerr metric deformed by a function of the radial coordinate, on which background we have studied the gravitational-wave equations previously. We obtain the unified expression of the Teukolsky-like master equations and the corresponding radial equations with various spins. We find that taking the separable gauge introduced in previous study simplifies the unified form. We also discuss the structure of the radial equation as an ordinary differential equation, such as the existence of the regular and the irregular singularities of the equation and the behavior of the solution around each singularity.</description>

      <title>Classical (and Quantum) Heuristics for Gravitational Wave Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a lower bound on the sensitivity of generic mechanical and electromagnetic gravitational wave detectors. We consider both classical and quantum detection schemes, although we focus on the former. Our results allow for a simple reproduction of the sensitivities of a variety of experiments, including optical interferometers, resonant bars, optomechanical sensors, and electromagnetic conversion experiments. In the high-frequency regime, all detection schemes we consider can be characterised by their stored electromagnetic energy and the signal transfer function, which we provide. We discuss why high-frequency gravitational wave searches are especially difficult and primordial gravitational wave backgrounds might not be detectable above the sensitivity window of existing interferometers.</description>

      <title>Late-time tails and mass inflation for the spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a decay result in the black hole exterior region of spherically symmetric solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field system arising from compactly supported admissible data. Our result allows for large initial data, and it is the first decay statement for higher order derivatives of the scalar field.
  Solutions to this model generically develop a singularity in the black hole interior. Indeed, Luk--Oh (arxiv:1702.05715, arxiv:1702.05716) identify a generic class of initial data that produces $C^2$-future-inextendible solutions. However, they leave open the question of mass inflation: does the Hawking mass become identically infinite at the Cauchy horizon? By work of Luk--Oh--Shlapentokh-Rothman (arxiv:2201.12294), our decay result implies mass inflation for sufficiently regular solutions in the generic class considered by Luk--Oh (arxiv:1702.05715, arxiv:1702.05716).
  Together with the methods and results of Luk--Oh (arXiv:2404.02220), our estimates imply a late-time tails result for the scalar field. This result provides another proof of generic mass inflation, through a result of Dafermos (arXiv:arch-ive/0307013). Another application of our late-time tails result, due to Van de Moortel, is the global construction of two-ended black holes that contain null and spacelike singularities.</description>

      <title>Scalar kicks and memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scalar field coupled conformally and disformally to matter affects both the linear memory effect for binary systems on hyperbolic orbits, as well as the kick velocity for binaries on bound or unbound orbits. We study these corrections in detail, their order of magnitude, and discuss their detectability. In particular, we find that the disformal interaction does not contribute to the memory effect and the emitted power spectrum at zero frequency. The conformal interaction corrects the GR linear memory and the quadrupole emitted power at zero frequency resulting in a breaking of the GR memory-power spectrum relationship. On the other hand, disformal interactions give rise to a change of momentum for the centre of mass. Hence, measuring both the linear memory effect and the kicks for hyperbolic orbits would give access to the conformal and disformal couplings of nearly massless scalars to matter.</description>

      <title>Covariant LTB collapse in models of loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of gravitational collapse provide important means to test whether non-classical space-time effects motivated for instance by quantum gravity can be realized in generic ways in physically relevant situations. Here, a detailed analysis of marginally bound Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi space-times is given in emergent modified gravity, which in particular includes a covariant formulation of holonomy modifications usually considered in models of loop quantum gravity. As a result, generic collapse in this setting is shown to imply a physical singularity that removes the bouncing behavior seen in vacuum space-times with the same type of modifications.</description>

      <title>Light rings and shadows of static black holes in effective quantum gravity II: A new solution without Cauchy horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the three known types of static solutions proposed within the Hamiltonian constraint approach to effective quantum gravity (EQG), the first two have been extensively investigated, whereas the third type-which preserves general covariance, is free of Cauchy horizons, and was only recently obtained-remains relatively unexplored. This solution can describe a black hole with an event horizon for certain parameter ranges, or a horizonless compact object beyond those ranges. In this paper, we focus on the third type and show that its light rings feature both stable and unstable branches, and that the black hole shadow size grows with the quantum parameter-unlike in the first two types. However, when we account for both the shadow and the lensing ring, the overall behavior closely resembles that of the second type, in which an increasing quantum parameter leads to a larger portion of the lensing ring being occupied by the shadow. This feature can serve as a hallmark of black holes in EQG, offering a potential way to distinguish them from their GR counterparts. Remarkably, the parameter ranges under which the solution remains a black hole are highly consistent with the current observational constraints on black hole shadows, lending strong support to the classification of the third type of compact object in EQG as a black hole endowed with an event horizon.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We treat the semiclassical Einstein equation as a quantum-classical hybrid and demonstrate the formal equivalence of its two derivation methods. This approach identifies the left-hand side of the equation as the expectation value of the Einstein tensor given the state of matter, and not its actual value in each realization of the set-up. As a result, standard criticisms of semiclassical gravity do not apply, and stochastic gravity emerges as a necessary extension</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Coalescence Gravitational Wave Signals Counting and Separation Using UnMixFormer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As next-generation gravitational-wave (GW) observatories approach unprecedented sensitivities, the need for robust methods to analyze increasingly complex, overlapping signals becomes ever more pressing. Existing matched-filtering approaches and deep-learning techniques can typically handle only one or two concurrent signals, offering limited adaptability to more varied and intricate superimposed waveforms. To overcome these constraints, we present the UnMixFormer, an attention-based architecture that not only identifies the unknown number of concurrent compact binary coalescence GW events but also disentangles their individual waveforms through a multi-decoder architecture, even when confronted with five overlapping signals. Our UnMixFormer is capable of capturing both short- and long-range dependencies by modeling them in a dual-path manner, while also enhancing periodic feature representation by incorporating Fourier Analysis Networks. Our approach adeptly processes binary black hole, binary neutron star, and neutron star-black hole systems over extended time series data (16,384 samples). When evaluating on synthetic data with signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) ranging from 10 to 50, our method achieves 99.89% counting accuracy, a mean overlap of 0.9831 between separated waveforms and templates, and robust generalization ability to waveforms with spin precession, orbital eccentricity, and higher modes, marking a substantial advance in the precision and versatility of GW data analysis.</description>

Abstract: We present the complete solution to the classification problem regarding the variational symmetries of the generalized Brans-Dicke cosmological model in the presence of a second scalar field minimally coupled to gravity and the generalized Brans-Dicke scalar field theory. Through the symmetry analysis, we were able to specify the functional form of the field equations such that they become integrable. Additionally, new families of integrable cosmological models are presented.</description>

      <title>Alternative LISA-TAIJI networks: Detectability of the Parity Violation in Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of parity violation in the isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) will serve a crucial probe for new physics, particularly in parity-violating theories of gravity. The joint observations by the planned space-borne gravitational wave detectors, LISA and TAIJI, will offer a unique opportunity to observe such effects in the millihertz (mHz) band. This study evaluates the detectability of parity violation in the SGWB using two network configurations: LISA-TAIJIp and LISA-TAIJIm. The former configuration consists of LISA (inclined at $+60^\circ$ relative to the ecliptic plane) and TAIJIp (also inclined at $+60^\circ$), while the latter network pairs LISA with TAIJIm (inclined at $-60^\circ$). Our analysis demonstrates that the sensitivity of the LISA-TAIJIm network to parity violation in the SGWB is approximately one order of magnitude greater than that of the LISA-TAIJIp network at lower frequencies. To quantify the performance of the two networks, we evaluate the signal-to-noise ratios for different spectral shapes, including power-law, single-peak, and broken power-law models, and estimate parameter determination using the Fisher information matrix. The results confirm that LISA-TAIJIm outperforms LISA-TAIJIp in detecting the SGWB with circular polarization components, offering a superior opportunity to test parity-violating gravitational constraints on various mechanisms in the mHz band.</description>

      <title>2D numerical simulation of lunar response to gravitational waves using finite element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies of the response of the Moon to gravitational waves have been carried out using analytical or semi-analytical models assuming ideal lunar structures. Such models are advantageous for their high-speed calculation but fail to account for the extremely heterogeneous subsurface and/or interior structures of the Moon. Numerical calculations are needed, but it is challenging to model the topography and lateral heterogeneity of the Moon. In addition, the computational cost is great especially when performing the GW simulation for a long time. As a first step towards overcoming the above difficulties, we employ a two-dimensional finite element method to numerically simulate the lunar response to gravitational waves. We verify our method by comparing our numerical results with those semi-analytical solutions. Based on such comparison, we also analyze the limitation of the two-dimensional simulation. Our work breaks a new way towards the precise simulation of realistic lunar response to gravitational waves in the future and lays down a solid foundation for three-dimensional numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Particles Produced from Bubble Collisions in First-Order Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a new source of gravitational waves (GWs) from first-order phase transitions. The collisions of bubbles of the new phase can efficiently produce particles that couple to the background field undergoing the transition, thereby transferring a significant fraction of the released vacuum energy into a distribution of inhomogeneous and dynamic particle populations that persist long after the bubbles have disappeared. We study the GWs produced by such particle distributions, showing that GWs arise from the quadrupolar anisotropy in the radiation emitted from the bubble collisions, and present a semi-analytical calculation of the two-point correlation function for the associated energy distributions. We find that this new contribution can qualitatively modify the overall GW signal from such phase transitions, creating a distinct shift in the spectral slope at low frequencies that could be observed by future GW experiments. It is therefore important to take this new contribution into account for any transition where the background field has significant self-coupling or couplings to other fields that could lead to efficient particle production at bubble collision.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of the two independent parity-even cubic interactions $I_1 = {R^{\alpha \beta}}_{\mu \nu} {R^{\mu \nu}}_{\rho \sigma} {R^{\rho \sigma}}_{\alpha \beta}$ and $ G_3 = I_1 -2 {R^{\mu \nu \alpha}}_\beta {R^{\beta \gamma}}_{\nu \sigma} {R^\sigma}_{\mu \gamma \alpha}$ on the spectrum of gravitational waves emitted in the quasi-circular inspiral phase of the merger of two spinning objects. Focusing on the aligned spin configuration, we extract the corrections to Newton's potential at linear order in the perturbations, using the four-point amplitude of the massive spinning objects evaluated in the Post-Minkowskian expansion. We then derive the modifications to the quadrupole moments at leading order in the cubic perturbations, using a five-point amplitude with emission of a soft graviton. These modified moments, along with the corresponding potentials, are then employed to calculate the power emitted by gravitational waves during the inspiral phase. Using these results, we determine the changes to the waveforms, up to linear order in spin, in the Stationary Phase Approximation. Finally, we comment on the relation between cubic and tidal perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the cross-correlation data from the first three observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, we search for a gravitational-wave background (GWB) from primordial black holes, arising from the superposition of compact binary coalescence events. We consider both early and late binary formation mechanisms, and perform Bayesian parameter inference, investigating different prior distributions of the model parameters. From the non-detection of the GWB, we provide constraints on the fraction of primordial black holes contributing to the present dark matter energy density.</description>

      <title>Notes on Quasinormal Modes of charged de Sitter Blackholes from Quiver Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give the connection formulae for ordinary differential equations with 5 and 6 (and in principle can be generalized to more) regular singularities from the data of instanton partition functions of quiver gauge theories. We check the consistency of these connection formulae by numerically computing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter (RN-dS) blackhole. Analytic expressions are obtained for all the families of QNMs, including the photon-sphere modes, dS modes, and near-extremal modes. We also argue that a similar method can be applied to the dS-Kerr-Newman blackhole.</description>

      <title>Komar charge of N = 2 supergravity and its superspace generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find the defining equations for a Killing vector and its superpartner (called the generalized Killing spinor) and use them to construct the generalized Komar superform of minimal N=2, d=4 supergravity using the superspace formulation. The superspace procedure presented here can be used for the construction of generalized Komar forms in more general supergravity theories. We also present the (more cumbersome) calculation of the generalized Komar 2-form and of the on-shell closed 2-form used to prove the first law in the component formalism, as an independent confirmation of our main result.</description>

      <title>The exact Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the scale-factor minisuperspace model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the classical minisuperspace model describing a closed, homogeneous and isotropic Universe, with a positive cosmological constant. Upon canonical quantization, the infinite number of possible operator orderings in the quantum Hamiltonian leads to distinct Wheeler-DeWitt equations for the wavefunction $\psi$ of the Universe. Similarly, ambiguity arises in the path-integral formulation of $\psi$, due to the infinite choices of path-integral measures for the single degree of freedom of the model. For each choice of path-integral measure, we determine the correct operator ordering of the quantum Hamiltonian and derive the exact form of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, including all corrections in $\hbar$. Additionally, we impose Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian to deduce the Hilbert-space measure $\mu$, which appears in the definition of the Hermitian inner product. Remarkably, all quantum predictions can be expressed through the combination $\Psi=\sqrt{\mu}\, \psi$, which satisfies a universal Wheeler-DeWitt equation, independent of the initial path-integral prescription. This result demonstrates that all seemingly distinct quantum theories arising from different quantization schemes of the same classical model are fundamentally equivalent.</description>

      <title>Flowery Horizons &amp; Bulk Observers: $sl^{(q)}(2,\mathbb{R})$ Drive in $2d$ Holographic CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore and analyze bulk geometric aspects corresponding to a driven two-dimensional holographic CFT, where the drive Hamiltonian is constructed from the $sl^{(q)}(2,\mathbb{R})$ generators. In particular, we demonstrate that starting with a thermal initial state, the evolution of the event horizon is characterized by distinct geometric transformations in the bulk which are associated to the conjugacy classes of the corresponding transformations on the CFT. Namely, the bulk evolution of the horizon is geometrically classified into an oscillatory (non-heating) behaviour, an exponentially growing (heating) behaviour and a power-law growth with an angular rotation (the phase boundary), all as a function of the stroboscopic time. We also show that the explicit symmetry breaking of the drive is manifest in a flowery structure of the event horizon that displays a $U(1) \to {\mathbb Z}_q$ symmetry breaking. In the $q\to \infty$ limit, the $U(1)$ symmetry is effectively restored. Furthermore, by analyzing the integral curves generated by the asymptotic Killing vectors, we also demonstrate how the fixed points of these curves approximate a bulk Ryu-Takayanagi surface corresponding to a modular Hamiltonian for a sub-region in the CFT. Since the CFT modular Hamiltonian has an infinitely many in-equivalent extensions in the bulk, the fixed points of the integral curves can also lie outside the entanglement wedge of the CFT sub-region.</description>

      <title>Stability of $f(Q, B)$ Gravity via Dynamical System Approach: a Comprehensive Bayesian Statistical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10956v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the cosmological stability of $f(Q, B)$ gravity using a dynamical system approach, where $Q$ denotes the nonmetricity scalar and $B$ represents the boundary term. We determine the model parameters of $f(Q, B)$ through Bayesian statistical analysis, employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. This analysis incorporates numerical solutions and observational data from cosmic chronometers, the extended Pantheon$^+$ data set, and baryonic acoustic oscillation measurements. Our findings reveal a stable critical point within the dynamical system of the model, corresponding to the de Sitter phase, which is consistent with current observations of the Universe dominated by dark energy and undergoing late-time accelerated expansion. Additionally, we utilize Center Manifold Theory to examine the stability of this critical point, providing deeper insights into the behavior of the model. The cosmological implications of $f(Q, B)$ gravity indicate a smooth transition in the deceleration parameters from deceleration to the acceleration phase, underscoring the potential of the model to describe the evolution of the Universe. Our results suggests that the $f(Q, B)$ model presents a viable alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, effectively capturing the observed acceleration of the Universe and offering a robust framework for explaining the dynamics of cosmic expansion.</description>

      <title>Entropy production due to spacetime fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the quantum nature of the gravitational field is undoubtedly one of the greatest challenges in theoretical physics. Despite significant progress, a complete and consistent theory remains elusive. However, in the weak field approximation -- where curvature effects are small -- we can explore some expected properties of such a theory. Particularly relevant to this study is the quantum nature of gravitational waves, which are represented as small perturbations in flat spacetime. In this framework, a quantum description of these perturbations, as a quantum field, is feasible, leading to the emergence of the graviton. Here we consider a non-relativistic quantum system interacting with such a field. We employ the consistent histories approach to quantum mechanics, which allows us to frame classical questions in a quantum context, to define a fluctuation relation for this system. As a result, thermodynamic entropy must be produced in the system due to its unavoidable interaction with the quantum fluctuations of spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) space-time, we investigate a two-fluid cosmological model where a tachyon scalar field with self-interacting potential and a modified chaplygin gas with non-linear equation of state are taken as the background fluids. We perform phase space analysis of the autonomous system obtained from the cosmological governing equations by a suitable transformation of variables. Linear stability theory is employed to characterise the stability criteria for hyperbolic critical points. Numerical investigation is carried out for non-hyperbolic points. Our study reveals that modified chaplygin fluid dominated solutions cannot provide the late-time evolution. Late-time accelerated evolution is obtained only when the solution is dominated by tachyon fluid. This study also yields a late-time scaling attractor providing similar order of energy densities in its evolution. The adiabatic sound speed is evaluated for both the fluids and test the stability of the models independently. Further, we perform cosmographic analysis in the model independent way by evaluating all the cosmographic parameters and then $Om$ diagnostic is also found to compare our model with $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signal Denoising and Merger Time Prediction By Deep Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mergers of massive black hole binaries could generate rich electromagnetic emissions, which allow us to probe the environments surrounding these massive black holes and gain deeper insights into the high energy astrophysics. However, due to the short timescale of binary mergers, it is crucial to predict the time of the merger in advance to devise detailed observational plans. The overwhelming noise and the slow accumulation of signal-to-noise ratio in the inspiral phase make this task particularly challenging. To address this issue, we propose a novel deep neural denoising network in this study, capable of denoising a 30-day inspiral phase signal. Following the denoising process, we perform the detection and merger time prediction based on the denoised signals. Our results demonstrate that for a 30-day inspiral phase data with a signal-to-noise ratio between 10 and 50 occurring no more than 10 days before the merger, our absolute prediction error for the merger time is generally within 24 hours.</description>

Abstract: We obtain the first image of a parity-odd celestial body. Recently, an intriguing parity-odd rotating boson star has been proposed, and we investigate the lensing effects of these stars in detail. Our analysis demonstrates distinct gravitational distortions around these stars, clearly differentiating them from their parity-even counterparts. Furthermore, we analyze the conditions under which chaotic behavior appears in the images of ultra-compact stars.</description>

      <title>Fixing three dimensional geometries from entanglement entropies of CFT$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:1809.01355v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method of fixing the leading behaviors of three dimensional geometries from the dual CFT$_2$ entanglement entropies. We employ only the holographic principle and do not use any assumption about the AdS/CFT correspondence and bulk geometry. Our strategy involves using both UV and IR-like CFT$_2$ entanglement entropies to fix the bulk geodesics. With a simple trick, the metric can be extracted from the geodesics. As examples, we fix the leading behaviors of the pure AdS$_3$ metric from the entanglement entropies of free CFT$_2$ and, more importantly, the BTZ black hole from the entanglement entropies of finite temperature CFT$_2$. Consequently, CFT$_2$ with finite size or topological defects can be determined through simple transformations. Following the same steps, in principle, the leading behaviors of all three dimensional (topologically distinct) holographic classical geometries from the dual CFT$_2$ entanglement entropies can be fixed.</description>

      <title>High-order alloharmonics produced by nonperiodic drivers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-order harmonics are ubiquitous in nature and present in electromagnetic, acoustic, and gravitational waves. They are generated by periodic nonlinear processes or periodic high-frequency pulses. However, this periodicity is often inexact, such as that in chirped (frequency-swept) optical waveforms or interactions with nonstationary matter - for instance, reflection from accelerating mirrors. Spectra observed in such cases often contain complicated sets of harmonic-like fringes, uninterpretable or even misinterpretable via standard Fourier analysis. Here, we propose the concept of alloharmonics, i.e. spectral interference of harmonics with different orders, fully explaining the formation of these fringes (from Greek $\ddot{{\alpha}}{\lambda}{\lambda}{\omicron}{\varsigma}$: \'allos, "other"). Like atomic spectra, the complex alloharmonic spectra depend on several integer numbers and bear a unique imprint of the emission process, such as the driver period and its time derivatives, which the alloharmonic theory can decipher. We demonstrate laser-driven alloharmonics experimentally in the extreme ultraviolet spectral region and extract nonperiodicity parameters. We analyze previously published simulations of gravitational waves emitted by binary black hole mergers and demonstrate alloharmonics there. Further, we predict the presence of alloharmonics in the radio spectra of pulsars and in optical frequency combs, and propose their use for measurement of extremely small accelerations necessary for testing gravity theories. The alloharmonics phenomenon generalizes classical harmonics and is critical in attosecond physics, frequency comb generation, pulsar studies, and future gravitational wave spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of quantum superpositions by Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was shown by Danielson-Satishchandran-Wald (DSW) that for the massive or charged body in a quantum spatial separated superposition state, the presence of a black hole can decohere the superposition inevitably towards capturing the radiation of soft photons or gravitons. In this work, we study the DSW decoherence effect for the static charged body in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes. By calculating the decohering rate for this case, it is shown that the superposition is decohered by the low frequency photons that propagate through the black hole horizon. For the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, the decoherence of quantum superposition is completely suppressed due to the black hole Meissner effect.It is also found that the decoherence effect caused by the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole is equivalent to that of an ordinary matter system with the same size and charge.</description>
