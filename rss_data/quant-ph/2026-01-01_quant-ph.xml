      <title>Quantization of Physical Interaction Strengths via Singular Moduli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the 2019 redefinition of the SI units, precision metrology has sought to anchor all physical quantities to fundamental constants and integer invariants. While the optical frequency comb revolutionized timekeeping by discretizing the continuum of light into countable teeth, and the Quantum Hall Effect standardized resistance via topological invariants, a comparable standard for interaction strength remains elusive. Currently, measuring the coupling constant ($g$) between quantum systems is an estimation problem, inherently subject to drift, noise, and fabrication variance. Here, we introduce Interaction Metrology, a protocol that transforms the measurement of coupling strengths from an analog estimation into a topological counting problem. By engineering a specific class of algebraic catastrophe -- the Unimodal $X_9$ singularity -- in a driven-dissipative lattice, we prove that the system's interaction moduli are topologically forced to take discrete, quantized values, forming a "Geometric $k$-Comb." We derive the universality class of this quantization, showing that it arises from the discrepancy between the Milnor ($\mu$) and Tjurina ($\tau$) numbers of the effective potential, a strictly non-Hermitian effect forbidden in standard quantum mechanics. Finally, we provide an ab-initio blueprint for a silicon nitride implementation, demonstrating that this quantization is robust against disorder levels exceeding current foundry tolerances. This discovery establishes a universal standard for force sensing and quantum logic gates, enabling the calibration of interaction strengths with topological certainty.</description>

      <title>Landauer cost in a continuous vacuum/no-vacuum measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic cost of maintaining a continuous binary record of a vacuum or no-vacuum measurement. Modeling the monitoring as a time-binned click or no-click process with finite bandwidth, we treat the outcomes as a classical register that is reset after each bin. Landauer's principle then yields an operational lower bound on the dissipated heat rate set by the Shannon entropy rate of the measurement record. We discuss the role of coarse-graining, extend the analysis to many monitored modes, including correlations and compressibility, and provide parameter estimates for circuit-QED photon monitoring, with a speculative horizon-based bookkeeping illustration.</description>

      <title>Aliphatic Chains as One-Dimensional XY Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin waves are propagating disturbances of spin order in lattices with nearest-neighbor interactions. They are traditionally observed in magnetically ordered solids using inelastic neutron, light, or electron scattering, and ferromagnetic resonance. Here, we show that analogous spin dynamics can arise in liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of molecules containing aliphatic chains. In such molecules, each CH_2 group must have a distinct chemical shift and be magnetically inequivalent via out-of-pair couplings. Under these conditions, singlet state populations of geminal protons propagate along (CH_2)_n segments forming magnetically silent spin waves. For a chain with translational symmetry, the spin Hamiltonian factorizes into subspaces formally equivalent to the one-dimensional XY model. This correspondence yields analytic expressions for eigenstates and eigenenergies in a spectroscopy we term spin-chain zero-quantum NMR. We identify molecular systems in which these conditions are met. Their collective dynamics rapidly exceed classical computational tractability, making them targets for quantum-computer simulations of spin transport and many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Euler-Korteweg vortices: A fluid-mechanical analogue to the Schr\"odinger and Klein-Gordon equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum theory and relativity exhibit several formal analogies with fluid mechanics. This paper examines under which conditions a classical fluid model may reproduce the most basic mathematical formalism of both theories. By assuming that the angular momentum of an irrotational vortex in an inviscid, barotropic, isothermal fluid with sound speed c is equal in magnitude to the reduced Planck constant, and incorporating Korteweg capillary stress, a complex wave equation describing the momentum and continuity equations of a Euler-Korteweg vortex is obtained. When uniform convection is introduced, the weak field approximation of this wave equation is equivalent to Schr\"odinger's equation. The model is shown to yield classical analogues to de Broglie wavelength, the Einstein-Planck relation, the Born rule and the uncertainty principle. Accounting for the retarded propagation of the wavefield of a vortex in convection produces the Lorentz transformation and the Klein-Gordon equation, with Schr\"odinger's equation appearing as the low-Mach-number limit. These results demonstrate that, under explicit assumptions, a classical continuum can reproduce the mathematical formalism of quantum and relativistic theory in their simplest form, without assuming the postulates principal to those theories.</description>

      <title>DifGa: Differentiable Error Mitigation for Multi-Mode Gaussian and Non-Gaussian Noise in Quantum Photonic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce DifGa, a fully differentiable error-mitigation framework for continuous-variable (CV) quantum photonic circuits operating under Gaussian loss and weak non-Gaussian noise. The approach is demonstrated using analytic simulations with the default.gaussian backend of PennyLane, where quantum states are represented by first and second moments and optimized end-to-end via automatic differentiation. Gaussian loss is modeled as a beam splitter interaction with an environmental vacuum mode of transmissivity $\eta \in [0.3,0.95]$, while non-Gaussian phase noise is incorporated through a differentiable Monte-Carlo mixture of random phase rotations with jitter amplitudes $\delta \in [0,0.7]$. The core architecture employs a multi-mode Gaussian circuit consisting of a signal, ancilla, and environment mode. Input states are prepared using squeezing and displacement operations with parameters $(r_s,\varphi_s,\alpha)=(0.60,0.30,0.80)$ and $(r_a,\varphi_a)=(0.40,0.10)$, followed by an entangling beam splitter with angles $(\theta,\phi)=(0.70,0.20)$. Error mitigation is achieved by appending a six-parameter trainable Gaussian recovery layer comprising local phase rotations and displacements, optimized by minimizing a quadratic loss on the signal-mode quadratures $\langle \hat{x}_0\rangle$ and $\langle \hat{p}_0\rangle$ using gradient descent with fixed learning rate $0.06$ and identical initialization across experiments. Under pure Gaussian loss, the optimized recovery suppresses reconstruction error to near machine precision ($&lt;10^{-30}$) for moderate loss ($\eta \ge 0.5$). When non-Gaussian phase noise is present, noise-aware training using Monte Carlo averaging yields robust generalization, reducing error by more than an order of magnitude compared to Gaussian-trained recovery at large phase jitter. Runtime benchmarks confirm linear scaling with the number of Monte Carlo samples.</description>

      <title>Efficient simulation of logical magic state preparation protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing space- and time-efficient logical magic state preparation protocols will likely be an essential step towards building a large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer. Motivated by this need, we introduce a scalable method for simulating logical magic state preparation protocols under the standard circuit-level noise model. When applied to protocols based on code switching, magic state cultivation, and magic state distillation, our method yields a complexity polynomial in (i) the number of qubits and (ii) the non-stabilizerness, e.g., stabilizer rank or Pauli rank, of the target encoded magic state. The efficiency of our simulation method is rooted in a curious fact: every circuit-level Pauli error in these protocols propagates to a Clifford error at the end. This property is satisfied by a large family of protocols, including those that repeatedly measure a transversal Clifford that squares to a Pauli. We provide a proof-of-principle numerical simulation that prepares a magic state using such logical Clifford measurements. Our work enables practical simulation of logical magic state preparation protocols without resorting to approximations or resource-intensive state-vector simulations.</description>

      <title>Mermin Devices for Generalized Dicke States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present here several new exact results for a number of entangled states: the W-state of three qubits and its generalization -- Dicke states for more than three qubits. We derive these results by bounding the expected values of the Bell-Mermin operators. We review the three qubit GHZ Mermin device, make its generalization to four qubits, and then construct analogous Mermin devices for the generalized Dicke states of three and four qubits. As a result of studying if their operations can be fully explained by Mermin's instructional sets, we show that the GHZ and Dicke states of three qubits and the GHZ state of four qubits do not allow such a description. However, among the two generalized Dicke states of four qubits, one does allow and the other does not allow such a description.</description>

      <title>Syndrome aware mitigation of logical errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broad applications of quantum computers will require error correction (EC). However, quantum hardware roadmaps indicate that physical qubit numbers will remain limited in the foreseeable future, leading to residual logical errors that limit the size and accuracy of achievable computations. Recent work suggested logical error mitigation (LEM), which applies known error mitigation (EM) methods to logical errors, eliminating their effect at the cost of a runtime overhead. Improving the efficiency of LEM is crucial for increasing the logical circuit volumes it enables to execute.
  We introduce syndrome-aware logical error mitigation (SALEM), which makes use of the syndrome data measured during error correction, when mitigating the logical errors. The runtime overhead of SALEM is exponentially lower than that of previously proposed LEM schemes, resulting in significantly increased circuit volumes that can be executed accurately. Notably, relative to the routinely used combination of error correction and syndrome rejection (post-selection), SALEM increases the size of reliably executable computations by orders of magnitude. In this practical setting in which space and time are both resources that need to be optimized, our work reveals a surprising phenomenon: SALEM, which tightly combines EC with EM, can outperform physical EM even above the standard fault-tolerance threshold. Thus, SALEM can make use of EC in regimes of physical error rates at which EC is commonly deemed useless.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Mitigation with Attention Graph Transformers for Burgers Equation Solvers on NISQ Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical framework augmented with learned error mitigation for solving the viscous Burgers equation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Using the Cole-Hopf transformation, the nonlinear Burgers equation is mapped to a diffusion equation, discretized on uniform grids, and encoded into a quantum state whose time evolution is approximated via Trotterized nearest-neighbor circuits implemented in Qiskit. Quantum simulations are executed on noisy Aer backends and IBM superconducting quantum devices and are benchmarked against high-accuracy classical solutions obtained using a Krylov-based solver applied to the corresponding discretized Hamiltonian. From measured quantum amplitudes, we reconstruct the velocity field and evaluate physical and numerical diagnostics, including the L2 error, shock location, and dissipation rate, both with and without zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). To enable data-driven error mitigation, we construct a large parametric dataset by sweeping viscosity, time step, grid resolution, and boundary conditions, producing matched tuples of noisy, ZNE-corrected, hardware, and classical solutions together with detailed circuit metadata. Leveraging this dataset, we train an attention-based graph neural network that incorporates circuit structure, light-cone information, global circuit parameters, and noisy quantum outputs to predict error-mitigated solutions. Across a wide range of parameters, the learned model consistently reduces the discrepancy between quantum and classical solutions beyond what is achieved by ZNE alone. We discuss extensions of this approach to higher-dimensional Burgers systems and more general quantum partial differential equation solvers, highlighting learned error mitigation as a promising complement to physics-based noise reduction techniques on NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>Squeezed states for Frenkel-like two-fermion composite bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate squeezed states of composite bosons (cobosons) formed by pairs of spin-$1/2$ fermions, with emphasis on Frenkel-like cobosons. While squeezing for standard bosonic modes is well established, its extension to cobosons requires accounting for Pauli blocking and the resulting non-canonical commutation algebra. Building on earlier constructions of coboson coherent states, we define squeezed cobosons as eigenstates of a Bogoliubov transformed coboson operator and derive explicit expressions for the associated quadrature variances. We show that the underlying fermionic structure leads to state-dependent modifications of the Heisenberg--Robertson uncertainty bound, which may fall below the canonical bosonic limit without implying any violation of uncertainty principles. Numerical results based on finite-dimensional matrix representations illustrate how these effects constrain the attainable squeezing. Our framework is relevant to composite boson systems such as tightly bound electron-hole pairs and provides a physically transparent setting to probe compositeness through observable quadrature fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Tensor Computing Interface: An Application-Oriented, Lightweight Interface for Portable High-Performance Tensor Network Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) are a central computational tool in quantum science and artificial intelligence. However, the lack of unified software interface across tensor-computing frameworks severely limits the portability of TN applications, coupling algorithmic development to specific hardware and software back ends. To address this challenge, we introduce the Tensor Computing Interface (TCI) -- an application-oriented, lightweight application programming interface designed to enable framework-independent, high-performance TN applications. TCI provides a well-defined type system that abstracts tensor objects together with a minimal yet expressive set of core functions covering essential tensor manipulations and tensor linear-algebra operations. Through numerical demonstrations on representative tensor-network applications, we show that codes written against TCI can be migrated seamlessly across heterogeneous hardware and software platforms while achieving performance comparable to native framework implementations. We further release an open-source implementation of TCI based on \textit{Cytnx}, demonstrating its practicality and ease of integration with existing tensor-computing frameworks.</description>

      <title>Geometric View of One-Dimensional Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply De Haro's Geometric View of Theories to one of the simplest quantum systems: a spinless particle on a line and on a circle. The classical phase space M = T*Q is taken as the base of a trivial Hilbert bundle E ~ M x H, and the familiar position and momentum representations are realised as different global trivialisations of this bundle. The Fourier transform appears as a fibrewise unitary transition function, so that the standard position-momentum duality is made precise as a change of coordinates on a single geometric object. For the circle, we also discuss twisted boundary conditions and show how a twist parameter can be incorporated either as a fixed boundary condition or as a base coordinate, in which case it gives rise to a flat U(H)-connection with nontrivial holonomy. These examples provide a concrete illustration of how the Geometric View organises quantum-mechanical representations and dualities in geometric terms.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Machine Learning of Lattice Boltzmann Collision Operators for Fluid Dynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We attempt the use of a unitary operator to approximate the lattice Boltzmann collision operator. We use a modified amplitude encoding to bypass the renormalization that would have required classical processing at every step (thus eroding any quantum advantage to be had). We describe the hard-wiring of the lattice Boltzmann symmetries into the quantum circuit and show that, for the specific case of the cavity flow, approximating the nonlinear system is limited to low velocities. These findings may help us understand better the possibilities of nonlinear simulations on a quantum computer, and also pave the way for a discussion on how quantum machine learning might be harnessed to address more complex problems.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Structured Pruning of Quantum Neural Networks via $q$-Group Engineering and Quantum Geometric Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) suffer from severe gate-level redundancy, which hinders their deployment on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we propose q-iPrune, a one-shot structured pruning framework grounded in the algebraic structure of $q$-deformed groups and task-conditioned quantum geometry.
  Unlike prior heuristic or gradient-based pruning methods, q-iPrune formulates redundancy directly at the gate level. Each gate is compared within an algebraically consistent subgroup using a task-conditioned $q$-overlap distance, which measures functional similarity through state overlaps on a task-relevant ensemble. A gate is removed only when its replacement by a subgroup representative provably induces a bounded deviation on all task observables.
  We establish three rigorous theoretical guarantees. First, we prove completeness of redundancy pruning: no gate that violates the prescribed similarity threshold is removed. Second, we show that the pruned circuit is functionally equivalent up to an explicit, task-conditioned error bound, with a closed-form dependence on the redundancy tolerance and the number of replaced gates. Third, we prove that the pruning procedure is computationally feasible, requiring only polynomial-time comparisons and avoiding exponential enumeration over the Hilbert space.
  To adapt pruning decisions to hardware imperfections, we introduce a noise-calibrated deformation parameter $\lambda$ that modulates the $q$-geometry and redundancy tolerance. Experiments on standard quantum machine learning benchmarks demonstrate that q-iPrune achieves substantial gate reduction while maintaining bounded task performance degradation, consistent with our theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiphoton states are needed for quantum communication and computation. Multiphoton states are significantly more difficult to generate than one- and two-photon states because two individual down-conversion processes must be cascaded. Only efficiencies of $&lt;100$ Hz/mW have been reported to date. We integrate two down-converters on the same thin-film lithium niobate waveguide, significantly enhancing the cascaded process efficiency to $237 \pm 36$ kHz/mW. The measured $4.4\times10^{-5}$ probability of the second down-converter, which sets the limit on detectable triplet rates, exceeds those of previous triplet sources by an order of magnitude and demonstrates a path towards MHz rates of triplets for quantum applications.</description>

      <title>A new entanglement measure based on the total concurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a crucial resource in quantum information processing, advancing quantum technologies. The greater the uncertainty in subsystems' pure states, the stronger the quantum entanglement between them. From the dual form of $q$-concurrence ($q\geq 2$) we introduce the total concurrence. A bona fide measure of quantum entanglement is introduced, the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_q$-concurrence ($q \geq 2$), which is based on the total concurrence. Analytical lower bounds for the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_q$-concurrence are derived. In addition, an analytical expression is derived for the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_q$-concurrence in the cases of isotropic and Werner states. Furthermore, the monogamy relations that the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_q$-concurrence satisfies for qubit systems are examined. Additionally, based on the parameterized $\alpha$-concurrence and its complementary dual, the $\mathcal{C}^{t}_\alpha$-concurrence $(0\leq\alpha\leq\frac{1}{2})$ is also proposed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speed Limits Based on the Sharma-Mittal Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum speed limits (QSLs) establish intrinsic bounds on the minimum time required for the evolution of quantum systems. We present a class of QSLs formulated in terms of the two-parameter Sharma-Mittal entropy (SME), applicable to finite-dimensional systems evolving under general nonunitary dynamics. In the single-qubit case, the QSLs for both quantum channels and non-Hermitian dynamics are analyzed in detail. For many-body systems, we explore the role of SME-based bounds in characterizing the reduced dynamics and apply the results to the XXZ spin chain model. These entropy-based QSLs characterize fundamental limits on quantum evolution speeds and may be employed in contexts including entropic uncertainty relations, quantum metrology, coherent control and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Parametric amplification of continuous variable entangled state for loss-tolerant multi-phase estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum parameter estimation exploits quantum states to achieve estimation sensitivity beyond classical limit. In continuous variable (CV) regime, squeezed state has been exploited to implement deterministic phase estimation. It is however, often restricted by fragility of quantum states. The quantum phase estimation sensitivity of squeezed state is significantly affected by loss or detection inefficiency, which restrict its applications. This issue can be solved by using a method of parametric amplification of squeezed state \cite{OPA}. In this work, we implement multi-phase estimation with optical parametric amplification of entanglement generated from squeezed states. We find multi-phase estimation sensitivity is robust against loss or detection inefficiency, where we use two-mode Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled state and four-mode cluster state for analysis. Our work provides a method for realizing large-scale quantum metrology in real-world applications against loss or detection inefficiency.</description>

      <title>5-GHz chip-based quantum key distribution with 1Mbps secure key rate over 150 km</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables secure communication by harnessing the fundamental principles of quantum physics, which inherently guarantee information-theoretic security and intrinsic resistance to quantum computing attacks. However, the secure key rate of QKD typically decreases exponentially with increasing channel distance. In this work, by developing a novel polarization-state preparation method, an ultra-low time-jitter laser source and superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, we demonstrate a 5-GHz integrated QKD system featuring ultra-low quantum bit error rates (QBERs). The system achieves secure key rates of 1.076 Mbps at 150 km and 105 kbps at 200 km over standard single-mode fiber channels, respectively. Our system substantially enhances the secure key rate, enabling high-resolution video calls with one-time-pad encryption over intercity backbone QKD links. This work represents a significant step forward in the development of high-performance practical QKD systems.</description>

      <title>Testing Noise Correlations by an AI-Assisted Two-Qubit Quantum Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and validate a machine learning-assisted protocol to classify time and space correlations of classical noise acting on a quantum system, using two interacting qubits as probe. We consider different classes of noise, according to their Markovianity and spatial correlations. Leveraging the sensitivity of a coherent population transfer protocol under three distinct driving conditions, the various noises are discriminated by only measuring the final transfer efficiencies. This approach reaches around 90% accuracy with a minimal experimental overhead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum brushes are computational arts software introduced by Ferreira et al (2025) that leverage quantum behavior to generate novel artistic effects. In this outreach paper, we introduce the mathematical framework and describe the implementation of two quantum brushes based on variational quantum algorithms, Steerable and Chemical. While Steerable uses quantum geometric control theory to merge two works of art, Chemical mimics variational eigensolvers for estimating molecular ground energies to evolve colors on an underlying canvas. The implementation of both brushes is available open-source at https://github.com/moth-quantum/QuantumBrush and is fully compatible with the original quantum brushes.</description>

Abstract: This note is a friendly technical check of Jeffrey Bub's There is No Quantum World (arXiv:2512.18400v2). I flag one unambiguous mathematical slip (a cardinality identity that implicitly assumes the Continuum Hypothesis) and then point out a few places where the discussion of infinite tensor products, ``sectorization,'' and measurement updates would benefit from sharper wording. Nothing here is meant as a critique of Bub's interpretive goals; the aim is simply to separate what is mathematically forced from what depends on choices of algebra, representation, or philosophical stance. I end with a short remark on Philippe Grangier's reply (arXiv:2512.22965v1).</description>

      <title>Capacity-time Trade-off in Highly Reliable Quantum Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable optical quantum memory is limited by real-world imperfections such as disordered coupling and detuning. Existing studies mostly address these factors separately, while in practice their correlated effects set a fundamental limit on storage performance. We develop a comprehensive model that simultaneously incorporates disordered coupling and detuning. It is shown that these disorders induce a random Berry's phase in the stored states, while decoherence from disordered coupling stems from correlations with detuning rather than individual imperfections. This mechanism imposes a fundamental trade-off among storage capacity, storage time, and driving time, setting a universal limit for reliable storage. Extending the analysis to memory based devices operating with multiple storage processes shows that enhancing parameter independence improves their reliability. We further provide a more precise relation for measuring and correcting global detuning, which is directly relevant to current experimental protocols.</description>

      <title>Using NV centers in diamond to detect DC to very-low frequency magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a compact and portable tabletop magnetometer that utilizes negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. The magnetometer is operated using a dual microwave resonance detection approach in combination with an optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) technique (mitigating drifts in results due to changes of the diamond temperature), capable of simultaneously exciting and registering two ODMR transitions. The experimentally measured magnetic field noise-floor is $\approx 2.3~\textrm{nT}\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ while the calculated shot-noise-limited magnetic field sensitivity is $\approx 585~\textrm{pT}\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ when excited with a continuous wave laser at 0.5~W.
  These results pave the way for realizing a simple set-up magnetometer for precise single axis magnetic field measurements for example for accurate electric current measurements for stabilization purposes and magnetic communication applications.</description>

      <title>Deterministic distribution of W-class states in quantum networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipartite entangled states possess a number of non-intuitive properties, making them a useful resource for various quantum information-processing tasks. The three-qubit W-state is one such example where every state is robust to single-qubit loss. However, this state is not suitable for deterministic distribution, and deterministic communication protocols. Here, we focus on the distribution of a non-symmetric version of such states, namely $W_{\mathrm{mod}}$ states. These states belong to the W-class, and have one ebit of entanglement across a specific bipartition, enabling deterministic teleportation and superdense coding. In particular, we describe a few protocols through which these multipartite entangled states can be distributed {\it deterministically} in a quantum network by first preparing them locally in a central node and then transmitting individual qubits to the end nodes. We analyse the performance of these protocols based on the fidelity of the final distributed state, considering all types of noises that can act during the distribution. Finally, we compare the performance of the protocols to the case where the distribution is performed without any central node.</description>

      <title>Ergodic dynamics in iterated quantum protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study measurement-induced nonlinear dynamics generated by an iterated quantum protocol combining an entangling gate, a single-qubit rotation, and post-selection. For pure single-qubit inputs, a particular choice of the single-qubit unitary yields globally chaotic, strongly mixing dynamics that explores the entire Bloch sphere, providing a physical realization of ergodic behavior in a complex map. We extend the analysis to realistic, noisy preparation by considering mixed initial states and the induced nonlinear evolution inside the Bloch sphere. Numerical results show that the maximally mixed state is an attractor for mixed inputs, although many trajectories exhibit transient increases in purity before ultimately converging. To quantify robustness against noise, we introduce a practical notion of quasi-ergodicity: ensembles prepared in a small angular patch at fixed purity rapidly spread to cover all directions, while the purity gradually decreases toward its minimal value. By varying the final single-qubit gate, we identify a broad family of protocols that remain ergodic-like for pure states, supported by consistent diagnostics including the absence of attracting cycles, agreement of time and ensemble statistics, rapid spreading from localized regions, and exponential sensitivity to initial conditions. Away from the special globally mixing case, the mixed-state dynamics can change qualitatively: for most ergodic-like parameters, a finite subset of noisy inputs is driven toward purification rather than complete mixing, demonstrating the coexistence of statistical mixing and purification within a single iterated protocol.</description>

Abstract: After a brief historical perspective, we introduce the key notions of work and heat for quantum systems, to then apply them to quantum engines operating on quantum Otto and Carnot cycles. The irreversible and dissipative character of the quantum Otto cycle is briefly analyzed, contrasting with the energetic optimality of the quantum Carnot cycle. The central question of quantum effects is also addressed and illustrated with several examples. Finally, the last part strives to explain the role that quantum thermodynamics plays for quantum applications and quantum technologies, particularly in relation to energy optimization and the trade-off between performances and energy costs.</description>

      <title>In defense of temporal Tsirelson bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Chatterjee et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett 135, 220202 (2025)] analyze and experimentally implement a specific unitary evolution of a simple quantum system. The authors refer to this type of dynamics as a "superposition of unitary time evolutions." They claim that such an evolution enables a violation of the temporal Tsirelson bound in the Leggett-Garg scenario, a claim that is supported by their experimental results. In this work, we show that the proposed evolution can be understood within a more conventional framework, without invoking a superposition of evolutions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the apparent violation of the bound arises because the measured quantities are not consistent with the assumptions of the Leggett-Garg scenario. This is a slightly extended version of the Comment submitted for publication in Phys. Rev. Lett.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing, Ising Formulation, and the Traveling Salesman Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ising formulation is important for many NP problems (Lucas, 2014). This formulation enables implementing novel quantum computing methods including Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Here, we investigate closely the traveling salesman problem (TSP).
  First, we present some non-trivial issues related to Ising model view versus a realistic salesman.
  Then, focusing on VQE we discuss and clarify the use of: a.-- Conventional VQE and how it is relevant as a novel SAT-solver; b.-- Qubit efficiency and its importance in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum-era; and c.-- the relevance and importance of a novel approach named Discrete Quantum Exhaustive Search (Alfassi, Meirom, and Mor, 2024), for enhancing VQE and other methods using mutually unbiased bases.
  The approach we present here in details can potentially be extended for analyzing approximating and solving various other NP complete problems. Our approach can also be extended beyond the Ising model and beyond the class NP, for example to the class Quantum Merlin Arthur (QMA) of problems, relevant for quantum chemistry and for general spin problems.</description>

      <title>Gravitationally Induced Entanglement Between Particles in Harmonic Traps: Limits for Gaussian States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitationally induced entanglement has been proposed as a probe of the quantum nature of gravity. This work analyzes a system of two particles in harmonic traps interacting only through gravity, considering thermal and two-mode squeezed initial states. For thermal states, a maximum temperature is identified above which entanglement cannot be generated, and for fixed system parameters an optimal trap frequency that maximizes the logarithmic negativity is found. Squeezing the initial state does not further enhance the entanglement generation, but increases the temperature range over which it can be observed. Extending the analysis to general Gaussian states, an upper bound on the achievable entanglement is derived and shown to be saturated, for example, by ground and squeezed states. The results show that the amount of entanglement generated in this setup is extremely small, highlighting the experimental challenges of observing gravitationally induced quantum effects.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Lindblad description of the electron's radiative dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An effective model for describing the relativistic quantum dynamics of a radiating electron is developed via a relativistic generalization of the Lindblad master equation. By incorporating both radiation reaction and vacuum fluctuations into the Dirac equation within an open quantum system framework, our approach captures the Zitterbewegung of the electron, ensuing noncommutativity of its effective spatial coordinates, and provides the quantum analogue of the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) classical equation of motion with radiation reaction. We develop the corresponding phase-space representation via the relativistic Wigner function and derive the semiclassical limit through a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. The latter elucidates the signature of quantum vacuum fluctuations in the LL equation, and shows its relationship with the corrected Sokolov equation. Our results offer a robust framework for investigating quantum radiation reaction effects in ultrastrong laser fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), the performance of the information reconciliation (IR) step is critical for the achievable secret key rate (SKR) and transmission distance. We show how to improve on the recently introduced implementation of an IR-protocol involving multiple decoding attempts (MDA) and validate the method on simulated data in different application scenarios. Throughout, we demonstrate meaningful SKR-gains compared to both the standard protocol of a single decoding attempt and to the original MDA-implementation, even at given decoding complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete characterization of diagonal unitary covariant (DU-covariant) superchannels, i.e. higher-order transformations transforming quantum channels into themselves. Necessary and sufficient conditions for complete positivity and trace preservation are derived and the canonical decomposition describing DU-covariant superchannels is provided. The presented framework unifies and extends known families of covariant quantum channels and enables explicit analysis of their action on physically relevant examples, including amplitude-damping, bit-flip, and Pauli channels. Our results provide a practical toolbox for symmetry-restricted higher-order quantum processes and offer a setting for exploring open problems such as the PPT$^2$ conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We apply a machine-learning-enhanced greybox framework to a quantum optimal control protocol for open quantum systems. Combining a whitebox physical model with a neural-network blackbox trained on synthetic data, the method captures non-Markovian noise effects and achieves gate fidelities above 90% under Random Telegraph and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise.

      <title>Harnessing subspace controllability: Time-optimal Dicke-state generation in Heisenberg-coupled qubit arrays with a single local control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the feasibility of realizing Dicke states in qubit arrays with always-on isotropic Heisenberg coupling between adjacent qubits, assuming a single Zeeman-type control acting in the $z$ direction on an actuator qubit. The Lie-algebraic criteria of controllability imply that such an array is not completely controllable, but satisfies the conditions for subspace controllability on any subspace with a fixed number of excitations. Therefore, a qubit array described by the model under consideration is state-to-state controllable for an arbitrary choice of initial and final states that have the same Hamming weight. This limited controllability is exploited here for the time-optimal dynamical generation of an $a$-excitation Dicke state $|D^{N}_{a}\rangle$ ($a=1,2,\ldots, N-1$) in a linear array with $N$ qubits starting from a generic Hamming-weight-$a$ product state. To dynamically generate the desired Dicke states -- including $W$ states $|W_{N}\rangle$ as their special ($a=1$) case -- in the shortest possible time with a single local $Z$ control, we employ an optimal-control scheme based on the dressed Chopped RAndom Basis (dCRAB) algorithm. We optimize the target-state fidelity over the expansion coefficients of smoothly-varying control fields in a truncated random Fourier basis; this is done by combining Nelder-Mead-type local optimizations with the multistart-based clustering algorithm that facilitates searches for global extrema. In this manner, we obtain the optimal control fields for Dicke-state preparation in arrays with up to $N=9$ qubits. Based on our numerical results, we find that the shortest possible state-preparation times scale quadratically with $N$. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our control scheme against small control-field deviations from the optimal values.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-Stabilized Quantum Revivals in a Non-Hermitian Lattice Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of quantum simulation experiments of lattice gauge theories (LGTs), an open question is the effect of non-Hermiticity on their rich physics. The well-known PXP model, a U$(1)$ LGT with a two-level electric field in one spatial dimension, has become a paradigm of exotic physics in and out of equilibrium. Here, we introduce a non-Hermitian version in which the spin-flip rate differs between the two spin directions. While the naive expectation is that non-Hermiticity might suppress coherent phenomena such as quantum many-body scars, we find that when the facilitating direction of the spin is disfavored, the oscillations are instead \emph{enhanced}, decaying much slower than in the PXP limit. We demonstrate that this can be understood through a similarity transformation that maps our model to the standard PXP model, revealing that the oscillations are enhanced versions of the PXP scars. Our work provides an analytically tractable and conceptually simple example where non-Hermiticity enhances the stability of dynamically non-trivial coherent many-body modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era of technology in which we currently find ourselves is defined by non-universality, susceptibility to errors and noise, and a search for useful applications. While demonstrations of practical quantum advantage remain elusive in this era, it provides space to develop and analyze the advantages and limitations of systems and their ability to solve problems. In this work, we critically assess a proposed quantum algorithm for the graph isomorphism problem, implemented on a photonic quantum device. Inspired by the nature of this quantum algorithm, we formulate a necessary condition for the isomorphism of graphs encoded in Gaussian boson samplers and a classical algorithm to test for it. Our classical algorithm makes use of efficiently computable statistical properties of a quantum sampling system to show a pair of graphs fail to meet our necessary condition and thus cannot be isomorphic. We analyze our algorithm in the context of the inspiring, sampler-based quantum algorithm of Br\`adler et. al., the classical color refinement algorithm, and the state-of-the-art quasi-polynomial Babai algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of distinguishing between separable and entangled states of two quantum wave packets, one of which falls into a black hole. Intuitively, one might expect the two scenarios to be indistinguishable, since the information carried by one wave packet is hidden beyond the event horizon. We show, however, that fundamental limitations on the localizability of quantum states render the two scenarios, in principle, distinguishable. Employing tools from quantum state discrimination theory, we analyze a concrete realization and discuss the configurations that maximize the probability of successfully distinguishing between the two cases.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty inequalities in a non-Hermitian scenario: the problem of the metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate uncertainty relations for quantum observables evolving under non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, with particular emphasis on the role of metric operators. By constructing appropriate metrics in each dynamical regime, namely the unbroken-symmetry phase, the broken-symmetry phase, and at exceptional points, we provide a consistent definition of expectation values, variances, and time evolution within a Krein-space framework. Within this approach, we derive a generalized Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty inequality which is valid across all spectral regimes. As an application, we analyze a two level model with parity-time reversal symmetry and show that, while the uncertainty measure exhibits oscillatory behavior in the unbroken phase, it evolves toward a minimum-uncertainty steady state in the broken symmetry phase and at exceptional points. We further compare our metric-based description with a Lindblad master-equation approach and show their agreement in the steady state. Our results highlight the necessity of incorporating appropriate metric structures to extract physically meaningful predictions from non-Hermitian quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Incorporating multi-qubit exchange coupling effects between transmon qubits in Maxwell-Schr\"{o}dinger numerical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits have emerged as a leading platform for realizing quantum computers. Accurate modeling of these devices is essential for predicting performance, improving design, and optimizing control. Many modeling approaches currently rely on lumped circuit approximations or other simplified treatments that can be limited in resolving the interplay between the qubit dynamics and the electromagnetic circuitry, leading to significant experimental deviations from numerical predictions at times. To address many of these limitations, methods that self-consistently solve the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for qubit dynamics with the classical Maxwell's equations have been developed and shown to accurately predict a wide range of effects related to superconducting qubit control and readout. Despite these successes, these methods have not been able to consider multi-qubit effects that give rise to qubit-qubit entanglement. Here, we address this by rigorously deriving how multi-qubit coupling effects between transmon qubits can be embedded into Maxwell-Schr\"{o}dinger methods. To support this, we build on earlier first-principles derivations of Maxwell-Schr\"{o}dinger methods for the specific case of two transmon qubits coupled together through a common electromagnetic system in the dispersive regime. To aid in validating aspects of the Maxwell-Schr\"{o}dinger framework, we also provide a new interpretation of Maxwell-Schr\"{o}dinger methods as an efficient simulation strategy to capture the class of non-Markovian open quantum system dynamics. Our results demonstrate that these effects can give rise to strong classical crosstalk that can significantly alter multi-qubit dynamics, which we demonstrate for the cross-resonance gate. These classical crosstalk effects have been noted in cross-resonance experiments, but previous quantum theory and device analysis could not explain their origin.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase synchronisation enhanced via Coulomb interaction in an optomechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the dynamics of quantum synchronization in a four-mode optomechanical system, focusing on the influence of the Coulomb interaction between two mechanical resonators. We analyze the effect of the Coulomb coupling on three distinct synchronization regimes, i.e., complete quantum synchronization, $\phi$-synchronization, and quantum phase synchronization. Our results show that while the Coulomb interaction plays a pivotal role in significantly enhancing quantum phase synchronization by facilitating energy exchange and phase coherence, it has little impact on complete and $\phi$-synchronization. This indicates that amplitude and frequency locking are primarily determined by the optical driving, whereas phase alignment depends critically on inter-resonator coupling. We also demonstrate that the oscillations of the two optical cavities, which are indirectly coupled via the mechanical resonators, can become aligned over time, resulting in classical synchronization. These findings provide a robust mechanism for controlling collective quantum dynamics and offer a foundation for applications in quantum communication, precision sensing, and the development of synchronized quantum networks.</description>

      <title>A Boundary Condition Perspective on Circuit QED Dispersive Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boundary conditions in confined geometries and measurement interactions in quantum mechanics share a common structural role: both select a preferred basis by determining which states are compatible with the imposed constraint. This paper develops this perspective for circuit QED dispersive readout through a first-principles derivation starting from the circuit Lagrangian. The transmon qubit terminating a transmission line resonator provides a frequency-dependent boundary condition whose pole structure encodes the qubit's transition frequencies; different qubit states yield different resonator frequencies. Two approximations, linear response and a pole-dominated expansion valid near resonance, reduce the boundary function to a rational form in the Sturm-Liouville eigenparameter. The extended Hilbert space of the Fulton-Walter spectral theory then provides a framework for the dressed-mode eigenvalue problem conditional on the qubit state. The dispersive shift and vacuum Rabi splitting emerge from the transcendental eigenvalue equation, with the residues determined by matching to the splitting: $\delta_{ge} = 2Lg^2\omega_q^2/v^4$, where $g$ is the vacuum Rabi coupling. A level repulsion theorem guarantees that no dressed mode frequency coincides with a transmon transition. For two qubits with matched dispersive shifts, odd-parity states become frequency-degenerate; true parity-only measurement requires engineered suppression of linear dispersive terms.</description>

      <title>Three-Axis Spin Squeezed States Associated with Excited-State Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin squeezing in collective atomic ensembles enables quantum-enhanced metrology by reducing noise below the standard quantum limit through nonlinear interactions. Extending the one-axis and two-axis twisting paradigms of Kitagawa and Ueda, we introduce a general class of three-axis spin squeezed states within the anisotropic Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. The model features direction-dependent quadratic couplings that interpolate between uniaxial and biaxial regimes and can be interpreted as an asymmetric quantum rotor. Using semiclassical dynamics, Majorana representations, and Husimi-Q distributions, we analyze the structure and metrological properties of the resulting states. The three-axis framework reproduces the known N^(-2/3) scaling of one-axis twisting and the Heisenberg-limited N^(-1) scaling of two-axis twisting, while allowing additional tunability and enhanced entanglement generation in low-spin systems. We further show that tuning the anisotropy parameters induces ground-state and excited-state quantum phase transitions, including a second-order transition associated with level clustering and critical dynamics. These results unify spin squeezing, quantum criticality, and rotor analogies, and suggest implementations in Rydberg arrays and cavity-QED platforms for precision sensing and quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of Quantum Phase Slips: Visualizing Complex Real-Time Instantons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametrically driven oscillators can emerge as a basis for the next generation of qubits. Classically, these systems exhibit two stable oscillatory states with opposite phases. Upon quantization, these states turn into a pair of closely spaced Floquet states, which can serve as the logical basis for a qubit. However, interaction with the environment induces phase-slip events which set a limit on qubit coherence. Such phase slips persist even at zero temperature due to a mechanism known as quantum activation \cite{QuantumActivation}. In contrast to conventional tunneling, the quantum activation is described by a {\em real-time} instanton trajectory in the complexified phase space of the system. In this work, we show that the phase-slip rate is exponentially sensitive to weak AC perturbations. The spectrum of the system's response -- captured by the so-called logarithmic susceptibility (LS) -- enables a direct observation of characteristic features of real-time instantons. Studying this spectrum suggests new means of efficient qubit control.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional derivative-free optimization. A case study on minimization of Hartree-Fock-Roothaan energy functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an evaluation of derivative-free optimization algorithms for the direct minimization of Hartree-Fock-Roothaan energy functionals involving nonlinear orbital parameters and quantum numbers with noninteger order. The analysis focuses on atomic calculations employing noninteger Slater-type orbitals. Analytic derivatives of the energy functional are not readily available for these orbitals. Four methods are investigated under identical numerical conditions: Powell's conjugate-direction method, the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm, coordinate-based pattern search, and a model-based algorithm utilizing radial basis functions for surrogate-model construction. Performance benchmarking is first performed using the Powell singular function, a well-established test case exhibiting challenging properties including Hessian singularity at the global minimum. The algorithms are then applied to Hartree-Fock-Roothaan self-consistent-field energy functionals, which define a highly non-convex optimization landscape due to the nonlinear coupling of orbital parameters. Illustrative examples are provided for closed$-$shell atomic configurations, specifically the He, Be isoelectronic series, with calculations performed for energy functionals involving up to eight nonlinear parameters.</description>

      <title>Geometric phase of exceptional point as quantum resonance in complex scaling method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian operators and exceptional points (EPs) are now routinely realized in few-mode systems such as optical resonators and superconducting qubits. However, their foundations in genuine scattering problems with unbounded Hamiltonians remain much less clear. In this work, we address how the geometric phase associated with encircling an EP should be formulated when the underlying eigenstates are quantum resonances within a one-dimensional scattering model. To do this, we employ the complex scaling method, where resonance poles of the S-matrix are realized as discrete eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian dilated Hamiltonian, to construct situations in which resonant and scattering states coalesce into an EP in the complex energy plane, that is, the resonance pole is embedded into the continuum spectrum. We analyze the self-orthogonality in the vicinity of an EP and the Berry phase. Our results provide a bridge between non-Hermitian spectral theory and the traditional theory of quantum resonances.</description>

      <title>TLS-induced thermal nonlinearity in a micro-mechanical resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experimental evidence of a thermally-driven amplitude-frequency nonlinearity in a thin-film quartz phononic crystal resonator at millikelvin temperatures. The nonlinear response arises from the coupling of the mechanical mode to an ensemble of microscopic two-level system defects driven out of equilibrium by a microwave drive. In contrast to the conventional Duffing oscillator, the observed nonlinearity exhibits a mixed reactive-dissipative character. Notably, the reactive effect can manifest as either a softening or hardening of the mechanical resonance, depending on the ratio of thermal to phonon energy. By combining the standard TLS theory with a thermal conductance model, the measured power-dependent response is quantitatively reproduced and readout-enhanced relaxation damping from off-resonant TLSs is identified as the primary mechanism limiting mechanical coherence. Within this framework, we delineate the conditions under which similar systems will realize this nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Computers for Neural Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural quantum states efficiently represent many-body wavefunctions with neural networks, but the cost of Monte Carlo sampling limits their scaling to large system sizes. Here we address this challenge by combining sparse Boltzmann machine architectures with probabilistic computing hardware. We implement a probabilistic computer on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and use it as a fast sampler for energy-based neural quantum states. For the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model at criticality, we obtain accurate ground-state energies for lattices up to 80 $\times$ 80 (6400 spins) using a custom multi-FPGA cluster. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-sampling algorithm to train deep Boltzmann machines, replacing intractable marginalization with conditional sampling over auxiliary layers. This enables the training of sparse deep models and improves parameter efficiency relative to shallow networks. Using this algorithm, we train deep Boltzmann machines for a system with 35 $\times$ 35 (1225 spins). Together, these results demonstrate that probabilistic hardware can overcome the sampling bottleneck in variational simulation of quantum many-body systems, opening a path to larger system sizes and deeper variational architectures.</description>

      <title>QAOA-MaxCut has barren plateaus for almost all graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The QAOA has been the subject of intense study over recent years, yet the corresponding Dynamical Lie Algebra (DLA)--a key indicator of the expressivity and trainability of VQAs--remains poorly understood beyond highly symmetric instances. An exponentially scaling DLA dimension is associated with the presence of so-called barren plateaus (BP) in the optimization landscape, which renders training intractable. In this work, we investigate the DLA of QAOA applied to the canonical MaxCut, for both weighted and unweighted graphs. For weighted graphs, we show that when the weights are drawn from a continuous distribution, the DLA dimension grows as $\Theta(4^n)$ almost surely for all connected graphs except paths and cycles. In the more common unweighted setting, we show that asymptotically all but an exponentially vanishing fraction of graphs have $\Theta(4^n)$ large DLA dimension. The entire simple Lie algebra decomposition of the corresponding DLAs is also identified, from which we prove that the variance of the loss function is $O(1/2^n)$, implying that QAOA on these weighted and unweighted graphs all suffers from BP. Moreover, we give explicit constructions for families of graphs whose DLAs have exponential dimension, including cases whose MaxCut is in $\mathsf P$. Our proof of the unweighted case is based on a number of splitting lemmas and DLA-freeness conditions that allow one to convert prohibitively complicated Lie algebraic problems into amenable graph theoretic problems. These form the basis for a new algorithm that computes such DLAs orders of magnitude faster than previous methods, reducing runtimes from days to seconds on standard hardware. We apply this algorithm to MQLib, a classical MaxCut benchmark suite covering over 3,500 instances with up to 53,130 vertices, and find that, ignoring edge weights, at least 75% of the instances possess a DLA of dimension at least $2^{128}$.</description>

      <title>Hidden rotation symmetry of the Jordan-Wigner transformation and its application to measurement in quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a global rotation by theta about the z-axis in the spin sector of the Jordan-Wigner transformation rotates Pauli matrices X and Y in the x-y-plane, while it adds a global complex phase to fermionic quantum states that have a fixed number of particles. With the right choice of angles, this relates expectation values of Pauli strings containing products of X and Y to different products, which can be employed to reduce the number of measurements needed when simulating fermionic systems on a quantum computer. Here, we derive this symmetry and show how it can be applied to systems in Physics and Chemistry that involve Hamiltonians with only single-particle (hopping) and two-particle (interaction) terms. We also discuss the consequences of this for finding efficient measurement circuits in variational ground state preparation.</description>

      <title>Band Structure and Dynamics of Single Photons in Atomic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework to investigate the collective properties of atomic lattices in one, two, and three dimensions. We analyze the single-photon band structure and associated atomic decay rates, revealing a fundamental dependence on dimensionality. One- and two-dimensional arrays are shown to be inherently radiative, exhibiting band gaps and decay rates that oscillate between superradiant and subradiant regimes, as a function of lattice spacing. In contrast, three-dimensional lattices are found to be fundamentally non-radiative due to the inhibition of spontaneous emission, with decay only at discrete Bragg resonances. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this structural difference dictates the system dynamics, which crosses over from dissipative decay in lower dimensions to coherent transport in three dimensions. Our results provide insight into cooperative effects in atomic arrays at the single-photon level.</description>

      <title>Volcano Architecture for Scalable Quantum Processor Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information processing platforms based on array of matter qubits, such as neutral atoms, trapped ions, and quantum dots, face significant challenges in scalable addressing and readout as system sizes increase. Here, we propose the "Volcano" architecture that establishes a new quantum processing unit implementation method based on optical channel mapping on a arbitrarily arranged static qubit array. To support the feasibility of Volcano architecture, we show a proof-of-principle demonstration by employing a photonic chip that leverages custom-designed three-dimensional waveguide structures to transform one-dimensional beam arrays into arbitrary two-dimensional output patterns matching qubit array geometries. We demonstrate parallel and independent control of 49-channel with negligible crosstalk and high uniformity. This architecture addresses the challenges in scaling up quantum processors, including both the classical link for parallel qubit control and the quantum link for efficient photon collection, and holds the potential for interfacing with neutral atom arrays and trapped ion crystals, as well as networking of heterogeneous quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Variance Decomposition in Bohmian Mechanics with Weak Actual Value Field and Quantum Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a trajectory-based decomposition of quantum variances within Bohmian mechanics. By extending the weak actual value to a field on configuration space, we prove, under strong regularity conditions for stationary bound states, that the standard quantum variance splits into two non-negative terms: the ensemble variance of weak actual value and a quantum termarising from phase-amplitude coupling. For momentum, linking variance-level fluctuations to the average quantum potential. The decomposition fails to provide a physical interpretation for spin, reinforcing the Bohmian tenet that only position is fundamental. The work provides a formal tool for analyzing quantum fluctuations and clarifies the interpretative limits of such a trajectory-based approach.</description>

      <title>A fast and exact algorithm for stabilizer R\'enyi entropy via XOR-FWHT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum advantage is widely understood to rely on key quantum resources beyond entanglement, among which nonstabilizerness (quantum ``magic'') plays a central role in enabling universal quantum computation. However, a direct brute-force enumeration of all Pauli strings and the corresponding expectation values from a length-$2^N$ state vector, where $N$ is the system size, yields an overall computational cost scaling as $O(8^N)$, which quickly becomes infeasible as the system size grows. Here we reformulate the second-order stabilizer R\'enyi entropy in a bitstring language, expose an underlying XOR-convolution structure on $\mathbb Z_2^N$, and reduce the computation to $2^N$ fast Walsh-Hadamard transforms of length, together with pointwise operations, yielding a deterministic and exact XOR fast Walsh-Hadamard transforms algorithm with runtime scaling $O(N4^N)$ and natural parallelism. This algorithm enables high-precision, medium-scale exact calculations for generic state vectors. It provides a practical tool for probing the scaling, phase diagnostics, and dynamical fine structure of quantum magic in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Visual Word Sense Disambiguation: Unraveling Ambiguities Through Quantum Inference Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual word sense disambiguation focuses on polysemous words, where candidate images can be easily confused. Traditional methods use classical probability to calculate the likelihood of an image matching each gloss of the target word, summing these to form a posterior probability. However, due to the challenge of semantic uncertainty, glosses from different sources inevitably carry semantic biases, which can lead to biased disambiguation results. Inspired by quantum superposition in modeling uncertainty, this paper proposes a Quantum Inference Model for Unsupervised Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (Q-VWSD). It encodes multiple glosses of the target word into a superposition state to mitigate semantic biases. Then, the quantum circuit is executed, and the results are observed. By formalizing our method, we find that Q-VWSD is a quantum generalization of the method based on classical probability. Building on this, we further designed a heuristic version of Q-VWSD that can run more efficiently on classical computing. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art classical methods, particularly by effectively leveraging non-specialized glosses from large language models, which further enhances performance. Our approach showcases the potential of quantum machine learning in practical applications and provides a case for leveraging quantum modeling advantages on classical computers while quantum hardware remains immature.</description>

      <title>Interfacing Atomic Spins with Photons for Quantum Metrology, Simulation and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lecture notes discuss applications of atom-light interactions in cavities to quantum metrology, simulation, and computation. A focus is on nonlocally interacting spin systems realized by coupling many atoms to a delocalized mode of light. We will build up from the fundamentals: understanding how a cavity enables light to coherently imprint information on atoms and atoms to imprint information on the light, enabling quantum non-demolition measurements that constitute a powerful means of engineering nonclassical states. By extension, letting the intracavity light act back on the atoms enables coherent photon-mediated interactions. I start by discussing collective spin models, emphasizing applications in entanglement-enhanced metrology, before proceeding to richer many-body physics enabled by incorporating spatiotemporal control or employing multiple cavity modes. I will highlight opportunities for leveraging these tools for quantum simulations inspired by problems in condensed matter and quantum gravity. Along the way, I provide a pedagogical introduction to criteria for strong atom-light coupling, illustrate how the corresponding figure of merit -- the cooperativity -- sets fundamental limits on the coherence of atom-light interactions, and discuss prospects for harnessing high-cooperativity cavity QED in quantum simulation and computation.</description>

      <title>Continuous-variable quantum key distribution network based on entangled states of optical frequency combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) features a high key rate and compatibility with classical optical communication. Developing expandable and efficient CVQKD networks will promote the deployment of large-scale quantum communication networks in the future. This paper proposes a CVQKD network based on the entangled states of an optical frequency comb. This scheme generates Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled states with a frequency comb structure through the process of a type-II optical parametric oscillator. By combining with the scheme of entanglement in the middle, a fully connected CVQKD network capable of distributing secret keys simultaneously can be formed. We analyze the security of the system in the asymptotic case. Simulation results show that under commendable controlling of system loss and noise, the proposed scheme is feasible for deploying a short-distance fully connected CVQKD network. Loss will be the main factor limiting the system's performance. The proposed scheme provides new ideas for a multi-user fully connected CVQKD network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate benchmarking of quantum gates is crucial for understanding and enhancing the performance of quantum hardware. A standard method for this is interleaved benchmarking, a technique which estimates the error on an interleaved target gate by comparing cumulative error rates of randomized sequences implemented with the interleaved gate and without it. In this work, we show both numerically and experimentally that the standard approach of interleaved randomized benchmarking (IRB), which uses the multi-qubit Clifford group for randomization, can produce highly inaccurate and even physically impossible estimates for the error on the interleaved gate in the presence of coherent errors. Fortunately we also show that interleaved benchmarking performed with cycle benchmarking, which randomizes with single qubit Pauli gates, provides dramatically reduced systematic uncertainty relative to standard IRB, and further provides as host of additional benefits including data reusability. We support our conclusions with a theoretical framework for bounding systematic errors, extensive numerical results comparing a range of interleaved protocols under fixed resource costs, and experimental demonstrations on three quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealers can solve QUBO problems efficiently but struggle with continuous optimization tasks like regression due to their discrete nature. We introduce Quadratic Continuous Quantum Optimization (QCQO), an anytime algorithm that approximates solutions to unconstrained quadratic programs via a sequence of QUBO instances. Rather than encoding real variables as binary vectors, QCQO implicitly represents them using continuous QUBO weights and iteratively refines the solution by summing sampled vectors. This allows flexible control over the number of binary variables and adapts well to hardware constraints. We prove convergence properties, introduce a step size adaptation scheme, and validate the method on linear regression. Experiments with simulated and real quantum annealers show that QCQO achieves accurate results with fewer qubits, though convergence slows on noisy hardware. Our approach enables quantum annealing to address a wider class of continuous problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the static isoperimetric problem underlying the Mandelstam-Tamm bound. Among one-dimensional confining potentials with a fixed spectral gap, we prove that the harmonic trap is the unique maximizer of the ground-state position variance. As a consequence, we obtain a sharp geometric quantum speed-limit bound on the position-position component of the quantum metric, and we give a necessary-and-sufficient condition for when the bound is saturated. Beyond the exact extremum, we establish quantitative rigidity. We control the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn spectral tail and provide square-integrable structural stability for potentials that nearly saturate the bound. We further extend the analysis to magnetic settings, deriving a longitudinal necessary-and-sufficient characterization and transverse bounds expressed in terms of guiding-center structure. Finally, we outline applications to bounds on static polarizability, limits on the quantum metric, and benchmarking of trapping potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct holonomic quantum gates for qubits that are encoded in the near-degenerate vibrational $E$-doublet of a deformable three-body system. Using Kendall's shape theory, we derive the Wilczek--Zee connection governing adiabatic transport within the $E$-manifold. We show that its restricted holonomy group is $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, implying universal single-qubit control by closed loops in shape space. We provide explicit loops implementing a $\pi/2$ phase gate and a Hadamard-type gate. For two-qubit operations, we outline how linked holonomic cycles in arrays generate a controlled Chern--Simons phase, enabling an entangling controlled-$X$ (CNOT) gate. We present a Ramsey/echo interferometric protocol that measures the Wilson loop trace of the Wilczek--Zee connection for a control cycle, providing a gauge-invariant signature of the non-Abelian holonomy. As a physically realizable demonstrator, we propose bond-length modulations of a Cs($6s$)--Cs($6s$)--Cs($nd_{3/2}$)
  Rydberg trimer in optical tweezers and specify operating conditions that suppress leakage out of the $E$-manifold.</description>

Abstract: Sampling tasks have been successful in establishing quantum advantages both in theory and experiments. This has fueled the use of quantum computers for generative modeling to create samples following the probability distribution underlying a given dataset. In particular, the potential to build generative models on classically hard distributions would immediately preclude classical simulability, due to theoretical separations. In this work, we study quantum generative models from the perspective of output distributions, showing that models that anticoncentrate are not trainable on average, including those exhibiting quantum advantage. In contrast, models outputting data from sparse distributions can be trained. We consider special cases to enhance trainability, and observe that this opens the path for classical algorithms for surrogate sampling. This observed trade-off is linked to verification of quantum processes. We conclude that quantum advantage can still be found in generative models, although its source must be distinct from anticoncentration.</description>

      <title>Operator Entanglement from Non-Commutative Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that Hopf-algebra deformations of symmetries -- as encountered in non-commutative models of quantum spacetime -- carry an intrinsic content of $operator$ $entanglement$ that is enforced by the coproduct-defined notion of composite generators. As a minimal and exactly solvable example, we analyze the $U_q(\mathfrak{su}(2))$ quantum group and a two-qubit realization obtained from the coproduct of a $q$-deformed single-spin Hamiltonian. Although the deformation is invisible on a single qubit, it resurfaces in the two-qubit sector through the non-cocommutative coproduct, yielding a family of intrinsically nonlocal unitaries. We compute their operator entanglement in closed form and show that, for Haar-uniform product inputs, their entangling power is fully determined by the latter. This provides a concrete mechanism by which non-commutative symmetries enforce a baseline of entanglement at the algebraic level, with implications for information dynamics in quantum-spacetime settings and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Topological Phase Discovery in Periodically Driven Systems via Floquet-Bloch State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floquet engineering offers an unparalleled platform for realizing novel non-equilibrium topological phases. However, the unique structure of Floquet systems, which includes multiple quasienergy gaps, poses a significant challenge to classification using conventional analytical methods. We propose a novel unsupervised machine learning framework that employs a kernel defined in momentum-time ($\boldsymbol{k},t$) space, constructed directly from Floquet-Bloch eigenstates. This approach is intrinsically data-driven and requires no prior knowledge of the underlying topological invariants, providing a fundamental advantage over prior methods that rely on abstract concepts like the micromotion operator or homotopic transformations. Crucially, this work successfully reveals the intrinsic topological characteristics encoded within the Floquet eigenstates themselves. We demonstrate that our method robustly and simultaneously identifies the topological invariants associated with both the $0$-gap and the $\pi$-gap across various symmetry classes (1D AIII, 1D D, and 2D A), establishing a robust methodology for the systematic classification and discovery of complex non-equilibrium topological matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum Mpemba effect in a dissipative Dicke model, which consists of a spin-1/2 ensemble coupled to a bosonic mode, which in turn is coupled to a bosonic bath. We derive a sufficient criterion for occurrence of the quantum Mpemba effect, characterized by quantum coherence, in this model. We introduce the phenomenon of role reversal in the Mpemba effect, wherein changes in the system parameters invert the relaxation ordering of a given pair of initial states that exhibit the Mpemba effect, causing the faster-relaxing state to become slower and vice versa. We find the existence of role reversal in Mpemba effect for this Dicke model using different relaxation measures, including differential quantum coherence and entanglement, and trace distance, between the time-evolved and steady states.</description>

      <title>Measuring Mixed-State Topological Invariant in Open Photonic Quantum Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pure-state manifestations of geometric phase are well established and have found applications across essentially all branches of physics, yet their generalization to mixed-state regimes remains largely unexplored experimentally. The Uhlmann geometric phase offers a natural extension of pure-state paradigms and can exhibit a topological character. However, observation of this invariant is impeded by the incompatibility between Uhlmann parallel transport and Hamiltonian dynamics, as well as the difficulty of preparing topologically nontrivial mixed states. To address this challenge, we report an experimentally accessible protocol for directly measuring the mixed-state topological invariant. By engineering controlled nonunitary dynamics in a photonic quantum walk, we prepare topologically nontrivial mixed states from a trivial initial state. Furthermore, by machine-learning the full density matrix in momentum space, we directly extract the quantized geometric phase of the nontrivial mixed states. These results highlight a geometric phase framework that naturally extends to open quantum systems both in and out of thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Image-Plane Detection of Spatially Entangled Photon Pairs with a CMOS Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially entangled photon pairs (biphotons) generated by spontaneous parametric down-conversion offer unique opportunities for quantum imaging, but image-plane biphoton correlations are difficult to observe with camera-based detectors. Previous camera-based biphoton imaging experiments have relied on photon-counting detection, which necessitates operation deep in the photon-sparse regime and requires extremely low dark rates.
  Here, we demonstrate the detection of spatial biphoton joint probability distributions in both the image plane and the pupil plane (also termed "near-field plane" and "far-field plane" respectively) using a conventional scientific CMOS camera operated in linear mode. We work at mesoscopic intensity levels, corresponding to a photon flux approximately four orders of magnitude higher than typical photon-counting approaches. From the measured image- and pupil plane correlations, we observe position and momentum correlations consistent with an EPR-type entanglement witness.
  A tailored correlation analysis suited for image plane imaging suppresses detector artifacts and intensity fluctuations, enabling acquisition with significantly fewer frames. Our results demonstrate that spatially entangled-light imaging can be performed efficiently with standard imaging hardware, extending quantum imaging techniques beyond the photon-counting regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in time-resolved cathodoluminescence have enabled ultrafast studies of single emitters in quantum materials with femtosecond temporal resolution. Here, we develop a quantum theory modeling the dynamics of free electrons interacting with quantum emitters in arbitrary initial states. Our analysis reveals that a free electron can induce transient coherent oscillations in the populations when the system is initially prepared in a coherent superposition of its states. Moreover, the electron energy spectrum exhibits a clear signature of the quantum coherence and sensitivity to the transition frequency of the emitter. These coherence effects manifest themselves as oscillations in the zero-loss peak of the spectral energy-loss probability. Our findings pave the way for characterization of quantum-coherent dynamics of individual quantum emitters by electron-probes.</description>

      <title>Quantumness of hybrid systems under quantum noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum correlations in an axially symmetric hybrid qubit-qutrit system subjected to different noisy environments. We first introduce a physical model and analyze its Hamiltonian structure, emphasizing the role of hybrid dimensionality and axial symmetry. The effects of decoherence are then examined under two local noise mechanisms, namely dephasing and phase-flip channels, acting on the qubit and qutrit subsystems in both symmetric and asymmetric configurations. Quantum correlations are quantified using negativity to capture entanglement and quantum discord based on linear entropy to characterize more general nonclassical correlations. Our results show that both thermal fluctuations and phase noise lead to a monotonic degradation of quantum correlations, with increasing temperature accelerating coherence loss and inducing entanglement sudden death at finite temperatures. While negativity vanishes abruptly under sufficiently strong noise, quantum discord persists beyond the entanglement threshold, revealing residual quantum correlations in mixed states. We further demonstrate that asymmetric noise configurations significantly enhance the robustness of both entanglement and discord by partially shielding coherence in the less affected subsystem. A comparative analysis reveals that phase-flip noise is more destructive than pure dephasing, leading to faster suppression of quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Resource Orchestration for Distributed Quantum Computing Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling quantum computing beyond a single device requires networking many quantum processing units (QPUs) into a coherent quantum-HPC system. We propose the Modular Entanglement Hub (ModEn-Hub) architecture: a hub-and-spoke photonic interconnect paired with a real-time quantum network orchestrator. ModEn-Hub centralizes entanglement sources and shared quantum memory to deliver on-demand, high-fidelity Bell pairs across heterogeneous QPUs, while the control plane schedules teleportation-based non-local gates, launches parallel entanglement attempts, and maintains a small ebit cache. To quantify benefits, we implement a lightweight, reproducible Monte Carlo study under realistic loss and tight round budgets, comparing a naive sequential baseline to an orchestrated policy with logarithmically scaled parallelism and opportunistic caching. Across 1-128 QPUs and 2,500 trials per point, ModEn-Hub-style orchestration sustains about 90% teleportation success while the baseline degrades toward about 30%, at the cost of higher average entanglement attempts (about 10-12 versus about 3). These results provide clear, high-level evidence that adaptive resource orchestration in the ModEn-Hub enables scalable and efficient quantum-HPC operation on near-term hardware.</description>

      <title>High-performance quantum interconnect between bosonic modules beyond transmission loss constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computing architectures require high-performance quantum interconnects between quantum information processing units, while previous implementations have been fundamentally limited by transmission line losses. Here, we demonstrate a low-loss interconnect between two superconducting modules using an aluminum coaxial cable, achieving a bus mode quality factor of 1.7e6. By employing SNAIL as couplers, we realize inter-modular state transfer in 0.8 {\mu}s via a three-wave mixing process. The state transfer fidelity reaches 98.2% for quantum states encoded in the first two energy levels, achieving a Bell state fidelity of 92.5%. Furthermore, we show the capability to transfer high-dimensional states by successfully transmitting binomially encoded logical states. Systematic characterization reveals that performance constraints have shifted from transmission line losses (contributing merely 0.2% infidelity) to module-channel interface effects and local Kerr nonlinearities. Our work advances the realization of quantum interconnects approaching fundamental capacity limits, paving the way for scalable distributed quantum computing and efficient quantum communications.</description>

      <title>Multi-particle quantum systems within the Worldline Monte Carlo formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Worldline Monte Carlo approach to computationally simulating the Feynman path integral of non-relativistic multi-particle quantum-mechanical systems. We show how to generate an arbitrary number of worldlines distributed according to the (free) kinetic part of the multi-particle quantum dynamics and how to simulate interactions between worldlines in the ensemble. We test this formalism with two- and three-particle quantum mechanical systems, with both long range Coulomb-like interactions between the particles and external fields acting separately on the particles, in various spatial dimensionality. We extract accurate estimations of the ground state energy of these systems using the late-time behaviour of the propagator, validating our approach with numerically exact solutions obtained via straightforward diagonalisation of the Hamiltonian. Systematic benchmarking of the new approach, presented here for the first time, shows that the computational complexity of Wordline Monte Carlo scales more favourably with respect to standard numerical alternatives. The method, which is general, numerically exact, and computationally not intensive, can easily be generalised to relativistic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty is a fundamental and important concept in quantum mechanics. Recent works have revealed both the product and sum forms of uncertainty constants for three observables. Such a result is intimately to the properties of Pauli operators. In this work, using the technique in matrix theory, we give an alternative proof for the case of three observables, and generalize the result to the case of four measurements. Comparing with the original proof, such a derivation is simplified. Moreover, the discussions can deal with the summation form of uncertainty relation for two, three and four observables in a unified way.</description>

      <title>Laser intracavity absorption magnetometry for optical quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intracavity absorption spectroscopy (ICAS) is a well-established technique for detecting weak absorption signals with ultrahigh sensitivity. Here, we extend this concept to magnetometry using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. We introduce laser intracavity absorption magnetometry (LICAM), a concept that is in principle applicable to a broader class of optical quantum sensors, including optically pumped magnetometers. Using an electrically driven, edge-emitting diode laser that operates self-sustainably, we show that LICAM enables highly sensitive magnetometers operating under ambient conditions. Near the lasing threshold, we achieve a 475-fold enhancement in optical contrast and a 180-fold improvement in magnetic sensitivity compared with a conventional single-pass geometry. The experimental results are accurately described by a rate-equation model for single-mode diode lasers. From our measurements, we determine a projected shot-noise-limited sensitivity in the $\mathrm{pT}\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ range and show that, with realistic device improvements, sensitivities down to the $\mathrm{fT}\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ scale are attainable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) bound the precision of currents by entropy production, but quantum transport of noncommuting (non-Abelian) charges challenges standard formulations because different charge components cannot be monitored within a single classical frame. We derive a process-level matrix TUR starting from the operational entropy production $\Sigma = D(\rho'_{SE}\|\rho'_S\!\otimes\!\rho_E)$. Isolating the experimentally accessible bath divergence $D_{\mathrm{bath}}=D(\rho'_E\|\rho_E)$, we prove a fully nonlinear, saturable lower bound valid for arbitrary current vectors $\Delta q$: $D_{\mathrm{bath}} \ge B(\Delta q,V,V')$, where the bound depends only on the transported-charge signal $\Delta q$ and the pre/post collision covariance matrices $V$ and $V'$. In the small-fluctuation regime $D_{\mathrm{bath}}\geq\frac12\,\Delta q^{\mathsf T}V^{-1}\Delta q+O(\|\Delta q\|^4)$, while beyond linear response it remains accurate. Numerical strong-coupling qubit collisions illustrate the bound and demonstrate near-saturation across broad parameter ranges using only local measurements on the bath probe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a Python framework named after the General Equation of Quantum Image Encoding (GEQIE). The framework creates the image-encoding state using a unitary gate, which can later be transpiled to target quantum backends. The benchmarking results, simulated with different noise levels, demonstrate the correctness of the already implemented encoding methods and the usability of the framework for more sophisticated research tasks based on quantum image encodings. Additionally, we present a showcase example of Cosmic Web dark-matter density snapshot encoding and high-accuracy retrieval (PCC = 0.995) to demonstrate the extendability of the GEQIE framework to multidimensional data and its applicability to other fields of research.</description>

      <title>Lindbladian PT phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A parity-time (PT) transition is a spectral transition characteristic of non-Hermitian generators; it typically occurs at an exceptional point, where multiple eigenvectors coalesce. The concept of a PT transition has been extended to Markovian open quantum systems, which are described by the GKSL equation. Interestingly, the PT transition in many-body Markovian open quantum systems, the so-called \textit{Lindbladian PT (L-PT) phase transition}, is closely related to two classes of exotic nonequilibrium many-body phenomena: \textit{continuous-time crystals} and \textit{non-reciprocal phase transitions}. In this review, we describe the recent advances in the study of L-PT phase transitions. First, we define PT symmetry in three distinct contexts: non-Hermitian systems, nonlinear dynamical systems, and Markovian open quantum systems, highlighting the interconnections between these frameworks. Second, we develop mean-field theories of L-PT phase transitions for collective-spin systems and for bipartite bosonic systems with particle-number conservation. Within these classes of models, we show that L-PT symmetry can induce a breaking of continuous time-translation symmetry down to a discrete one, leading to persistent periodic dynamics. We further demonstrate that the L-PT phase transition point is typically \textit{a critical exceptional point}, where multiple collective excitation modes with zero excitation spectrum coalesce. These findings establish an explicit connection to continuous-time crystals and non-reciprocal phase transitions. Third, going beyond the mean-field theory, we analyze statistical and quantum properties, such as purity and quantum entanglement indicators of time-independent steady states for several specific models with the L-PT symmetry. Finally, we discuss future research directions for L-PT phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Any Clifford+T circuit can be controlled with constant T-depth overhead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since an n-qubit circuit consisting of CNOT gates can have up to $\Omega(n^2/\log{n})$ CNOT gates, it is natural to expect that $\Omega(n^2/\log{n})$ Toffoli gates are needed to apply a controlled version of such a circuit. We show that the Toffoli count can be reduced to at most n. The Toffoli depth can also be reduced to O(1), at the cost of 2n Toffoli gates, even without using any ancilla or measurement. In fact, using a measurement-based uncomputation, the Toffoli depth can be further reduced to 1. From this, we give two corollaries: any controlled Clifford circuit can be implemented with O(1) T-depth, and any Clifford+T circuit with T-depth D can be controlled with T-depth O(D), even without ancillas. As an application, we show how to catalyze a rotation by any angle up to precision $\epsilon$ in T-depth exactly 1 using a universal $\lceil\log_2(8/\epsilon)\rceil$-qubit catalyst state.</description>

      <title>Mathieu Control of the Effective Coupling in Superconducting Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common challenge in superconducting quantum circuits is the trade-off between strong coupling and computational subspace integrity. We present Mathieu control, which uses a non-resonant two-photon drive to create a selective nonlinear frequency shift. This shift modifies interactions while preserving qubit states, enabling continuous tuning of the ZZ coupling, including full suppression, and integrating single- and two-qubit gates with low leakage. For a qubit-coupler-qubit device, it allows independent ZZ control, facilitating a programmable Heisenberg (XXZ) Hamiltonian. Extended to a five-qubit chain, the system can be reconfigured to simulate dynamics of quantum magnetic phases. Mathieu control thus provides a framework for high-fidelity quantum logic and programmable simulation.</description>

      <title>Strategies for Overcoming Gradient Troughs in the ADAPT-VQE Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adaptive derivative-assembled problem-tailored variational quantum eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) provides a promising approach for simulating highly correlated quantum systems on quantum devices, as it strikes a balance between hardware efficiency, trainability, and accuracy. Although ADAPT-VQE avoids many of the shortcomings of other VQEs, it is sometimes hindered by a phenomenon known as gradient troughs. This refers to a non-monotonic convergence of the gradients, which may become very small even though the minimum energy has not been reached. This results in difficulties finding the right operators to add to the ansatz, due to the limited number of shots and statistical uncertainties, leading to stagnation in the circuit structure optimization. In this paper, we propose ways to detect and mitigate this phenomenon. Leveraging the non-commutative algebra of the ansatz, we develop heuristics for determining where to insert new operators into the circuit. We find that gradient troughs are more likely to arise when the same locations are used repeatedly for new operator insertions. Our novel protocols, which add new operators in different ansatz positions, allow us to escape gradient troughs and thereby lower the measurement cost of the algorithm. This approach achieves an effective balance between cost and efficiency, leading to faster convergence without compromising the low circuit depth and gate count of ADAPT-VQE.</description>

      <title>No-cost Bell Nonlocality Certification from Quantum Tomography and Its Applications in Quantum Magic Witnessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tomographic measurements are the standard tool for characterizing quantum states, yet they are usually regarded only as means for state reconstruction or fidelity measurement. Here, we show that the same Pauli-basis measurements (X, Y, Z) can be directly employed for the certification of nonlocality at no additional experimental cost. Our framework allows any tomographic data - including archival datasets -- to be reinterpreted in terms of fundamental nonlocality tests. We introduce a generic, constructive method to generate tailored Bell inequalities and showcase their applicability to certify the non-locality of states in realistic experimental scenarios. Recognizing the stabilizer nature of the considered operators, we analyze our inequalities in the context of witnessing quantum magic - a crucial resource for quantum computing. Our approach requires Pauli measurements only and tests the quantum magic solely through the resources present in the state. Our results establish a universal standard that unifies state tomography with nonlocality certification and its application to quantum magic witnessing, thereby streamlining both fundamental studies and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Notes on Crowther and the "Interpretation" of Quantum Mechanics (arXiv:2512.14315)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We read Karen Crowther's \emph{Another 100 Years of Quantum Interpretation?} with two practical goals. First, we spell out what she means by interpretation'': an attempt to provide understanding (not just predictions), which may be representationalist or non-representationalist, and which she contrasts with deeper \emph{reductive} (inter-theoretic) explanation -- especially in the quantum-gravity setting. Second, we list twelve points where the paper's physics-facing wording could be sharpened. In our view, several claims are directionally well-motivated but stated more strongly than the underlying physics supports, or they run together distinct notions (e.g.\ degrees of freedom,'' singularity,'' and different senses of locality'') that need careful separation. We end by suggesting that the philosophical question is genuinely worthwhile, but the physics should be phrased more cautiously so that heuristic motivation is not mistaken for strict implication.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity breaking meets criticality in a gauge-theory quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum simulations have opened access to the real-time dynamics of lattice gauge theories, providing a new setting to explore how quantum criticality influences thermalization and ergodicity far from equilibrium. Using QuEra's programmable Rydberg atom array, we map out the dynamical phase diagram of the spin-1/2 U(1) quantum link model in one spatial dimension by quenching the fermion mass. We reveal a tunable regime of ergodicity breaking due to quantum many-body scars, manifested as long-lived coherent oscillations that persist across a much broader range of parameters than previously observed, including at the equilibrium phase transition point. We further analyze the electron-positron pairs generated during state preparation via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, which strongly affect the post-quench dynamics. Our results provide new insights into nonthermal dynamics in lattice gauge theories and establish Rydberg atom arrays as a powerful platform for probing the interplay between ergodicity breaking and quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Gedanken Experiments of Entanglement in Particle Physics: Interactions, Operators and Bell Inequalities in Flavor Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we explore ideas from quantum entanglement which can be meaningfully formulated and tested in the collider environment. We propose Bell-type inequalities as operator-level diagnostics of quantum incompatibility in particle-physics systems. We construct flavor operators associated with mass identification, flavor change, and charged-current weak mixing which arise from fundamental interactions in the Standard Model. We treat these interactions as alternative measurement settings in a Gendanken experiment. For entangled two-particle states, these operators generate nontrivial correlations that violate Bell-type bounds, excluding non-contextual local descriptions under the stated assumptions. These violations arise from the algebraic structure of the operators rather than from kinematic correlations or exotic dynamics. We discuss how the predicted correlation patterns may be probed with experimental data, clarifying the scope and limitations of Bell-type reasoning in particle physics.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the benefits and disadvantages of using double-pair anti-Helmholtz coils in BEC-producing MOT setups and optimizing their design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work has investigated the Magneto-Optical Trap (MOT) system used to produce Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC). A primary challenge addressed in this study concerns the geometric limitations of traditional single-pair anti-Helmholtz coil configurations, where the magnetic field peaks occur outside the accessible inter-coil region. To overcome this limitation, we have explored the use of double-pair anti-Helmholtz coil configurations that create well-shaped magnetic field potentials centered at the experimentally accessible $z=0$ location. This investigation encompasses the three sequential processes of atom cooling: cooling in a linear external magnetic field through Doppler cooling, cooling in a well-shaped magnetic field through trapping, and evaporative cooling of atoms to achieve sub-microkelvin temperatures. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, we have determined optimal geometric parameters for the coil configuration and operational parameters including laser detuning, saturation intensity, and initial atom populations for ${}^{87}\text{Rb}$ BEC production. The results indicate that with the optimized configuration, the system can achieve final temperatures of approximately $T_f \sim 60\,\mathrm{nK}$ and produce condensate populations of $\sim 10^5$ atoms with a mean density of $n_0 = 4.9 \times 10^{15}\,\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, providing systematic design guidance for experimental BEC systems</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Unruh effect remains a central topic in quantum field theory, although its direct experimental verification continues to be challenging. Recent efforts have therefore focused on indirect detection strategies in which the Unruh effect emerges through measurable physical processes. In this work, we extend a previously introduced detector model, originally formulated for a massless scalar field, to the electromagnetic field. We show that the decoherence decay rates differ between inertial and accelerated frames. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the characteristic exponential decay associated with the Unruh effect can be observed at lower accelerations than those considered in earlier studies.</description>

      <title>Unruh effect and quantum entanglement for the non-uniform Rindler spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the Unruh effect has traditionally been studied under the assumption of uniform acceleration, a simplification motivated by experimental considerations, it is not necessarily true for all non-inertial motions. We propose a novel approach for the indirect detection of the Unruh effect without relying on the former restriction. Previous studies have shown that probing the decoherence of an Unruh-DeWitt detector can significantly reduce the acceleration required for observing the effect by several orders of magnitude compared to earlier proposals. Building on this idea, we develop a theoretical framework describing a non-inertial observer equipped with a detector undergoing non-uniform, time-dependent acceleration. We show that, in a non-uniformly accelerated Rindler spacetime, the particle distribution perceived in the Minkowski vacuum acquires a time-dependent modification of the standard Unruh spectrum. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the inclusion of quantum entanglement leads to a deformation of the Minkowski vacuum into squeezed states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that proximitizing an altermagnet to a non-Hermitian topological insulator provides a powerful mechanism for engineering non-Hermitian higher-order topological phases. The altermagnetic order opens a gap at the topological edge states and drives a topological phase transition from a first-order to a second-order topological phase. When combined with nonreciprocal hopping, the system exhibits both the non-Hermitian skin effect and a hybrid skin-topological effect, whereby first-order edge states and second-order corner states accumulate at selected corners of the lattice. We demonstrate that the spectral winding number of the edge states under cylindrical geometry dictates this corner localization and can be reversed by tuning the altermagnetic order. Consequently, both edge and corner modes become directionally controllable. Our results establish altermagnets as a versatile platform for realizing and tuning skin-topological phenomena in non-Hermitian higher-order topological systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum two-dimensional superintegrable systems in flat space: exact-solvability, hidden algebra, polynomial algebra of integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short review paper the detailed analysis of six two-dimensional quantum {\it superintegrable} systems in flat space is presented. It includes the Smorodinsky-Winternitz potentials I-II (the Holt potential), the Fokas-Lagerstrom model, the 3-body Calogero and Wolfes (equivalently, $G_2$ rational, or $I_6$) models, and the Tremblay-Turbiner-Winternitz (TTW) system with integer index $k$. It is shown that all of them are exactly-solvable, thus, confirming the Montreal conjecture (2001); they admit algebraic forms for the Hamiltonian and both integrals (all three can be written as differential operators with polynomial coefficients without a constant term), they have polynomial eigenfunctions with the invariants of the discrete symmetry group of invariance taken as variables, they have hidden (Lie) algebraic structure $g^{(k)}$ with various $k$, and they possess a (finite order) polynomial algebras of integrals. Each model is characterized by infinitely-many finite-dimensional invariant subspaces, which form the infinite flag. Each subspace coincides with the finite-dimensional representation space of the algebra $g^{(k)}$ for a certain $k$. In all presented cases the algebra of integrals is a 4-generated $(H, I_1, I_2, I_{12}\equiv[I_1, I_2])$ infinite-dimensional algebra of ordered monomials of degrees 2,3,4,5, which is a subalgebra of the universal enveloping algebra of the hidden algebra.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics driven by topology and non-Hermiticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between topology and non-Hermiticity gives rise to exotic dynamic phenomena that challenge conventional wave-packet propagation and entanglement dynamics. While recent studies have established the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) as a key mechanism for anomalous wave dynamics, a unified framework for characterizing and controlling entanglement evolution in non-Hermitian topological systems remains underdeveloped. Here, by combining theory and experiments, we demonstrate that entanglement entropy (EE) and transport currents serve as robust dynamic probes to distinguish various non-Hermitian topological regimes. Using a generalized non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model implemented in an acoustic analog platform, we identify three dynamic phases, bulk-like, edge-like, and skin-like regimes, each exhibiting unique EE signatures and transport characteristics. In particular, skin-like dynamics exhibit periodic information shuttling with finite, oscillatory EE, while edge-like dynamics lead to complete EE suppression. We further map the dynamic phase diagram and show that EE scaling and temporal profiles directly reflect the competition between coherent delocalization and NHSE-driven localization. Our results establish a programmable approach to steering entanglement and transport via tailored non-Hermitian couplings, offering a pathway for engineering quantum information dynamics in synthetic phononic, photonic, and quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: Photon echo is observed in n-type Ge uniaxially stressed along the [111] crystallographic direction, with a coherence relaxation time of 300 ps. The nonlinear polarization responsible for the effect originates from antimony donors. Uniaxial stress induces valley splitting of the donor states, substantially enhancing the coherence time and enabling the observation of photon echo.</description>

      <title>Linear exciton Hall and Nernst effects in monolayer two-dimensional semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the study of linear exciton Hall and Nernst effects in monolayer two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, employing the semi-classical transport theory. By deriving the exciton Berry curvature in momentum space for a general inhomogeneous 2D system, we establish its dependence on the Berry curvature and the effective mass of electron and hole. As illustrative examples, the exciton Hall effect in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and black phosphorus (BP) are calculated. For these materials, we demonstrate that a linear Hall (Nernst) exciton current with the non-zero Berry curvature is strictly forbidden by the symmetries. This finding aligns with earlier experimental observations on the exciton Hall effect in MoSe$_2$. In contrast, a strong anisotropy in BP leads to a net linear Hall current of excitons, exhibiting a relatively large value and resembling an anomalous Hall effect rather than a valley Hall effect. Our work reveals that the specific symmetry of 2D materials can induce a significant linear exciton Hall (Nernst) effect even without Berry curvature, which is normally forbidden with non-zero Berry curvature in the monolayer 2D material. This observation holds promise for future optoelectronic applications and offers exciting possibilities for experimental exploration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) construction, also known as the topological holography, provides a natural and intuitive framework for the entropic order parameter characterising phases with (partially) broken symmetries. Various examples of group and non-invertible symmetries are studied. In particular, the origin of the distinguishability of the vacua resulting from spontaneously broken non-invertible symmetries is made manifest with an information-theoretic perspective, where certain operators in the SymTFT are excluded from observation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic monitoring of maritime environments is an important problem for monitoring and optimising shipping, as well as national security. New developments in compact, fibre-coupled quantum magnetometers have led to the opportunity to critically evaluate how best to create such a sensor network. Here we explore various magnetic sensor network architectures for target identification. Our modelling compares networks of scalar vs vector magnetometers. We implement an unscented Kalman filter approach to perform target tracking, and we find that vector networks provide a significant improvement in target tracking, specifically tracking accuracy and resilience compared with scalar networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These notes are adapted from six lectures that I delivered at Analogue Gravity in Benasque 2023. They present the unified Gaussian (phase-space) framework to describe linear bosonic quantum systems, the standard tool in quantum optics and continuous-variable quantum information, emphasizing its simplicity and platform independence, with applications to semi-classical black holes and analogue gravity. Parts (I-III) develop the formalism: from harmonic dynamics and Gaussian transformations to state characterization via moments, Wigner functions, and entanglement measures. Part (IV) applies these tools to semi-classical black holes, discussing Hawking radiation and quantum superradiance in rotating black holes, and laboratory analogues in light-matter systems via toy models.</description>

      <title>Assembling a Bose-Hubbard superfluid from tweezer-controlled single atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation relies on the preparation and control of low-entropy many-body systems to reveal the behavior of classically intractable models. The development of new approaches for realizing such systems therefore represents a frontier in quantum science. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new protocol for generating ultracold, itinerant many-body states in a tunnel-coupled two-dimensional optical lattice. We do this by adiabatically connecting a near-ground-state-cooled array of up to 50 single strontium-86 atoms with a Bose-Hubbard superfluid. Through comparison with finite-temperature quantum-Monte-Carlo calculations, we estimate that the entropy per particle of the prepared many-body states is approximately $2 k_B$, and that the achieved temperatures are consistent with a significant superfluid fraction. This represents the first time that itinerant many-body systems have been prepared from rearranged atoms, opening the door to bottom-up assembly of a wide range of neutral-atom and molecular systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks provide a powerful new framework for classifying and simulating correlated and topological phases of quantum matter. Their central premise is that strongly correlated matter can only be understood by studying the underlying entanglement structure and its associated (generalised) symmetries. In essence, tensor networks provide a compressed, holographic description of the complicated vacuum fluctuations in strongly correlated systems, and as such they break down the infamous many-body exponential wall. These lecture notes provide a concise overview of the most important conceptual, computational and mathematical aspects of this theory.</description>

      <title>Sub-Ensemble Correlations as a Covariance Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional practice of spatially resolved detection in diffusion-coupled thermal atomic vapors implicitly treat localized responses as mutually independent. However, in this study, it is shown that observable correlations are governed by the intrinsic spatiotemporal covariance of a global spin-fluctuation field, such that spatial separation specifies only overlapping statistical projections rather than independent physical components. A unified field-theoretic description is established in which sub-ensembles are defined as measurement-induced statistical projections of a single stochastic field. Within this formulation, sub-ensemble correlations are determined by the covariance operator, inducing a natural geometry in which statistical independence corresponds to orthogonality of the measurement functionals. For collective spin fluctuations described by a diffusion-relaxation Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic field, the covariance spectrum admits only a finite set of fluctuation modes in a bounded domain, imposing an intrinsic, field-level limit on the number of statistically distinguishable sub-ensembles. The loss of sub-ensemble independence is formalized through the notion of spatial sampling overlap, which quantifies the unavoidable statistical coupling arising from shared access to common low-order fluctuation modes. While multi-channel atomic magnetometry provides a concrete physical setting in which these constraints become explicit, the framework applies generically to diffusion-coupled stochastic fields.</description>

      <title>The Wigner-Ville Transform as an Information Theoretic Tool in Radio-frequency Signal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents novel interpretations to the field of classical signal processing of the Wigner-Ville transform as an information measurement tool. The transform's utility in detecting and localizing information-laden signals amidst noisy and cluttered backgrounds, and further providing measure of their information volumes, are detailed herein using Tsallis' entropy and information and related functionals. Example use cases in radio frequency communications are given, where Wigner-Ville-based detection measures can be seen to provide significant sensitivity advantage, for some shown contexts greater than 15~dB advantage, over energy-based measures and without extensive training routines. Such an advantage is particularly significant for applications which have limitations on observation resources including time/space integration pressures and transient and/or feeble signals, where Wigner-Ville-based methods would improve sensing effectiveness by multiple orders of magnitude. The potential for advancement of several such applications is discussed.</description>

      <title>Necessary and sufficient conditions for entropy vector realizability by holographic simple tree graph models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the ``chordality condition'', which was established in arXiv:2412.18018 as a necessary condition for an entropy vector to be realizable by a holographic simple tree graph model, is also sufficient. The proof is constructive, demonstrating that the algorithm introduced in arXiv:2512.18702 for constructing a simple tree graph model realization of a given entropy vector that satisfies this condition always succeeds. We emphasize that these results hold for an arbitrary number of parties, and, given that any entropy vector realizable by a holographic graph model can also be realized, at least approximately, by a stabilizer state, they highlight how techniques originally developed in holography can provide broad insights into entanglement and information theory more generally, and in particular, into the structure of the stabilizer and quantum entropy cones. Moreover, if the strong form of the conjecture from arXiv:2204.00075 holds, namely, if all holographic entropy vectors can be realized by (not necessarily simple) tree graph models, then the result of this work demonstrates that the essential data that encodes the structure of the holographic entropy cone for an arbitrary number of parties, is the set of ``chordal'' extreme rays of the subadditivity cone.</description>

      <title>Matter with apparent and hidden spin physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials with interesting physical properties are often designed based on our understanding of the target physical effects. The physical properties can be either explicitly observed ("apparent") or concealed by the perceived symmetry ("hidden") but still exist. Both are enabled by specific symmetries and induced by certain physical interactions. Using the underlying approach of condensed matter theory of real materials (rather than schematic model Hamiltonians), we discuss apparent and hidden physics in real materials focusing on the properties of spin splitting and spin polarization. Depending on the enabling symmetries and underlying physical interactions, we classify spin effects into four categories with each having two subtypes; representative materials are pointed out. We then discuss the electric tunability and switch of apparent and hidden spin splitting and polarization in antiferromagnets. Finally, we extend "hidden effects" to views that are farsighted in the sense of resolving the correct atomistic and reciprocal symmetry and replaced by the incorrect higher symmetry. This framework could guide and enable systematic discovery of such intriguing effects.</description>

Abstract: We study the unitary almost Mathieu operator (UAMO), a one-dimensional quasi-periodic unitary operator arising from a two-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk on $\mathbb Z^2$ in a homogeneous magnetic field. In the positive Lyapunov exponent regime $0\le \lambda_1&lt;\lambda_2\le 1$, we establish an arithmetic localization statement governed by the frequency exponent $\beta(\omega)$. More precisely, for every irrational $\omega$ with $\beta(\omega)&lt;L$, where $L&gt;0$ denotes the Lyapunov exponent, and every non-resonant phase $\theta$, we prove Anderson localization, i.e. pure point spectrum with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions. This extends our previous arithmetic localization result for Diophantine frequencies (for which $\beta(\omega)=0$) to a sharp threshold in frequency.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the momentum distribution of an electron gas in a $3$-dimensional torus. The goal is to compute the occupation number of Fourier modes for some trial state obtained through random phase approximation. We obtain the mean-field analogue of momentum distribution formulas for electron gas in [Daniel and Voskov, Phys. Rev. 120, (1960)] in high density limit and [Lam, Phys. Rev. \textbf{3}, (1971)] at metallic density. Our findings are related to recent results obtained independently by Benedikter, Lill and Naidu, and our analysis applies to a general class of singular potentials rather than just the Coulomb case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply methods of equivariant homotopy theory, which may not previously have found due attention in condensed matter physics, to classify first the fragile/unstable topological phases of 2D crystalline Chern insulator materials, and second the possible topological order of their fractional cousins. We highlight that the phases are given by the equivariant 2-Cohomotopy of the Brillouin torus of crystal momenta (with respect to wallpaper point group actions) -- which, despite the attention devoted to crystalline Chern insulators, seems not to have been considered before. Arguing then that any topological order must be reflected in the adiabatic monodromy of gapped quantum ground states over the covariantized space of these band topologies, we compute the latter in examples where this group is non-abelian, showing that any potential FQAH anyons must be localized in momentum space. We close with an outlook on the relevance for the search for topological quantum computing hardware. Mathematical details are spelled out in a supplement.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle Dynamics in the 4d-4f Ising-like Double Perovskite Ba2DyRuO6 Probed by Neutron Scattering and Machine-Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double perovskites containing 4d--4f interactions provide a platform to study complex magnetic phenomena in correlated systems. Here, we investigate the magnetic ground state and quasiparticle excitations of the fascinating double perovskite system, Ba$_2$DyRuO$_6$, through Time of flight (TOF) neutron diffraction (TOF), inelastic neutron scattering (INS), and theoretical modelling. The compound Ba$_2$DyRuO$_6$ is reported to exhibit a single magnetic transition, in sharp contrast to most of the other rare-earth (R) members in this family, A$_2$RRuO$_6$ (A = Ca/Sr/Ba), which typically show magnetic ordering of the Ru ions, followed by R-ion ordering. Our neutron diffraction results confirm that long-range antiferromagnetic order emerges at $T_\mathrm{N} \approx 47$~K, primarily driven by 4d--4f Ru$^{5+}$--Dy$^{3+}$ exchange interactions, where both Dy and Ru moments start to order simultaneously. The ordered ground state is a collinear antiferromagnet with Ising character, carrying ordered moments of $\mu_{\mathrm{Ru}} = 1.6(1)~\mu_\mathrm{B}$ and $\mu_{\mathrm{Dy}} = 5.1(1)~\mu_\mathrm{B}$ at 1.5~K. Low-temperature INS reveals well-defined magnon excitations below 10~meV. SpinW modelling of the INS spectra evidences complex exchange interactions and the presence of magnetic anisotropy, which governs the Ising ground state and accounts for the observed magnon spectrum. Combined INS and Raman spectroscopy reveal crystal-electric-field (CEF) excitations of Dy$^{3+}$ at 46.5 and 71.8~meV in the paramagnetic region. The observed CEF levels are reproduced by point-charge calculations consistent with the $O_h$ symmetry of Dy$^{3+}$. A complementary machine-learning approach is used to analyse the phonon spectrum and compare with INS data. Together, these results clarify the origin of phonon and magnon excitations and their role in the ground-state magnetism of Ba$_2$DyRuO$_6$.</description>

      <title>Towards autonomous time-calibration of large quantum-dot devices: Detection, real-time feedback, and noise spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance and scalability of semiconductor quantum-dot (QD) qubits are limited by electrostatic drift and charge noise that shift operating points and destabilize qubit parameters. As systems expand to large one- and two-dimensional arrays, manual recalibration becomes impractical, creating a need for autonomous stabilization frameworks. Here, we introduce a method that uses the full network of charge-transition lines in repeatedly acquired double-quantum-dot charge stability diagrams (CSDs) as a multidimensional probe of the local electrostatic environment. By accurately tracking the motion of selected transitions in time, we detect voltage drifts, identify abrupt charge reconfigurations, and apply compensating updates to maintain stable operating conditions. We demonstrate our approach on a 10-QD device, showing robust stabilization and real-time diagnostic access to dot-specific noise processes. The high acquisition rate of radio-frequency reflectometry CSD measurements also enables time-domain noise spectroscopy, allowing the extraction of noise power spectral densities, the identification of two-level fluctuators, and the analysis of spatial noise correlations across the array. From our analysis, we find that the background noise at 100~$\mu$\si{\hertz} is dominated by drift with a power law of $1/f^2$, accompanied by a few dominant two-level fluctuators and an average linear correlation length of $(188 \pm 38)$~\si{\nano\meter} in the device. These capabilities form the basis of a scalable, autonomous calibration and characterization module for QD-based quantum processors, providing essential feedback for long-duration, high-fidelity qubit operations.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of boson mixtures with multi-component continuous matrix product states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuous matrix product state (cMPS) ansatz is a promising numerical tool for studying quantum many-body systems in continuous space. Although it provides a clean framework that allows one to directly simulate continuous systems, the optimization of cMPS is known to be a very challenging task, especially in the case of multi-component systems. In this work, we have developed an improved optimization scheme for multi-component cMPS that enables simulations of bosonic quantum mixtures with substantially larger bond dimensions than previous works. We benchmark our method on the two-component Lieb-Liniger model, obtaining numerical results that agree well with analytical predictions. Our work paves the way for further numerical studies of quantum mixture systems using the cMPS ansatz.</description>

      <title>Parity order as a fundamental driver of bosonic topology</title>

Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in interacting bosonic systems have been extensively studied, yet most realizations rely on fine-tuned interactions or enlarged symmetries. Here we show that a qualitatively different mechanism--parity order coupled to bond dimerization--acts as a fundamental driver of bosonic topology. Using density matrix renormalization group simulations, we identify two distinct topological phases absent in the purely dimerized model: an SPT phase at half filling stabilized by positive parity coupling, and a topological phase at unit filling stabilized by negative coupling that can be adiabatically connected to a trivial phase without breaking any symmetry. Our results establish parity order as a new organizing principle for correlation-driven bosonic topology.</description>

      <title>Randomization Times under Quantum Chaotic Hamiltonian Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.25074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomness generation through quantum-chaotic evolution underpins foundational questions in statistical mechanics and applications across quantum information science, including benchmarking, tomography, metrology, and demonstrations of quantum computational advantage. While statistical mechanics successfully captures the temporal averages of local observables, understanding randomness at the level of higher statistical moments remains a daunting challenge, with analytic progress largely confined to random quantum circuit models or fine-tuned systems exhibiting space-time duality. Here we study how much randomness can be dynamically generated by generic quantum-chaotic evolution under physical, non-random Hamiltonians. Combining theoretical insights with numerical simulations, we show that for broad classes of initially unentangled states, the dynamics become effectively Haar-random well before the system can ergodically explore the physically accessible Hilbert space. Both local and highly nonlocal observables, including entanglement measures, equilibrate to their Haar expectation values and fluctuations on polynomial timescales with remarkably high numerical precision, and with the fastest randomization occurring in regions of parameter space previously identified as maximally chaotic. Interestingly, this effective randomization can occur on timescales linear in system size, suggesting that the sub-ballistic growth of Renyi entropies typically observed in systems with conservation laws can be bypassed in non-random Hamiltonians with an appropriate choice of initial conditions.</description>

      <title>A simple generalization of the energy gap law for nonradiative processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.09464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For more than 50 years, an elegant energy gap (EG) law developed by Englman and Jortner [Mol. Phys. {\bf 18}, 145 (1970)] has served as a key theory to understand and model nearly exponential dependence of nonradiative transition rates on the difference of energy between the initial and final states. This work revisits the theory, clarifies key assumptions involved in the rate expression, and provides a generalization for the cases where the effects of temperature dependence and low frequency modes cannot be ignored. For a specific example where the low frequency vibrational and/or solvation responses can be modeled as an Ohmic spectral density, a simple generalization of the EG law is provided. Test calculations demonstrate that this generalized EG law brings significant improvement over the original EG law. Both the original and generalized EG laws are also compared with stationary phase approximations developed for electron transfer theory, which suggests the possibility of a simple interpolation formula valid for any value of EG.</description>

      <title>Partially polaron-transformed quantum master equation for exciton and charge transport dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.02812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polaron-transformed quantum master equation (PQME) offers a unified framework to describe the dynamics of quantum systems in both limits of weak and strong couplings to environmental degrees of freedom. Thus, PQME serves as an efficient method to describe charge and exciton transfer/transport dynamics for a broad range of parameters in condensed or complex environments. However, in some cases, the polaron transformation (PT) being employed in the formulation invokes an over-relaxation of slow modes and results in premature suppression of important coherence terms. A formal framework to address this issue is developed in the present work by employing a partial PT that has smaller weights for low frequency bath modes. It is shown here that a closed form expression of a 2nd order time-local PQME including all the inhomogeneous terms can be derived for a general form of partial PT, although more complicated than that for the full PT. All the expressions needed for numerical calculation are derived in detail. Applications to a model of two-level system coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators, with test calculations focused on those due to homogeneous relaxation terms, demonstrate the feasibility and the utility of the present approach.</description>

      <title>Forward-backward stochastic simulations: Q-based model for measurement and Bell-nonlocality consistent with weak local realistic premises</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.06070v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how measurement and nonlocality can be explained consistently with macroscopic realism and no-signaling, and causal relations for macroscopic quantities. Considering measurement of a field amplitude $\hat{x}$, we derive theorems that lead to an equivalence between a quantum phase-space probability distribution Q(x,p,t) and stochastic trajectories for real amplitudes x and p propagating backwards and forwards in time, respectively. We present forward-backward stochastic simulations that motivate a Q-based model of reality. Amplification plays a key role in measurement. With amplification, contributions due to interference become unobservable, leading to branches that correspond to distinct eigenvalues. This elucidates how the system evolves from a superposition to an eigenstate, from which Born's rule follows. We deduce a hybrid causal structure involving causal deterministic relations for amplified variables, along with microscopic noise inputs and hidden loops for unobservable quantities. Causal consistency is confirmed. The simulations allow evaluation of a state inferred for the system, conditioned on a particular branch, from which we deduce a model for projection and collapse of the wave function. The theory is extended to Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen and Bell nonlocality. We demonstrate consistency with three weak local realistic premises: the existence of real properties (defined after operations that fix measurement settings); a partial locality implying no-signaling; elements of reality that apply to the predictions of a system by a meter, once meter-settings are fixed. A mechanism for non-locality is identified. Our work shows how forward-backward stochastic simulations lead to a hybrid causal structure, involving both deterministic causal relations and hidden stochastic loops, explaining measurement and entanglement, with paradoxes associated with retrocausality avoided.</description>

Abstract: Many protocols and tasks in quantum information science rely inherently on the fundamental notion of contextuality to provide advantages over their classical counterparts, and contextuality represents one of the main differences between quantum and classical physics. In this work we present a witness for preparation contextuality inspired by optimal two-state discrimination. The main idea is based on finding the accessible averaged success and error probabilities in both classical and quantum models. We can then construct a noncontextuality inequality and associated witness which we find to be robust against depolarising noise and loss in the form of inconclusive events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnus expansion (ME) provides a general way to expand the real-time propagator of a time-dependent Hamiltonian within the exponential such that the unitarity is satisfied at any order. We use this property and explicit integration of Lagrange interpolation formulas for the time-dependent Hamiltonian within each time interval and derive approximations that preserve unitarity for the differential time evolution operators of general time-dependent Hamiltonians. The resulting second-order approximation is the same as using the average of Hamiltonians for two end points of time. We identify three fourth-order approximations involving commutators of Hamiltonians at different times and also derive a sixth-order expression. A test of these approximations along with other available expressions for a two-state time-dependent Hamiltonian with sinusoidal time dependences provides information on the relative performance of these approximations and suggests that the derived expressions can serve as useful numerical tools for time evolution in time-resolved spectroscopy, quantum control, quantum sensing, real-time ab initio quantum dynamics, and open system quantum dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Expander graphs are fundamental in both computer science and mathematics, with a wide array of applications. With quantum technology reshaping our world, quantum expanders have emerged, finding numerous uses in quantum information theory, quantum complexity, and noncommutative pseudorandomness. The classical expander mixing lemma plays a central role in graph theory, offering essential insights into edge distribution within graphs and aiding in the analysis of diverse network properties and algorithms. This paper establishes the quantum analogue of the classical expander mixing lemma and its structural converse for quantum expanders.</description>

      <title>Fermi's golden rule rate expression for transitions due to nonadiabatic derivative couplings in the adiabatic basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from a general molecular Hamiltonian expressed in the basis of adiabatic electronic and nuclear position states, where a compact and complete expression for nonadiabatic derivative coupling (NDC) Hamiltonian term is obtained, we provide a general analysis of the Fermi's golden rule (FGR) rate expression for nonadiabatic transitions between adiabatic states. We then consider a quasi-adiabatic approximation that uses crude adiabatic states evaluated at the minimum potential energy configuration of the initial adiabatic state as the basis for the zeroth order adiabatic and NDC coupling terms of the Hamiltonian. Although application of this approximation is rather limited, it allows deriving a general FGR rate expression without further approximation and still accounts for non-Condon effect arising from momentum operators of NDC terms and its coupling with vibronic displacements. For a generic and widely used model where all nuclear degrees of freedom and environmental effects are represented as linearly coupled harmonic oscillators, we derive a closed form FGR rate expression that requires only Fourier transform. The resulting rate expression includes quadratic contributions of NDC terms and their couplings to Franck-Condon modes, which require evaluation of two additional bath spectral densities in addition to conventional one that appears in a typical FGR rate theory based on the Condon approximation. Model calculations for the case where nuclear vibrations consist of both a sharp high frequency mode and an Ohmic bath spectral density illustrate new features and implications of the rate expression. We then apply our theoretical expression to the nonradiative decay from the first excited singlet state of azulene, which illustrates the utility and implications of our theoretical results.</description>

Abstract: The two-state vector formalism of quantum mechanics is a time-symmetrized approach to standard quantum theory. In our work, we aim to establish rigorous foundations for the future investigation within this formalism. We introduce the concept of a story - a compatible pair consisting of a two-state vector and an ideal measurement. Using this concept, we examine the structure of the space comprising all two-state vectors. We analyze the problem of distinguishability and confirm that some pairs of two-state vectors or their statistical mixtures cannot be physically distinguished. In particular, we discuss an example of a two-state vector that is indistinguishable from a statistical mixture of separable two-state vectors and provide an example of a two-state vector that can be distinguished from every such mixture. This leads us to formulate the definition of a strictly non-separable two-state vector as a genuine manifestation of entanglement between the past and the future.</description>

Abstract: Quantum illumination is a protocol for detecting a low-reflectivity target by using two-mode entangled states composed of signal and idler modes, which can outperform unentangled states. We study multi-qudit states for single-shot detection limits of quantum illumination under white noise environment. Using three-qubit states, we obtain that the performance is enhanced by the entanglement between signal and idler qubits, whereas it is degraded by the entanglement between signal qubits. The similar behaviors are also observed for three-qutrit, four-qubit, and four-ququart states. In particular, the optimal state is not a maximally entangled multipartite state but a combination of a maximally entangled bipartite state. Moreover, we show that quantum correlation can explain the quantum advantage of three-qubit, three-qutrit, and four-qubit states, with exception of a four-ququart state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14034v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum measurements performed on a subsystem of a quantum many-body state can generate entanglement for its remaining constituents. The whole system including the measurement record is described by a hybrid mixed state, which can exhibit exotic phase transitions and critical phenomena. We demonstrate that generic measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs) can be cast as decoherence-induced critical mixed states in one higher dimension, by constructing a projected entangled pair state (PEPS) prior to decoherence or measurement. In this context, a deeper conceptual understanding of such mixed-state criticality is called for, particularly with regard to algebraic symmetry as an advanced organizing principle for such entangled states of matter. Integrating these connections we investigate the role of self-dual symmetry -- a fundamental notion in theoretical physics -- in mixed states, showing that the decoherence of electric (e) and magnetic (m) vortices from the 2D bulk of the toric code, or equivalently, a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the N-&gt;1 limit of the 2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class D with target space SO(2N)/U(N) at $\Theta$-angle $\pi$, and represents a "measurement-version" of the Cho-Fisher network model subjected to Born-rule randomness...</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13388v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel mathematical framework for universal digital quantum computation using algebraic probability theory. We rigorously define quantum circuits as finite sequences of elementary quantum gates and establish their role in implementing unitary transformations. A key result demonstrates that every unitary matrix in \(\mathrm{U}(N)\) can be expressed as a product of elementary quantum gates, leading to the concept of a universal dictionary for quantum computation. We apply this framework to the construction of quantum circuits that encode probability distributions, focusing on the Grover-Rudolph algorithm. By leveraging controlled quantum gates and rotation matrices, we design a quantum circuit that approximates a given probability density function. Numerical simulations, conducted using Qiskit, confirm the theoretical predictions and validate the effectiveness of our approach. These results provide a rigorous foundation for quantum circuit synthesis within an algebraic probability framework and offer new insights into the encoding of probability distributions in quantum algorithms. Potential applications include quantum machine learning, circuit optimization, and experimental implementations on real quantum hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The GKP encoding is a top contender among bosonic codes for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Analysis of the GKP code is complicated by the fact that finite-energy code states leak out of the ideal GKP code space and are not orthogonal. We analyze a variant of the GKP stabilizer measurement circuit using damped, approximate GKP states that virtually project onto the ideal GKP code space between rounds of error correction even when finite-energy GKP states are used. This allows us to identify logical maps between projectors; however, due to finite-energy effects, these maps fail to resolve completely positive, trace-preserving channels on the logical code space. We present two solutions to this problem based on channel twirling the damping operator. The first twirls over the full stabilizer group motivated by standard binning (SB) decoding that converts small amounts of damping into Gaussian random noise. The second twirls over a set of representative Pauli shifts that keeps the energy in the code finite and allow for arbitrary decoding. This approach is not limited to small damping, can be applied when logical GKP unitaries or other sources of CV noise are present, and allows us to study general decoding, which can be optimized to the noise in the circuit. Focusing on damping, we compare decoding strategies tailored to different levels of effective squeezing. While our results indicate that SB decoding is suboptimal for finite-energy GKP states, the advantage of optimized decoding over SB decoding shrinks as the energy in the code increases, and moreover the performance of both strategies converges to that of the stabilizer-twirled logical channel. These studies provide stronger arguments for commonplace procedures in the analysis of GKP error correction:(i) using stochastically shifted GKP states in place of coherently damped ones, and(ii) the use of SB decoding.</description>

      <title>Classical Estimation of the Free Energy and Quantum Gibbs Sampling from the Markov Entropy Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the Markov Entropy Decomposition, a classical convex relaxation algorithm introduced by Poulin and Hastings to approximate the free energy in quantum spin lattices. We identify a sufficient condition for its convergence, namely the decay of the effective interaction. The effective interaction, also known as Hamiltonians of mean force, is a widely established correlation measure, and we show our decay condition in 1D at any temperature as well as in the high-temperature regime under a certain commutativity condition on the Hamiltonian building on existing results. This yields polynomial and quasi-polynomial time approximation algorithms in these settings, respectively. Furthermore, the decay of the effective interaction implies the decay of the conditional mutual information for the Gibbs state of the system. We then use this fact to devise a rounding scheme that maps the solution of the convex relaxation to a global state and show that the scheme can be efficiently implemented on a quantum computer, thus proving efficiency of quantum Gibbs sampling under our assumption of decay of the effective interaction.</description>

      <title>Adversarial quantum channel discrimination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework for quantum channel discrimination in an adversarial setting, where the tester plays against an adversary. We show that in asymmetric hypothesis testing, the optimal type-II error exponent is precisely characterized by a new notion of quantum channel divergence (termed the minimum output channel divergence). This serves as a direct analog of the quantum Stein's lemma in this new framework, and complements previous studies on ``best-case'' channel discrimination, thereby providing a complete understanding of the ultimate limits of quantum channel discrimination. Notably, the optimal error exponent can be achieved by simple non-adaptive adversarial strategies, and despite the need for regularization, it remains efficiently computable and satisfies the strong converse property in general. Furthermore, we show that entropy accumulation, a powerful tool in quantum cryptography, can be reframed as an adversarial channel discrimination problem, establishing a new connection between quantum information theory and quantum cryptography.</description>

      <title>Ultracoherent superconducting cavity-based multiqudit platform with error-resilient control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities offer a promising platform for quantum computing due to their long coherence times, yet integrating nonlinear elements like transmons for control often introduces additional loss. We report a multimode quantum system based on a 2-cell elliptical shaped SRF cavity, comprising two cavity modes weakly coupled to an ancillary transmon circuit, designed to preserve coherence while enabling efficient control of the cavity modes. We mitigate the detrimental effects of the transmon decoherence through careful design optimization that reduces transmon-cavity couplings and participation in the dielectric substrate and lossy interfaces, to achieve single-photon lifetimes of 20.6 ms and 15.6 ms for the two modes, and a pure dephasing time exceeding 40 ms. This marks an order-of-magnitude improvement over prior 3D multimode memories. Leveraging sideband interactions and novel error-resilient protocols, including measurement-based correction and post-selection, we achieve high-fidelity control over quantum states. This enables the preparation of Fock states up to $N = 20$ with fidelities exceeding 95%, the highest reported to date to the authors' knowledge, as well as two-mode entanglement with an estimated coherence-limited fidelities of 99.9% after post-selection. These results establish our platform as a robust foundation for quantum information processing, allowing for future extensions to high-dimensional qudit encodings.</description>

      <title>Local-available quantum correlation swapping in one-parameter X states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although introduced for entanglement, quantum repeaters and swapping protocols have been analyzed for other quantum correlations (QC), such as quantum discord. In 2015, Mundarain and Ladr\'on de Guevara [Quantum Inf. Process. 14, 4493 (2015)] introduced local-available quantum correlations (LAQC), which are a promising yet understudied quantum correlation. Recently, Bellorin et al. [Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 36, 22500990 (2022), Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 36, 2250154 (2022)] obtained exact analytical results for the LAQC quantifier of general 2-qubit X states. Building up from those results, we analyzed the LAQC swapping for 2-qubit X states. As expected, we find that if the initial states are non-classical and the one used for the projective measurement is entangled, the final state will generally have non-zero LAQC. Using the properties of this quantum correlation, we establish the conditions for a QCS scheme that leads to a final state with a non-zero LAQC measure. We illustrate these results by analyzing five families of one-parameter 2-qubit X states, including families where the projective measure leads to a separable state, but whose LAQC measure is non-zero. This feature opens the possibility for this quantum correlation to be considered a genuine resource in quantum information technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Absolutely maximally entangled (AME) pure states of a system composed of $N$ parties are distinguished by the property that for any splitting at least one partial trace is maximally mixed. Due to maximal possible correlations between any two selected subsystems these states have numerous applications in various fields of quantum information processing including multi-user teleportation, quantum error correction and secret sharing. We present an updated survey of various techniques to generate such strongly entangled states, including those going beyond the standard construction of graph and stabilizer states. Our contribution includes, in particular, analysis of the degree of entanglement of reduced states obtained by partial trace of AME projectors, states obtained by a symmetric superposition of GHZ states, an orthogonal frequency square representation of the "golden" AME state and an updated summary of the number of local unitary equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>Logical Error Rates for the Surface Code Under a Mixed Coherent and Stochastic Circuit-Level Noise Model Inspired by Trapped Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) on the horizon, it is critical to understand sources of logical error in plausible hardware implementations of quantum error-correcting codes (QECC). In this work, we consider logical error rates for the surface code implemented on a hypothetical grid-based trapped-ion quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) architecture. Specifically, we construct logical channels for the idling surface code and examine its diamond error under a mixed coherent and stochastic circuit-level noise model inspired by trapped ions. We include the coherent dephasing noise that is known to accumulate during physical qubit idling and transport in these systems, determining idling and transport durations using the time-resolved output of the trapped-ion surface code compiler (TISCC). To estimate expectation values of logical Pauli observables following hardware circuits containing non-Clifford sources of noise, we utilize a Monte Carlo technique to sample from an underlying quasi-probability distribution of Clifford circuits that we independently simulate in a phase-sensitive fashion. We verify error suppression up to code distance $d=11$ at coherent dephasing rates near and below those of current-generation trapped-ion quantum computers and find that logical error rates align with those of analogous fully stochastic simulations in this regime. Exploring higher dephasing rates at $d=3-5$, we find evidence for growing coherent rotations about all three logical Pauli axes, increased diagonal logical error process matrix elements relative to those of stochastic simulations, and a reduced dephasing rate threshold. Overall, our work paves a way toward realistic hardware emulation of small fault-tolerant quantum processes, e.g., members of a FTQC instruction set.</description>

Abstract: Understanding how quantum materials return to equilibrium after being driven into excited states is a fundamental problem in condensed matter physics. A prototypical material, 1T-TaS$_2$, exhibits complex electronic textures made up of domain walls, which slowly reorganize into a more uniform structure as the system relaxes. At low temperatures, this process becomes dominated by quantum rather than thermal effects. In this work, we use large-scale noise-driven quantum simulations-spanning more than 2000 qubits-to study this relaxation process through an effective model known as the transverse-field Ising model in a longitudinal field. By mathematically transforming this model into a simpler form, we identify the basic microscopic steps involved: rather than moving collectively, the domain walls evolve through a sequence of noise-driven single-particle tunneling events. A detailed analysis of how the relaxation rate depends on temperature and model parameters confirms this picture. Our findings show that quantum simulation can provide rare, predictive insight into the inner workings of real quantum materials, and establish a practical pathway for studying complex non-equilibrium processes using current-generation quantum hardware.</description>

Abstract: We show that a simple model of non-Hermitian noise gives rise to the telegraph switching behavior seen in experiments with single qubits, without any reference to the existence of photons as corpuscles. This lends support to a continuous collapse interpretation of quantum mechanics, but can also be viewed as a model of continuous detection of a steady-state process in the incoherent limit. We show explicitly that such a system obeys the Born rule for particle counting statistics, even though no particle behavior has been invoked at any point in the calculation.</description>

      <title>Empty-Signal Detection and the Principle-Level Feasibility of Arbitrarily Long-Distance Repeaterless Quantum Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Practical repeaterless quantum communication (PRQC) is fundamentally constrained by the divergence of the quantum bit error rate (QBER) arising from the interplay between channel loss and single-photon detector (SPD) dark counts. As the channel transmission rate decays exponentially with distance, vacuum-induced dark counts inevitably dominate detection events beyond a finite range, driving the QBER toward 50\% and rendering PRQC infeasible. Here, a theoretical framework termed empty-signal detection (ESD) is established to address this long-standing limitation at the level of principle. By encoding particle-existence information (PEI) onto an auxiliary degree of freedom (DOF) and employing controlled operations together with multi-copy analysis, the ESD paradigm enables vacuum-induced detection events to be identified and filtered without disturbing the encoded quantum information. Consequently, the non-empty signal rate (NESR) of the accepted signals can be stabilized at a distance-independent level under physically reasonable conditions, thereby suppressing the fundamental QBER within the secure bounds of PRQC, irrespective of channel attenuation. As a result, PRQC can, in principle, remain feasible over arbitrarily long distances, with the fundamental limitation shifting from distance-dependent QBER divergence to resource-dependent efficiency trade-offs. By providing a rigorous theoretical resolution of the fundamental QBER-induced distance limitation, this work clarifies the principle-level scalability of PRQC. Furthermore, the vacuum-filtering framework developed here may also be of interest in a broader class of loss-sensitive or detection-based quantum tasks.</description>

      <title>Multipartite quantum entanglement in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric molecular optomechanics: Nonreciprocal enhancement and thermal resilience to \SI{500}{\kelvin}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric double-cavity molecular optomechanical system demonstrating nonreciprocal enhancement of multipartite quantum entanglement at elevated temperatures. All bipartite entanglement channels ($E_{ac}$, $E_{aB_1}$, $E_{cB_2}$, $E_{B_1B_2}$) simultaneously maximize at optimal nonreciprocal asymmetry $J_1/J_2 \approx 5$, with entanglement persisting to $T \sim \SIrange{400}{500}{\kelvin}$ (material-limited ceiling) two orders of magnitude beyond conventional optomechanical systems. This thermal resilience and balanced enhancement across all channels arise from synergistic combination of ultra-high-frequency molecular vibrations ($\omega_m/2\pi = \SI{30}{\tera\hertz}$), collective $\sqrt{N}$ coupling enhancement with $N=\num{e6}$ molecules, and directional nonreciprocal coupling shielding entanglement-generating interactions from backaction noise. Unlike optical parametric amplifier schemes where vibration-vibration enhancement suppresses optical-vibration correlations, our $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric architecture circumvents this fundamental trade-off, validated through rigorous stability analysis via Routh-Hurwitz criterion.</description>

      <title>Navigating entanglement via Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida exchange: Snake, bouncing, boundary-residing, pulse, and damping-stabilized time-frozen trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement dynamics are fundamental to quantum technologies, yet navigating their temporal profiles (trajectories) remains challenging. Here, we propose a scalable solid-state platform based on RKKY exchange, where two spin qubits couple to a central spin qudit that oscillatorily spin-polarizes the surrounding conduction electrons. We introduce the exchange-time integral (ETI), which maps the spatial motion of the qubits to a time-dependent exchange interaction and serves as an effective "trajectory clock" governing the system evolution. We focus specifically on entanglement trajectories initially near the entanglement-unentanglement boundary, with the distance to this boundary quantified by concurrence extended to include negative values. By alternating the sign changes of the exchange, implemented through vibrational motion of qubits, the ETI enables programmable entanglement trajectories. For in-phase and antiphase vibrations, including scenarios with controlled stopping at the RKKY exchange-free nodes, we identify distinctive trajectories: snake (repeatedly crossing the boundary), bouncing (immediately reversing upon reaching the boundary), boundary-residing (remaining at the transition point), and pulse (controllable entanglement intervals). The vibration phase creates asymmetric shifts to the trajectories. The proposed device offers built-in error correction against dephasing by utilizing both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regimes. Out-of-phase vibrations drive trajectories away from the boundary, accessing larger entanglement values but with irregular/unsteady final states. To stabilize these trajectories, we introduce a damping mechanism. Our framework offers a systematic method for navigating and engineering entanglement dynamics in quantum systems, with potential applications in quantum computation, cryptography, and metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22753v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The usual position-momentum commutation relation plays a fundamental role in the mathematical description of continuous-variable quantum systems. In the case of a qudit described by a Hilbert space of a high enough dimension, there exists a discrete version of the position-momentum commutation relation approximately satisfied by a large part of the pure quantum states. Our purpose is to explore in more details the set of these states. We show that it contains a family of discrete-variable Gaussian states depending on a continuous parameter and certain discrete coherent states. It also contains various discrete-variable versions of the Hermite-Gauss states, defined either as eigenstates of certain discrete versions of the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian or generated by using a discrete version of the creation or annihilation operator. As a direct consequence, a discrete version of the incertitude relation is satisfied by the considered quantum states.</description>

      <title>Barnett Effect-Induced Nonreciprocal Entanglement and Gaussian interferometric power in Magnomechanics with Optical Parametric Amplifier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonreciprocity is a powerful tool in quantum technologies. It allows signals to be sent in one direction but not the other. In this article, we propose a method for achieving non-reciprocal entanglement and Gaussian interferometric power (GIP) via the Barnett effect. The YIG is coupled to a microwave cavity that interacts with an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). Due to the Barnett effect, giant nonreciprocal entanglement can emerge. By fine-tuning the cavity detuning, the GIP can exhibits nonreciprocal behavior. All entanglements with ideal nonreciprocity can be achieved by tuning the photon frequency detuning, appropriately choosing the cavity-magnon coupling regime, the nonlinear gain, and the phase shift of the OPA. Interestingly, the amount of entanglement nonreciprocity and its resilience to thermal occupation are remarkably enhanced by increasing the gain of the OPA. This nonreciprocity can be significantly enhanced even at relatively high temperatures. Our research offers a pathway for the realization of nonreciprocal single-phonon devices, with potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum communication. This proposed scheme could pave the way for the development of novel nonreciprocal devices that remain robust under thermal fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: In classical mechanics, driven systems with dissipation often exhibit complex, fractal dynamics known as strange attractors. This paper addresses the fundamental question of how such structures manifest in the quantum realm. We investigate the quantum Duffing oscillator, a paradigmatic chaotic system, using the Caldirola-Kanai (CK) framework, where dissipation is integrated directly into a time-dependent Hamiltonian. By employing the Husimi distribution to represent the quantum state in phase space, we present the first visualization of a quantum strange attractor within this model. Our simulations demonstrate how an initially simple Gaussian wave packet is stretched, folded, and sculpted by the interplay of chaotic dynamics and energy loss, causing it to localize onto a structure that beautifully mirrors the classical attractor. This quantum "photograph" is inherently smoothed, blurring the infinitely fine fractal details of its classical counterpart as a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle. We supplement this analysis by examining the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), which shows that stronger dissipation clarifies the exponential growth associated with the classical Lyapunov exponent, thereby confirming the model's semiclassical behavior. This work offers a compelling geometric perspective on open chaotic quantum systems and sheds new light on the quantum-classical transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Erasure qubits -- qubits designed to have an error profile that is dominated by detectable leakage errors -- are a promising way to cut down the resources needed for quantum error correction. There have been several recent experiments demonstrating erasure qubits in superconducting quantum processors, most notably the dual-rail qubit defined by the one-photon subspace of two coupled cavities. An outstanding challenge is that the ancillary transmons needed to facilitate erasure checks and two-qubit gates introduce a substantial amount of noise, limiting the benefits of working with erasure-biased qubits. Here, we show how to suppress the adverse effects of transmon-induced noise while performing erasure checks or two-qubit gates. We present control schemes for these operations that suppress erasure check errors by two orders of magnitude and reduce the logical two-qubit gate infidelities by up to three orders of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks is a novel multilayer neuromorphic network that can exhibit higher accuracy than a neural network. It can learn and predict more accurately than neural networks with a smaller number of parameters, and many research groups worldwide have adopted it. As a result, many types of applications have been proposed. This network can be used as a generator solely or with a Generative Adversarial Network; however, KAN has a slower speed of learning than neural networks for the number of parameters. Hence,it has not been researched as a generator. Therefore, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network called Generative Adversarial Variational Quantum KAN that uses Variational Quantum KAN as a generator. This method enables efficient learning with significantly fewer parameters by leveraging the computational advantages of quantum circuits and their output distributions. We performed the training and generation task on MNIST and CIFAR10, and revealed that our method can achieve higher accuracy than neural networks and Quantum Generative Adversarial Network with less data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate crystalline-like behavior of the spectral form factor (SFF) in unitary quantum systems with extremely strong eigenvalue repulsion. Using a low-temperature Coulomb gas as a model of repulsive eigenvalues, we derive the Debye-Waller factor suppressing periodic oscillations of the SFF and estimate the order of its singularities at multiples of the Heisenberg time. We also reproduce this crystalline-like behavior using perturbed permutation circuits and random matrix ensembles associated with Lax matrices. Our results lay a foundation for future studies of quantum systems that exhibit intermediate level statistics between standard random matrix ensembles and permutation circuits.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e Duality and Multiplicative Structures on Quantum Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum LDPC codes have attracted intense interest due to their advantageous properties for realizing efficient fault-tolerant quantum computing. In particular, sheaf codes represent a novel framework that encompasses all well-known good qLDPC codes with profound underlying mathematics. In this work, we generalize Poincar\'e duality from manifolds to both classical and quantum codes defined via sheaf theory on $t$-dimensional cell complexes. Viewing important code properties including the encoding rate, code distance, local testability soundness, and efficient decoders as parameters of the underlying (co)chain complexes, we rigorously prove a duality relationship between the $i$-th chain and the $(t-i)$-th cochain of sheaf codes.
  We further build multiplicative structures such as cup and cap products on sheaved chain complexes, inspired by the standard notions of multiplicative structures and Poincar\'e duality on manifolds. This immediately leads to an explicit isomorphism between (co)homology groups of sheaf codes via a cap product. As an application, we obtain transversal disjoint logical $\mathrm{C}Z$ gates with $k_{\mathrm{C}Z}=\Theta(n)$ on families of good qLDPC and almost-good quantum locally testable codes. Moreover, we provide multiple new methods to construct transversal circuits composed of $\mathrm{C}\mathrm{C}Z$ gates as well as for higher order controlled-$Z$ that are provably logical operations on the code space. We conjecture that they generate nontrivial logical actions, pointing towards fault-tolerant non-Clifford gates on nearly optimal qLDPC sheaf codes. Mathematically, our results are built on establishing the equivalence between sheaf cohomology in the derived-functor sense, \v{C}ech cohomology, and the cohomology of sheaf codes, thereby introducing new mathematical tools into quantum coding theory.</description>

      <title>Applying Grover-mixer Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz Algorithm to High-order Unconstrained Binary Optimization Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is among leading candidates for achieving quantum advantage on near-term processors. While typically implemented with a transverse-field mixer (XM-QAOA), the Grover-mixer variant (GM-QAOA) offers a compelling alternative due to its global search capabilities. This work investigates the application of GM-QAOA to Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) problems, also known as Polynomial Unconstrained Binary Optimization (PUBO), which constitute a generalized class of combinatorial optimization tasks characterized by intrinsically multi-variable interactions. We present a comprehensive numerical study demonstrating that GM-QAOA, unlike XM-QAOA, exhibits monotonic performance improvement with circuit depth and achieves superior results for HUBO problems. An important component of our approach is an analytical framework for modeling GM-QAOA dynamics, which enables a classical approximation of the optimal parameters and helps reduce the optimization overhead. Our resource-efficient parameterized GM-QAOA nearly matches the performance of the fully optimized algorithm while being far less demanding, establishing it as a highly effective approach for complex optimization tasks. These findings highlight GM-QAOA's potential and provide a practical pathway for its implementation on current quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>LogosQ: A High-Performance and Type-Safe Quantum Computing Library in Rust</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing robust and high performance quantum software is challenging due to the dynamic nature of existing Python-based frameworks, which often suffer from runtime errors and scalability bottlenecks. In this work, we present LogosQ, a high performance backend agnostic quantum computing library implemented in Rust that enforces correctness through compile time type safety. Unlike existing tools, LogosQ leverages Rust static analysis to eliminate entire classes of runtime errors, particularly in parameter-shift rule gradient computations for variational algorithms. We introduce novel optimization techniques, including direct state-vector manipulation, adaptive parallel processing, and an FFT optimized Quantum Fourier Transform, which collectively deliver speedups of up to 900 times for state preparation (QFT) and 2 to 5 times for variational workloads over Python frameworks (PennyLane, Qiskit), 6 to 22 times over Julia implementations (Yao), and competitive performance with Q sharp. Beyond performance, we validate numerical stability through variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) experiments on molecular hydrogen and XYZ Heisenberg models, achieving chemical accuracy even in edge cases where other libraries fail. By combining the safety of systems programming with advanced circuit optimization, LogosQ establishes a new standard for reliable and efficient quantum simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.06460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of an exciton as a quasiparticle that represents collective excited states was originally adapted from solid-state physics and has been successfully applied to molecular aggregates by relying on the well-established limits of the Wannier exciton and the Frenkel exciton. However, the study of excitons in more complex chemical systems and solid materials over the past two decades has made it clear that simple concepts based on Wannier or Frenkel excitons are not sufficient to describe detailed excitonic behavior, especially in nano-structured solid materials, multichromophoric macromolecules, and complex molecular aggregates. In addition, important effects such as vibronic coupling, the influence of charge-transfer (CT) components, spin-state interconversion, and electronic correlation, which had long been studied but not fully understood, have turned out to play a central role in many systems. This has motivated new experimental approaches and theoretical studies of increasing sophistication. This article provides an overview of works addressing these issues that were published for A Special Topic of the Journal of Chemical Physics on "Excitons: Energetics and spatio-temporal dynamics" and discusses their implications.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic derivative couplings through multiple Franck-Condon modes dictate the energy gap law for near and short-wave infrared dye molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Near infrared (NIR, 700 - 1,000 nm) and short-wave infrared (SWIR, 1,000 - 2,000 nm) dye molecules exhibit significant nonradiative decay rates from the first singlet excited state to the ground state. While these trends can be empirically explained by a simple energy gap law, detailed mechanisms of the nearly universal behavior have remained unsettled for many cases. Theoretical and experimental results for two representative NIR/SWIR dye molecules reported here clarify the key mechanism for the observed energy gap law behavior. It is shown that the first derivative nonadiabatic coupling terms serve as major coupling pathways for nonadiabatic decay processes from the first excited singlet state to the ground state for these NIR and SWIR dye molecules and that vibrational modes other than the highest frequency ones also make significant contributions to the rate. This assessment is corroborated by further theoretical comparison with possible alternative mechanisms of intersystem crossing to triplet states and also by comparison with experimental data for deuterated molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we establish a connection between timelike and spacelike entanglement entropy. We show that timelike entanglement entropy is closely related to spacelike entanglement entropy and its temporal derivative. For a broad class of states, it can be uniquely determined by a linear combination of spacelike entanglement entropy and its first-order temporal derivative. This relation holds, for instance, in states conformally equivalent to the vacuum in two-dimensional conformal field theories. For more general states, we demonstrate that the relation can be constructed perturbatively. Our results suggest that timelike entanglement entropy is constrained by causality. Moreover, this relation provides a unified framework for timelike and spacelike entanglement entropy, within which the imaginary component of timelike entanglement entropy can be understood as arising from the non-commutativity between the twist operator and its first-order temporal derivative.</description>

      <title>Circular Dichroism on the Edge of Quantum Hall Systems: From Many-Body Chern Number to Anisotropy Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Hall states are characterized by a topological invariant, the many-body Chern number, which determines their quantized Hall conductivity. This invariant also emerges in circular dichroic responses, namely, by applying a circular drive and comparing excitation rates for opposite orientations. This work explores the dichroic response of confined, isolated quantum Hall systems, where bulk and edge contributions cancel exactly:~When the edge response is properly isolated, the circular dichroic signal becomes quantized, serving as a direct and elegant probe of the many-body Chern number encoded in the edge physics. We demonstrate that this quantized edge response is entirely captured by low-energy chiral edge modes, allowing for a universal description of this effect based on Wen's edge theory. Its low-energy nature implies that the quantized edge response can be distinguished from the bulk response in the frequency domain. The edge response is also shown to be a sensitive diagnostic of geometric features. This opens the possibility of characterizing the shape of quantum Hall droplets through edge spectroscopic measurements, without requiring knowledge of the system's boundary profile. We illustrate our findings using realistic models of integer and fractional Chern insulators, with different edge geometries, and propose detection schemes suitable for ultracold atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16590v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable codes are designed for avoiding loss of information in large scale distributed and cloud storage systems. We introduce the quantum counterpart of those codes by defining quantum $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable codes which are quantum error-correcting codes capable of correcting $\delta -1$ qudit erasures from sets of at most $r+ \delta -1$ qudits.
  We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a quantum stabilizer code $Q(C)$ to be $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable. Our condition depends only on the puncturing and shortening at suitable sets of both the symplectic self-orthogonal code $C$ used for constructing $Q(C)$ and its symplectic dual $C^{\perp_s}$. When $Q(C)$ comes from a Hermitian or Euclidean dual-containing code, and under an extra condition, we show that there is an equivalence between the classical and quantum concepts of $(r,\delta)$-local recoverability. A Singleton-like bound is stated in this case and examples attaining the bound are given.</description>

Abstract: We find non-monotonic equilibrium energy distributions, qualitatively different from the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein forms, in strongly-interacting many-body chaotic systems. The effect emerges in systems with finite energy spectra, supporting both positive and negative temperatures, in the regime of quantum ergodicity. The results are supported by exact diagonalization calculations for chaotic Fermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models, when they have Wigner-Dyson statistics of energy spectra and demonstrate eigenstate thermalization. The proposed effects may be observed in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Elimination of angular dependency in quantum three-body problem made easy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a systematic account of elimination of angular dependency from nonrelativistic Schr\"odinger equation for a three-body quantum system with arbitrary masses, charges, angular momentum, and parity. The resulting reduced Schr\"odinger equation (RSE) for the reduced wave components, corresponding to the basis of solid bipolar harmonics, is presented in a compact matrix operator form. The variational form of RSE, providing a practical tool for calculating energy levels and wave functions, is also derived. The resulting angular integrals were derived by expanding bipolar harmonics in a basis of parity-adapted Wigner functions. The theoretical results are numerically validated by computing accurate energy levels for selected states of the helium atom in the explicitly correlated Hylleraas-type basis. The work aims to serve as a self-contained reference for the previously scattered throughout the scientific literature formulation of RSE, offering a convenient foundation for further analytical studies of three-particle quantum systems with arbitrary angular momentum and parity.</description>

Abstract: Spectral degeneracies, including diabolic (DP) and exceptional (EP) points, exhibit unique sensitivity to external perturbations, enabling powerful control and engineering of wave phenomena. We present a residue-based perturbation theory that quantifies complex resonance splitting of DP and EP type spectral degeneracies using generalized Wigner-Smith operators. We validate our theory using both analytic Hamiltonian models and numerical electromagnetic simulations, demonstrating excellent agreement across a range of cases. Our approach accurately predicts degenerate resonance splitting using only scattering data, offering a powerful framework for precision tuning, inverse design, and practical exploitation of non-Hermitian phenomena.</description>

      <title>Time-diffracting 2D wave vortices</title>

Abstract: Wave vortices constitute a large family of wave entities, closely related to phase singularities and orbital angular momentum (OAM). So far, two main classes of localized wave vortices have been explored: (i) transversely-localized monochromatic vortex beams that carry well-defined longitudinal OAM and propagate/diffract along the longitudinal $z$-axis in space, and (ii) 2D-localized spatiotemporal vortex pulses that carry the more elusive transverse (or tilted) OAM and propagate/diffract along both the $z$-axis and time. Here we introduce another class of wave vortices which are localized in a 2D $(x,y)$ plane, do not propagate in space (apart from uniform radial deformations), and instead propagate/diffract solely along time. These vortices possess well-defined transverse OAM and can naturally appear in 2D wave systems, such as surface polaritons or water waves. We provide a general integral expression for time-diffracting 2D wave vortices, their underlying ray model, and examples of approximate and exact wave solutions. We also analyze the temporal Gouy phase closely related to the rotational evolution in such vortices. Finally, we show that time-diffracting 2D vortices can provide strong spatiotemporal concentration of energy and OAM at sub-wavelength and oscillation-period scales.</description>

      <title>Long-lived giant circular Rydberg atoms at room temperature</title>

Abstract: Stability achieved by large angular momentum is ubiquitous in nature, with examples ranging from classical mechanics, over optics and chemistry, to nuclear physics. In atoms, angular momentum can protect excited electronic orbitals from decay due to selection rules. This manifests spectacularly in highly excited Rydberg states. Low angular momentum Rydberg states are at the heart of recent breakthroughs in quantum computing, simulation and sensing with neutral atoms. For these applications the lifetime of the Rydberg levels sets fundamental limits for gate fidelities, coherence times, or spectroscopic precision. The quest for longer Rydberg state lifetimes has motivated the generation, coherent control and trapping of circular Rydberg atoms, which are characterized by the maximally allowed electron orbital momentum and were key to Nobel prize-winning experiments with single atoms and photons. Here, we report the observation of individually trapped circular Rydberg atoms with lifetimes of more than 10 milliseconds, two orders of magnitude longer-lived than the established low angular momentum orbitals. This is achieved via Purcell suppression of blackbody modes at room temperature. We coherently control individual circular Rydberg levels at so far elusive principal quantum numbers of up to $n=103$, and observe tweezer trapping of the Rydberg atoms on the few hundred millisecond scale. Our results pave the way for quantum information processing and sensing utilizing the combination of extreme lifetimes and giant Rydberg blockade.</description>

      <title>Coupled-wire construction of non-Abelian higher-order topological phases</title>

Abstract: Non-Abelian topological charges (NATCs), characterized by their noncommutative algebra, offer a framework for describing multigap topological phases beyond conventional Abelian invariants. While higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) host boundary states at corners or hinges, their characterization has largely relied on Abelian invariants such as winding and Chern numbers. Here, we propose a coupled-wire scheme of constructing non-Abelian HOTPs and analyze a non-Abelian second-order topological insulator as its minimal model. The resulting Hamiltonian supports hybridized corner modes, protected by parity-time-reversal plus sublattice symmetries and described by a topological vector that unites a non-Abelian quaternion charge with an Abelian winding number. Corner states emerge only when both invariants are nontrivial, whereas weak topological edge states of non-Abelian origins arise when the quaternion charge is nontrivial, enriching the bulk-edge-corner correspondence. The system further exhibits both non-Abelian and Abelian topological phase transitions, providing a unified platform that bridges these two distinct topological classes. Our work extends the understanding of HOTPs into non-Abelian regimes and suggests feasible experimental realizations in synthetic quantum systems, such as photonic or acoustic metamaterials.</description>
