      <title>Flat degenerate metrics and Riemannian foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bandyopadhyay, Dacorogna, Matveev and Troyanov conjectured that a closed manifold admitting a flat, non-negative definite metric of constant rank $m$ should be finitely covered by a fiber bundle over the $m$-torus. We give a counter-example to this statement and we discuss the link between this problem and the study of transversely flat Riemannian foliations.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Ordered Mean Curvature with Integrable Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the concept of nonlocal ordered curvature. In the classical (differential) setting, the problem was introduced by Nirenberg and Li, where they conjectured that if a bounded, smooth surface has its mean curvature ordered in a particular direction, then the surface must be symmetric with respect to some hyperplane orthogonal to that direction. The conjecture was proved by Li et al in 2022. Here we study the counterpart problem in the nonlocal setting, where the nonlocal mean curvature of a set $\Omega$, at any point $x$ on its boundary, is defined as $H_\Omega^J(x) = \int_{\Omega^c} J(x-y) dy - \int_\Omega J(x-y) dy$ and the kernel function $J$ is radially symmetric, non-increasing, integrable and compactly supported. Using a generalization of Alexandrov's moving plane method, we prove a similar result in the nonlocal setting.</description>

      <title>On a Complete Riemannian Metric on the Space of Embedded Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new strong Riemannian metric on the manifold of (parametrized) embedded curves of regularity $H^s$, $s\in(3/2,2)$. We highlight its close relationship to the (generalized) tangent-point energies and employ it to show that this metric is complete in the following senses: (i) bounded sets are relatively compact with respect to the weak $H^s$ topology; (ii) every Cauchy sequence with respect to the induced geodesic distance converges; (iii) solutions of the geodesic initial-value problem exist for all times; and (iv) there are length-minimizing geodesics between every pair of curves in the same path component (i.e., in the same knot class). As a by-product, we show $C^\infty$-smoothness of the tangent-point energies in the Hilbert case.</description>

      <title>Passing through nondegenerate singularities in mean curvature flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the properties of nondegenerate cylindrical singularities of mean curvature flow. We prove they are isolated in spacetime and provide a complete description of the geometry and topology change of the flow passing through the singularities. Particularly, the topology change agrees with the level sets change near a critical point of a Morse function, which is the same as performing surgery. The proof is based on a new $L^2$-distance monotonicity formula, which allows us to derive a discrete almost monotonicity of the ``decay order", a discrete mean curvature flow analog to Almgren's frequency function.</description>

      <title>Function Spaces on Uniformly Regular and Singular Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shows that the basic properties of Sobolev, Besov, and Bessel potential spaces are valid on Riemannian manifolds with boundary, which either have bounded geometry or posses singularities. In the latter case the appropriate setting is that of Kondratiev-type weighted spaces. The importance and usefulness of our results are indicated by a demonstration of a maximal regularity result for a linear parabolic initial value problem on singular manifolds.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of 3-webs around a point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let W be a planar 3-web defined on a neighborhood of a point M. We call {\guillemotleft}symmetry of W around M{\guillemotright} any local diffeomorphism which fixes M and maps each foliation of W to a (not necessarily the same) foliation of W. We say that it is a {\guillemotleft}simple symmetry{\guillemotright} if it respects any foliation, a {\guillemotleft}mirror symmetry{\guillemotright} if its respects one foliation an permutes the two other and a {\guillemotleft}circular symmetry{\guillemotright} if it permutes circularly the three foliations.
  Hexagonal (i.e. flat) planar 3-webs have always the three types of symmetry. We study here the non-flat case. We give a classification of 3-webs which admits simple or mirror symmetries. We give a method to build all the 3-webs with a circular symmetry and we exhibit a precise non-flat example.</description>

      <title>Geometric calculations on density manifolds from reciprocal relations in hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamics are systems of equations describing the evolution of macroscopic states in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. From generalized Onsager reciprocal relationships, one can formulate a class of hydrodynamics as gradient flows of free energies. In recent years, Onsager gradient flows have been widely investigated in optimal transport-type metric spaces with nonlinear mobilities, namely hydrodynamical density manifolds. This paper studies geometric calculations in these hydrodynamical density manifolds. We first formulate Levi-Civita connections, gradient, Hessian, and parallel transport and then derive Riemannian and sectional curvatures on density manifolds. We last present closed formulas for sectional curvatures of density manifolds in one dimensional spaces, in which the sign of curvatures is characterized by the convexities of mobilities. For example, we present density manifolds and their sectional curvatures in zero-range models, such as independent particles, simple exclusion processes, and Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti models.</description>

      <title>Deformations of $\mathbb Z_2$-Harmonic Spinors on 3-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $\mathbb Z_2$-harmonic spinor on a 3-manifold $Y$ is a solution of the Dirac equation on a bundle that is twisted around a submanifold $\mathcal Z$ of codimension 2 called the singular set. This article investigates the local structure of the universal moduli space of $\mathbb Z_2$-harmonic spinors over the space of parameters $(g,B)$ consisting of a metric and perturbation to the spin connection. The main result states that near a $\mathbb Z_2$-harmonic spinor with $\mathcal Z$ smooth, the universal moduli space projects to a codimension 1 submanifold in the space of parameters. The analysis is complicated by the presence of an infinite-dimensional obstruction bundle and a loss of regularity in the first variation of the Dirac operator with respect to deformations of the singular set $\mathcal Z$, necessitating the use of the Nash-Moser Implicit Function Theorem.</description>

      <title>Equivariant constructions of spheres with Zoll families of minimal spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct one-parameter deformations of the Euclidean sphere $\mathbb{S}^n$ inside $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ that admit a Zoll family of codimension one embedded minimal spheres, in all dimensions $n\geq 3$. The method of construction is equivariant with respect to the natural actions of the orthogonal group. In particular, we show that the original Zoll spheres of revolution in $\mathbb{R}^3$ have counterparts in the context of minimal surface theory, in all dimensions.
  We also describe the first examples of metrics on the real projective spaces $\mathbb{RP}^n$, in all dimensions $n \geq 3$, that admit a Zoll family of embedded minimal projective hyperplanes, and which are not isometric to metrics with minimal linear projective hyperplanes.
  The new constructions are underpinned by equivariant versions of Nash-Moser-Hamilton implicit function theorem, and yield new information even in dimension $n=2$. As an application, we also show that every finite group of the orthogonal group $O(3)$ that does not contain $-Id$ is the isometry group of some (classical) Zoll metric on $\mathbb{S}^2$.</description>

      <title>The index of sub-laplacians: beyond contact manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the following question: do sub-Laplacian type operators have non-trivial index theory on Carnot manifolds in higher degree of nilpotency? The problem relates to characterizing the structure of the space of hypoelliptic sub-Laplacian type operators, and results going back to Rothschild-Stein and Helffer-Nourrigat. In two degrees of nilpotency, there is a rich index theory by work of van Erp-Baum on contact manifolds, that was later extended to polycontact manifolds by Goffeng-Kuzmin. We provide a plethora of examples in higher degree of nilpotency where the index theory is trivial.</description>

      <title>Complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation for positive $(p,p)$ forms on compact K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation for differential $(p,p)$ forms is introduced on compact K\"ahler manifolds. For any $1 \leq p &lt; n$, we show the existence of smooth solutions unique up to adding constants. For $p=1$, this corresponds to the Calabi-Yau theorem proved by S. T. Yau, and for $p=n-1$, this gives the Monge-Amp\`ere equation for $(n-1)$ plurisubharmonic functions solved by Tosatti-Weinkove. For other $p$ values, this defines a non-linear PDE that falls outside of the general framework of Caffarelli-Nirenberg-Spruck. Further, we define a geometric flow for higher-order forms that preserves their cohomology classes, and extends the K\"ahler-Ricci flow naturally to $(p,p)$ forms. As a consequence of our main theorem, we show that this flow exists in a maximal time interval and can be shown to converge under some assumptions. A modified flow is introduced and the convergence of the associated normalized flow is shown. Some potential applications are also discussed.</description>
