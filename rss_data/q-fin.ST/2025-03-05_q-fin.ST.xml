      <title>Extrapolating the long-term seasonal component of electricity prices for forecasting in the day-ahead market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies provide evidence that decomposing the electricity price into the long-term seasonal component (LTSC) and the remaining part, predicting both separately, and then combining their forecasts can bring significant accuracy gains in day-ahead electricity price forecasting. However, not much attention has been paid to predicting the LTSC, and the last 24 hourly values of the estimated pattern are typically copied for the target day. To address this gap, we introduce a novel approach which extracts the trend-seasonal pattern from a price series extrapolated using price forecasts for the next 24 hours. We assess it using two 5-year long test periods from the German and Spanish power markets, covering the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2021/2022 energy crisis, and the war in Ukraine. Considering parsimonious autoregressive and LASSO-estimated models, we find that improvements in predictive accuracy range from 3\% to 15\% in terms of the root mean squared error and exceed 1\% in terms of profits from a realistic trading strategy involving day-ahead bidding and battery storage.</description>

      <title>VWAP Execution with Signature-Enhanced Transformers: A Multi-Asset Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper I propose a novel approach to Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) execution that addresses two key practical challenges: the need for asset-specific model training and the capture of complex temporal dependencies. Building upon my recent work in dynamic VWAP execution arXiv:2502.18177, I demonstrate that a single neural network trained across multiple assets can achieve performance comparable to or better than traditional asset-specific models. The proposed architecture combines a transformer-based design inspired by arXiv:2406.02486 with path signatures for capturing geometric features of price-volume trajectories, as in arXiv:2406.17890. The empirical analysis, conducted on hourly cryptocurrency trading data from 80 trading pairs, shows that the globally-fitted model with signature features (GFT-Sig) achieves superior performance in both absolute and quadratic VWAP loss metrics compared to asset-specific approaches. Notably, these improvements persist for out-of-sample assets, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize across different market conditions. The results suggest that combining global parameter sharing with signature-based feature extraction provides a scalable and robust approach to VWAP execution, offering significant practical advantages over traditional asset-specific implementations.</description>

      <title>Regression and Forecasting of U.S. Stock Returns Based on LSTM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyses the investment returns of three stock sectors, Manuf, Hitec, and Other, in the U.S. stock market, based on the Fama-French three-factor model, the Carhart four-factor model, and the Fama-French five-factor model, in order to test the validity of the Fama-French three-factor model, the Carhart four-factor model, and the Fama-French five-factor model for the three sectors of the market. French five-factor model for the three sectors of the market. Also, the LSTM model is used to explore the additional factors affecting stock returns. The empirical results show that the Fama-French five-factor model has better validity for the three segments of the market under study, and the LSTM model has the ability to capture the factors affecting the returns of certain industries, and can better regress and predict the stock returns of the relevant industries. Keywords- Fama-French model; Carhart model; Factor model; LSTM model.</description>
