      <title>Detecting the Indian Monsoon using Topological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A monsoon is a wind system that seasonally reverses its direction, accompanied by corresponding changes in precipitation. The Indian monsoon is the most prominent monsoon system, primarily affecting India's rainy season and its surrounding lands and water bodies. Every year, the onset and withdrawal of this monsoon happens sometime in May-June and September-October, respectively. Since monsoons are very complex systems governed by various weather factors with random noise, the yearly variability in the dates is significant. Despite the best efforts by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the South Asia Climate Outlook Forum (SCOF), forecasting the exact dates of onset and withdrawal, even within a week, is still an elusive problem in climate science. We interpret the onset and withdrawal of the Indian monsoon as abrupt regime shifts into and out of chaos. During these transitions, topological signatures (e.g., persistence diagrams) show rapid fluctuations, indicative of chaotic behavior. To detect these shifts, we reconstruct the phase space using Takens' embedding of the Indian monsoon index and apply topological data analysis (TDA) to track the birth and death of $k$-dimensional features. Applying this approach to historical monsoon index data (1948-2015) suggests a promising framework for more accurate detection of monsoon onset and withdrawal.</description>

      <title>Slowing Climate Change and Ocean Acidification by Converting Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide to Graphite (CD2G)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere may slow climate change and ocean acidification. My approach converts atmospheric carbon dioxide into graphite (CD2G). The net profit for this conversion is ~$381/ton CO2 removed from the atmosphere. At the gigaton scale, CD2G factories will increase the affordability and availability of graphite. Since graphite can be used to make thermal batteries and electrodes for fuel cells and batteries, CD2G factories will help lower the cost of storing renewable energy, which will accelerate the transition to renewable energy. Replacing fossil fuel energy with renewable energy will slow the release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, also slowing climate change. Converting atmospheric carbon dioxide into graphite will both generate a profit and slow climate change.</description>

      <title>Impact of Small-Scale Gravity Waves on Tracer Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-scale gravity waves play a crucial role in atmospheric tracer transport, yet their effects remain unresolved in climate models and must be parameterized. This study investigates how gravity waves influence large-scale tracer distributions, utilizing a multiple-scale analysis to systematically identify the governing terms of gravity wave-induced tracer fluxes. The analysis reveals both leading-order and next-order impacts: the former being the inertia-gravity wave-induced tracer Stokes drift, which acts perpendicular to both the large-scale tracer gradient and the wave number, while the latter becomes significant at lower latitudes where Coriolis effects diminish. A numerical framework is developed to incorporate these fluxes into a gravity wave parameterization model, potentially enhancing climate model accuracy without requiring explicit resolution of small-scale wave dynamics. Model validation against high-resolution wave-resolving simulations confirms the effectiveness of this approach. By improving the representation of gravity wave-induced tracer transport, this research advances the accuracy of climate simulations, particularly in their depiction of microphysics and radiative processes.</description>

      <title>Performance and applications of optical pin beams in turbulent long-range free space optical communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical pin beams (OPBs) are a promising candidate for realizing turbulence-resilient long-distance free-space optical communication links spanning hundreds of kilometers. In this work, we introduce a unified theoretical model to describe the propagation of OPBs and present comprehensive simulation results based on many realizations and link-budget analyses for constant turbulence strengths. For reference, we compare the performance of the OPBs to weakly diverging and focusing Gaussian beams. For a 100km long air-to-air link, 10km above sea level, our simulation results show that OPBs offer an improved link budget of up to 8.6dB and enhanced beam wander statistics of up to 3dB compared to the considered Gaussian beams. Additionally, we identified a quadratic relationship between the transmitter aperture diameter and the maximum achievable distances, which is crucial in deciding the suitability of OPBs for a given application scenario.</description>
