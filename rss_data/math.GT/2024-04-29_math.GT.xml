      <title>Equivariant Double-Slice Genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we define the equivariant double-slice genus and equivariant super-slice genus of a strongly invertible knot. We prove lower bounds for both the equivariant double-slice genus and the equivariant super-slice genus. Using these bounds we find a family of knots which are double-slice and equivariantly slice but have arbitrarily large equivariant double-slice genus. From this, we construct equivariantly knotted symmetric 3-balls as well as unknotted symmetric 2-spheres which do not bound equivariant 3-balls. Additionally, using double-slice and super-slice genus we construct properly embedded surfaces with large 1-handle stabilization distance distance rel boundary.</description>

      <title>$L$-space knots with positive surgeries that are not weakly symplectically fillable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a general strategy to detect the absence of weakly symplectic fillings of $L$-spaces. We start from a generic $L$-space knot and consider (positive) Dehn surgeries on it. We compute, using arithmetic data depending only on the knot type and the surgery coefficient, the value of the relevant geometric invariants used to obstruct fillability. We also provide a new example of an infinite family of hyperbolic $L$-spaces that do not admit weakly symplectic fillings. These are manifolds that lie inside $\{\text{Tight}\}$ but not inside $\{\text{Weakly Fillable}\}$.</description>

      <title>Pullback of symplectic forms to the space of circle patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider circle patterns on surfaces with complex projective structures. We investigate two symplectic forms pulled back to the deformation space of circle patterns. The first one is Goldman's symplectic form on the space of complex projective structures on closed surfaces. The other is the Weil-Petersson symplectic form on the Teichm\"uller space of punctured surfaces. We show that their pullbacks to the space of circle patterns coincide. It is applied to prove the smoothness of the deformation space, which is an essential step to the conjecture that the space of circle patterns is homeomorphic to the Teichm\"uller space of the closed surface. We further conjecture that the pullback of the symplectic forms is non-degenerate and defines a symplectic structure on the space of circle patterns.</description>

      <title>A Notion of Dimension based on Probability on Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce notions of dimension of an infinite group, or more generally, a metric space, defined using percolation. Roughly speaking, the percolation dimension $pdim(G)$ of a group $G$ is the fastest rate of decay of a symmetric probability measure $\mu$ on $G$, such that Bernoulli percolation on $G$ with connection probabilities proportional to $\mu$ behaves like a Poisson branching process with parameter 1 in a sense made precise below. We show that $pdim(G)$ has several natural properties: it is monotone decreasing with respect to subgroups and quotients, and coincides with the growth rate exponent for several classes of groups.</description>

Abstract: We compute the symplectic cohomology of Milnor fibers of isolated quasihomogeneous $cA_n$ singularities. As a by-product of our computations we distinguish their links as contact manifolds and we also provide further evidence to a conjecture of Evans and Lekili.</description>

      <title>The definable content of homological invariants II: \v{C}ech cohomology and homotopy classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11098v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the second installment in a series of papers applying descriptive set theoretic techniques to both analyze and enrich classical functors from homological algebra and algebraic topology. In it, we show that the \v{C}ech cohomology functors $\check{\mathrm{H}}^n$ on the category of locally compact separable metric spaces each factor into (i) what we term their definable version, a functor $\check{\mathrm{H}}^n_{\mathrm{def}}$ taking values in the category $\mathsf{GPC}$ of groups with a Polish cover (a category first introduced in this work's predecessor), followed by (ii) a forgetful functor from $\mathsf{GPC}$ to the category of groups. These definable cohomology functors powerfully refine their classical counterparts: we show that they are complete invariants, for example, of the homotopy types of mapping telescopes of $d$-spheres or $d$-tori for any $d\geq 1$, and, in contrast, that there exist uncountable families of pairwise homotopy inequivalent mapping telescopes of either sort on which the classical cohomology functors are constant. We then apply the functors $\check{\mathrm{H}}^n_{\mathrm{def}}$ to show that a seminal problem in the development of algebraic topology, namely Borsuk and Eilenberg's 1936 problem of classifying, up to homotopy, the maps from a solenoid complement $S^3\backslash\Sigma$ to the $2$-sphere, is essentially hyperfinite but not smooth.
  In the course of this work, we record Borel definable versions of a number of classical results bearing on both the combinatorial and homotopical formulations of \v{C}ech cohomology; in aggregate, this work may be regarded as laying foundations for the descriptive set theoretic study of the homotopy relation on the space of maps from a locally compact Polish space to a polyhedron, a relation which embodies a substantial variety of classification problems arising throughout mathematics.</description>

      <title>Denseness of $g$-vector cones from weighted orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02282v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $g$-vector cones in a cluster algebra defined from a weighted orbifold of rank $n$ introduced by Felikson, Shapiro and Tumarkin. We determine the closure of the union of the $g$-vector cones. It is equal to $\mathbb{R}^n$ except for a weighted orbifold with empty boundary and exactly one puncture, in which case it is equal to the half space of a certain explicit hyperplane in $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>
