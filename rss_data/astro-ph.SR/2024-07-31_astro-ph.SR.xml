      <title>Asteroseismology of the Nearby K-Dwarf $\sigma$ Draconis using the Keck Planet Finder and TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroseismology of dwarf stars cooler than the Sun is very challenging due to the low amplitudes and rapid timescales of oscillations. Here, we present the asteroseismic detection of solar-like oscillations at 4-minute timescales ($\nu_{\mathrm{max}}\sim4300\mu$Hz) in the nearby K-dwarf $\sigma$ Draconis using extreme precision Doppler velocity observations from the Keck Planet Finder and 20-second cadence photometry from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. The star is the coolest dwarf star to date with both velocity and luminosity observations of solar-like oscillations, having amplitudes of $5.9\pm0.8\,$cm$\,\text{s}^{-1}$ and $0.8\pm0.2$ ppm, respectively. These measured values are in excellent agreement with established luminosity-velocity amplitude relations for oscillations and provide further evidence that mode amplitudes for stars with $T_{\mathrm{eff}}&lt;\,5500\,$K diminish in scale following a $(L/M)^{1.5}$ relation. By modeling the star's oscillation frequencies from photometric data, we measure an asteroseismic age of $4.5\pm0.9\,\rm{(ran)} \pm 1.0\,\rm{(sys)}$ Gyr. The observations demonstrate the capability of next-generation spectrographs and precise space-based photometry to extend observational asteroseismology to nearby cool dwarfs, which are benchmarks for stellar astrophysics and prime targets for directly imaging planets using future space-based telescopes.</description>

      <title>FCN4Flare: Fully Convolution Neural Networks for Flare Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar flares originate from the sudden reconnection of magnetic flux lines within the star's atmosphere, particularly in the chromosphere. Automated flare detection enables exploiting vast photometric datasets from missions like Kepler. Prior methods rely on outlier detection, facing challenges of complexity, detection accuracy, and scalability. This paper presents FCN4Flare, a deep learning approach using fully convolutional networks for precise point-to-point flare prediction regardless of light curve length. Key innovations include the NaN Mask to handle missing data, dilated convolutions to preserve local information, and the MaskDice loss to mitigate severe class imbalance. Experiments demonstrate significantly improved detection performance over previous models, with a 0.64 Dice coefficient on Kepler data. Applying FCN4Flare to Kepler and LAMOST, we compile a catalog of 30,285 high-confidence flares across 1426 stars. Flare energies are estimated and stellar/exoplanet properties analyzed, identifying pronounced activity for an M-dwarf hosting a habitable zone planet. This work overcomes limitations of prior flare detection methods via deep learning, enabling new scientific discoveries through analysis of photometric time-series data.</description>

      <title>An all-sky catalogue of stellar reddening values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When observing astronomical objects, we must deal with extinction (i.e. the absorption and scattering of the emitted radiation by dust and gas between the source and the observer). Interstellar extinction depends on the location of the object and the wavelength. The different extinction laws describing these effects are difficult to estimate for a small sample of stars. Many sophisticated and automatic methods have recently been developed for estimating astrophysical parameters (age and metallicity, for example) depending on the reddening, which is usually treated as a free parameter within the corresponding estimations. However, many reddening values for stars have been published over the last few decades, most of which include observations in the ultraviolet, which are essential for a good estimation but are essentially no longer considered. We searched the literature through the end of 2022 for published independent reddening values of stellar objects based on various methods that exclude estimates from reddening maps. In addition, we present new reddening estimates based on the classical photometric indices in the Geneva, Johnson, and Stromgren-Crawford systems. These are based on well-established and reliable calibrations. After a careful identification procedure and quality assessment of the data, we calculated the mean reddening values of 157 631 individual available measurements for 97 826 objects. We find several statistically significant offsets and trends within the different references and discuss possible explanations for them.</description>

      <title>Why Do Stars Turn Red?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a star exhausts the hydrogen fuel in its core, the core contracts, and the envelope may expand to $\sim 100$ times its original size. Consequently, stars with $\lesssim 8$ solar masses become red giants, while those with $\gtrsim 8$ solar masses evolve into red supergiants. However, the physics driving this extreme expansion is unclear. This letter presents a new mechanism grounded in the instability of stellar envelopes to explain the expansion. If the gravitational energy released by core contraction can trigger the initial expansion to a critical radius where the envelope becomes unstable, the star then continues expanding until stabilizing, thereby becoming a red giant or supergiant. We demonstrate that the envelope instability can explain several elusive features in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, such as the Hertzsprung gap between the main sequence and the red giant branch, as well as the dichotomy of the supergiant populations in red and blue.</description>

      <title>On Extended d-D Kappa Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal Doppler broadening of spectral profiles for particle populations in the absence or presence of potential fields are described by kappa distributions. The kappa distribution provides a replacement for the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution which can be considered as a generalization for describing systems characterized by local correlations among their particles as found in space and astrophysical plasmas. This paper presents all special cases of kappa distributions as members of a general pathway family of densities introduced by Mathai.</description>

      <title>Effect of area divergence and frequency on damping of slow magnetoacoustic waves propagating along umbral fan loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waves play an important role in the heating of solar atmosphere, however, observations of wave propagation and damping from the solar photosphere to corona through chromosphere and transition region are very rare. Recent observations have shown propagation of 3-min slow magnetoacoustic waves (SMAWs) along fan loops from the solar photosphere to corona. In this work, we investigate the role of area divergence and frequencies on the damping of SMAWs propagating from the photosphere to the corona along several fan loops rooted in the sunspot umbra. We study the Fourier power spectra of oscillations along fan loops at each atmospheric height which showed significant enhancements in 1--2 min, 2.3--3.6 min and 4.2--6 min period bands. Amplitude of intensity oscillations in different period bands and heights are extracted after normalizing the filtered light curves with low-frequency background. We find damping of SMAW energy flux propagating along the fan loop 6 with damping lengths ~170 km and ~208 km for 1.5-min and 3-min period bands. We also show the decay of total wave energy content with height after incorporating area divergence effect, and present actual damping of SMAWs from photosphere to corona. Actual damping lengths in this case increases to ~172 km and ~303 km for 1.5-min and 3-min period bands. All the fan loops show such increase in actual damping lengths, and thus highlight the importance of area divergence effect. Results also show some frequency-dependent damping of SMAW energy fluxes with height where high-frequency waves are damped faster than low-frequency waves.</description>

      <title>Non-radial oscillations mimicking a brown dwarf orbiting the cluster giant NGC 4349 No. 127</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several evolved stars have been found to exhibit long-period radial velocity variations that cannot be explained by planetary or brown dwarf companions. Non-radial oscillations caused by oscillatory convective modes have been put forth as an alternative explanation, but no modeling attempt has yet been undertaken. We provide a model of a non-radial oscillation, aiming to explain the observed variations of the cluster giant NGC 4349 No. 127. The star was previously reported to host a brown dwarf companion, but whose existence was later refuted in the literature. We reanalyzed 58 archival HARPS spectra, acquiring additional activity indicators using the SERVAL and RACCOON pipelines. We searched for periodicity in the indicators and correlations between the indicators and radial velocities. We further present a simulation code able to produce synthetic HARPS spectra, incorporating the effect of non-radial oscillations, and compare the simulated results to the observed variations. We find a positive correlation between chromatic index and radial velocity, along with closed-loop Lissajous-like correlations between radial velocity and each of the spectral line shape indicators (full width at half maximum, and contrast of the cross-correlation function and differential line width). Simulations of a low-amplitude, retrograde, dipole (l = 1, m = 1), non-radial oscillation can reproduce the observed behavior and explain the observables. Photometric variations below the detection threshold of the available ASAS-3 photometry are predicted. The oscillation and stellar parameters are largely in agreement with the prediction of oscillatory convective modes. The periodic variations of the radial velocities and activity indicators, along with the respective phase shifts, measured for the intermediate-mass cluster giant NGC 4349 No. 127, can be explained by a non-radial oscillation.</description>

      <title>A study in scarlet -- I. Photometric properties of a sample of Intermediate Luminosity Red Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the photometric characteristics of a sample of Intermediate Luminosity Red Transients (ILRTs), a class of elusive objects with peak luminosity between that of classical novae and standard supernovae. We present the multi-wavelength photometric follow-up of four ILRTs, namely NGC 300 2008OT-1, AT 2019abn, AT 2019ahd and AT 2019udc. Through the analysis and modelling of their spectral energy distribution and bolometric light curves we infer the physical parameters associated with these transients. All four objects display a single peaked light curve which ends in a linear decline in magnitudes at late phases. A flux excess with respect to a single black body emission is detected in the infrared domain for three objects in our sample, a few months after maximum. This feature, commonly found in ILRTs, is interpreted as a sign of dust formation. Mid infrared monitoring of NGC 300 2008OT-1 761 days after maximum allows us to infer the presence of $\sim$10$^{-3}$-10$^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$ of dust, depending on the chemical composition and the grain size adopted. The late time decline of the bolometric light curves of the considered ILRTs is shallower than expected for $^{56}$Ni decay, hence requiring an additional powering mechanism. James Webb Space Telescope observations of AT 2019abn prove that the object has faded below its progenitor luminosity in the mid-infrared domain, five years after its peak. Together with the disappearance of NGC 300 2008OT-1 in Spitzer images seven years after its discovery, this supports the terminal explosion scenario for ILRTs. With a simple semi-analytical model we try to reproduce the observed bolometric light curves in the context of few M$_{\odot}$ of material ejected at few 10$^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$ and enshrouded in an optically thick circumstellar medium.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the spectroscopic characteristics of Intermediate Luminosity Red Transients (ILRTs), a class of elusive objects with peak luminosity between that of classical novae and standard supernovae. We present the extensive optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic monitoring of four ILRTs, namely NGC 300 2008OT-1, AT 2019abn, AT 2019ahd and AT 2019udc. First we focus on the evolution of the most prominent spectral features observed in the low resolution spectra, then we discuss more in detail the high resolution spectrum collected for NGC 300 2008OT-1 with the Very Large Telescope equipped with UVES. Finally we analyse late time spectra of NGC 300 2008OT-1 and AT 2019ahd through comparisons with both synthetic and observed spectra. Balmer and Ca lines dominate the optical spectra, revealing the presence of slowly moving circumstellar medium (CSM) around the objects. The line luminosity of H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and Ca II NIR triplet presents a double peaked evolution with time, possibly indicative of interaction between fast ejecta and the slow CSM. The high resolution spectrum of NGC 300 2008OT-1 reveals a complex circumstellar environment, with the transient being surrounded by a slow ($\sim$30 km s$^{-1}$) progenitor wind. At late epochs, optical spectra of NGC 300 2008OT-1 and AT 2019ahd show broad ($\sim$2500 km s$^{-1}$) emission features at $\sim$6170 A and $\sim$7000 A which are unprecedented for ILRTs. We find that these lines originate most likely from the blending of several narrow lines, possibly of iron-peak elements.</description>

      <title>The evolution of the $M_{\mathrm{d}}-M_{\star}$ and $\dot M-M_{\star}$ correlations traces protoplanetary disc dispersal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (Abridged) Observational surveys of entire star-forming regions have provided evidence of power-law correlations between the disc properties and the stellar mass, especially the disc mass (${M_d \propto M_*}^{\lambda_m}$) and the accretion rate ($\dot M \propto {M_*}^{\lambda_{acc}}$). Whether the secular disc evolution affects said correlations is still debated: while the purely viscous scenario has been probed, other mechanisms could impact differently. We study the evolution of the slopes $\lambda_m$ and $\lambda_{acc}$ in the wind-driven and hybrid case and compare it to the viscous prediction, using a combination of analytical calculations and numerical simulations (performed with the 1D population synthesis code Diskpop, that we also present and release). Assuming $M_d(0) \propto {M_*}^{\lambda_{m, 0}}$ and $\dot M(0) \propto {M_*}^{\lambda_{acc, 0}}$ as initial conditions, we find that viscous and hybrid accretion preserve the shape of the correlations and evolve their slope; on the other hand, MHD winds change the shape of the correlations, bending them according to the scaling of the accretion timescale with the stellar mass. We also show how a spread in the initial conditions conceals this behaviour. We then analyse the impact of disc dispersal, and find that the currently available sample sizes ($\sim 30$ discs at 5 Myr) introduce stochastic oscillations in the slopes evolution, which dominate over the physical signatures. Increasing the sample size could mitigate this issue: $\sim 140$ discs at 5 Myr, corresponding to the complete Upper Sco sample, would give small enough error bars to use the evolution of the slopes as a proxy for the driving mechanism of disc evolution. Finally, we discuss how the observational claim of steepening slopes necessarily leads to an initially steeper $M_d - M_*$ correlation with respect to $\dot M - M_*$.</description>

      <title>The Nature of the Emission Spectrum of NGC 7793 P13: modeling the atmosphere of the donor star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue to study the ultra-luminous X-ray source NGC 7793 P13 in the optical range. In this work, we are testing the model of a spherically symmetric wind atmosphere of the donor star, previously identified as a B9 Ia supergiant. The model spectrum has shown good agreement with the observed one at a relatively high mass loss rate of $\dot{M} \approx 6\times10^{-6}\,M_{\odot}\,\text{yr}^{-1}$; other parameters turned out to be close to those expected for late B-supergiants. The increased mass loss rate can be explained by the high rotation velocity of the star. In addition, we have qualitatively demonstrated the effect of X-ray irradiation on the observed spectrum and discuss the fundamental possibility of wind acceleration under conditions of powerful irradiation.</description>

      <title>An Earth-sized Planet on the Verge of Tidal Disruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TOI-6255~b (GJ 4256) is an Earth-sized planet (1.079$\pm0.065$ $R_\oplus$) with an orbital period of only 5.7 hours. With the newly commissioned Keck Planet Finder (KPF) and CARMENES spectrographs, we determined the planet's mass to be 1.44$\pm$0.14 $M_{\oplus}$. The planet is just outside the Roche limit, with $P_{\rm orb}/P_{\rm Roche}$ = 1.13 $\pm0.10$. The strong tidal force likely deforms the planet into a triaxial ellipsoid with a long axis that is $\sim$10\% longer than the short axis. Assuming a reduced stellar tidal quality factor $Q_\star^\prime \approx10^7$, we predict that tidal orbital decay will cause TOI-6255 to reach the Roche limit in roughly 400 Myr. Such tidal disruptions may produce the possible signatures of planet engulfment that have been on stars with anomalously high refractory elemental abundances compared to its conatal binary companion. TOI-6255 b is also a favorable target for searching for star-planet magnetic interactions, which might cause interior melting and hasten orbital decay. TOI-6255 b is a top target (Emission Spectroscopy Metric of about 24) for phase curve observations with the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Investigating the crust of neutron stars with neural-network quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An accurate description of low-density nuclear matter is crucial for explaining the physics of neutron star crusts. In the density range between approximately 0.01 fm$^{-3}$ and 0.1 fm$^{-3}$, matter transitions from neutron-rich nuclei to various higher-density pasta shapes, before ultimately reaching a uniform liquid. In this work, we introduce a variational Monte Carlo method based on a neural Pfaffian-Jastrow quantum state, which allows us to model the transition from the liquid phase to neutron-rich nuclei microscopically. At low densities, nuclear clusters dynamically emerge from the microscopic interactions among protons and neutrons, which we model based on pionless effective field theory. Our variational Monte Carlo approach represents a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art auxiliary-field diffusion Monte Carlo method, which is severely hindered by the fermion-sign problem in this low-density regime and cannot capture the onset of clusters. In addition to computing the energy per particle of symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter, we analyze an intermediate isospin-asymmetry configuration to elucidate the formation of nuclear clusters. We also provide evidence that the presence of such nuclear clusters influences the amount of protons in the crust compared to protons in beta-equilibrated, neutrino-transparent matter.</description>

      <title>The OATMEAL Survey. I. Low Stellar Obliquity in the Transiting Brown Dwarf System GPX-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the OATMEAL survey, an effort to measure the obliquities of stars with transiting brown dwarf companions. We observed a transit of the close-in ($P_{\rm orb} = 1.74 \,$ days) brown dwarf GPX-1 b using the Keck Planet Finder (KPF) spectrograph to measure the sky-projected angle between its orbital axis and the spin axis of its early F-type host star ($\lambda$). We measured $\lambda = 6.88 \pm 1.72 ^\circ$ (with additional unquantified systematic uncertainty), suggesting an orbit that is prograde and well aligned with the stellar equator. Hot Jupiters around early F stars are frequently found to have highly misaligned orbits, with polar and retrograde orbits being commonplace. It has been theorized that these misalignments stem from dynamical interactions, such as von Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov cycles, and are retained over long timescales due to weak tidal dissipation in stars with radiative envelopes. By comparing GPX-1 to similar systems under the frameworks of different tidal evolution theories, we argued that the rate of tidal dissipation is too slow to have re-aligned the system. This suggests that GPX-1 may have arrived at its close-in orbit via coplanar high-eccentricity migration or migration through an aligned protoplanetary disk. Our result for GPX-1 is the fifth measurement of the obliquity of a star with a transiting brown dwarf. By enlarging the number of such measurements and comparing them with hot Jupiter systems, we will more clearly discern the differences between the mechanisms that dictate the formation and evolution of both classes of objects.</description>

      <title>X-ray Emission of Nearby Low-mass and Sun-like Stars with Directly Imageable Habitable Zones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar X-ray and UV radiation can significantly affect the survival, composition, and long-term evolution of the atmospheres of planets in or near their host star's habitable zone (HZ). Especially interesting are planetary systems in the solar neighborhood that may host temperate and potentially habitable surface conditions, which may be analyzed by future ground and space-based direct-imaging surveys for signatures of habitability and life. To advance our understanding of the radiation environment in these systems, we leverage $\sim$3 Msec of XMM-Newton and Chandra observations in order to measure three fundamental stellar properties at X-ray energies for 57 nearby FGKM stellar systems: the shape of the stellar X-ray spectrum, the luminosity, and the timescales over which the stars vary (e.g., due to flares). These systems possess HZs that will be directly imageable to next-generation telescopes such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory and ground-based Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs). We identify 29 stellar systems with $L_X/L_{\rm bol}$ ratios similar to (or less than) that of the Sun; any potential planets in the habitable zones of these stars therefore reside in present day X-ray radiation environments similar to (or less hostile than) modern Earth, though a broader set of these targets could host habitable planets. An additional 19 stellar systems have been observed with the Swift X-ray Telescope; in total, only $\sim$30% of potential direct imaging target stars has been observed with XMM-Newton, Chandra, or Swift. The data products from this work (X-ray light curves and spectra) are available via a public Zenodo repository (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.11490574).</description>

      <title>A Testbed for Tidal Migration: the 3D Architecture of an Eccentric Hot Jupiter HD 118203 b Accompanied by a Possibly Aligned Outer Giant Planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing outer companions to hot Jupiters plays a crucial role in deciphering their origins. We present the discovery of a long-period giant planet, HD 118203 c ($m_{c}=11.9^{+0.69}_{-0.63}\ \mathrm{M_{J}}$, $a_{c}=5.36^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$ AU, $e_{c}=0.26^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$) exterior to previously known close-in eccentric hot Jupiter HD 118203 b ($P_{b}=6.135\ \mathrm{days}$, $m_{b}=2.14\pm{0.12}\ \mathrm{M_{J}}$, $r_{b}=1.14\pm{0.029}\ \mathrm{R_{J}}$, $e_{b}=0.31\pm{0.007}$) based on twenty-year radial velocity observations. Using Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) observations from the Keck Planet Finder (KPF), we measured a low sky-projected obliquity $\lambda_{b}=-11^{\circ}.7^{+7.6}_{-10}$ for HD 118203 b and detected stellar oscillations in the host star, confirming its evolved status. Combining the RM observation with the stellar inclination measurement, we constrained the true obliquity of HD 118203 b as $\Psi_{b}&lt;33^{\circ}.5\ (2\sigma)$, indicating the orbit normal of the hot Jupiter nearly aligned with the stellar spin axis. Furthermore, by combining radial velocities and Hipparcos-Gaia astrometric acceleration, we constrained the line-of-sight mutual inclination between the hot Jupiter and the outer planet to be $9^{\circ}.8^{+16.2}_{-9.3}$ at $2\sigma$ level. HD 118203 is the first hot Jupiter system where both the true obliquity of the hot Jupiter and the mutual inclination between inner and outer planets have been determined. Our results are consistent with a system-wide alignment, with low mutual inclinations between the outer giant planet, the inner hot Jupiter, and the host star. This alignment, along with the moderate eccentricity of HD 118203 c, implies that the system may have undergone coplanar high-eccentricity tidal migration. Under this framework, our dynamical analysis suggests an initial semi-major axis of 0.3 to 3.2 AU for the proto-hot Jupiter.</description>

Abstract: We produce a new photometric calibration for the combined six-filter system formed by $Gaia$ DR2 + EDR3 $G$+$G_{\rm BP}$+$G_{\rm RP}$ using an improved STIS/HST spectrophotometric library with very red stars. The comparison between observed and synthetic photometry yields residual dispersions of just 3.4-8.7 mmag, resulting in the most accurate and precise whole-sky large-dynamic-range optical photometric system ever obtained.

      <description>arXiv:2407.21399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Villafranca project is studying Galactic stellar groups with OB stars combining information from $Gaia$ and ground-based surveys. We summarize the status of the project and we present its most important results. The Villafranca project has been used to produce a new astrometric calibration for $Gaia$ (E)DR3, which improves the previous one significantly for bright stars. We have discovered that dynamical interactions among massive stars at a very young age ($\sim$1 Ma or less) can play a significant interaction in the dynamical evolution of clusters. As a consequence, our current view of the massive-star IMF may be distorted and the number of free-floating neutron stars and black holes higher than previously considered.</description>

      <title>Detection of Dimethyl Ether in the Central Region of the MWC 480 Protoplanetary Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the chemistry of complex organic molecules (COMs) at the epoch of planet formation provides insights into the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM) and the origin of organic materials in our Solar System. We report a detection of dimethyl ether (CH$_3$OCH$_3$) in the disk around the Herbig Ae star MWC 480 with the sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations. This is the first detection of CH$_3$OCH$_3$ in a non-transitional Class II disk. The spatially unresolved, compact (${\lesssim}$25 au in radius) nature, the broad line width ($\sim$30 km s$^{-1}$), and the high excitation temperature (${\sim}$200 K) indicate sublimation of COMs in the warm inner disk. Despite the detection of CH$_3$OCH$_3$, methanol (CH$_3$OH), the most abundant COM in the ISM, has not been detected, from which we constrain the column density ratio of CH$_3$OCH$_3$/CH$_3$OH ${\gtrsim}$7. This high ratio may indicate the reprocessing of COMs during the disk phase, as well as the effect of the physical structure in the inner disk. We also find that this ratio is higher than in COM-rich transition disks recently discovered. This may indicate that, in the full disk of MWC 480, COMs have experienced substantial chemical reprocessing in the innermost region, while the COM emission in the transition disks predominantly traces the inherited ice sublimating at the dust cavity edge located at larger radii (${\gtrsim}$20 au).</description>

      <title>The effect of dynamical interactions in stellar birth environments on the orbits of young close-in planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars do not form in isolation but together with other stars, and often in a clustered environment. Depending on the initial conditions in these environments, such as initial density and substructure, the distances of encounters between stars will differ. These encounters can also affect just-formed exoplanetary systems. Using N-body simulations, we show the effect of a single fly-by on a common type of exoplanetary system: close-in Super-Earths/sub-Neptunes with or without a distant Giant planet. Even a single encounter can significantly modify the architecture of these exoplanetary systems over their long lifetimes. We test fly-bys with different characteristics, such as distance and mass, and show how they perturb the inner planets long after the encounter, leading to collisions and mutual inclination excitation, which can significantly modify the observed architecture of these systems in transit. We find that our initially four-planet inner systems reduce to three or two inner planets depending on their initial separation and that the mutual inclinations of these remaining planets can be high enough to reduce the number of observable, transiting planets. In our 500 Myr simulations, we show that this reduction in the number of transiting planets due to stellar fly-bys can contribute to the observed excess of single-transit systems.</description>

      <title>TESS Giants Transiting Giants. VI. Newly Discovered Hot Jupiters Provide Evidence for Efficient Obliquity Damping after the Main Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The degree of alignment between a star's spin axis and the orbital plane of its planets (the stellar obliquity) is related to interesting and poorly understood processes that occur during planet formation and evolution. Hot Jupiters orbiting hot stars ($\gtrsim$6250 K) display a wide range of obliquities, while similar planets orbiting cool stars are preferentially aligned. Tidal dissipation is expected to be more rapid in stars with thick convective envelopes, potentially explaining this trend. Evolved stars provide an opportunity to test the damping hypothesis, particularly stars that were hot on the main sequence and have since cooled and developed deep convective envelopes. We present the first systematic study of the obliquities of hot Jupiters orbiting subgiants that recently developed convective envelopes using Rossiter-McLaughlin observations. Our sample includes two newly discovered systems in the Giants Transiting Giants Survey (TOI-6029 b, TOI-4379 b). We find that the orbits of hot Jupiters orbiting subgiants that have cooled below $\sim$6250 K are aligned or nearly aligned with the spin-axis of their host stars, indicating rapid tidal realignment after the emergence of a stellar convective envelope. We place an upper limit for the timescale of realignment for hot Jupiters orbiting subgiants at $\sim$500 Myr. Comparison with a simplified tidal evolution model shows that obliquity damping needs to be $\sim$4 orders of magnitude more efficient than orbital period decay to damp the obliquity without destroying the planet, which is consistent with recent predictions for tidal dissipation from inertial waves excited by hot Jupiters on misaligned orbits.</description>

      <title>The frequency of transiting planetary systems around polluted white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the frequency of transiting planetary systems around metal-polluted white dwarfs using high-cadence photometry from ULTRACAM and ULTRASPEC on the ground, and space-based observations with TESS. Within a sample of 313 metal-polluted white dwarfs with available TESS light curves, two systems known to have irregular transits are blindly recovered by box-least-squares and Lomb-Scargle analyses, with no new detections, yielding a transit fraction of 0.8 (-0.4, +0.6) per cent. Planet detection sensitivities are determined using simulated transit injection and recovery for all light curves, producing upper limit occurrences over radii from dwarf to Kronian planets, with periods from 1 h to 27 d. The dearth of short-period, transiting planets orbiting polluted white dwarfs is consistent with engulfment during the giant phases of stellar evolution, and modestly constrains dynamical re-injection of planets to the shortest orbital periods. Based on simple predictions of transit probability, where (R + Rp)/a ~ 0.01, the findings here are nominally consistent with a model where 100 per cent of polluted white dwarfs have circumstellar debris near the Roche limit; however, the small sample size precludes statistical confidence in this result. Single transits are also ruled out in all light curves using a search for correlated outliers, providing weak constraints on the role of Oort-like comet clouds in white dwarf pollution.</description>

Abstract: In the era of space exploration, coronal holes on the sun play a significant role due to their impact on satellites and aircraft through their open magnetic fields and increased solar wind emissions. This study employs computer vision techniques to detect coronal hole regions and estimate their sizes using imagery from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Additionally, we utilize hybrid time series prediction model, specifically combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and ARIMA, to analyze trends in the area of coronal holes and predict their areas across various solar regions over a span of seven days. By examining time series data, we aim to identify patterns in coronal hole behavior and understand their potential effects on space weather.</description>

Abstract: The application of clustering algorithms to the Gaia astrometric catalog has revolutionized our census of stellar populations in the Milky Way, including the discovery of many new, dispersed structures. We focus on one such structure, Theia 456 (COIN-Gaia-13), a loosely bound collection of ~320 stars spanning ~120 pc that has previously been shown to exhibit kinematic, chemical, and gyrochronal coherency, indicating a common origin. We obtain follow-up radial velocities and supplement these with Gaia astrometry to perform an in-depth dynamical analysis of Theia 456. By integrating stellar orbits through a Milky Way potential, we find the currently dispersed structure coalesced into a small cluster in the past. Via Bayesian modeling, we derive a kinematic age of 245 +/- 3 Myr (statistical), a half-mass radius of 9 +/- 2 pc, and an initial one-dimensional velocity dispersion of 0.14 +/- 0.02 km/s. Our results are entirely independent of model isochrones, details of stellar evolution, and internal cluster dynamics, and the statistical precision in our age derivation rivals that of the most precise age-dating techniques known today, though our imperfect knowledge of the Milky Way potential and simple spherical model for Theia 456 at birth add additional uncertainties. Using posterior predictive checking, we confirm these results are robust under reasonable variations to the Milky Way potential. Such low density structures that are disrupted by the Galactic tides before virializing may be ubiquitous, signifying that Theia 456 is a valuable benchmark for studying the dynamical history of stellar populations in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Stellar Masses and Origin of the Protostellar VLA 1623 System</title>

Abstract: We present ALMA Band 7 molecular line observations of the protostars within the VLA 1623 system. We map C$^{17}$O (3 - 2) in the circumbinary disk around VLA 1623A and the outflow cavity walls of the collimated outflow. We further detect red-shifted and blue-shifted velocity gradients in the circumstellar disks around VLA 1623B and VLA 1623W that are consistent with Keplerian rotation. We use the radiative transfer modeling code, pdspy, and simple flared disk models to measure stellar masses of $0.27 \pm 0.03$ M$_\odot$, $1.9^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ M$_\odot$, and $0.64 \pm 0.06$ M$_\odot$ for the VLA 1623A binary, VLA 1623B, and VLA 1623W, respectively. These results represent the strongest constraints on stellar mass for both VLA 1623B and VLA 1623W, and the first measurement of mass for all stellar components using the same tracer and methodology. We use these masses to discuss the relationship between the young stellar objects (YSOs) in the VLA 1623 system. We find that VLA 1623W is unlikely to be an ejected YSO, as has been previously proposed. While we cannot rule out that VLA 1623W is a unrelated YSO, we propose that it is a true companion star to the VLA 1623A/B system and that the these stars formed in situ through turbulent fragmentation and have had only some dynamical interactions since their inception.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric heating and magnetism driven by $^{22}$Ne distillation in isolated white dwarfs</title>

Abstract: The origin of atmospheric heating in the cool, magnetic white dwarf GD 356 remains unsolved nearly 40 years after its discovery. This once idiosyncratic star with $T_{\rm eff}\approx7500$ K, yet Balmer lines in Zeeman-split emission is now part of a growing class of white dwarfs exhibiting similar features, and which are tightly clustered in the HR diagram suggesting an intrinsic power source. This paper proposes that convective motions associated with an internal dynamo can power electric currents along magnetic field lines that heat the atmosphere via Ohmic dissipation. Such currents would require a dynamo driven by core $^{22}$Ne distillation, and would further corroborate magnetic field generation in white dwarfs by this process. The model predicts that the heating will be highest near the magnetic poles, and virtually absent toward the equator, in agreement with observations. This picture is also consistent with the absence of X-ray or extreme ultraviolet emission, because the resistivity would decrease by several orders of magnitude at the typical coronal temperatures. The proposed model suggests that i) DAHe stars are mergers with enhanced $^{22}$Ne that enables distillation and may result in significant cooling delays; and ii) any mergers that distill neon will generate magnetism and chromospheres. The predicted chromospheric emission is consistent with the two known massive DQe white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the statistical equilibrium of H$^-$ in stellar atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The negative hydrogen ion H$^-$ is, almost without exception, treated in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) in the modelling of F, G, and K stars, where it is the dominant opacity source in the visual spectral region. This assumption rests in practice on a study from the 1960s. Since that work, knowledge of relevant atomic processes and theoretical calculations of stellar atmospheres and their spectra have advanced significantly, but this question has not been reexamined. We present calculations based on a slightly modified analytical model that includes H, H$_2$, and H$^-$, together with modern atomic data and a grid of 1D LTE theoretical stellar atmosphere models with stellar parameters ranging from T$_\mathrm{eff} = 4000$ to 7000~K, $\log{g} = 1$ to 5 cm/s$^2$, and [Fe/H]$=-3$ to 0. We find direct non-LTE effects on populations in spectrum-forming regions, continua, and spectral lines of about 1-2% in stars with higher T$_\mathrm{eff}$ and/or lower $\log g$. Effects in models for solar parameters are smaller by a factor of 10, about 0.1-0.2%, and are practically absent in models with lower T$_\mathrm{eff}$ and/or higher $\log g$. These departures from LTE found in our calculations originate from the radiative recombination of electrons with hydrogen to form H$^-$ exceeding photodetachment, that is, overrecombination. Modern atomic data are not a source of significant differences compared to the previous work, although detailed data for processes on H$_2$ resolved with vibrational and rotational states provide a more complete and complex picture of the role of H$_2$ in the equilibrium of H$^-$. In the context of modern studies of stellar spectra at the percent level, our results suggest that this question requires further attention, including a more extensive reaction network, and indirect effects due to non-LTE electron populations.</description>

      <title>Bumpy Superluminous Supernovae Powered by a Magnetar-star Binary Engine</title>

Abstract: Wolf-Rayet stars in close binary systems can be tidally spun up by their companions, potentially leaving behind fast-spinning highly-magnetized neutron stars, known as ``magnetars", after core collapse. These newborn magnetars can transfer rotational energy into heating and accelerating the ejecta, producing hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). In this {\em{Letter}}, we propose that the magnetar wind of the newborn magnetar could significantly evaporate its companion star, typically a main-sequence or helium star, if the binary system is not disrupted by the {abrupt mass loss and} SN kick. The subsequent heating and acceleration of the evaporated star material along with the SN ejecta by the magnetar wind can produce a post-peak bump in the SLSN lightcurve. Our model can reproduce the primary peaks and post-peak bumps of four example observed multiband SLSN lightcurves, revealing that the mass of the evaporated material could be $\sim0.4-0.6\,M_\odot$ if the material is hydrogen-rich. {We propose that the magnetar could induce strongly enhanced evaporation from its companion star near the pericenter if the orbit of the post-SN binary is highly eccentric, ultimately generating multiple post-peak bumps in the SLSN lightcurves. This ``magnetar-star binary engine" model may offer a possible explanation for the evolution of polarization, along with the origin and velocity broadening of late-time hydrogen or helium broad spectral features observed in some bumpy SLSNe.} The diversity in the lightcurves and spectra of SLSNe may be attributed to the wide variety of companion stars and post-SN binary systems.</description>

      <title>The neutron star mass, distance, and inclination from precision timing of the brilliant millisecond pulsar J0437$-$4715</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observation of neutron stars enables the otherwise impossible study of fundamental physical processes. The timing of binary radio pulsars is particularly powerful, as it enables precise characterization of their (three-dimensional) positions and orbits. PSR~J0437$-$4715 is an important millisecond pulsar for timing array experiments and is also a primary target for the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). The main aim of the NICER mission is to constrain the neutron star equation of state by inferring the compactness ($M_p/R$) of the star. Direct measurements of the mass $M_p$ from pulsar timing therefore substantially improve constraints on the radius $R$ and the equation of state. Here we use observations spanning 26 years from Murriyang, the 64-m Parkes radio telescope, to improve the timing model for this pulsar. Among the new precise measurements are the pulsar mass $M_p=1.418\pm 0.044$ $M_{\odot}$, distance $D=156.96 \pm 0.11$ pc, and orbital inclination angle $i=137.506 \pm 0.016^\circ$, which can be used to inform the X-ray pulse profile models inferred from NICER observations. We demonstrate that these results are consistent between multiple data sets from the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA), each modeled with different noise assumptions. Using the longest available PPTA data set, we measure an apparent second derivative of the pulsar spin frequency and discuss how this can be explained either by kinematic effects due to the proper motion and radial velocity of the pulsar or excess low-frequency noise such as a gravitational-wave background.</description>
