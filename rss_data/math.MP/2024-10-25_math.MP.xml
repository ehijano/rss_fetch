      <title>Cosmological Landsberg Finsler spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We locally classify all possible cosmological homogeneous and isotropic Landsberg-type Finsler structures, in 4-dimensions. Among them, we identify viable non-stationary Finsler spacetimes, i.e. those geometries leading to a physical causal structure and a dynamical universe. Noting that any non-stationary Landsberg metric must be actually non-Berwaldian (i.e., it should be a so-called 'unicorn'), we construct the unique Finsler, non-Berwaldian Landsberg generalization of Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker geometry.</description>

      <title>Continuum limit of resonances for discrete Schr\"{o}dinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider complex resonances for discrete and continuous Schr\"odinger operators, and we show that the resonances of discrete models converge to resonances of continuous models in the continuum limit. The potential is supposed to be a sum of an exterior dilation analytic function and an exponentially decaying function, which may have local singularities. The proof employs a generalization of the norm resolvent convergence of discrete Schr\"odinger operators by Nakamura and Tadano (2021), combined with the complex distortion method in the Fourier space. Our results confirm that the complex resonances can be approximately computed using discrete Schr\"odinger operators. We also give a recipe for the construction of approximate discrete operators for Schr\"odinger operators with singular potentials.</description>

      <title>On Classification and Geometric Characterizations of Ensembled $2\times2$ Pseudo Hermitian and PT-Symmetric Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian matrices $H\in M_2(\mathbb{C})$ satisfying the relation $ H^{\dag}G = GH $, for invertible and singular Hermitian matrices $G$ have been studied. The matrices $H$ corresponding to invertible $G$ are known in the literature as G-pseudo Hermitian matrices. We label the matrices corresponding to the singular $G_s$ as $G_s$-pseudo Hermitian. We have proved that all $ 2\times 2$ $G$-pseudo Hermitian matrices are PT-symmetric. For a given $G$ ($G_s$), all $G$ ($G_s$)-pseudo-Hermitian $H\in M_2(\mathbb{C})$ are found to be expressed as a linear variety. It is further found that for any two Hermitian $G_i,G_j\in M_2(\mathbb{C})$ such that $G_i\neq \lambda G_j$, there always exists exactly one trace less $H\in M_2(\mathbb{C})$ (up to real scaling) which is pseudo-Hermitian with respect to both these $G$ matrices. The set of all $G$- and $G_s$- pseudo-Hermitian matrices has been divided into seven distinct ensembles of matrices and the set of all PT-symmetric matrices in $M_2(\mathbb{C})$ is partitioned into four cells, denoted by $S_1,S_2,S_3$ and $S_4$. The ensembles of trace-less G-pseudo Hermitian matrices are shown to be written as a linear combination of three basis elements from these cells. When $\mathrm{Tr}(G) = 0$, one basis element is from $S_1$ and the other two are from $S_2$. On the other hand, when $\mathrm{Tr}(G)\neq0$, one basis element is from $S_1$ and the other two are from $S_4$. The determinant of such ensembles of trace-less matrices are shown to be quadrics, which could be hyperboloid of two sheets, hyperboloid of one sheet, ellipsoid or quadric cone for invertible $G$, whereas it is two parallel planes or a plane for singular $G_s$. Finally, the set of all the matrices $G\in M_2(\mathbb{C})$, satisfying $H^{\dagger}G = GH$, given a specific $H\in M_2(\mathbb{C})$, are shown to be describable in terms of quadratic variety.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for the log-Gamma polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conjecture an explicit expression for the lower tail large deviation rate function of the partition function of the log-Gamma polymer. We rigorously prove our result, except for one step for which we only provide heuristic evidence. We show that the large deviation rate function matches with that of last passage percolation with exponential weights in the zero-temperature limit, and with the lower tail of the Tracy-Widom distribution for moderate deviations.</description>

      <title>A universal inequality on the unitary 2D CFT partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the conjecture proposed by Hartman, Keller and Stoica [HKS14]: the grand-canonical free energy of a unitary 2D CFT with a sparse spectrum below the scaling dimension $\frac{c}{12}+\epsilon$ and below the twist $\frac{c}{12}$ is universal in the large $c$ limit for all $\beta_L\beta_R \neq 4\pi^2$.
  The technique of the proof allows us to derive a one-parameter (with parameter $\alpha\in(0,1]$) family of universal inequalities on the unitary 2D CFT partition function with general central charge $c\geqslant 0$, using analytical modular bootstrap. We derive an iterative equation for the domain of validity of the inequality on the $(\beta_L,\beta_R)$ plane. The infinite iteration of this equation gives the boundary of maximal-validity domain, which depends on the parameter $\alpha$ in the inequality.
  In the $c \to \infty$ limit, with the additional assumption of a sparse spectrum below the scaling dimension $\frac{c}{12} + \epsilon$ and the twist $\frac{\alpha c}{12}$ (with $\alpha \in (0,1]$ fixed), our inequality shows that the grand-canonical free energy exhibits a universal large $c$ behavior in the maximal-validity domain. This domain, however, does not cover the entire $(\beta_L, \beta_R)$ plane, except in the case of $\alpha = 1$. For $\alpha = 1$, this proves the conjecture proposed by [HKS14], and for $\alpha &lt; 1$, it quantifies how sparseness in twist affects the regime of universality. Furthermore, this implies a precise lower bound on the temperature of near-extremal BTZ black holes, above which we can trust the black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum chaos without chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum chaos is a quantum many-body phenomenon that is associated with a number of intricate properties, such as level repulsion in energy spectra or distinct scalings of out-of-time ordered correlation functions. In this work, we introduce a novel class of "pseudochaotic" quantum Hamiltonians that fundamentally challenges the conventional understanding of quantum chaos and its relationship to computational complexity. Our ensemble is computationally indistinguishable from the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) of strongly-interacting Hamiltonians, widely considered to be a quintessential model for quantum chaos. Surprisingly, despite this effective indistinguishability, our Hamiltonians lack all conventional signatures of chaos: it exhibits Poissonian level statistics, low operator complexity, and weak scrambling properties. This stark contrast between efficient computational indistinguishability and traditional chaos indicators calls into question fundamental assumptions about the nature of quantum chaos. We, furthermore, give an efficient quantum algorithm to simulate Hamiltonians from our ensemble, even though simulating Hamiltonians from the true GUE is known to require exponential time. Our work establishes fundamental limitations on Hamiltonian learning and testing protocols and derives stronger bounds on entanglement and magic state distillation. These results reveal a surprising separation between computational and information-theoretic perspectives on quantum chaos, opening new avenues for research at the intersection of quantum chaos, computational complexity, and quantum information. Above all, it challenges conventional notions of what it fundamentally means to actually observe complex quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Probability Geometrically Realized in Projective Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The principal goal of this paper is to pass all quantum probability formulas to the projective space associated to the complex Hilbert space of a given quantum system. Quantum events have consecutive and conditional probabilities, which have been used in the author's previous work to clarify `collapse' and to generalize the concept of entanglement by incorporating it into quantum probability theory. Also all (possibly unbounded) self-adjoint operators will be passed to the projective space setting. In this way all of standard textbook quantum theory can be understood as a geometric theory of projective subspaces without any special role for the zero-dimensional projective subspaces, which are also called pure states. The upshot is that quantum theory is the probability theory of projective subspaces, or equivalently, of quantum events. The ideas are developed here in the context of a type I factor, but comments will be given about how to adopt this approach to more general von Neumann algebras.</description>

Abstract: The BV formalism is a well-established method for analyzing symmetries and quantization of field theories. In this paper we use the BV formalism to derive partition functions of gauge invariant operators up to equations of motions and their redundancies of selected theories. We discuss various interpretations of the results, some dualities and relation to first quantized models.</description>

      <title>Futaki Invariants and Reflexive Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Futaki invariants of the classical moduli space of 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories determine whether they have a conformal fixed point in the IR. We systematically compute the Futaki invariants for a large family of 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories coming from D3-branes probing Calabi-Yau 3-fold singularities whose bases are Gorenstein Fano surfaces. In particular, we focus on the toric case where the Fano surfaces are given by the 16 reflexive convex polygons and the moduli spaces are given by the corresponding toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds. We study the distribution of and conjecture new bounds on the Futaki invariants with respect to various topological and geometric quantities. These include the minimum volume of the Sasaki-Einstein base manifolds as well as the Chern and Euler numbers of the toric Fano surfaces. Even though the moduli spaces for the family of theories studied are known to be K-stable, our work sheds new light on how the topological and geometric quantities restrict the Futaki invariants for a plethora of moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>Closed real plane curves of hyperelliptic solutions of focusing gauged modified KdV equation of genus three</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The real and imaginary parts of the focusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (MKdV) equation defined over the complex field $\mathbb{C}$ give rise to the focusing gauged MKdV (FGMKdV) equations. As a generalization of Euler's elastica whose curvature obeys the focusing static MKdV (FSMKdV) equation, we study real plane curves whose curvature obeys the FGMKdV equation since the FSMKdV equation is a special case of the FGMKdV equation. In this paper, we focus on the hyperelliptic curves of genus three. By tuning some moduli parameters and initial conditions, we show closed real plane curves associated with the FGMKdV equation beyond Euler's figure-eight of elastica.</description>

      <title>Hysteresis in a Generalized Kuramoto Model with a Simplified Realistic Coupling Function and Inhomogeneous Coupling Strengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate hysteresis in a generalized Kuramoto model with identical oscillators, focusing on coupling strength inhomogeneity, which results in oscillators being coupled to others with varying strength, and a simplified, more realistic coupling function. With the more realistic coupling function and the coupling strength inhomogeneity, each oscillator acquires an effective intrinsic frequency proportional to its individual coupling strength. This is analogous to the positive coupling strength-frequency correlation introduced explicitly or implicitly in some previous models with nonidentical oscillators that show explosive synchronization and hysteresis. Through numerical simulations and analysis using truncated Gaussian, uniform, and truncated power-law coupling strength distributions, we observe that the system can exhibit abrupt phase transitions and hysteresis. The distribution of coupling strengths significantly affects the hysteresis regions within the parameter space of the coupling function. Additionally, numerical simulations of models with weighted networks including a brain network confirm the existence of hysteresis due to the realistic coupling function and coupling strength inhomogeneity, suggesting the broad applicability of our findings to complex real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Planar decomposition of bipartite HOMFLY polynomials in symmetric representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the recently discovered planar decomposition (Kauffman bracket) for the HOMFLY polynomials of bipartite knot/link diagrams to (anti)symmetrically colored HOMFLY polynomials. Cabling destroys planarity, but it is restored after projection to (anti)symmetric representations. This allows to go beyond arborescent calculus, which so far produced the majority of results for colored polynomials. Technicalities include combinations of projectors, and these can be handled rigorously, without any guess-work -- what can be also useful for other considerations, where reliable quantization was so far unavailable. We explicitly provide simple examples of calculation of the HOMFLY polynomials in symmetric representations with the use of our planar technique. These examples reveal what we call the bipartite evolution and the bipartite decomposition of squares of $\mathcal{R}$-matrices eigenvalues in the antiparallel channel.</description>

      <title>Stochastic optimal control of open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the generic problem of state preparation for open quantum systems. As is well known, open quantum systems can be simulated by quantum trajectories described by a stochastic Schr\"odinger equation. In this context, the state preparation problem becomes a stochastic optimal control (SOC) problem. The SOC problem requires the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, which is generally challenging to solve. A notable exception are the so-called path integral (PI) control problems for which one can estimate the optimal control solution by sampling. We derive a class of quantum state preparation problems that can be solved with PI control. Since our method only requires the propagation of state vectors $\psi$, it presents a quadratic advantage over density-centered approaches, such as PMP-based methods. Unlike most conventional quantum control algorithms, it does not require computing gradients of the cost function to determine the optimal controls. Instead, the optimal control is computed by iterative importance sampling. The SOC setting allows in principle for a state feedback control solution, whereas Lindblad-based methods are restricted to open-loop control. Here, we illustrate the effectiveness of our approach through some examples of open loop control solutions for single- and multi-qubit systems.</description>

      <title>A Field Theory Framework of Incompressible Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study develops an effective theoretical framework that couples two vector fields: the velocity field $\mathbf{u}$ and an auxiliary vorticity field $\boldsymbol{\xi}$. Together, these fields form a larger conserved dynamical system. Within this framework, the incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equation and a complementary vorticity equation with negative viscosity are derived. By introducing the concept of light-cone vorticity $\boldsymbol{\eta}_\pm = \mathbf{w} \pm \boldsymbol{\xi}$, the paper constructs a unified framework for coupled dynamics. Furthermore, it explores the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking from $SU(2)$ gauge theory to $U(1) \times U(1)$, which leads to the emergence of the coupled vector field theory in the non-relativistic limit. This approach uncovers a connection between fluid dynamics and fundamental gauge theories, suggesting that the NS equations describe a subsystem where dissipation results from energy transfer between the velocity and auxiliary fields. The study concludes by linking the complete dynamical framework to the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen-Zumino (ANOZ) theory, a non-Abelian generalization of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, offering new insights into fluid dynamics and quantum fluid theory.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the rotating-wave approximation of the Dicke model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically find quantitative, non-perturbative bounds to the validity of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) for the multi-atom generalization of the quantum Rabi model: the Dicke model. Precisely, we bound the norm of the difference between the evolutions of states generated by the Dicke model and its rotating-wave approximated counterpart, that is, the Tavis-Cummings model. The intricate role of the parameters of the model in determining the bounds is discussed and compared with numerical results. Our bounds are intrinsically state-dependent and, in particular, are significantly different in the cases of entangled and non-entangled states; this behaviour also seems to be confirmed by the numerics.</description>

      <title>Encoded quantum gates by geometric rotation on tessellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We utilize the symmetry groups of regular tessellations on two-dimensional surfaces of different constant curvatures, including spheres, Euclidean planes and hyperbolic planes, to encode a qubit or qudit into the physical degrees of freedom on these surfaces. We show that the codes exhibit decent error correction properties by analysis via geometric considerations and the representation theory of the isometry groups on the corresponding surfaces. Interestingly, we demonstrate how this formalism enables the implementation of certain logical operations via geometric rotations of the surfaces. We provide a variety of concrete constructions of such codes associated with different tessellations, which give rise to different logical groups.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable models for 2+1D topological phases derived from crossed modules of semisimple Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.02766v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define an exactly solvable model for 2+1D topological phases of matter on a triangulated surface derived from a crossed module of semisimple finite-dimensional Hopf algebras, the `Hopf-algebraic higher Kitaev model'. This model generalizes both the Kitaev quantum double model for a semisimple Hopf algebra and the full higher Kitaev model derived from a 2-group, and can hence be interpreted as a Hopf-algebraic discrete higher gauge theory.
  We construct a family of crossed modules of semisimple Hopf algebras, $(\mathscr{F}_{\mathbb{C}}(X) \otimes \mathbb{C}E \xrightarrow{\partial} \mathscr{F}_{\mathbb{C}}(Y) \rtimes \mathbb{C} G, \triangleright)$, that depends on four finite groups, $E,G,X$ and $Y$. We calculate the ground-state spaces of the resulting model on a triangulated surface when $G=E=\{1\}$ and when $Y=\{1\}$, prove that those ground-state spaces are canonically independent of the triangulations, and so depend only on the underlying surface; and moreover we find a 2+1D TQFT whose state spaces on surfaces give the ground-state spaces. These TQFTs are particular cases of Quinn's finite total homotopy TQFT and hence the state spaces assigned to surfaces are free vector spaces on sets of homotopy classes of maps from a surface to homotopy finite spaces, in this case obtained as classifying spaces of finite groupoids and finite crossed modules of groupoids.
  We leave it as an open problem whether the ground-state space of the Hopf-algebraic higher Kitaev model on a triangulated surface is independent of the triangulation for general crossed modules of semisimple Hopf algebras, whether a TQFT always exists whose state space on a surface gives the ground-state space of the model, and whether the ground-state space of the model obtained from $E,G,X,Y$ can always be given a homotopical explanation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11696v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past three decades, it has been shown that discrete and continuous media can support topologically nontrivial waves. Recently, it was shown that the same is true of the vacuum, in particular, right (R) and left (L) circularly polarized photons are topologically nontrivial. Here, we study the topology of another class of massless particles, namely gravitons. We show that the collection of all gravitons forms a topologically trivial vector bundle over the lightcone, allowing us to construct a globally smooth basis for gravitons. The graviton bundle also has a natural geometric splitting into two topologically nontrivial subbundles, consisting of the R and L gravitons. The R and L gravitons are unitary irreducible bundle representations of the Poincar\'{e} group, and are thus elementary particles; their topology is characterized by the Chern numbers $\mp 4$. This nontrivial topology obstructs the splitting of graviton angular momentum into spin and orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <title>RKHS, Berezin and Odzijewicz-type quantizations on arbitrary compact smooth manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we define Berezin-type and Odzijewicz-type quantizations on compact smooth manifolds. The method is we embed the smooth manifold of real dimension $n$ into ${\mathbb C}P^n$ and induce the quantizations from there. The standard way by which reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces are defined on submanifolds gives a way to define the pullback coherent states. In Berezin-type quantization the Hilbert space of quantization is the pullback (by the embedding) of the Hilbert space of geometric quantization of ${\mathbb C}P^n$. In the Odzijewicz-type quantization one has to consider a tensor product of the geometric quantization line bundle with holomorphic $n$-forms. In the Berezin case, the operators that are quantized are those induced from the ambient space ${\mathbb C}P^n$. The Berezin-type quantization exhibited here is a generalization of an earlier work of the author and Ghosh. In both Berezin and Odzijewicz-type quantizations we first exhibit this quantization explicitly on ${\mathbb C}P^n$ and we induce the quantization on the smooth compact embedded manifold from ${\mathbb C}P^n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a direct combinatorial proof of a Feynman graph identity which implies a wide generalization of a formality theorem by Kontsevich. For a Feynman graph $\Gamma$, we associate to each vertex a position $x_v \in \mathbb R$ and to each edge $e$ the combination $s_e = a_e^{-\frac 12} \left( x^+_e - x^-_e \right)$, where $x^\pm_e$ are the positions of the two end vertices of $e$, and $a_e$ is a Schwinger parameter. The "topological propagator" $P_e = e^{-s_e^2}\text d s_e$ includes a part proportional to $\text d x_v$ and a part proportional to $\text d a_e$. Integrating the product of all $P_e$ over positions produces a differential form $\alpha_\Gamma$ in the variables $a_e$. We derive an explicit combinatorial formula for $\alpha_\Gamma$, and we prove that $\alpha_\Gamma \wedge \alpha_\Gamma=0$.</description>

      <title>Module categories of the generic Virasoro VOA and quantum groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.12969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the equivalence between two braided tensor categories. On the one hand, we consider the category of modules of the Virasoro vertex operator algebra with a generic central charge (generic Virasoro VOA) generated by those simple modules lying in the first row of the Kac table. On the other hand, we take the category of finite-dimensional type I modules of the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_{q} (\mathfrak{sl}_{2})$ with $q$ determined by the central charge. This is a continuation of our previous work in which we examined intertwining operators for the generic Virasoro VOA in detail. Our strategy to show the categorical equivalence is to take those results as input and directly compare the structures of the tensor categories. Therefore, we are to execute the most elementary proof of categorical equivalence. We also study the category of $C_{1}$-cofinite modules of the generic Virasoro VOA. We show that it is equivalent to the category of finite-dimensional type I modules of $\mathcal{U}_{q} (\mathfrak{sl}_{2})\otimes \mathcal{U}_{\tilde{q}} (\mathfrak{sl}_{2})$ as a tensor category, where $q$ and $\tilde{q}$ are again related to the central charge.</description>

      <title>Gradual convergence for Langevin dynamics on a degenerate potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11026v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an ordinary differential equation with a degenerate global attractor at the origin, to which we add a white noise with a small parameter that regulates its intensity. Under general conditions, for any fixed intensity, as time tends to infinity, the solution of this stochastic dynamics converges exponentially fast in total variation distance to a unique equilibrium distribution. We suitably accelerate the random dynamics and show that the preceding convergence is gradual, that is, the function that associates to each fixed $t\geq 0$ the total variation distance between the accelerated random dynamics at time $t$ and its equilibrium distribution converges, as the noise intensity tends to zero, to a decreasing function with values in $(0,1)$. Moreover, we prove that this limit function for each fixed $t \geq 0$ corresponds to the total variation distance between the marginal, at time $t$, of a stochastic differential equation that comes down from infinity and its corresponding equilibrium distribution. This completes the classification of all possible behaviors of the total variation distance between the time marginal of the aforementioned stochastic dynamics and its invariant measure for one dimensional well-behaved convex potentials. In addition, there is no cut-off phenomenon for this one-parameter family of random processes and asymptotics of the mixing times are derived.</description>

Abstract: We give a framework for growth models on posets which simultaneously generalizes the Classical Sequential Growth models for posets from causal set theory and the tree growth models of natural growth and simple tree classes, the latter of which also appear as solutions of combinatorial Dyson-Schwinger equations in quantum field theory. We prove which cases of the Classical Sequential Growth models give subHopf algebras of the Hopf algebra of posets, in analogy to a characterization due to Foissy in the Dyson-Schwinger case. We find a family of generating sets for the Connes-Moscovici Hopf algebra.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the supercritical phase of Voronoi percolation on $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\geq 3$, is well behaved in the sense that for every $p&gt;p_c(d)$ local uniqueness of macroscopic clusters happens with high probability. As a consequence, truncated connection probabilities decay exponentially fast and percolation happens on sufficiently thick 2D slabs. This is the analogue of the celebrated result of Grimmett &amp; Marstrand for Bernoulli percolation and serves as the starting point for renormalization techniques used to study several fine properties of the supercritical phase.</description>

      <title>On CCGG, the De Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian formulation of canonical gauge gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper gives a brief overview of the manifestly covariant canonical gauge gravity (CCGG) that is rooted in the De Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian formulation of relativistic field theories, and the proven methodology of the canonical transformation theory. That framework derives, from a few basic physical and mathematical assumptions, equations describing generic matter and gravity dynamics with the spin connection emerging as a Yang Mills-type gauge field. While the interaction of any matter field with spacetime is fixed just by the transformation property of that field, a concrete gravity ansatz is introduced by the choice of the free (kinetic) gravity Hamiltonian. The key elements of this approach are discussed and its implications for particle dynamics and cosmology presented. Among the results are especially: - Anomalous Pauli coupling of spinors to curvature and torsion of spacetime, - spacetime with (A)dS ground state, inertia, torsion and geometrical vacuum energy, - Zero-energy balance of the Universe leading to a vanishing cosmological constant and torsional dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the application of BRST and BRST-BV approaches to construct the generic off-shell local Lorentz covariant cubic interaction vertices for irreducible massless and massive higher integer spin fields (as the candidates for massive particles in the Dark Matter problem) on $d$-dimensional Minkowski spaces. It is shown that equivalence among two Lagrangian dynamics for the same cubically interacting fields with given masses and spins obtained by means of the approach with complete BRST, $Q$, operator and of one with incomplete BRST, $Q_c$, operator in presence of consistent off-shell holonomic (traceless) constraints can be uplifted from the equivalence of the Lagrangians for free higher spin fields. We found that to get non-contradictory Lagrangians for irreducible interacting higher-spin fields within approach with $Q_c$ operator, together with off-shell algebraic constraints in addition to necessary condition of superconmmuting of $Q_c$ with appropriate holonomic constraints on the field and gauge parameter vectors, these constraints should form Abelian superalgebra both with BRST operator above and with operators of cubic vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit stress problems in linear elasticity to provide a perspective from the geometrical and functionalanalytic points of view. For the static stress problem of linear elasticity with mixed boundary conditions we write the associated pair of unbounded adjoint operators. The stress solution is found as an intersection of affine translations of the fundamental subspaces of the adjoint operators. In particular, we treat the equilibrium equation in the operator form, involving spaces of traces on a part of the boundary, known as Lions-Magenes spaces. Our analysis of the pair of adjoint operators for the problem with mixed boundary conditions relies on the properties of the analogous pair of operators for the problem with the displacement boundary conditions, which we also include in the paper.</description>

      <title>Higher Gauge Theory and Integrability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the study of integrable systems from a gauge theoretic perspective. This development originated with the introduction of $4$d Chern-Simons theory with defects, which provided a systematic framework for constructing two-dimensional integrable systems. In this article, we propose a novel approach to studying higher-dimensional integrable models employing techniques from higher category theory. Starting with higher Chern-Simons theory on the $4$-manifold $\mathbb{R}\times Y$, we complexify and compactify the real line to $\mathbb{C}P^1$ and introduce the disorder defect $\omega=z^{-1}\mathrm{d} z $. This procedure defines a holomorphic five-dimensional variant of higher Chern-Simons theory, which, when endowed with suitable boundary conditions, allows for the localisation to a three-dimensional theory on $Y$. The equations of motion of the resulting model are equivalent to the flatness of a $2$-connection $(L,H)$, that we then use to construct the corresponding higher holonomies. We prove that these are invariants of homotopies relative boundary, which enables the construction of conserved quantities. The latter are labelled by both the categorical characters of a Lie crossed-module and the infinite number of homotopy classes of surfaces relative boundary in $Y$. Moreover, we also demonstrate that the $3$d theory has left and right acting symmetries whose current algebra is given by an infinite dimensional centrally extended affine Lie 2-algebra. Both of these conditions are direct higher homotopy analogues of the properties satisfied by the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten CFT, which we therefore interpret as facets of integrable structures.</description>

      <title>The differential of self-consistent transfer operators and the local convergence to equilibrium of mean field strongly coupled dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the differential of a self-consistent transfer operator at a fixed point of the operator itself and show that its spectral properties can be used to establish a kind of local exponential convergence to equilibrium: probability measures near the fixed point converge exponentially fast to the fixed point by the iteration of the transfer operator. This holds also in the strong coupling case. We also show that for mean field coupled systems satisfying uniformly a Lasota-Yorke inequality the differential does also. We present examples of application of the general results to self-consistent transfer operators based on deterministic expanding maps considered with different couplings, outside the weak coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Quantum Theory, Gravity and Second Order Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that a consistent coupling of a quantum theory to gravity requires an extension of ordinary `first order' Riemannian geometry to second order Riemannian geometry, which incorporates both a line element and an area element. This extension results in a misalignment between the dimension of the manifold and the dimension of the tangent spaces. In particular, we find that for a 4-dimensional spacetime, tangent spaces become 18-dimensional. We then discuss the construction of physical theories within this framework, which involves the introduction of terms that are quadratic in derivatives in the action. On a flat spacetime, the quadratic sector is perpendicular to the first order sector and only affects the normalization of the path integral, whereas in a curved spacetime the quadratic sector couples to the first order sector. Moreover, we show that, despite the introduction of higher order derivatives, the Ostragradski instability can be avoided, due to an order mixing of the two sectors. Finally, we comment on extensions to higher order geometry and on relations with non-commutative and generalized geometry.</description>

      <title>Truncating Dyson-Schwinger Equations Based on Lefschetz Thimble Decomposition and Borel Resummation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Truncating the Dyson-Schwinger (DS) equations in quantum field theory presents a practical challenge. In this paper, we consider the zero-dimensional prototype of the path integrals in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. Using the Lefschetz thimble decomposition and the saddle point expansion, we derive multiple asymptotic formal series of the correlation function, which are associated with the (non-)perturbative saddle points. Furthermore, we reconstruct the exact correlation function employing the Borel resummation. Based on these exact correlation functions, we propose a truncation method of the DS equations using the large $n$ asymptotic behavior.</description>
