      <title>Visibly Fair Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Priority-based allocation of individuals to positions are pervasive, and elimination of justified envy is often, an absolute requirement. This leaves serial dictatorship (SD) as the only rule that avoids justified envy under standard direct mechanisms. What if SD outcomes are undesirable from a designer's perspective? We propose visible fairness, which demands fairness relative to the (potentially purposefully incomplete) preference information the mechanism elicits. Visibly fair mechanisms generalize SD; we fully characterize them and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for strategy-proofness. We show how to apply these results to design strategy-proof visibly fair rules that satisfy a broad class of distributional objectives. Visible fairness, however, results in a new information-efficiency trade-off: meeting distributional goals leads to the avoidance of eliciation of information about preferences that could prevent inefficiencies.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Equilibrium Analysis of the Boston Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the performance of the Boston mechanism under equilibrium play in uniform random markets. We provide two results. First, while the share of students assigned to their first preference is 63% under truthfulness, this fraction becomes vanishingly small in any Nash equilibrium of the preference revelation game induced by the Boston mechanism. Second, we show that there is a Nash equilibrium of the corresponding preference revelation game where the average student is assigned to a highly undesirable school-dramatically worse ranked than the logarithmic rank achieved under truthfulness.</description>

      <title>Reasoning about Bounded Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive decision-making relies on strategic reasoning. Two prominent frameworks are (1) models of bounded reasoning, exemplified by level-$k$ models, which keep reasoning implicit, and (2) epistemic game theory, which makes reasoning explicit. We connect these approaches by "lifting" static complete-information games into incomplete-information settings where payoff types reflect players' reasoning depths as in level-$k$ models. We introduce downward rationalizability, defined via minimal belief restrictions capturing the basic idea common to level-$k$ models, to provide robust yet well-founded predictions in games where bounded reasoning matters. We then refine these belief restrictions to analyze the foundations of two seminal models of bounded reasoning: the classic level-$k$ model and the cognitive hierarchy model. Our findings shed light on the distinction between hard cognitive bounds on reasoning and beliefs about co-players' types. Furthermore, they offer insights into robustness issues relevant for market design. Thus, our approach unifies key level-$k$ models building on clear foundations of strategic reasoning stemming from epistemic game theory.</description>

      <title>Distributed Interview Selection for Stable Matching in Large Random Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In real-world settings of the Deferred Acceptance stable matching algorithm, such as the American medical residency match (NRMP), school choice programs, and various national university entrance systems, candidates need to decide which programs to list. In many of these settings there is an initial phase of interviews or information gathering which affect the preferences on one or both sides. We ask: which interviews should candidates seek? We study this question in a model, introduced by Lee (2016) and modified by Allman and Ashlagi (2023), with preferences based on correlated cardinal utilities.
  We describe a distributed, low-communication strategy for the doctors and students, which lead to non-match rates of $e^{(-\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k}))}$ in the residency setting and $e^{(-\widetilde{O}(k))}$ in the school-choice setting, where $k$ is the number of interviews per doctor in the first setting, and the number of proposals per student in the second setting; these bounds do not apply to the agents with the lowest public ratings, the bottommost agents, who may not fare as well. We also obtain bounds on the expected utilities each non-bottommost agent obtains.
  These results are parameterized by the capacity of the hospital programs and schools. Larger capacities improve the outcome for the hospitals and schools, but don't significantly affect the outcomes of the doctors or students. Finally, in the school choice setting we obtain an $\epsilon$-Nash type equilibrium for the students apart from the bottommost ones; importantly, the equilibrium holds regardless of the actions of the bottommost students. We also discuss to what extent this result extends to the residency setting. We complement our theoretical results with an experimental study that shows the asymptotic results hold for real-world values of $n$.</description>

      <title>Game Connectivity and Adaptive Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10609v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the typical structure of games in terms of the connectivity properties of their best-response graphs. Our central result shows that, among games that are `generic' (without indifferences) and that have a pure Nash equilibrium, all but a small fraction are \emph{connected}, meaning that every action profile that is not a pure Nash equilibrium can reach every pure Nash equilibrium via best-response paths. This has important implications for dynamics in games. In particular, we show that there are simple, uncoupled, adaptive dynamics for which period-by-period play converges almost surely to a pure Nash equilibrium in all but a small fraction of generic games that have one (which contrasts with the known fact that there is no such dynamic that leads almost surely to a pure Nash equilibrium in \emph{every} generic game that has one). We build on recent results in probabilistic combinatorics for our characterisation of game connectivity.</description>

      <title>Berk-Nash Rationalizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Misspecified learning -- where agents rely on simplified or biased models -- offers a unifying framework for analyzing behavioral biases, cognitive constraints, and systematic misperceptions. We introduce Berk--Nash rationalizability, a new solution concept for such settings that parallels rationalizability in games. Our main result shows that, with probability one, every limit action -- any action played or approached infinitely often -- is Berk--Nash rationalizable. This holds regardless of whether behavior converges and offers a tractable way to bound long-run behavior without solving complex learning dynamics. We illustrate this advantage with a known example and identify general classes of environments where the rationalizable set can be easily characterized.</description>
