      <title>A Polyharmonic Liouville Hierarchy on Complete Manifolds of Nonnegative Ricci Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a complete Liouville--type hierarchy for polyharmonic functions on a broad class of Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. Extending Yau's classical result for harmonic functions and our recent biharmonic Liouville theorem, we prove that on any complete manifold of nonnegative Ricci curvature with a pole, every $k$--polyharmonic function of growth $o(r^{2(k-1)})$ must in fact be $(k-1)$--polyharmonic. Iterating this procedure yields the result that all polyharmonic functions of sublinear growth are constant.The key innovation is a new $L^{2}$ estimate for the Laplacian of a polyharmonic function, obtained by induction through a delicate cutoff construction combined with a hole--filling argument. This provides the first sharp geometric extension of the Euclidean classification of polyharmonic functions to manifolds of nonnegative Ricci curvature, and completes a natural hierarchy of Yau--type Liouville theorems for iterates of the Laplacian.</description>

      <title>The small growth invariants of Goursat distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second of a pair of papers devoted to the local invariants of Goursat distributions. The study of these distributions naturally leads to a tower of spaces over an arbitrary surface, called the monster tower, and thence to connections with the topic of singularities of curves on surfaces. In the prior paper we studied those invariants of Goursat distributions akin to those of curves on surfaces, which we call structural invariants. In this paper we study invariants arising from the small growth sequence of a Goursat distribution, and relate them to the the structural invariants.</description>

      <title>Existence of twisted Calabi flow and deformation from the $J$-flow to Calabi flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a family of twisted Calabi flows connecting the $J$-flow and Calabi flow on a compact K\"ahler manifold with a constant scalar curvature (cscK) metric. We show that for any initial data the twisted Calabi flow near the $J$-flow has long time existence and converges smoothly to the cscK metric. Moreover, we show that if a twisted Calabi flow has long time existence and converges, then the nearby twisted Calabi flow with the same initial data also has long time existence and converges. These results imply the openness of the continuity method to study Chen's long time existence conjecture on (twisted) Calabi flow on cscK manifolds.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue Estimate for the Rough Laplacian on $1$-Forms and its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we establish a geometric lower bound for the first positive eigenvalue $\lambda^{(1)}_{1}$ of the rough Laplacian acting on $1$-forms for closed $2n$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with nonvanishing Euler characteristic. In contrast to the case of functions, such a Li-Yau-type estimate does not hold in general, as evidenced by existing counterexamples. Under assumptions including a lower bound on Ricci curvature, an upper bound on diameter, and an $L^{2p}$-norm bound on the Riemann curvature tensor, we prove that $\lambda^{(1)}_{1}$ is bounded below by a positive constant depending on these parameters. As applications, we derive vanishing results for the Euler characteristic under certain Ricci curvature bounds and the presence of a nonzero Killing vector field, extending classical Bochner-type theorems.</description>

Abstract: This paper consists of three parts: a. exhibit a new gluing result which can dramatically simplify extensions of calibration pairs; b. observe that every Lawlor cone can support coflat calibrations singular only at the origin; c. show that there exist many Lawlor cones which cannot support any smooth calibrations. As an application, we extend our previous work on detecting duality obstruction of calibrations in the smooth category.</description>

      <title>Spectral flow and the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a formula for the spectral flow of a smooth family of twisted Dirac operators on a closed odd-dimensional Riemannian spin manifold, generalizing a result by Getzler. The spectral flow is expressed in terms of the $\hat{A}$-form of the manifold, the odd Chern character form of the family of connections, and the $\xi$-invariants of the initial and final operators. Our proof is based on a reduction to the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem for manifolds with boundary, which provides a conceptually very simple approach to the problem. As an application, we give a proof of Llarull's rigidity theorem for scalar curvature of strictly convex hypersurfaces in Euclidean space which works the same in even and odd dimensions.</description>

      <title>RNNs perform task computations by dynamically warping neural representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analysing how neural networks represent data features in their activations can help interpret how they perform tasks. Hence, a long line of work has focused on mathematically characterising the geometry of such "neural representations." In parallel, machine learning has seen a surge of interest in understanding how dynamical systems perform computations on time-varying input data. Yet, the link between computation-through-dynamics and representational geometry remains poorly understood. Here, we hypothesise that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) perform computations by dynamically warping their representations of task variables. To test this hypothesis, we develop a Riemannian geometric framework that enables the derivation of the manifold topology and geometry of a dynamical system from the manifold of its inputs. By characterising the time-varying geometry of RNNs, we show that dynamic warping is a fundamental feature of their computations.</description>

      <title>Rotation angles of a rotating disc as the holonomy of the Hopf fibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates a simple kinematical model of a disc (Disc B) rolling on the edge of a fixed disc (Disc A) to study the geometric nature of rotation. The total rotation angle $\Delta$ of Disc B after one cycle is decomposed into a dynamical phase $\Delta_d$ and a geometric phase $\Delta_g$. The paper's main contribution is to demonstrate that this geometric phase can be essentially described as the $U(1)$ holonomy of the Hopf fibration with the canonical connection. By using a Gauss map to represent the disc's motion as a curve on a two-sphere ($S^2$), the work connects the physical rotation to the underlying geometry of the Hopf fiber bundle $S^3 \to S^2$ and clarifies the origin of the geometric phase.</description>

      <title>Random walks on rank one symmetric spaces of noncompact type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a central limit theorem, a local limit theorem, and a law of large numbers for a natural random walk on a symmetric space $M$ of non-compact type and rank one. This class of spaces, which includes the complex and quaternionic hyperbolic spaces and the Cayley hyperbolic plane, generalizes the real hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{n}$. Our approach introduces a unified algebraic framework that generalizes the M\"obius addition, previously used for the constant curvature case, to define the random walk via a non-Euclidean summation of variables. We demonstrate that the renormalized walk converges to the heat kernel associated with the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $M$, which plays the role of the limiting normal law. The proofs leverage the harmonic analysis of spherical functions on symmetric spaces. To the best of our knowledge, these results are new in the context of rank one symmetric spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give two flexible and degenerate constructions related to a theorem of Thurston. First, we produce geodesic segments for Thurston's asymmetric metric on Teichm\"uller space $\mathcal{T}(S_g)$ that remain geodesics after adding arbitrary $\varepsilon$-Lipschitz noise to all but one Fenchel-Nielsen coordinate. Then, for all $2 &lt; n \leq 3g-3$ we construct open sets in $\mathcal{T}(S_g)^n$ for which the limit cones of the corresponding representations in $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})^n$ are cones over explicit finite-sided polyhedra. Each construction is as degenerate as possible and has applications to the basic structure and local non-rigidity of the involved objects.</description>

      <title>On elliptic and quasiregularly elliptic manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In his book "Metric structures for Riemannian and non-Riemannian spaces", Gromov defined two properties of Riemannian manifolds, ellipticity and quasiregular ellipticity, and suggested that there may be a connection between the two. Since then, groups of researchers working independently have proved strikingly similar results about these two concepts. We obtain new topological obstructions to the two properties: most notably, we show that closed manifolds of both types must have virtually abelian fundamental group. We also give the first examples of open manifolds which are elliptic but not quasireguarly elliptic and vice versa. Whether there is a direct connection between these properties -- and, in particular, whether they are equivalent for closed manifolds -- remains elusive.</description>

Abstract: We provide an example of a non-collapsed strong Kato limit that is branching, essentially branching, and satisfies neither the $\mathrm{CD}(K,\infty)$ nor the $\mathrm{MCP}(K,N)$ conditions for any $K \in \mathbb{R}$ and $N \in [1,+\infty)$. In particular, this space is not a Ricci limit space. We also construct a compact non-collapsed strong Kato limit that cannot be obtained as Gromov-Hausdorff limit of closed Riemannian surfaces satisfying a uniform small $L^p$ bound \`a la Petersen--Wei.</description>

Abstract: We extend Gromov's conjecture on the sharp width estimate for Riemannian bands with positive scalar curvature to the family case and prove that it holds for fiber bundles with infinite family A-hat area. The method we employ is based on Dirac operators and the family index theory. Our proof relies on a product formula for index bundles established in this paper.</description>

Abstract: Instanton properties of the characteristic connection $\nabla$ on an integrable $G_2$ manifold as well as instanton condition of the torsion connection $\nabla$ on a $Spin(7)$ manifold are investigated. It is shown that for an integrable $G_2$ manifold with $\nabla$-parallel Lee form the curvature of the characteristic connection is a $G_2$ instanton exactly when the torsion 3-form is $\nabla$-parallel. It is observed that on a compact $Spin(7)$ manifold with $\nabla$ closed torsion 3-form the torsion connection is a $Spin(7)$ instanton if and only if the torsion 3-form is parallel with respect to the torsion connection.</description>

      <title>Absolute continuity of Wasserstein barycenters on manifolds with a lower Ricci curvature bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a complete Riemannian manifold $M$ with a lower Ricci curvature bound, we consider barycenters in the Wasserstein space $\mathcal{W}_2(M)$ of probability measures on $M$. We refer to them as Wasserstein barycenters, which by definition are probability measures on $M$. The goal of this article is to present a novel approach to proving their absolute continuity. We introduce a new class of displacement functionals exploiting the Hessian equality for Wasserstein barycenters. To provide suitable instances of such functionals, we revisit Souslin space theory, Dunford-Pettis theorem and the de la Vall\'ee Poussin criterion for uniform integrability. Our method shows that if a probability measure $\mathbb{P}$ on $\mathcal{W}_2(M)$ gives mass to absolutely continuous measures on $M$, then its unique barycenter is also absolutely continuous. This generalizes the previous results on compact manifolds by Kim and Pass arXiv:1412.7726 [math.AP] .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rational homology ellipsoids are certain Liouville domains diffeomorphic to rational homology balls and having Lagrangian pin-wheels as their skeleta. From the point of view of almost toric fibrations, they are a natural generalisation of usual symplectic ellipsoids. We study symplectic embeddings of rational homology ellipsoids into the complex projective plane and we show that for each Markov triple, this problem gives rise to an infinite staircase. A key ingredient in the proof is the result that any two such embeddings are Hamiltonian isotopic. We also prove constraints on sizes for pairs of disjoint embeddings.</description>

      <title>Fractal failures of Ratner rigidity in higher rank geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ratner's theorem shows that in a locally symmetric space of noncompact type and finite volume, every immersed totally geodesic subspace of noncompact type is topologically rigid: its closure is an immersed submanifold.
  We construct the first explicit higher-rank, infinite-volume examples in which this rigidity fails, via floating geodesic planes. Specifically, we exhibit a Zariski-dense Hitchin surface group $\Gamma&lt;\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})$ such that $\Gamma\backslash \mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})/ \mathrm{SO}(3)$ contains a sequence of immersed floating geodesic planes with fractal closures whose Hausdorff dimensions, non-integral, accumulate at $2$. Moreover, $\Gamma$ can be chosen inside $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$.
  Our method uses Goldman's bulging deformations, but in higher rank new difficulties arise: unlike in rank one, where geodesics orthogonal to a hyperplane always diverge, here one must analyze the collective behavior of entire families of parallel geodesics inside flats under bulging, a phenomenon intrinsic to higher rank.</description>

      <title>Topological 5d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ Gauge Theories: Mirror Symmetry and Langlands Duality of $A_\infty$-categories of Floer Homologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explain why on certain five-manifolds, topological 5d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ gauge theory of Haydys-Witten twist with gauge group $G$, is dual to that of Geyer-M\"{u}lsch twist with gauge group $^LG$, where $G$ is a real, compact Lie group with Langlands dual $^LG$. In turn, via their 2d and 3d gauged A/B-twisted Landau-Ginzburg model interpretations, we can show that (i) a Fukaya-Seidel-type $A_\infty$-1-category of an HW$_4$-instanton Floer homology of three-manifolds and (ii) a Fueter-type $A_\infty$-2-category of an HW$_3$-instanton Floer homology of two-manifolds, are dual to (i) an Orlov-type $A_\infty$-1-category of a novel $^LG_{\mathbb{H}}$-flat Floer homology of three-manifolds and (ii) a Rozansky-Witten-type $A_\infty$-2-category of a novel $^LG_{\mathbb{O}}$-flat Floer homology of two-manifolds, respectively. We also derive their Atiyah-Floer-type correspondences to symplectic categories. Our work, which demonstrates a mirror symmetry and Langlands duality of (higher) $A_\infty$-categories of Floer homologies, therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and gauge-theoretic generalizations of the mathematical conjectures by Bousseau [1] and Doan-Rezchikov [2], and more.</description>
