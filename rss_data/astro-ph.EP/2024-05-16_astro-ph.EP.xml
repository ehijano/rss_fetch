      <title>Into the red: an M-band study of the chemistry and rotation of $\beta$ Pictoris b at high spectral resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS) combined with adaptive optics has been enormously successful in advancing our knowledge of exoplanet atmospheres, from chemistry to rotation and atmospheric dynamics. This powerful technique now drives major science cases for ELT instrumentation including METIS/ELT, GMTNIRS/GMT and MICHI/TMT, targeting biosignatures on rocky planets at 3-5 $\mu$m, but remains untested beyond 3.5 $\mu$m where the sky thermal background begins to provide the dominant contribution to the noise. We present 3.51-5.21 $\mu$m M-band CRIRES+/VLT observations of the archetypal young directly imaged gas giant $\beta$ Pictoris b, detecting CO absorption at S/N = 6.6 at 4.73 $\mu$m and H$_2$O at S/N = 5.7, and thus extending the use of HRCCS into the thermal background noise dominated infrared. Using this novel spectral range to search for more diverse chemistry we report marginal evidence of SiO at S/N = 4.3, potentially indicative that previously proposed magnesium-silicate clouds in the atmosphere are either patchy, transparent at M-band wavelengths, or possibly absent on the planetary hemisphere observed. The molecular detections are rotationally broadened by the spin of $\beta$ Pic b, and we infer a planetary rotation velocity of $v$sin(i) = 22$\pm$2 km s$^{-1}$ from the cross-correlation with the H$_2$O model template, consistent with previous K-band studies. We discuss the observational challenges posed by the thermal background and telluric contamination in the M-band, the custom analysis procedures required to mitigate these issues, and the opportunities to exploit this new infrared window for HRCCS using existing and next-generation instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Repelling Planet pairs by Ping-pong Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kepler mission reveals a peculiar trough-peak feature in the orbital spacing of close-in planets near mean-motion resonances: a deficit and an excess that are a couple percent to the narrow, respectively wide, of the resonances. This feature has received two main classes of explanations, one involving eccentricity damping, the other scattering with small bodies. Here, we point out a few issues with the damping scenario, and study the scattering scenario in more detail. We elucidate why scattering small bodies tends to repel two planets. As the small bodies random-walk in energy and angular momentum space, they tend to absorb, fractionally, more energy than angular momentum. This, which we call "ping-pong repulsion", transports angular momentum from the inner to the outer planet and pushes the two planets apart. Such a process, even if ubiquitous, leaves identifiable marks only near first-order resonances: diverging pairs jump across the resonance quickly and produce the MMR asymmetry. To explain the observed positions of the trough-peaks, a total scattering mass of order a few percent of the planet masses is required. Moreover, if this mass is dominated by a handful of Mercury-sized bodies, one can also explain the planet eccentricities as inferred from transit-time-variations. Lastly, we suggest how these conditions may have naturally arisen during the late stages of planet formation.</description>

      <title>Puffy Venuses: the Mass-Radius Impact of Carbon-Rich Atmospheres on Lava Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent advancements in exoplanet observations enable the potential detection of exo-Venuses, rocky planets with carbon-rich atmospheres. How extended these atmospheres can be, given high carbon abundances, has not been studied. To answer this, we present a model for a theoretical class of exoplanets - puffy Venuses - characterized by thick, carbon-dominated atmospheres in equilibrium with global magma oceans. Our model accounts for carbon and hydrogen partition between the atmosphere and the magma ocean, as well as the C-H-O equilibrium chemistry throughout a semi-grey, radiative-convective atmosphere. We find that radius inflation by puffy Venus atmospheres is significant on small and irradiated planets: carbon content of 1200 ppm (or that of ordinary chondrites) can generate an atmosphere of ~0.16 - 0.3 $R_{\oplus}$ for an Earth-mass planet with equilibrium temperatures of 1500 to 2000 K. We identify TOI-561 b as an especially promising puffy Venus candidate, whose under-density could be attributed to a thick C-rich atmosphere. We also advocate for a puffy Venus interpretation of 55 Cancri e, where recent JWST observation indicates the presence of a CO/CO2 atmosphere. Puffy Venuses may thus constitute a testable alternative interpretation for the interior structure of underdense low-mass exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Fast formation of large ice pebbles after FU Orionis outbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During their formation, nascent planetary systems are subject to FU Orionis outbursts that heat a substantial part of the disc. This causes water ice in the affected part of the disc to sublimate as the ice line moves outwards to several to tens of astronomical units. In this paper, we investigate how the subsequent cooling of the disc impacts the particle sizes. We calculate the resulting particle sizes in a disc model with cooling times between 100 and 1,000 years, corresponding to typical FU Orionis outbursts. As the disc cools and the ice line retreats inwards, water vapour forms icy mantles on existing silicate particles. This process is called heterogeneous nucleation. The nucleation rate per surface area of silicate substrate strongly depends on the degree of super-saturation of the water vapour in the gas. Fast cooling results in high super-saturation levels, high nucleation rates, and limited condensation growth because the main ice budget is spent in the nucleation. Slow cooling, on the other hand, leads to rare ice nucleation and efficient growth of ice-nucleated particles by subsequent condensation. We demonstrate that close to the quiescent ice line, pebbles with a size of about centimetres to decimetres form by this process. The largest of these are expected to undergo cracking collisions. However, their Stokes numbers still reach values that are high enough to potentially trigger planetesimal formation by the streaming instability if the background turbulence is weak. Stellar outbursts may thus promote planetesimal formation around the water ice line in protoplanetary discs.</description>

      <title>NeuralCMS: A deep learning approach to study Jupiter's interior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NASA's Juno mission provided exquisite measurements of Jupiter's gravity field that together with the Galileo entry probe atmospheric measurements constrains the interior structure of the giant planet. Inferring its interior structure range remains a challenging inverse problem requiring a computationally intensive search of combinations of various planetary properties, such as the cloud-level temperature, composition, and core features, requiring the computation of ~10^9 interior models. We propose an efficient deep neural network (DNN) model to generate high-precision wide-ranged interior models based on the very accurate but computationally demanding concentric MacLaurin spheroid (CMS) method. We trained a sharing-based DNN with a large set of CMS results for a four-layer interior model of Jupiter, including a dilute core, to accurately predict the gravity moments and mass, given a combination of interior features. We evaluated the performance of the trained DNN (NeuralCMS) to inspect its predictive limitations. NeuralCMS shows very good performance in predicting the gravity moments, with errors comparable with the uncertainty due to differential rotation, and a very accurate mass prediction. This allowed us to perform a broad parameter space search by computing only ~10^4 actual CMS interior models, resulting in a large sample of plausible interior structures, and reducing the computation time by a factor of 10^5. Moreover, we used a DNN explainability algorithm to analyze the impact of the parameters setting the interior model on the predicted observables, providing information on their nonlinear relation.</description>

      <title>Volatile atmospheres of lava worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A magma ocean (MO) is thought to be a ubiquitous stage in the early evolution of rocky planets and exoplanets. During the lifetime of the MO, exchanges between the interior and exterior envelopes of the planet are very efficient. In particular, volatile elements that initially are contained in the solid part of the planet can be released and form a secondary outgassed atmosphere. We determine trends in the H-C-N-O-S composition and thickness of these secondary atmospheres for varying planetary sizes and MO extents, and the oxygen fugacity of MOs, which provides the main control for the atmospheric chemistry. We used a model with coupled chemical gas-gas and silicate melt-gas equilibria and mass conservation to predict the composition of an atmosphere at equilibrium with the MO depending on the planet size and the extent and redox state of the MO. We used a self-consistent mass-radius model for the rocky core to inform the structure of the planet, which we combined with an atmosphere model to predict the transit radius of lava worlds. We find that MOs (especially the shallow ones) on small planets are generally more reduced, and are thus dominated by H2-rich atmospheres (whose outgassing is strengthened at low planetary mass), while larger planets and deeper MOs vary from CO to CO2-N2-SO2 atmospheres, with increasing fO2 . In the former case, the low molecular mass of the atmosphere combined with the low gravity of the planets yields a large vertical extension of the atmosphere, while in the latter cases, secondary outgassed atmospheres on super-Earths are likely significantly shrunk. Both N and C are largely outgassed regardless of the conditions, while the S and H outgassing is strongly dependent on the fO2 , as well as on the planetary mass and MO extent for the latter.</description>

      <title>Imaging Polarimetry of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko: Homogeneous Distribution of Polarisation and its Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) become observable for the first time in 2021 since the Rosetta rendezvous in 2014--16. Here, we present pre-perihelion polarimetric measurements of 67P from 2021 performed with the Very Large Telescope (VLT), as well as post-perihelion polarimetric measurements from 2015--16 obtained with the VLT and the William Herschel Telescope (WHT). This new data covers a phase angle range of ~4-50{\deg} and presents polarimetric measurements of unprecedentedly high S/N ratio. Complementing previous measurements, the polarimetric phase curve of 67P resembles that of other Jupiter family comets and high-polarisation, dusty comets. Comparing pre- and post-perihelion data sets, we find only a marginal difference between the polarimetric phase curves. In our imaging maps, we detect various linear structures produced by the dust in the inner coma of the comet. Despite this, we find a homogeneous spread of polarisation around the photocentre throughout the coma and tail, in contrast to previous studies. Finally, we explore the consequences of image misalignments on both polarimetric maps and aperture polarimetric measurements.</description>

      <title>Giant branch planetary systems: Dynamical and radiative evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In seven billion years, the Sun will be dead. As stars like the Sun pass from their present state to that of a dead white dwarf star, they undergo two phases of extremely high luminosity and radius -- the red giant branch and the asymptotic giant branch -- during which they will lose half or more of their mass. These changes to the star have a significant impact on orbiting planets, asteroids and comets. The large stellar radius (beyond the current orbit of the Earth) leads to the engulfment of bodies entering the stellar envelope, a process enhanced by strong tidal interactions. The high luminosity affects bodies' orbits and physical properties, while mass loss can later trigger the destabilisation of bodies around white dwarfs. It is necessary to understand these processes to understand both the future of our Solar System, and to interpret growing observations of planetary systems around evolved stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kp-Index is a very important factor for determining how the Sun's magnetic field is affecting the Earth's magnetic field and help us prepare for the worst (like solar or geomagnetic storms). Currently there are around thirteen observation centers to determine the worldwide Kp index. Huge data is generated from all the observation centers which is then used to determine several factors, but the observatories are concentrated in places like North America and Europe only. To eliminate the data dependency from a very limited geographical periphery we can use a constellation of satellites in LEO which can log in data continuously and provide a real time and accurate Kp index which can help humanity for tackling with the impending issues from our nearest star in a better way. The constellation of the satellites will be deployed in the Low Earth Orbit(LEO) and continuously log the geomagnetic data and provide a constant stream of data, which will be more diverse given the area coverage made by one satellite. This is essentially a boon as more the data we can have better geomagnetic data and the Kp index will be all encompassing which can help in better mapping of any solar-catastrophe.</description>

      <title>Low-Latitude Auroras: Insights from 23 April 2023 Solar Storm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In April 2023, low-latitude aurora observation by the all-sky camera at Hanle, Ladakh, India ($33^{\circ} {} N $ geographic latitude (GGLat)) was reported, which stimulated a lot of discussion among scientists as well as masses across the globe. The reported observation was intriguing as the solar storm that triggered this aurora was moderate and the first such observation from Indian region in the space-era. In this communication, we investigate such a unique modern-day observation of low-latitude auroral sighting occurring during the passage of sheath-region of Interplanetary-Coronal-Mass-Ejection, utilizing in situ multi-spacecraft particle measurements along with geomagnetic-field observations by ground and satellite-based magnetometers. Auroral observations at Hanle coincided with the intense substorm occurrences. It is unequivocally found that the aurora didnt reach India, rather the equatorward boundary of the aurora was beyond $ 50^{\circ} {}N $ GGLat. The multi-instrumental observations enabled us to estimate the altitude of the red auroral emissions accurately. The increased flux of low-energy electrons ($&lt;$100 eV) precipitating at $\sim 54^{\circ}N$ GGLat causing red-light emissions at higher altitudes ($\sim$700-950 km) can be visible from Hanle. The observed low-latitude red aurora from India resulted from two factors: emissions at higher altitudes in the auroral oval and a slight expansion of the auroral oval towards the equator. The precipitating low-energy particles responsible for red auroral emissions mostly originate from the plasma sheet. These particles precipitate due to wave-particle interactions enhanced by strong compression of the magnetosphere during high solar wind pressure. This study using multi-point observations holds immense importance in providing a better understanding of low-latitude auroras.</description>

      <title>The Scientific Impact of a Noiseless Energy-Resolving Detector for a Future Exoplanet-Imaging Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future space missions that aim to detect and characterize Earth-like exoplanets will require an instrument that efficiently measures spectra of these planets, placing strict requirements on detector performance. The upcoming Roman Space Telescope will demonstrate the performance of an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) as part of the coronagraphic instrument (CGI). The recent LUVOIR and HabEx studies baselined pairing such a detector with an integral field spectrograph (IFS) to take spectra of multiple exoplanets and debris disks simultaneously. We investigate the scientific impact of a noiseless energy-resolving detector for the planned Habitable Worlds Observatory's (HWO) coronagraphic instrument. By assuming higher quantum efficiency, higher optical throughput, and zero noise, we effectively place upper limits on the impact of advancing detector technologies. We find that energy-resolving detectors would potentially take spectra of hundreds of additional exoplanets "for free" over the course of an HWO survey, greatly increasing its scientific yield.</description>

      <title>Applications of Fast Magnetic Reconnection Models to the Atmospheres of the Sun and Protoplanetary Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partially-ionized plasmas consist of charged and neutral particles whose mutual collisions modify magnetic reconnection compared with the fully-ionized case. The collisions alter the rate and locations of the magnetic dissipation heating and the distribution of energies among the particles accelerated into the non-thermal tail. We examine the collisional regimes for the onset of fast reconnection in two environments: the partially-ionized layers of the solar atmosphere and the protoplanetary disks that are the birthplaces for planets around young stars. In both these environments, magnetic nulls readily develop into resistive current sheets in the regime where the charged and neutral particles are fully coupled by collisions, but the current sheets quickly break down under the ideal tearing instability. The current sheets collapse repeatedly, forming magnetic islands at successively smaller scales, till they enter a collisionally-decoupled regime where the magnetic energy is rapidly turned into heat and charged-particle kinetic energy. Small-scale, decoupled fast reconnection in the solar atmosphere may lead to preferential heating and energization of ions and electrons that escape into the corona. In protoplanetary disks such reconnection causes localized heating in the atmospheric layers that produce much of the infrared atomic and molecular line emission observed with the Spitzer and James Webb Space Telescopes.</description>

      <title>Interior solution of azimuthally symmetric case of Laplace equation in orthogonal similar oblate spheroidal coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Curvilinear coordinate systems distinct from the rectangular Cartesian coordinate system are particularly valuable in the field calculations as they facilitate the expression of boundary conditions of differential equations in a reasonably simple way when the coordinate surfaces fit the physical boundaries of the problem. The recently finalized orthogonal similar oblate spheroidal (SOS) coordinate system can be particularly useful for a physical processes description inside or in the vicinity of the bodies with the geometry of an oblate spheroid. Such shape is aproximating well objects investigated within astrophysics. The solution of the azimuthally symmetric case of the Laplace equation was found for the interior space in the orthogonal SOS coordinates. In the frame of the derivation of the harmonic functions, the Laplace equation was separated by a special separation procedure. A generalized Legendre equation was introduced as the equation for the angular part of the separated Laplace equation. The harmonic functions were determined as relations involving generalized Legendre functions of the first and of the second kind. Several lower-degree functions are reported. Recursion formula facilitating determination of the higher-degree harmonic functions was found. The general solution of the azimuthally symmetric Laplace equation for the interior space in the SOS coordinates is reported.</description>

Abstract: We present resolved images of IRAS 23077+6707 ("Dracula's Chivito") in 1.3 mm/225 GHz thermal dust and CO gas emission with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and optical (0.5-$0.8\,\mu\mathrm{m}$) scattered light with the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS). The Pan-STARRS data show a bipolar distribution of optically scattering dust that is characteristic for disks observed at high inclinations. Its scattered light emission spans ${\sim}14''$, with two highly asymmetric filaments extending along the upper bounds of each nebula by ${\sim}9''$. The SMA data measure 1.3 mm continuum dust as well as $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O $J$=2$-$1 line emission over $12''$-$14''$ extents, with the gas presenting the typical morphology of a disk in Keplerian rotation, in both position-velocity space and in each CO line spectrum. IRAS 23077+6707 has no reported distance estimate, but if it is located in the Cepheus star-forming region (180-800 pc), it would have a radius spanning thousands of au. Taken together, we infer IRAS 23077+6707 to be a giant and gas-rich edge-on protoplanetary disk, which to our knowledge is the largest in extent so far discovered.</description>

      <title>Direct-imaging Discovery of a Substellar Companion Orbiting the Accelerating Variable Star, HIP 39017</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the direct-imaging discovery of a substellar companion (a massive planet or low-mass brown dwarf) to the young, $\gamma$ Doradus-type variable star, HIP 39017 (HD 65526). The companion's SCExAO/CHARIS JHK ($1.1-2.4\mu$m) spectrum and Keck/NIRC2 L$^{\prime}$ photometry indicate that it is an L/T transition object. A comparison of the JHK+L$^{\prime}$ spectrum to several atmospheric model grids finds a significantly better fit to cloudy models than cloudless models. Orbit modeling with relative astrometry and precision stellar astrometry from Hipparcos and Gaia yields a semi-major axis of $23.8^{+8.7}_{-6.1}$ au, a dynamical companion mass of $30^{+31}_{-12}$~M$_J$, and a mass ratio of $\sim$1.9\%, properties most consistent with low-mass brown dwarfs. However, its mass estimated from luminosity models is a lower $\sim$13.8 $M_{\rm J}$ due to an estimated young age ($\lesssim$ 115 Myr); using a weighted posterior distribution informed by conservative mass constraints from luminosity evolutionary models yields a lower dynamical mass of $23.6_{-7.4}^{+9.1}$~M$_J$ and a mass ratio of $\sim$1.4\%. Analysis of the host star's multi-frequency $\gamma$ Dor-type pulsations, astrometric monitoring of HIP 39017b, and Gaia Data Release 4 astrometry of the star will clarify the system age and better constrain the mass and orbit of the companion. This discovery further reinforces the improved efficiency of targeted direct-imaging campaigns informed by long-baseline, precision stellar astrometry.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Timing Noise from Brownian Motion of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) reported a signal at nanohertz frequencies consistent with a stochastic gravitational wave background. Here, I show that the Brownian motion of the Sun as a result of its random gravitational interactions with the cluster of thousands of unmodeled Main-belt asteroids of diameters &lt;80km, not included in the Solar system ephemeris, introduces correlated timing noise for pulsars with the magnitude and frequencies of the reported signal.</description>
