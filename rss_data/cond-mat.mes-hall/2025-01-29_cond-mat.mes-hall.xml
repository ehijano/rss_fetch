      <title>Quantum geometric bounds in spinful systems with trivial band topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive quantum geometric bounds in spinful systems with spin-topology characterized by a single $\mathbb{Z}$-index protected by a spin gap. Our bounds provide geometric conditions on the spin topology, distinct from the known quantum geometric bounds associated with Wilson loops and nontrivial band topologies. As a result, we obtain stricter bounds in time-reversal symmetric systems with a nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index and also bounds in systems with a trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index, where quantum metric should be otherwise unbounded. We benchmark these findings with first-principles calculations in elemental Bismuth realizing higher even nontrivial spin-Chern numbers. Moreover, we connect these bounds to optical responses, demonstrating that spin-resolved quantum geometry can be observed experimentally. Finally, we connect spin-bounds to quantum Fisher information and Cram\'er-Rao bounds which are central to quantum metrology, showing that the elemental Bi and other spin-topological phases hold promises for topological free fermion quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Nanostructured superlattices as a probe of fermiology in Weyl-semimetal NbP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a charged particle is subject to both a periodic potential and magnetic field, oscillations in its conductivity occur when the field-induced cyclotron radius is commensurate with the period of the potential. This effect has been observed in two-dimensional systems including electron gases and graphene, and is related to the Hofstadter spectrum of magnetic minibands. Here we show that commensuration oscillations also can arise in the ballistic transport regime of a nanostructured 3D material, with the Weyl semimetal NbP. These oscillations encode information about the quasiparticles at the Fermi-surface, including their momentum, charge, mass, and rotational symmetry. In particular, we use the magnetic field and temperature dependence of the commensuration oscillations to extract the Fermi-momenta and quasiparticle mass, in good agreement with Shubnikov-de Haas quantum oscillations. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between the engineered superlattice symmetry and resistivity response based on the symmetry of the Fermi surface and charge of the quasiparticles. These results demonstrate how nanopatterned superlattices can be used to characterize a 3D materials' fermiology, and also point towards new ways of engineering quantum transport in these systems.</description>

      <title>Reentrant localization transition in a dimerized quasiperiodic dipolar chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reentrant localization transitions, that is, the transitions of a portion of the eigenspectrum from localized to critical and then again to localized as the disorder strength is increased, have been recently unveiled in various quasiperiodic models. However, how these transitions may extend to systems with long-range coupling and dissipation remains elusive. Here we investigate the fate of such a phenomenon in a dimerized quasiperiodic chain of dipolar emitters with all-to-all coupling. Through an extensive study of the spectral properties of our model, we demonstrate that such anomalous transitions survive to all-to-all couplings when considering a staggered quasiperiodic modulation of the spacings between the emitters. Transport simulations through a driven-dissipative open quantum system approach complete our study and reveal the effects of emitter losses on the reentrant localization transition.</description>

      <title>Adhesion and Reconstruction of Graphene/Hexagonal Boron Nitride Heterostructures: A Quantum Monte Carlo Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate interlayer adhesion and relaxation at interfaces between graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) monolayers in van der Waals heterostructures. The adhesion potential between graphene and hBN is calculated as a function of local lattice offset using diffusion quantum Monte Carlo methods, which provide an accurate treatment of van der Waals interactions. Combining the adhesion potential with elasticity theory, we determine the relaxed structures of graphene and hBN layers at interfaces, finding no metastable structures. The adhesion potential is well described by simple Lennard-Jones pair potentials that we parameterize using our quantum Monte Carlo data. Encapsulation of graphene between near-aligned crystals of hBN gives rise to a moir\'{e} pattern whose period is determined by the misalignment angle between the hBN crystals superimposed over the moir\'{e} superlattice previously studied in graphene on an hBN substrate. We model minibands in such supermoir\'{e} superlattices and find them to be sensitive to a 180$^\circ$ rotation of one of the encapsulating hBN crystals. We find that monolayer and bilayer graphene placed on a bulk hBN substrate and bulk hBN/graphene/bulk hBN systems do not relax to adopt a common lattice constant. The energetic balance is much closer for free-standing monolayer graphene/hBN bilayers and hBN/graphene/hBN trilayers. The layers in an alternating stack of graphene and hBN are predicted to strain to adopt a common lattice constant and hence we obtain a new, stable three-dimensional crystal with a unique electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Polaron-Polariton Dispersion and Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an analytical microscopic theory to describe the polaron-polariton dispersion, formed by hybridizing excitons, photons, and phonons, and their coherent dynamics inside optical cavities. Starting from a microscopic light-matter Hamiltonian, we derive a simple analytical model by pursuing a non-perturbative treatment of the phonon and photon couplings to excitons. Within our theoretical framework, the phonons are treated as classical fields that are then quantized via the Floquet formalism. We show that, to a good approximation, the entire polaron-polariton system can be described using a band picture despite the phonons breaking translational symmetry. Our theory also sheds light on the long-lived coherent ballistic motion of exciton-polaritons with high excitonic character that propagate with group velocities lower than is expected from pure exciton-polariton bands, offering a microscopic explanation for these puzzling experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Superconducting Phase Diagram of Monolayer WTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of a quantum critical point (QCP) and fluctuations around it are believed to be important for understanding the phase diagram in unconventional superconductors such as cuprates, iron pnictides, and heavy fermion superconductors. However, the QCP is usually buried deep within the superconducting dome and is difficult to investigate. The connection between quantum critical fluctuations and superconductivity remains an outstanding problem in condensed matter. Here combining both electrical transport and Nernst experiments, we explicitly demonstrate the onset of superconductivity at an unconventional QCP in gate-tuned monolayer tungsten ditelluride (WTe2), with features incompatible with the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) scenario. The results lead to a novel superconducting phase diagram that is distinguished from other known superconductors. Two distinct gate-tuned quantum phase transitions are observed at the ends of the superconducting dome. We find that quantum fluctuations around the QCP of the underdoped regime are essential for understanding how the monolayer superconductivity is established. The unconventional phase diagram we report here illustrates a previously unknown relation between superconductivity and QCP.</description>

      <title>Systematic investigation of dynamic nuclear polarization with boron vacancy in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) using the boron vacancy ($\mathrm{V_B^-}$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has gained increasing attention. Understanding this DNP requires systematically investigating the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectra and developing a model that quantitatively describes its behavior. Here, we measure the ODMR spectra of $\mathrm{V_B^-}$ in $\mathrm{h}^{10}\mathrm{B}^{15}\mathrm{N}$ over a wide magnetic field range, including the ground state level anti-crossing (GSLAC), and compare them with the results of the Lindblad-based simulation that considers a single electron spin and three neighboring $^{15}\mathrm{N}$ nuclear spins. Our simulation successfully reproduces the experimental spectra, including the vicinity of GSLAC. It can explain the overall behavior of the magnetic field dependence of the nuclear spin polarization estimated using the Lorentzian fitting of the spectra. Despite such qualitative agreement, we also demonstrate that the fitting methods cannot give accurate polarizations. Finally, we discuss that symmetry-induced mechanisms of $\mathrm{V_B^-}$ limit the maximum polarization. Our study is an essential step toward a quantitative understanding of DNP using defects in hBN and its quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Separate surface and bulk topological Anderson localization transitions in disordered axion insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In topological phases of matter for which the bulk and boundary support distinct electronic gaps, there exists the possibility of decoupled mobility gaps in the presence of disorder. This is in analogy with the well-studied problem of realizing separate or concomitant bulk-boundary criticality in conventional Landau theory. Using a three-dimensional axion insulator having clean, gapped surfaces with $e^2/2h$ quantized Hall conductance, we show the bulk and surface mobility gap evolve differently in the presence of disorder. The decoupling of the bulk and surface topology yields a regime that realizes a two-dimensional, unquantized anomalous Hall metal in the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE), which shares some spectral and response properties akin to the surface states of a conventional three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator. The generality of these results as well as extensions to other insulators and superconductors is discussed.</description>

      <title>Viewing fluxonium through the lens of the cat qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We draw analogies between protected superconducting qubits and bosonic qubits by studying the fluxonium Hamiltonian in its Fock basis. The mean-field phase diagram of fluxonium (at the sweet spot) is identified, with a region in parameter space that is characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry-broken ground states. In the heavy fluxonium limit, these ground states are well approximated by squeezed coherent states in a Fock basis (corresponding to persistent current states with definite flux but indefinite charge), and simple expressions are provided for them in terms of the circuit parameters. We study the noise bias in fluxonium via a universal Lindblad master equation and find that the bit-flip rate is exponentially small in $E_j/(k_B T)$, while the phase-flip rate does not get worse with this ratio. Analogous behavior is found in $\cos(2 \theta)$ qubits. We discuss first steps towards generating an Ising interaction between protected superconducting qubits on a two-dimensional lattice, with the aim of achieving a passive quantum memory by coupling a static Hamiltonian to a generic thermal bath.</description>

      <title>Critical gate distance for Wigner crystallization in the two-dimensional electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the properties of the two-dimensional electron gas in a dual-gate geometry, using quantum Monte Carlo methods to obtain aspects of the phase diagram as a function of electron density and gate distance. We identify the critical gate distance below which the Wigner crystal phase disappears. For larger gate distances, the system undergoes a re-entrant transition from crystal to liquid at sufficiently low density. We also present preliminary evidence for a fully polarized ferromagnetic liquid state at low electron density and intermediate gate distances. The quantum Monte Carlo results are compared with simpler approximate methods, which are shown to be semi-quantitatively reliable for determining key features of the phase diagram. These methods are then used to obtain the phase boundary between the Wigner crystal and liquid in the single-gate geometry.</description>

      <title>Phase-matched electron-photon interactions enabled by 3D-printed helical waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Smith-Purcell effect enables electromagnetic radiation across arbitrary spectral ranges by phase-matching the diffraction orders of an optical grating with the near-field of a moving electron. In this work, we introduce a novel approach using a helically shaped waveguide, where phase-matching is achieved through guided light within a helical optical fiber fabricated via two-photon polymerization using a 3D printer. Our results demonstrate that radiation from these structures precisely satisfies the phase-matching condition and is emitted directionally at specific angles, contrasting with the broad angular distribution characteristic of the traditional Smith-Purcell effect. Helical electron-driven photon sources establish a new paradigm, enabling 3D-printed structures to control electron-beam-induced radiation and, inversely, to facilitate light-induced efficient electron beam shaping and acceleration.</description>

      <title>Landau-level composition of bound exciton states in magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theory that studies the state composition of a bound exciton in magnetic field. Using a basis set made of products of free electron and hole wavefunctions in Landau gauge, we derive a secular equation which shows the relation between Landau levels (LLs) of the electron and hole when a bound exciton is formed. Focusing on excitons in the light cone, we establish a scattering selection rule for the interaction of an electron in LL $n_\text{e}$ with a hole in LL $n_\text{h}$. We solve the resulting secular equation and identify a simple pairing law, $n_\text{e} = n_\text{h} + l$, which informs us on the construction of a bound exciton state with magnetic quantum number $l$, and on the interaction of the exciton magnetic moment with magnetic field. We obtain good agreement between theory results and recent measurements of the diamagnetic shifts of exciton states in WSe$_2$ monolayers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have provided compelling evidence supporting the theoretical predictions of phonon hydrodynamics in fast thermal conductors. Unlike diffusive heat transport, this regime is primarily governed by momentum-conserving phonon collisions. At the mesoscopic scale it is described by viscous heat equations (VHE), that resemble the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) in the laminar regime. We show how the VHE can be separated and recast as modified biharmonic equations, allowing for an analytical solution of the velocity potential and stream function of the phonon fluid. These two can be merged into a complex potential defining the flow streamlines, and give rise to two distinct temperature contributions, ultimately related to thermal compressibility and vorticity. By examining thermal flow within a 2D graphite strip device, we explore the boundary conditions and transport coefficients needed to observe thermal vortices and negative thermal resistance, or heat backflow from cooler to warmer regions, and propose a straightforward experimental setup to detect these distinctive hallmarks of viscous transport. Finally, the irrotational and incompressible limits of the phonon VHE are analyzed, showing how the latter mirrors the NSE for the electron fluid. This work provides novel analytical tools to design hydrodynamic phonon flow, highlights the connection to electron hydrodynamics, and paves the way to improve heat management in next-generation devices.</description>

      <title>Convection-modulated topological edge mode and extended-localized criticality in thermal metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convection offers a dynamic and flexible approach to achieving a variety of novel physical phenomena beyond pure conduction. Here, we demonstrate that thermal metamaterials with convection modulation enable the realization of non-Hermitian topological edge modes and bulk mode criticality. We illustrate that a periodic modulation can induce localized edge modes within the band gap. The temperature field of the topological state is localized at the edge rings, decaying exponentially at a fixed rate. Additionally, we introduce an extended-localized criticality through the quasiperiodic convection modulation in thermotics. The convections have an advantage of fantastic tunability in the application. Our work proposes a scheme for implementing topological modes and bulk mode criticality through modulating convection in diffusion systems, paving the way for the design of reconfigurable thermal devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometric Origin of Strain-Tunable Giant Second-Harmonic Generation in Bi$_2$O$_2$X (X=S, Se, Te)</title>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials with giant nonlinear optical (NLO) responses are essential for the development of advanced on-chip NLO devices. Using first-principles calculations, we predict a remarkable strain-induced enhancement of second-harmonic generation (SHG) in the high-performance 2D semiconductors Bi$_2$O$_2$X (X = S, Se, Te). The SHG susceptibilities of Bi$_2$O$_2$X under strain are on the order of 1~nm/V, rivalling the highest values reported among 2D materials. This giant SHG response originates from gauge-invariant geometric quantities, including the quantum metric, shift vector, and triple phase product. The strain also induces a bandgap variation in Bi$_2$O$_2$X. Intriguingly, in Bi$_2$O$_2$Te, strain-induced bandgap tuning drives a transition from a semiconductor to a half-metal, and ultimately to a polar metal. Our findings present a unique platform that combines strain-tunable bandgap engineering with exceptional NLO properties, while also highlighting the crucial role of quantum geometry in enhancing SHG.</description>

      <title>Electron dynamics induced by quantum cat-state light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an effective theory for describing electron dynamics driven by an optical external field in a Schr\"{o}dinger's cat state. We show that the electron density matrix evolves as an average over trajectories $\{\rho_\alpha\}$ weighted by the Sudarshan--Glauber $P$ distribution $P(\alpha)$ in the weak light--matter coupling regime. Each trajectory obeys an equation of motion, $\mathrm{i} \partial_t\rho_\alpha=\mathcal{H}_{\alpha} \rho_\alpha-\rho_\alpha\mathcal{H}_{\alpha}$, where an effective Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_{\alpha}$ becomes non-Hermitian due to quantum interference of light. The optical quantum interference is transferred to electrons through the asymmetric action between the ket and bra state vectors in $\rho_{\alpha}$. This non-Hermitian dynamics differs from the conventional one observed in open quantum systems, described by $\mathrm{i} \partial_t\rho=\mathcal{H}\rho-\rho \mathcal{H}^\dagger$, which has complex conjugation in the second term. We confirm that the results of the effective theory agree with those of full electron--photon system simulations for the few-electron Dicke model, demonstrating experimental accessibility to exotic non-Hermitian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Reversal of Spin-torque Polarity with Inverting Current Vorticity in Composition-graded Layer at the Ti/W Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While compositional gradient-induced spin-current generation has been explored, its microscopic mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, the contribution of polarity of compositional gradient on spin-current generation is explored. A nanoscale compositional gradient, formed by in-situ atomic diffusion of ultrathin Ti and W layers, is introduced between 10-nm-thick W and Ti layers. Spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance in ferromagnetic Ni95Cu5 deposited on this gradient reveals that a moderate compositional gradient suppresses negative spin torque from the spin Hall effect in W. In contrast, reversing the Ti/W stacking order, which inverts the gradient, suppresses positive spin torque from the orbital Hall effect in Ti. These findings suggest that the sign of spin torque is governed by the polarity of compositional gradient, providing a novel strategy for efficient spin-torque generation without relying on materials with strong spin or orbital Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Transport approach to two-qubit quantum state tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is a central task for quantum information processing, enabling quantum cryptography, computation, and state certification. Traditional QST relies on projective measurements of single- and two-qubit Pauli operators, requiring qubits to be isolated from environmental dissipation. In this work, we demonstrate that measuring currents and associated transport quantities flowing through a two-qubit system between two terminals biased in temperature or voltage are sufficient to perform complete QST of the open quantum system. This transport approach requires minimal knowledge of the system-environment couplings and of the parameters setting the system's dynamics, accessible in state-of-the-art solid-state experiments via spectroscopic measurements for instance. Our findings are analytical, offering comprehensive insights into the underlying processes. As a direct consequence of our approach, we are able to provide a transport-based entanglement measure to certify the presence of quantum correlations, expressing the concurrence in terms of currents and correlations functions only.</description>

      <title>Optically trapped exciton-polariton condensates in a perovskite microcavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate room temperature optical trapping and generation of high-order angular harmonics in exciton-polariton condensates in a monocrystalline CsPbBr$_3$ perovskite-filled microcavity. Using an annular nonresonant excitation profile focused onto the perovskite, we observed power-driven switching between different transverse modes of the optically induced trap. We explore the interplay between the perovskite crystal dimensions and the optical trap diameter that allows the condensate to transition from whispering gallery-like petal shapes to extended ripple states. Our results underline the feasibility in creating high-order quantum states in perovskite polariton condensates for reconfigurable and structured room temperature nonlinear lasing.</description>

      <title>Ultra-strong coupling of two ferromagnets via Meissner currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the magnetization dynamics in a ferromagnet/insulator/ferromagnet trilayer sandwiched between two superconductors (S/F/I/F/S heterostructure). It is well-known that a conceptually similar S/F/S system is a platform for implementing ultra-strong magnon-photon coupling. Here, we demonstrate that in such S/F/I/F/S heterostructure, ultra-strong magnon-magnon coupling also appears. The strength of this interaction is many times greater than the strength of the usual dipole-dipole interaction. It is mediated via Meissner currents excited in the superconductor layers by the magnon stray fields. The strength of the magnon-magnon coupling is anisotropic, and its anisotropy is opposite to the anisotropy of the magnon-photon coupling, which allows them to be separated. Both couplings become much stronger when the temperature drops below the critical temperature of the superconductor layers. It enables the implementation of an efficient tuning of the wavenumber in the S/F/I/F/S heterostructures controlled by temperature in a wide range of frequencies. Overall, the rich and tunable spectrum of S/F/I/F/S multilayers opens broad prospects for their application in magnonics.</description>

      <title>Unconventional resistive switching in dense Ag-based nanowire networks with brain-inspired perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an unconventional resistive switching effect on high-density self-assembled Ag-nanowire networks tailored by a fuse-like operation. We propose a mechanism to rationalize the observed phenomenology by analyzing the electrical signatures before and after such a fusing. The explanation allows reconciling the results obtained in similar systems early adopted as transparent electrodes and the more recent attempts to use this type of substrate for in-materia computational operations. In addition to the usual analog nature of the available resistance states and the ability to tune internal weights, we show that these networks' sparsity and non-linear behavior are also attributes. Thus, the formerly exhibited nanowires' abilities to code synaptic behavior are complemented by neuronal features upon properly tuning the network density and the applied electrical protocol.</description>

      <title>Upper critical field and colossal spin valve analogy in normal metal-superconductor-normal metal trilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The role of spin orbit interaction in superconducting proximity effect is an area of intense research effort. Recent theoretical and experimental works investigate the possible role of spin-orbit interaction in generating spin-triplet pair correlations. In this work, we present an experimental survey of thin normal metal-superconductor-normal metal trilayers with Nb superconductor and Al, Ti, Cu, Pt, Ta, and Au normal metals, along with single layers of Nb as reference. We aim to probe the role of spin-orbit interaction and resistivity on the normal metal proximity effect through measurements of the upper critical field. We find that the upper critical fields of the trilayers are lower than that of a single layer Nb reference sample, and that the trilayers with higher resistivity metals, Ti, Pt, and Ta, behave as 2-dimensional superconductors. We also find that compared to single layer Nb films, the trilayers show a greater suppression of critical temperature during rotation from in-plane to out-of-plane applied magnetic field. This suppression of critical temperature under field rotation is analogous to the colossal spin valve effect that can be achieved in systems with ferromagnetic materials, however in our trilayers only orbital contributions to the suppression are present.</description>

      <title>Directly probing work extraction from a single qubit engine fueled by quantum measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in manipulating individual quantum systems enables the exploration of resources of quantum origin in engines. One of the main remaining challenges consists in directly measuring the work extracted from such quantum engines. Here we probe the work extracted from a transmon superconducting qubit acting as a working medium. The engine is fueled by performing quantum measurements of an observable which does not commute with the bare qubit Hamiltonian. Using feedback, the engine acts as a quantum Maxwell demon working without a hot thermal source. In our implementation, the qubit working medium amplifies a coherent microwave field from which work is extracted. The latter is not only inferred from tomographic measurements of the qubit state but also directly monitored via heterodyne detection of the field quadratures. We demonstrate the long-term stability of the engine as well as its robustness to transmon decoherence, losses and drifts. To emphasize the role of feedback, we also study the breakdown of the engine in the open-loop configuration.</description>

      <title>Design of superparamagnetic nanoparticle-materials for high-frequency inductor cores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The progress in the semiconductor industry has resulted in great demand for high-frequency magnetic materials applicable in microfabricated inductor cores. Nanocomposite materials, containing magnetic nanoparticles in a non-conducting matrix, may provide a solution for materials with high susceptibility (/permeability) and low power loss in the MHz regime, where traditional ferrites fail in performance. Here, we present a design guide for usage of magnetic nanoparticles in such materials. We use statistical mechanics methods to derive the magnetic susceptibility of nanoparticles in case of uniaxial or cubic anisotropy, as function of particle size and applied field direction, and investigate shape and interaction effects on the susceptibility. Using the derived susceptibilities, with inductor-core applications in mind, we show that close-to-spherical particles of materials with high saturation magnetization and low magnetic anisotropy, such as FeNi$_3$, are optimal. Additionally, the particle size shall be optimized to be as large as possible while maintaining superparamagnetic behaviour at the relevant frequency. Based on this, we predict that high particle susceptibilities of $&gt;$700 (/$&gt;$1500) are possible for randomly oriented (/aligned) 20$\pm$1 nm diameter FeNi$_3$ particles, together with high-frequency stability, shown by low out-of-phase component at 2 MHz. This implies that materials containing nanoparticles have the potential to be tuned to outperform state-of-the-art ferrite inductor-core materials at MHz-frequencies.</description>

Abstract: We study van der Waals heterostructures consisting of monolayer MoSe$_2$ and few-layer Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ fully encapsulated in hexagonal Boron Nitride using low-temperature photoluminescence and polar magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements. Photoluminescence characterization reveals a partial quenching and a change of the exciton-trion emission ratio in the heterostructure as compared to the isolated MoSe$_2$ monolayer. Under circularly polarized excitation, we find that the exciton-trion emission ratio depends on the relative orientation of excitation helicity and Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ magnetization, even though the photoluminescence emission itself is unpolarized. This observation hints at an ultrafast, spin-dependent interlayer charge transfer that competes with exciton and trion formation and recombination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are a promising platform for multiple different qubit implementations, all of which are voltage controlled by programmable gate electrodes. However, as the QD arrays grow in size and complexity, tuning procedures that can fully autonomously handle the increasing number of control parameters are becoming essential for enabling scalability. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm for initializing a depletion-mode QD device in preparation for subsequent phases of tuning. During bootstrapping, the QD device functionality is validated, all gates are characterized, and the QD charge sensor is made operational. We demonstrate the bootstrapping protocol in conjunction with a coarse-tuning module, showing that the combined algorithm can efficiently and reliably take a cooled-down QD device to a desired global-state configuration in under 8 min with a success rate of 96 %. Finally, by following heuristic approaches to QD device initialization and combining the efficient ray-based measurement with the rapid radio-frequency reflectometry measurements, the proposed algorithm establishes a reference in terms of performance, reliability, and efficiency against which alternative algorithms can be benchmarked.</description>

Abstract: Raman spectroscopy is a valuable characterization tool for two-dimensional materials. Starting from model Hamiltonians for Chern insulators and magnetized monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides, we theoretically predict two unconventional features of Raman spectroscopy. First, a selection rule emerges in the Raman tensor when the incident and scattered photons are circularly polarized. This rule generalizes the well-known valley selection rule of optical conductivity in Dirac insulators. Second, for an electronic model with single massive Dirac fermion, the phase difference between Raman tensor elements is quantized to $\pm\pi/2$ for any frequency of the incident light. The quantization is robust under perturbations and the sign of the phase difference is reversed when the mass term of the Hamiltonian is inverted.</description>

Abstract: The possibility of topological phase transition with or without a magnetic flux trapped in the cells of a class of decorated lattices is explored in details.Using a tight binding Hamiltonian and a real space decimation scheme we analytically obtain the non-dispersive and dispersive energy bands, and exactly locate the eigenvalues at which energy gaps close.We find that despite the local breaking of the time reversal symmetry, as a magnetic field is turned on, the topological invariant exhibits quantization, and a clear appearance of edge localized modes is observed exactly at the gap-closing energy eigenvalues in the topologically non-trivial insulating phase.The bulk boundary correspondence is obeyed. The protection of the edge states by a chiral symmetry is confirmed for both the presence and absence of magnetic flux. Our studies have been extended to other kinds of decorated lattices where topological phase transition is possible only above a threshold value of the hopping integral describing these lattice. Our results are analytically exact.</description>

Abstract: The Mpemba effect has initially been noticed in macroscopic systems -- namely that hot water can freeze faster than cold water -- but recently its extension to open quantum systems has attracted significant attention. This phenomenon can be explained in the context of nonequilibrium thermodynamics of Markovian systems, relying on the amplitudes of different decay modes of the system dynamics. Here, we study the Mpemba effect in a single-level quantum dot coupled to a thermal bath, highlighting the role of the sign and magnitude of the electron-electron interaction in the occurrence of the Mpemba effect. We gain physical insights into the decay modes from a dissipative symmetry of this system called fermionic duality. Based on this analysis of the relaxation to equilibrium of the dot, we derive criteria for the occurrence of the Mpemba effect using two thermodynamically relevant measures of the distance to equilibrium, the nonequilibrium free energy and the dot energy. We furthermore compare this effect to a possible exponential speedup of the relaxation. Finally, we propose experimentally relevant schemes for the state preparation and explore different ways of observing the Mpemba effect in quantum dots in experiments.</description>

      <title>Coherence in resonance fluorescence</title>

Abstract: Resonance fluorescence of a two-level emitter displays persistently anti-bunching irrespective of the excitation intensity, but inherits the driving laser's linewidth under weak monochromatic excitation. These properties are commonly explained in terms of two disjoined pictures, i.e., the emitter's single photon saturation or passively scattering light. Here, we propose a unified model that treats all fluorescence photons as spontaneous emission, one at a time, and can explain simultaneously both the spectral and correlation properties of the emission. We theoretically derive the excitation power dependencies, measurable at the single-photon incidence level, of the first-order coherence of the whole resonance fluorescence and super-bunching of the spectrally filtered, followed by experimental confirmation on a semiconductor quantum dot micro-pillar device. Furthermore, our model explains peculiar coincidence bunching observed in phase-dependent two-photon interference experiments. Our work provides an intuitive understanding of coherent light-matter interaction and may stimulate new applications.</description>

      <title>Split Cherenkov radiation in isotropic chiral matter</title>

Abstract: Chiral matter exhibits unique electromagnetic responses due to the macroscopic manifestation of the chiral anomaly as anomalous transport currents. Here, we study the modification of electromagnetic radiation in isotropic chiral matter characterized by an axion coupling that varies linearly over time $\theta(t) = b_0 t$. Using Carroll-Field-Jackiw electrodynamics, we derive the causal Green's function to investigate the stability and radiation properties of the system. Even though the plane-wave modes of isotropic chiral matter exhibit imaginary frequencies for long wavelengths, which might suggest instability in the system, we show that their contribution is confined to the near-field region. Also we find no exponentially growing fields at arbitrarily large times, so that stability is preserved. Under these conditions the radiation yields a positive energy flux, although this is not an inherent property of the general definition. In the case of a fast-moving charge, we confirm the existence of vacuum Cherenkov radiation and show that, for refractive indices $n &gt; 1$, the Cherenkov cone can split into two concentric cones with opposite circular polarizations. This split, governed by the speed of the particle $v$, $n$ and $b_0$, resembles the optical spin-Hall effect and offers potential applications for creating circularly polarized terahertz (THz) light sources. Our Green's function approach provides a general method for analyzing radiation in chiral matter, from Weyl semimetals to quark-gluon plasmas, and can be extended to systems such as oscillating dipoles and accelerated charges.</description>

      <title>Off-resonant photoluminescence spectroscopy of high-optical quality single photon emitters in GaN</title>

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the relevance of excitation parameters on the emission from single-photon emitting defect centers in GaN. We investigate the absorption spectrum of different emitters by photoluminescence excitation technique at 10\,K. We report large spectral jumps (shifts up to 22\,meV) in the emitters' zero-phonon line (ZPL). The likelihood of such jumps is increased by the change in excitation energy. The shifts indicate a large built-in dipole moment of the defects and suggest a possibility to electrically tune their ZPL in a wide range. From the photoluminescence excitation studies, we observe that for majority of the emitters the absorption peaks exist between 2 and 2.55\,eV. The absorption peaks vary from emitter to emitter, and no universal absorption pattern is apparent. Finally, for selected emitters we observe significantly reduced spectral diffusion and instrument-limited linewidth of $138\,\mu eV$ (0.04\,nm).These findings show a new perspective for atomic defect GaN emitters as sources of coherent photons, shine new light on their energy level structure and show the possibility of tuning the ZPL, paving the way to fully harness their potential for applications in quantum technologies.</description>
