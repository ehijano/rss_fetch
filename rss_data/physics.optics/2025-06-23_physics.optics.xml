      <title>Spatial mapping and tuning of terahertz modes in a silicon whispering gallery mode resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identification and subsequent manipulation of resonant modes typically relies on comparison with calculations which require precise knowledge of material parameters and dimensions. For millimetre-sized resonators that support millimetre-wave modes, this is particularly challenging due to the poorly determined physical parameters and additional perturbative effects of nearby dielectric or metallic substrates in experimental setups. Here, we use perturbation from a metal needle to experimentally map the spatial distribution of terahertz modes in a silicon disc resonator. We then use this information to design a patterned structure to manipulate specific modes in the system, a technique that could be useful for targeted tuning of such modes.</description>

      <title>FINCH EYE: The Optical and Optomechanical Design of a GRISM-based SWIR Hyperspectral Imaging Payload for a 3U CubeSat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crop residue is an important metric used for agricultural land-use monitoring and climate science research. Estimating crop residue coverage is essential to sustainable agricultural practices. The University of Toronto Aerospace Team is developing FINCH EYE, the optical payload for the upcoming FINCH 3U CubeSat, to measure crop residue cover. We conceived of a novel ultra-compact push-broom architecture with a volume phase-holographic grism dispersive element to keep the design compact and simplify the mechanical assembly. The FINCH EYE will image hyperspectral data from 900nm to 1700nm at 10nm spectral resolution, with a spatial resolution of 100m, and a SNR of 100. In this paper, we will describe the optical design of FINCH EYE, which consists of a commercial objective lens, an InGaAs camera, and a custom lens-grism-lens spectrograph. We will also describe the optomechanical housing, emphasizing design features that facilitate proper alignment during assembly.</description>

      <title>Combined frequency comb and continuous wave cavity-enhanced optical-optical double-resonance spectrometer in the 1.7 ${\mu}$m range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an optical-optical double-resonance (OODR) spectrometer based on a 3.3 ${\mu}$m continuous wave pump and two cavity-enhanced probes: a frequency comb tunable in the 1.64 - 1.8 ${\mu}$m range, and a comb-referenced continuous wave (CW) laser tunable in the 1.6 - 1.75 ${\mu}$m range. The comb probe provides broad spectral coverage (bandwidth up to 7 THz) for simultaneous detection of many sub-Doppler OODR transitions with sub-MHz line position accuracy, while the CW probe allows targeting individual transitions with kHz accuracy and higher signal-to-noise ratio in shorter time. Using the pump stabilized to the frequency of the R(0) transition in the ${\nu}$${_3}$ band of methane and the comb probe covering the 5550 to 6070 cm$^{-1}$ interval, we detect 37 ladder-type transitions in the 3${\nu}$${_3}$ $\leftarrow$ ${\nu}$${_3}$ band region and 6 V-type transitions in the 2${\nu}$${_3}$ band region and assign them using available theoretical predictions. Using the CW probe, we measure selected ladder- and V-type transitions with much higher precision. We also detect Lamb dips in the R(0)- R(3) transitions of the 2${\nu}$${_3}$ band and report their center frequencies with kHz level accuracy. The synergy effects of the comb- and CW-OODR open new possibilities in precision spectroscopy of levels that cannot be reached from the ground state.</description>

      <title>Optically tunable linear and nonlinear enhancement of index of refraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control of optical properties of materials by tuning their refractive index can revolutionize the current state-of-the-art technology to manipulate light propagation in the high loss media. Here we demonstrate active optical tuning of the plasmonic analog of enhancement of index of refraction (EIR) in both linear and nonlinear regimes using a quantum mechanical approach. By employing a pump-probe scheme, we investigate the tuning of refractive index of the probe field by varying amplitude and phase of the pump source. We analyze the modulation in the response function of probe in both first- and second-order quantization, under the coupling of linear plasmonic modes supported by two L-shaped nano-ellipsoids. This approach enables indirect tuning of nonlinear modes and coherent control of the probe pulse. Varying the pump amplitude not only shows a significant enhancement in the EIR in both regimes but also effectively suppresses optical losses with zero dispersion at the system's resonance frequency. Additionally, tuning pump phase induces a spectral shift in the frequency of the probe field which open new ways for active tuning of epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials. Our approach offers all-optical tuning of refractive index and coherent control of optical properties of plasmonic nanostructures with applications in loss-compensated propagation and zero-index to high-refractive-index plasmonic metamaterials, as well as photonic switches.</description>

      <title>Ultra-broadband spectral and polarisation entanglement using dispersion-engineered nanophotonic waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose exploiting dispersion-engineered nanophotonic waveguides in generating unprecedented ultra-broadband spectral and polarisation entanglement using spontaneous four-wave mixing parametric processes. We developed a simplified theoretical quantum framework to investigate and analyse these interactions under pulse source excitations. Using aluminum gallium arsenide and thin-film lithium niobate waveguides, we anticipate to obtain photon pairs with high-dimensional frequency entanglement, characterised by Schmidt numbers as large as ~10$^8$, and covering the wavelength range 940--2730 nm (equivalent to a 210 THz bandwidth). Additionally, we show that Al$_{0.3}$Ga$_{0.7}$As waveguides with hybrid cladding can enable the generation of polarisation-entangled photon pairs with concurrence exceeding 0.93 across wavelengths from 1175 nm to 1750 nm, spanning almost across all the telecommunication bands with only approximately 27 nm window inevitable-degradation around the pump wavelength. We envisage that these introduced integrated on-chip sources will significantly advance quantum photonic technologies, enabling breakthroughs in multi-channel quantum networking and scalable quantum information systems.</description>

      <title>Wavelength-agnostic 3D-Nanoprinted coupler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a photonic coupler that exhibits effectively wavelength-agnostic performance for ultra-broadband optical interfacing. By incorporating a dual-ellipsoidal geometry, the design facilitates quasi-free-space optical propagation. We further propose a hybrid modelling workflow employs a matrix optics-based approach as an efficient pre-design tool, capturing critical geometry-to-mode mapping characteristics, significantly narrowing the parameter space required for subsequent full-vectorial finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. Our design achieves a 1 dB bandwidth exceeding 800 nm coupling from fibre to chip, with an insertion loss as low as 1.3 dB,to the best of our knowledge, a record for any reported photonic couplers. The additive manufacturing approach via 3D nano-printing enables flexible geometry customization and sub-micron integrated alignment features, facilitating seamless integration with photonic chips and optical fibers. Experimental validation demonstrates excellent stability and thermal robustness across diverse operational conditions, highlighting the design's suitability for integration into wide range of broadband photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Exceptional point in a PT symmetric non-Hermitian terahertz plasmonic metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate a non-Hermitian open PT-symmetric terahertz metasurface comprising complementary plasmonic structures capable of exhibiting an exceptional point (EP). The metasurface consists of two resonators of different sizes, representing effective gain and loss elements, placed orthogonally in close proximity to realize a non-Hermitian configuration leading to a PT symmetry state. A diagonal displacement of one resonator within this strongly coupled near-field configuration leads to the emergence of an exceptional point, where the system undergoes a sudden phase transition from a PT symmetric to a PT-asymmetric state. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is performed on the fabricated samples to experimentally validate the phase transition observed in numerical simulations. We employ coupled mode theory (CMT) to analyse and distinguish between the PT-symmetric, exceptional point, and PT-asymmetric states. This theoretical framework enables the calculation of eigenvalues, phase spectra, and eigenmodes associated with the metamaterial design, thereby corroborating the simulation results. Furthermore, we construct Poincare sphere to visualize the orientation of the polarization states of the eigenmodes, which further indicates the presence of the exceptional point. This comprehensive study of exceptional point in a plasmonic system holds potential for the development of practical, highly sensitive terahertz devices, addressing limitations of conventional PT-symmetric systems that rely on traditional gain and loss media.</description>

      <title>Analyzing partially-polarized light with a photonic deep random neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical neural networks are emerging as a powerful and versatile tool for processing optical signals directly in the optical domain with superior speed, integrability, and functionality. Their application to optical polarization enables neuromorphic polarization sensors, but their operation is limited to fully-polarized light. Here, we demonstrate single-shot analysis of partially-polarized beams with a photonic random neural network (PRNN). The PRNN is composed of a series of optical layers implemented by a stack of scattering media and a few trainable digital nodes. The setup infers the degree-of-polarization and the Stokes parameters of the polarized component with precision comparable to off-the-shelf polarimeters. The use of several optical layers allows to enhance the accuracy, reduce the sensor size, and minimize digital costs, demonstrating the advantage of a deep optical encoder for processing polarization information. Our results point out photonic neural networks as fast, compact, broadband, low-cost polarimeters that are widely applicable from sensing to imaging.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Photonic Circuit Losses with Machine Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-loss waveguides enable efficient light delivery in photonic circuits, which are essential for high-speed optical communications and scalable implementations of photonic quantum technologies. We study the effects of several fabrication and experimental parameters on the waveguide losses of a silicon nitride integrated photonics platform using various machine learning techniques. Compared to more complex machine learning algorithms, our results show that a simple linear regression model with variable selection offers a lower prediction error with high interpretability. The high interpretability, along with our domain knowledge, led to unique identification of fabrication process dependencies on the final outcome. With these insights, we show that by improving the process flow, it is possible to improve the loss by mitigating the cause in a real experiment.</description>

      <title>Fully analog end-to-end online training with real-time adaptibility on integrated photonic platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog neuromorphic photonic processors are uniquely positioned to harness the ultrafast bandwidth and inherent parallelism of light, enabling scalability, on-chip integration and significant improvement in computational performance. However, major challenges remain unresolved especially in achieving real-time online training, efficient end-to-end anolog systems, and adaptive learning for dynamical environmental changes. Here, we demonstrate an on-chip photonic analog end-to-end adaptive learning system realized on a foundry-manufactured silicon photonic integrated circuit. Our platform leverages a multiplexed gradient descent algorithm to perform in-situ, on-the-fly training, while maintaining robustness in online tracking and real-time adaptation. At its core, the processor features a monolithic integration of a microring resonator weight bank array and on-chip photodetectors, enabling direct optical measurement of gradient signals. This eliminates the need for high-precision digital matrix multiplications, significantly reducing computational overhead and latency, an essential requirement for effective online training. We experimentally demonstrate real-time, end-to-end analog training for both linear and nonlinear classification tasks at gigabaud rates, achieving accuracies of over 90\% and 80\%, respectively. Our analog neuromorphic processor introduces self-learning capabilities that dynamically adjust training parameters, setting the stage for truly autonomous neuromorphic architectures capable of efficient, real-time processing in unpredictable real-world environments. As a result, we showcase adaptive online tracking of dynamically changing input datasets and achieve over 90\% accuracy, alongside robustness to external temperature fluctuations and internal thermal crosstalk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polygon resonators are known for their small size and high force sensitivity. We propose an analytical model to predict the mechanical quality factors (Q) of polygon perimeter modes by incorporating a stress term in the Timoshenko-Gere equation. We discuss the origin of losses and their relationship with polygon structure dimensions. Notably, we demonstrate that the torsion loss can be suppressed through the torsion angle of supporting tethers. These results offer new insights into optimizing high Q polygon resonators for cavity optomechanics, force sensing, and multimode physics of phononic structures.</description>

      <title>Solid-State Optical Magnetometer: Next-Generation Approach to Sub-Nanotesla Magnetic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Solid-State Optical Magnetometer (SOM) based on black phosphorus (BP) multilayers, offering a compact, scalable, and highly sensitive alternative to traditional atomic-based magnetometers. Utilizing BP's intrinsic linear dichroism in a metasurface cavity, the SOM achieves sub-nanotesla precision and vector magnetic field sensing. BP enhances light-matter interactions, enabling tunable optical responses driven by Lorentz force-induced cavity deformation. Optimized metasurface unit cells increase polarization-dependent absorption, improving detection sensitivity. Finite Element Method simulations show high linearity (R-squared &gt; 0.999), tunable dynamic range, and adjustable sensitivity via current modulation. At 200 microamps, the SOM reaches a sensitivity of 31.25 picotesla, while lower currents expand the dynamic range up to +-10 nanotesla. This tunability allows for application-specific optimization in areas such as biomagnetic sensing, metrology, and industrial field detection. Unlike SQUIDs and optically pumped magnetometers, the BP-based SOM operates at room temperature and nanoscale dimensions with comparable sensitivity, eliminating the need for cryogenics or vapor cells. Power consumption remains under 1 microwatt, far below conventional technologies. This work establishes BP metasurface integration as a promising platform for low-power, miniaturized, and high-performance magnetic field sensing.</description>

      <title>Plasmon Polaritons in Disordered Nanoparticle Assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilayer assemblies of metal nanoparticles can act as photonic structures, where collective plasmon resonances hybridize with cavity modes to create plasmon-polariton states. For sufficiently strong coupling, plasmon polaritons qualitatively alter the optical properties of light-matter systems, with applications ranging from sensing to solar energy. However, results from experimental studies have raised questions about the role of nanoparticle structural disorder in plasmon-polariton formation and light-matter coupling in plasmonic assemblies. Understanding how disorder affects optical properties has practical implications since methods for assembling low-defect nanoparticle superlattices are slow and scale poorly. Modeling realistic disorder requires large system sizes, which is challenging using conventional electromagnetic simulations. We employ Brownian dynamics simulations to construct large-scale nanoparticle multilayers with controlled structural order. We investigate their optical response using a superposition T-matrix method with 2-D periodic boundary conditions. We find that while structural disorder broadens the polaritonic stop band and the near-field hot-spot distribution, the polariton dispersion and coupling strength remain unaltered. To understand effects of nanoparticle composition, we consider assemblies with model particles mimicking gold or tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) nanocrystals. Losses due to higher damping in ITO nanocrystals prevent their assemblies from achieving the deep strong coupling of gold nanoparticle multilayers, although the former still exhibit ultrastrong coupling. We demonstrate that while computationally efficient mutual polarization method calculations employing the quasistatic approximation modestly overestimate the strength of the collective plasmon, they reproduce the polariton dispersion relations determined by electrodynamic simulations.</description>

      <title>Space-time duality in polariton dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial and temporal dynamics of wave propagation are intertwined. A common manifestation of this duality emerges in the spatial and temporal decay of waves as they propagate through a lossy medium. A complete description of the non-Hermitian wave dynamics in such a lossy system, capturing temporal and spatial decays, necessitates the use of complex-valued frequency and/or wavenumber Eigen-values. Here, we demonstrate that the propagation of polaritons - hybrid light-matter quasiparticles - can be broadly controlled in space and time by temporally shaping their photonic excitation. Using time-domain terahertz near-field nanoscopy, we study plasmon polaritons in bilayer graphene at sub-picosecond time scales. Suppressed spatial decay of polaritons is implemented by temporally engineering the excitation waveform. Polaritonic space-time metrology data agree with our dynamic model. Through the experimental realization and visualization of polaritonic space-time duality, we uncover the effects of the spatio-temporal engineering of wave dynamics; these are applicable to acoustic, photonic, plasmonic, and electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Programmable electro-optic frequency comb empowers integrated parallel convolution processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photonic convolution processors make optical neural networks (ONNs) a transformative solution for artificial intelligence applications such as machine vision. To enhance the parallelism, throughput, and energy efficiency of ONNs, wavelength multiplexing is widely applied. However, it often encounters the challenges of low compactness, limited scalability, and high weight reconstruction latency. Here, we proposed and demonstrated an integrated photonic processing unit with a parallel convolution computing speed of 1.62 trillion operations per second (TOPS) and a weight reconstruction speed exceeding 38 GHz. This processing unit simultaneously achieves, for the first time, multi-wavelength generation and weight mapping via a single programmable electro-optic (EO) frequency comb, featuring unprecedented compactness, device-footprint independent scalability, and near-unity optical power conversion efficiency (conversion efficiency from input optical power to output weighted comb lines). To demonstrate the reconfigurability and functionality of this processing unit, we implemented image edge detection and object classification based on EO combs obtained using the particle swarm algorithm and an EO comb neural network training framework, respectively. Our programmable EO comb-based processing framework establishes a new paradigm towards the development of low-latency monolithic photonic processors, promising real-time in-sensor learning for autonomous vehicles, intelligent robotics, and drones.</description>

      <title>Room temperature spin injection into commercial VCSELs at non-resonant wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin lasers leverage electron spin-polarisation to control photon polarisation, offering the potential for lower thresholds, rapid modulation, and all-optical data processing. We report successful spin injection into a commercial Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL) using optical pumping at wavelengths of 794 nm and 810 nm. Maximum circular polarisation achieved was about 20% at 794 nm, whereas this falls to 5% with exciting at 810 nm. We attribute this to reduced spin injection due to the longer excitation wavelength in line with previous measurements on quantum wells under optical orientation. We extend the Spin-Flip Model (SFM) to account for realistic excitation conditions and find our theoretical analysis accurately reproduces experimental trends.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a tunable spectral filter on the dynamics of a passively mode-locked fiber laser in the anomalous dispersion regime. The results show that noise-like pulse emission evolves toward bound-state regime as the filter bandwidth is reduced. Thanks to the Shannon entropy applied to dispersive Fourier transform signals, it is demonstrated that the system undergoes a phase transition.</description>

      <title>Temporal pattern generation with tunable repetition rate using semiconductor laser periodic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a long-cavity semiconductor laser subject to optical feedback is exploited to generate repetitive temporal patterns with enhanced intra-pattern sample diversity. Stable limit cycle dynamics characterized by multiple frequency harmonics are experimentally demonstrated by considering a 2 m external cavity with appropriate optical feedback conditions. This simple configuration can enable stable and continuous generation of periodic waveforms with a tunable repetition rate ranging from 3.28 to 4.21 GHz. Distinct, highly consistent temporal patterns are obtained by applying high-pass filtering to adjust the relative power of the harmonics. The resulting system operates as a physical waveform generator capable of producing diverse and repeatable signal patterns, making it well-suited for use in the masking stage of time delay reservoir computing architectures.</description>

      <title>NEO-PGA: Nonvolatile electro-optically programmable gate array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable photonic integrated circuits (PICs) offer a unique opportunity to create a flexible platform, akin to electronic field programmable gate array (FPGA). These photonic PGAs can implement versatile functionalities for applications ranging from optical interconnects to microwave photonics. However, state-of-the-art programmable photonics relies predominantly on volatile thermo-optic tuning, which suffers from high static power consumption, large footprints, and thermal crosstalk. All these dramatically limit the gate density and pose a fundamental limit to the scalability. Chalcogenide-based phase-change materials (PCMs) offer a superior alternative due to their nonvolatility and substantial optical contrast, though challenges such as optical loss, and bit precision severely limited their application in large-scale PICs. Here, we demonstrate precise, multi-bit, low-loss tuning of the emerging PCM Sb2Se3 using a closed-loop, "program-and-verify" method. Electrically reconfigurable PCM-integrated silicon photonic gates are implemented on a 300mm silicon photonic platform, using circulating and forward Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) meshes. In the circulating mesh, we realize broadband optical switching fabrics and high-Q coupled resonators with unprecedented local control of coupling rates, which further enable exploration of coupled-cavity systems. The forward mesh supports self-configurable MZIs that sort two orthogonal beams to different ports. These results showcase a new type of scalable photonic PGA enabled by PCMs, offering a pathway toward general-purpose, on-chip programmable photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Lossless, Non-Volatile Post-Fabrication Trimming of PICs via On-Chip High-Temperature Annealing of Undercut Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limited by equipment precision, manufacturing deviations in waveguide width, etch depth, and layer thickness inevitably occur in photonic integrated circuits (PICs). These variations cause initial phase errors, compromising the reliability of phase-sensitive devices such as Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZI) and microring resonators. To overcome this, we report a nonvolatile, near-lossless post-trimming method utilizing sufficient high-temperature thermal treatment for undercut waveguides, reported here for the first time to the best of our knowledge.This CMOS-compatible approach requires no additional processes or equipment, enables simple electrical heating for trimming, and retains long-term stability after high-temperature removal, ensuring high energy efficiency. Transmission electron microscopy indicates that high-temperature thermal treatment induces irreversible lattice expansion in silicon waveguides, leading to a reduction in the real refractive index and enabling compensation for process errors. Experimental results using MZIs confirm a permanent refractive index reduction of 0.0173 and high-resolution tuning up to 5.25 bits, effective across a broadband spectrum and stable for over 218 days after final trimming.Furthermore, 15 MZIs on a single wafer are precisely calibrated to BAR, CROSS, or orthogonal states, demonstrating the method universality. This practical and scalable technique enables reliable post-fabrication trimming for next-generation low-cost, energy-efficient PIC applications such as optical switches and optical computing.</description>

      <title>A comparative analysis of plasmonic and dielectric metasurface sensing platforms powered by bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanophotonic platforms based on surface-enhanced infrared absorbance spectroscopy (SEIRAS) have emerged as an effective tool for molecular detection. Sensitive nanophotonic sensors with robust resonant modes and amplified electromagnetic near fields are essential for spectroscopy, especially in lossy environments. Metasurfaces driven by bound state in the continuum (BICs) have unlocked a powerful platform for molecular detection due to their exceptional spectral selectivity. While plasmonic BIC metasurfaces are preferred for molecular spectroscopy due to their high surface fields, enhancing the interaction with analytes, dielectric BICs have become popular due to their high-quality factors and, thus high sensitivity. However, their sensing performance has largely been demonstrated in air, neglecting the intrinsic infrared (IR) losses found in common solvents. This study evaluates the suitability of plasmonic versus dielectric platforms for in-situ molecular spectroscopy. Here, the sensing performance of plasmonic (gold) and dielectric (silicon) metasurfaces is assessed across liquid environments with varying losses resembling typical solvents. The results show that dielectric metasurfaces excel in dry conditions, while plasmonic BIC metasurfaces outperform them in lossy solvents, with a distinct crossover point where both show similar performance. Our results provide a framework for selecting the optimal metasurface material platform for SEIRAS studies based on environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Prism-based compensation of group delay dispersion in the components of a femtosecond laser resonator and analysis of the influence of prism configuration on laser radiation parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mathematical algorithm is described for calculating the minimum distance between prisms and the allowable prism insertion depth into the laser beam when solving the general problem of intracavity group delay dispersion (GDD) compensation. GDD is caused by the optical elements of the master oscillator in a femtosecond laser system. The calculation was carried out using analytical and geometrical methods. The influence of changing the distance between the prisms and the depth of their insertion into the laser beam on the GDD compensation has been investigated. Under experimental conditions, this changes the Q-factor of the laser resonator, which determines the central wavelength of the radiation and its spectral width in a titanium-sapphire laser.</description>

      <title>Versatile Absorption Modeling for Transmissive Optical Elements Using Ray Tracing and Finite Element Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging quality requirements in modern optical systems increase the need for accurate simulation and compensation of disturbances. One key disturbance in high-power laser applications results from thermal loading due to absorption. This paper presents a flexible modeling approach for absorption based on ray tracing, where point heat sources are defined along ray paths. In addition, several methods for mapping these point heat sources along the ray path to the finite element mesh are introduced and compared. A major advantage of the proposed approach lies in its flexibility, as it enables the simulation of transient phenomena such as dynamic beam positioning and time-dependent variations in beam shape.</description>

      <title>Universality and non-differentiability: A new perspective on angular dispersion in optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angular dispersion (AD) is a ubiquitous phenomenon in optics after light traverses a diffractive or dispersive device, whereby each wavelength propagates at a different angle. AD is useful in a variety of applications; for example, modifying the group velocity or group-velocity dispersion of pulsed lasers in free space or optical materials, which are essential ingredients in group-velocity matching and dispersion compensation. Conventional optical components introduce `differentiable' AD, so that the propagation angle can be expanded perturbatively around a fixed frequency, in which only a few low AD-orders are typically relevant. However, this model does not encompass newly emerging classes of propagation-invariant pulsed optical fields, such as `space-time wave packets', which incorporate a new form of AD that we call `non-differentiable AD'. This is a surprising feature: there exists a frequency at which the derivative of the propagation angle with respect to frequency is not defined. Consequently, the propagation angle cannot be expanded perturbatively at this frequency, and a large number of independently controllable AD orders are needed to approximate this condition. Synthesizing these new AD-induced field configurations requires constructing a `universal AD synthesizer' capable of accessing the magnitude and sign of any AD order, a capability missing from any single optical component to date. This Perspective article provides a unified schema for studying differentiable and non-differentiable AD, shows that non-differentiable AD enables circumventing many well-established constraints in optics -- thereby giving rise to new applications, and outlines the requirements for a universal AD synthesizer capable of producing both forms of AD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase-code mode-locked (PCML) laser provides a configurable frequency comb light source for circular-ranging optical coherence tomography systems (CR-OCT). However, prior implementations of PCML suffered from high relative intensity noise (RIN). In this work, we demonstrate that by configuring the output pulsewidth and pulse separation in relation to the linewidth of the intracavity Fabry-Perot etalon, low-noise operation can be achieved. We observed a more than ten-fold reduction in laser RIN that enabled CR-OCT imaging with a sensitivity of 103 dB with 35 mW delivered to the sample and provided images that are qualitatively comparable to those acquired using traditional swept-source methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as an excellent host material for generating room temperature single photons exhibiting high brightness and spin-photon entanglement. However, challenges in improving purity, stability, and scalability limit its use in quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate highly pure and stable single photon emitters (SPEs) in hBN by directly growing carbon-doped, centimeter-scale hBN thin films using the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. These SPEs exhibit room temperature operation with polarized emission, achieving a g(2)(0) value of 0.015, which is among the lowest reported for room temperature SPEs and the lowest achieved for hBN SPEs. It also exhibits high brightness ( around 0.5 million counts per second), remarkable stability during continuous operation (&gt; 15 minutes), and a Debye-Waller factor of 45%. First-principles calculations reveal unique carbon defects responsible for these properties, enabled by PLD's low-temperature synthesis and in-situ doping. Our results demonstrate an effective method for large-scale production of high-purity, stable SPEs in hBN, enabling robust quantum optical sources for various applications.</description>

      <title>A Liquid-Nitrogen-Cooled Ca+ Ion Optical Clock with a Systematic Uncertainty of 4.6E-19</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a single-ion optical clock based on the 4S_1/2-3D_5/2 transition of the 40Ca+ ion, operated in a liquid nitrogen cryogenic environment,achieving a total systematic uncertainty of 4.6E-19. We employ a refined temperature evaluation scheme to reduce the frequency uncertainty due to blackbody radiation (BBR), and the 3D sideband cooling has been implemented to minimize the second-order Doppler shift. We have precisely determined the average Zeeman coefficient of the 40Ca+ clock transition to be 14.345(40) Hz/mT^2, thereby significantly reducing the quadratic Zeeman shift uncertainty. Moreover, the cryogenic environment enables the lowest reported heating rate due to ambient electric field noise in trapped-ion optical clocks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the recently developed NARP scheme for laser-triggered single-photon sources to the simultaneous excitation of multiple emitters with varying transition energies, laying the groundwork for wavelength-division multiplexing in quantum optical networks. Our Multi-NARP scheme does not rely on polarization filtering and thus enables the near-unity extraction efficiency of single photons from each quantum dot. Our approach also offers the advantages of robustness to variations in the laser pulse parameters and immunity to excitation-induced dephasing tied to electron-phonon coupling. We show that simultaneous triggering of at least 10 emitters is possible, enabling the development of high-bandwidth quantum networks.</description>

Abstract: Recent research in 2-dimensional (2D) topological matter has generalized the notion of edge states from chiral to antichiral configurations with the same propagating direction at parallel edges, revealing a rich variety of robust transport phenomena. Here, we propose that antichiral hinge states can emerge in a 3D higher-order topological insulator/semimetal, where two surface/bulk Dirac points are connected by the hinge states. The band dispersion can be controlled and tilted independently for each hinge using properly designed tunnelings, resulting in tunable antichiral hinge states with programmable propagation direction and velocity. Moreover, we propose experimental realization schemes based on a 1D coupled cavity array with additional synthetic dimensions represented by the photonic orbital angular momentum and frequency. We innovatively introduce both longitudinal and transversal electro-optic modulators to generate the desired tunable tunnelings along the synthetic dimensions, which significantly reduce the experimental complexity by eliminating the need for beam splittings and auxiliary cavities. The tunable antichiral hinge states are confirmed by the photonic transmission spectra. Our work presents the robust and tunable antichiral hinge-state transports which paves the way for exploring novel topological matter and their device applications.</description>

      <title>Vertex corrections to nonlinear photoinduced currents in 2D superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of a rectified steady-state supercurrent as a response to the photoexcited current of the quasiparticles constitutes the concept of a superconducting photodiode. This phenomenon occurs in a two-dimensional thin superconducting film with a built-in DC supercurrent that is exposed to a circularly polarized external electromagnetic field. The flow of a Cooper-pair condensate, resulting as a second-order photo-response in a direction transverse to the initially built-in supercurrent, represents a superconducting counterpart to the photogalvanic effect. In this paper, we examine the photodiode supercurrent by restoring gauge invariance within the mean-field BCS framework. To achieve this, we derive an impurity-sensitive BCS-interaction-induced correction to the vertex function by performing self-consistent calculations within the Keldysh Green's function technique. The resulting photodiode current can be utilized for spectroscopic analysis of typical relaxation times in superconducting films.</description>

      <title>Programmable Bell State Generation in an Integrated Thin Film Lithium Niobate Circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is central to quantum technologies such as cryptography, sensing, and computing. Photon pairs generated via nonlinear optical processes are excellent for preparing entangled states due to their long coherence times and compatibility with fiber optic networks. Steady progress in nanofabrication has positioned lithium niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) as a leading platform for monolithic integration of photon pair sources into optical circuits, leveraging its strong second-order nonlinearity. Here, we present a reconfigurable photonic integrated circuit on LNOI, which combines two on-chip photon pair sources with programmable interferometers, enabling generation of entangled states. The pair sources achieve a source brightness of MHz nm$^{-1}$ mW$^{-1}$ while maintaining a coincidence-to-accidental ratio above 100. We successfully interfere the two sources with $99 \pm 0.7$ % visibility, demonstrating the indistinguishability required for producing entanglement on-chip. We show preparation of any of the maximally entangled Bell states with fidelity above 90 % verified by quantum state tomography. These results establish LNOI as a compelling, scalable platform to explore integrated quantum photonic technologies enabled by high-brightness sources of entangled quantum states.</description>

      <title>On the Particle Image Overlap in Single Camera Defocusing Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle image (PI) overlap presents a significant challenge in single-camera particle tracking and sizing techniques such as Defocusing Particle Tracking Velocimetry (DPTV) and Interferometric Particle Imaging (IPI). In DPTV, overlap obscures PI boundaries, complicating the detection and accurate estimation of PI diameter and center position, which increases uncertainty in the reconstructed particle positions. In IPI, overlap reduces the usable area of the interference pattern, limiting the accuracy of particle size determination. This study introduces a statistical model to quantify PI overlap independently from the optical setup, source density, or PI size. The model assumes uniformly distributed, uniformly sized circular PIs and is validated against experimental data featuring non-uniform sizes and mild astigmatism (up to aspect ratios of 1.66), demonstrating strong agreement. The present study reveals that the seeding density $\mathcal{S}$ serves as a strong universal scaling parameter for PI overlap. Key overlap metrics, including the number of overlaps per PI, the fraction of overlap-free PIs, and the usable PI area are analyzed as functions of the seeding density $\mathcal{S}$. The results reveal a critical threshold at $\mathcal{S} = 0.25$, where each PI experiences, on average, one overlap. The study provides practical guidance for experimental design by linking overlap metrics to controllable parameters such as source density, defocus length, and aperture diameter. The presented models serve as lookup tools to help experimenters maintain PI overlap within acceptable limits, enabling more reliable and quantitatively robust measurements in DPTV and IPI applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Hybrid Quantized Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here in this work, we present a novel Quadratic Binary Optimization (QBO) model for quantized neural network training, enabling the use of arbitrary activation and loss functions through spline interpolation. We introduce Forward Interval Propagation (FIP), a method designed to tackle the challenges of non-linearity and the multi-layer composite structure in neural networks by discretizing activation functions into linear subintervals. This approach preserves the universal approximation properties of neural networks while allowing complex nonlinear functions to be optimized using quantum computers, thus broadening their applicability in artificial intelligence. We provide theoretical upper bounds on the approximation error and the number of Ising spins required, by deriving the sample complexity of the empirical risk minimization problem, from an optimization perspective. A significant challenge in solving the associated Quadratic Constrained Binary Optimization (QCBO) model on a large scale is the presence of numerous constraints. When employing the penalty method to handle these constraints, tuning a large number of penalty coefficients becomes a critical hyperparameter optimization problem, increasing computational complexity and potentially affecting solution quality. To address this, we employ the Quantum Conditional Gradient Descent (QCGD) algorithm, which leverages quantum computing to directly solve the QCBO problem. We prove the convergence of QCGD under a quantum oracle with randomness and bounded variance in objective value, as well as under limited precision constraints in the coefficient matrix. Additionally, we provide an upper bound on the Time-To-Solution for the QCBO solving process. Experimental results using a coherent Ising machine (CIM) demonstrate a 94.95% accuracy on the Fashion MNIST classification task, with only 1.1-bit precision.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-empowered freely-arrangeable multi-task diffractive neural networks with weighted training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in optical computing have garnered considerable research interests owing to its ener-gy-efficient operation and ultralow latency characteristics. As an emerging framework in this domain, dif-fractive deep neural networks (D2NNs) integrate deep learning algorithms with optical diffraction principles to perform computational tasks at light speed without requiring additional energy consumption. Neverthe-less, conventional D2NN architectures face functional limitations and are typically constrained to single-task operations or necessitating additional costs and structures for functional reconfiguration. Here, an arrangea-ble diffractive neural network (A-DNN) that achieves low-cost reconfiguration and high operational versa-tility by means of diffractive layer rearrangement is presented. Our architecture enables dynamic reordering of pre-trained diffractive layers to accommodate diverse computational tasks. Additionally, we implement a weighted multi-task loss function that allows precise adjustment of task-specific performances. The efficacy of the system is demonstrated by both numerical simulations and experimental validations of recognizing handwritten digits and fashions at terahertz frequencies. Our proposed architecture can greatly expand the flexibility of D2NNs at a low cost, providing a new approach for realizing high-speed, energy-efficient ver-satile artificial intelligence systems.</description>

      <title>Phase-Dependent Squeezing in Dual-Comb Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure phase-dependent Kerr soliton squeezing and anti-squeezing in the time-domain dualcomb interferograms generated using two independent frequency comb lasers. The signal appears as non-stationary quantum noise that varies with the fringe phase of the interferogram and dips below the shot-noise level by as much as 3.8 dB for alternating zero-crossings. The behavior arises from the periodic displacement of the Kerr squeezed comb by the coherent field of the second frequency comb, and is confirmed by a quantum noise model. These experiments support a route towards quantum-enhanced dual-comb timing applications and raise the prospect of high-speed quantum state tomography with dual-comb interferometry.</description>

Abstract: Complex amplitude measurement is an essential prerequisite for light field characterization. In this work, we propose a one-time measurement method to characterize the complex amplitude of symmetry superposed optical vortices (SSOVs) with only one picture registered by CCD. This method includes two strategies we proposed. One is the ring extraction strategy for amplitude measurement, and another is the rotational measurement strategy for phase measurement. In the proof-of-concept experiment, the complex amplitude is characterized, and the mode purity is well measured. This method has excellent flexibility, rapidity, and robustness, which can be applied to various occasions and harsh conditions. Careful alignment and optimized error analysis allow us to generate and measure a single component with mode purity as high as 99.99%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10762v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aberration compensation with emphasis on the generalized spherical aberration components is discussed for plane-symmetric and anamorphic optical systems. A narrow field-of-view double-plane symmetric telescope objective containing reflective and refractive subsystems, which focus light separately in the two dimensions of the image plane, is introduced. Analytical derivation of the compensation rules is discussed for the telescope being composed of a Cassegrain-type cylindrical reflective subsystem and an economical refractive one that is determined by up to six essential parameters. Performance of a more advanced version of this telescope, which contains a less aberrative nine-parameter refractive subsystem, is studied using the ray-tracing simulator CODE~V. The telescopes of the introduced type provide two independent focal distances for the discussed focusings in the orthogonal dimensions allowing to set up a favorable field of view, and potentially can be used to achieve larger effective aperture area and resolution on a small spacecraft.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we report the experimental demonstration of the nonlinear non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in an effective Kerr nonlinear temporal photonic lattice, where the high-power requirements and lack of tunability intrinsic to optical materials are overcome by an artificial nonlinearity arising from optoelectronic feedforward. Thanks to Kerr self-trapping, the nonlinear NHSE is demonstrated to possess much better localization strength and robustness at the preferred boundary compared to the linear case. Away from the preferred boundary, Kerr self-trapping can even inhibit NHSE-induced transport and form stable skin solitons. Harnessing the nonlinearity-controlled NHSE, we judiciously design an optical router with a flexibly tuned output port. Our findings promise great applications in robust signal transmission, routing, and processing.</description>

      <title>Solution for the finite space-bandwidth limitation in digital holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13098v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A lensless digital holography enables wide-field microscopic imaging without the limitations imposed by optical lens performance. However, conventional holographic imaging often relies on magnifying optical systems to compensate for the low resolution of holograms captured by image sensors. The spatial resolution of the reconstructed image is fundamentally constrained by the space-bandwidth of the hologram due to aliasing errors at insufficient sampling rates. This study analyzes the spatial distribution of the angular spectrum in undersampled holograms using angle modulation techniques. Aliased replica functions are identified as phase-modulated functions by multiples of the sampling frequency, with the spatial frequency components continuously extending into the replica regions. Optical imaging simulations demonstrate that image reconstruction beyond the space-bandwidth limitation of digital holograms is feasible. In particular, high-order diffraction fields, characterized by orthogonality, can be effectively eliminated through an upsampling process. By sequentially removing high-order terms and applying a learning-based denoising algorithm, wide-field high-resolution optical imaging is achieved. This approach demonstrates that only a captured low-resolution hologram can reconstruct a high-resolution image, thereby overcoming the limitations imposed by the finite space-bandwidth of digital holography.</description>

      <title>All-passive upconversion of incoherent near-infrared light at intensities down to 10$^{-7}$ W/cm$^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frequency upconversion, which converts low-energy photons into higher-energy ones, typically requires intense coherent illumination to drive nonlinear processes or the use of externally driven optoelectronic devices. Here, we demonstrate an upconversion system that converts low-intensity (down to ~10-7 W/cm$^2$) incoherent near-infrared (NIR) light into the visible, reaching intensities perceptible by the human eye, without the use of any external power input. Our upconverting element is enabled by the following ingredients: (1) photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation in a bulk heterojunction of the organic semiconductors Y6 and rubrene; (2) plasmonic enhancement of absorption and field intensity in the heterojunction layer; (3) collection enhancement using a dichroic thin-film assembly. To enable high-resolution imaging, the upconverting element is inserted at an intermediate image plane of a dual-wavelength telescope system, which preserves the relative directionality of rays between the incident NIR light and output visible light. Our all-passive upconversion imaging system will enable NIR imaging and sensing in low-light environments under energy constraints.</description>

      <title>Ultra-compact broadband spot size converter using metamaterial cell-based inverse design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06390v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the expansion of silicon photonics from datacom applications into emerging fields like optical I/O, quantum and programmable photonics there is an increasing demand for devices that combine ultra-compact footprints, low losses, and broad bandwidths. While inverse design techniques have proven very efficient in achieving small footprints, they often underutilize physical insight and rely on large parameter spaces that are challenging to explore, thereby limiting the performance of the resulting devices. Here we present a design methodology that combines inverse design with a topology based on cells, each of which contains a subwavelength metamaterial. This approach significantly reduces the parameter space, while the inherent anisotropy of the subwavelength structures yields shorter devices. We experimentally demonstrate our technique with an ultra-compact spot size converter that achieves a x24 expansion ratio times (from 0.5 um to 12 um) over a length of only 7 um, with insertion losses of 0.8 dB across a measured bandwidth of 160 nm (up to 300 nm in simulation), surpassing the state-of-the-art by a wide margin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00199v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a seeded topology optimization methodology for integrated photonic devices fabricated on foundry platforms that yields improved performance compared to traditional topology optimization. We employ blurring filters and a DRC correction algorithm to more readily meet design rule checks, resulting in devices with fewer artifacts and improved correlation between simulation and measurements. We apply this process to an ultra-compact TE modal multiplexer, a TE mode converter, a polarization rotator, and a high-contrast grating reflector. The measured insertion loss of the TE mode converter was reduced from 1.37 dB to 0.64 dB through this optimization strategy. This approach enables a two-step inverse design process, merging of physics-informed design strategies with inverse design, and ensures strict compliance with foundry constraints throughout optimization.</description>

      <title>Time-reversal-symmetry bounds on electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For linear electromagnetic systems possessing time-reversal symmetry, we present an approach to bound ratios of internal fields excited from different ports, using only the scattering matrix (S matrix), improving upon previous related bounds by Sounas and Al\`u (2017) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 154302 (2017)]. By reciprocity, emitted-wave amplitudes from internal dipole sources are bounded in a similar way. When applied to coupled-resonant systems, our method constrains ratios of resonant coupling/decay coefficients. We also obtain a relation for the relative phase of fields excited from the two ports and the ratio of field intensities in a two-port system. In addition, although lossy systems do not have time-reversal symmetry, we can still approximately bound loss-induced non-unitarity of the S matrix using only the lossless S matrix. We show numerical validations of the near-tightness of our bounds in various scattering systems.</description>

      <title>Overcoming light scattering with high optical nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving high-resolution optical imaging deep within heterogeneous and scattering media remains a fundamental challenge in biological microscopy, where conventional techniques are hindered by multiple light scattering and absorption. Here, we present a non-invasive imaging approach that harnesses the nonlinear response of luminescent labels in conjunction with the statistical and spatial properties of speckle patterns - an effect of random light interference. Using avalanching nanoparticles (ANPs) with strong photoluminescence nonlinearity, we demonstrate that random speckle illumination can be converted into a single, localized, sub-diffraction excitation spot. This spot can be scanned across the sample using the angular memory effect, enabling high-resolution imaging through a scattering layer. Our method is general, fast, and cost-effective. It requires no wavefront shaping, no feedback, and no reconstruction algorithm, offering a powerful new route to deep, high-resolution imaging through complex media.</description>

      <title>Exciton--hyperbolic-phonon-polariton Hybridization in Biased Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04796v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excitons in biased bilayer graphene are electrically tunable optical excitations residing in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range, where intrinsic optical transitions are typically scarce. Such a tunable material system with an excitonic response offer a rare platform for exploring light-matter interactions and optical hybridization of quasiparticles residing in the long wavelength spectrum. In this work, we demonstrate that when the bilayer is encapsulated in hexagonal-boron-nitride (hBN)-a material supporting optical phonons and hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) in the MIR-the excitons can be tuned into resonance with the HPhP modes. We find that the overlap in energy and momentum of the two MIR quasiparticles facilitate the formation of multiple strongly coupled hybridized exciton-HPhP states. Using an electromagnetic transmission line model, we derive the dispersion relations of the hybridized states and show that they are highly affected and can be manipulated by the symmetry of the system, determining the hybridization selection rules. Our results establish a general tunable MIR platform for engineering strongly coupled quasiparticle states in biased graphene systems, opening new directions for studying and controlling light-matter interactions in the long-wavelength regime.</description>

      <title>Optical lever for broadband detection of fluid interface fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exploit the optical lever principle to detect minute fluctuations of a liquid-air interface. Waves propagating on the interface deflect a specularly reflected laser beam, inducing angular deviations captured by a dual-element photodiode. We realise this principle in a compact set-up including a temperature-controlled fluid sample. Deflection angle fluctuations span five orders of magnitude in frequency, enabling detection of both low-frequency eigenmodes and high-frequency capillary waves driven by thermal effects. These results demonstrate the broad dynamical range and versatility of specular reflection spectroscopy as a minimally-invasive tool for probing interfacial dynamics in fluid and soft matter systems.</description>

      <title>Coherent Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shifts of meta-grating with radiation asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coherent Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shifts of meta-grating are proposed, which is the Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shifts of the two outgoing beams under the simultaneous incidence of two coherent optical beams from opposite sides of the grating with the same lateral wave number. As both of the frequency and lateral wave number are resonant with a topological state of the meta-grating, such as unidirectionally guided resonance or circular polarized states, the energy flux and Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shifts of the two outgoing beams are coherently controlled by the relative phase difference between the two incident beams. By applying stationary-phase method, it is found that the enhancement of coherent Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shifts by the unidirectionally guided resonance and circular polarized states is accompanied by constant and peak transmittance, respectively. Analysis with temporal coupled mode theory shows that the different features are due to difference mechanism of interference between direction scattering and resonant radiation. The coherent Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shifts with incident Gaussian beams are sensitive to the relative phase between the two beams, which can be applied in refractive index sensor.</description>

      <title>Shaping non-reciprocal caustic spin-wave beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15011v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A caustic is a mathematical concept describing the beam formation when the beam envelope is reflected or refracted by a manifold. While caustics are common in a wide range of physical systems, caustics typically exhibit a reciprocal wave propagation and are challenging to control. Here, we utilize the highly anisotropic dispersion and inherent non-reciprocity of a magnonic system to shape non-reciprocal emission of caustic-like spin wave beams in an extended 200 nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film from a nano-constricted rf waveguide. We introduce a near-field diffraction model to study spin-wave beamforming in homogeneous in-plane magnetized thin films, and reveal the propagation of non-reciprocal spin-wave beams directly emitted from the nanoconstriction by spatially resolved micro-focused Brillouin light spectroscopy (BLS). The experimental results agree well with both micromagnetic simulation, and the near-field diffraction model. The proposed method can be readily implemented to study spin-wave interference at the sub-micron scale, which is central to the development of wave-based computing applications and magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Theory of Photocurrent and High-Harmonic Generation with Chiral Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically discover possible dc-current induction and high-harmonic generation from photodriven chiral fermions in B20-type semimetals irradiated with circularly polarized light as nonlinear optical responses with several unconventional properties. First, we find multiple sign changes of the induced bulk dc photocurrent as a function of light parameters, which is ascribed to the nature of asymmetric photon-dressed bands in chiral systems. Moreover, we observe a parity-dependent directivity of high-harmonic generation where the odd- and even-order harmonics have intensities only in directions perpendicular and parallel to the polarization plane, respectively, which can be understood from dynamical symmetry of the present photodriven chiral systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-contrast laser endoscopy for in vivo gastrointestinal imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: White light endoscopy is the clinical gold standard for detecting diseases in the gastrointestinal tract. Most applications involve identifying visual abnormalities in tissue color, texture, and shape. Unfortunately, the contrast of these features is often subtle, causing many clinically relevant cases to go undetected. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Multi-contrast Laser Endoscopy (MLE): a platform for widefield clinical imaging with rapidly tunable spectral, coherent, and directional illumination. We demonstrate three capabilities of MLE: enhancing tissue chromophore contrast with multispectral diffuse reflectance, quantifying blood flow using laser speckle contrast imaging, and characterizing mucosal topography using photometric stereo. We validate MLE with benchtop models, then demonstrate MLE in vivo during clinical colonoscopies. MLE images from 31 polyps demonstrate an approximate three-fold improvement in contrast and a five-fold improvement in color difference compared to white light and narrow band imaging. With the ability to reveal multiple complementary types of tissue contrast while seamlessly integrating into the clinical environment, MLE shows promise as an investigative tool to improve gastrointestinal imaging.</description>

      <title>Single-photon emission modeling with statistical estimators for the exponential distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-photon sources are used in numerous quantum technologies, from sensing and imaging to communication, making the accurate modeling of their emissions essential. In this work, we propose a statistical framework for describing single-photon emission processes and implement estimators for the exponential distribution to quantify this phenomenon. Our approach provides a reliable method for estimating the radiative decay time, represented by the inverse rate parameter, which is crucial in quantum optics applications. We explore several statistical estimators, including maximum likelihood estimation, minimum-variance unbiased estimator, and best linear unbiased estimator. To validate our theoretical methods, we test the proposed estimators on experimental data, demonstrating their applicability in real-world settings. We also evaluate the performance of these estimators when dealing with censored data, a frequent limitation in photon emission experiments. The analysis allows us to track the performance of the proposed estimators as the amount of available data decreases, providing insights into their reliability for modeling single-photon emission events under limited resources.</description>
