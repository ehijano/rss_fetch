      <title>In-plane angular dependence of superconducting gaps in FeSe probed by high resolution specific heat measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of a rotating magnetic field (in the $ab-$plane) on the density of states has been investigated in the superconducting state of the nematic FeSe superconductor using high sensitivity specific heat measurements. As expected for (quasi-)nodal superconductors, oscillations in the specific heat ($C$) associated to the Doppler energy shift of Cooper pairs with momenta close to the gap minima are observed. In the $T_c = 9$~K crystal, $C(\phi$) displays a twofold symmetry at low temperature and low magnetic field confirming the nematic character of FeSe from thermodynamical measurements. As expected, a $\pi/2$ phase shift is observed for increasing temperatures (at $H=1$~T) but the gap structure abruptly changes above $\sim 1$~K in this sample. At low temperature, the maxima observed for $H||a-$axis at low $H$ split into lobes at $\pm 45^\circ$ when the magnetic field is increased indicating an anomalous field dependence of the gaps.</description>

      <title>Inverse spin galvanic effect in proximitized superconductor/paramagnet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the interplay between spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the paramagnetic response of itinerant electrons in proximitized superconductor/paramagnet systems gives rise to the inverse spin galvanic effect, i.e. generation of magnetic moment under the influence of the charge current. Depending on the sign of the SOC constant and the system temperature, the corresponding contribution to the magnetic response of the superconductor can be either diamagnetic or paramagnetic. We discuss the relevance between the discovered phenomena and the recent experiments on Pt/Nb heterostructures as well as the puzzling sign change of the magnetic response observed in clean Ag coated Nb cylinders.</description>

      <title>Reaching quantum critical point by adding nonmagnetic disorder in single crystals of (Ca$_{x}$Sr$_{1-x}$)$_{3}$Rh$_{4}$Sn$_{13}$ superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasi-skutterudites (Ca$_{x}$Sr$_{1-x}$)$_{3}$(Rh, Ir)$_{4}$Sn$_{13}$ show a rare nonmagnetic quantum critical point associated with the second-order charge-density-wave (CDW) and structural distortion transition extended under the superconducting "dome". So far, the non-thermal tuning parameters for accessing the QCP included changing stoichiometry, pressure, and a magnetic field. Here we add another parameter -- a nonmagnetic point-like disorder induced by 2.5 MeV electron irradiation. The non-Fermi liquid regime was inferred from the analysis of the temperature-dependent resistivity, $\rho\left(T\right)$, in single crystals of (Ca$_{x}$Sr$_{1-x}$)$_{3}$Rh$_{4}$Sn$_{13}$. Starting at compositions below the known QCP concentration of $x_c=0.9$, added disorder resulted in a progressively larger linear term and a reduced quadratic term in $\rho\left(T\right)$. This behavior is supported by theoretical analysis based on the idea of superconducting fluctuations encompassing the crossover from quantum to thermal regimes. Our results strongly support the concept that the nonmagnetic disorder can drive the system toward the quantum critical regime.</description>

      <title>Emergence of quantum Griffiths singularity in disordered TiN thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The association of quantum Griffiths singularity (QGS) to the magnetic-field-induced superconductor-metal transition predicts the unconventional diverging behaviour of dynamical critical exponent in low disorder crystalline two-dimensional superconductors. But whether this state exists in the superconducting systems exhibiting superconductor-insulator transition remains elusive. Here, we report the emergence of quantum Griffiths singularity in ultrathin disordered TiN thin films with more than two orders of magnitude variation in their normal state resistance. For both superconductor-metal transition and superconductor-insulator transition types, a diverging critical exponent is observed while approaching the quantum phase transition. Further, the magnetoresistance isotherms obey a direct activated scaling governed by an infinite-randomness fixed critical point. Finally, this work establishes the robustness of the QGS phenomenon towards a wide range of temperature and also towards a wide range of disorder strength as correlated with the normal state resistance.</description>

      <title>Vortex lattices and critical fields in anisotropic superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method is developed to compute minimal energy vortex lattices in a general Ginzburg-Landau model of a superconductor subjected to an applied magnetic field. The model may have any number of components and may be spatially anisotropic. Both the period vectors of the vortex lattice, and the orientation of its vortex lines, are determined dynamically; no assumptions are made about them. Methods to compute the first and second critical magnetic fields, $H_{c_1}$ and $H_{c_2}$, in this class of models are also developed.
  These methods are applied to a simple anisotropic single-component model, and to an anisotropic two-component model of strong current theoretical interest (a so-called $s+id$ model). It is found, in both cases, that at low applied field the vortex lines can tilt very significantly away from the direction of the applied field (by as much as $40^o$ for the single-component and $30^o$ for the $s+id$ model). The optimal lattice in the $s+id$ model is qualitatively very different from the conventional triangular Abrikosov lattice, exhibiting a phase transition from a system of Skyrmion chains when the external field is orthogonal to the basal plane to a deformed Abrikosov lattice when applied in the basal plane.</description>

      <title>Can the noble metals (Au, Ag and Cu) be superconductors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is common knowledge that noble metals are excellent conductors but do not exhibit superconductivity. On the other hand, quantum confinement in thin films has been consistently shown to induce a significant enhancement of the superconducting critical temperature in several superconductors. It is therefore an important fundamental question whether ultra-thin film confinement may induce observable superconductivity in non-superconducting metals. We present a generalization, in the Eliashberg framework, of a BCS theory of superconductivity in good metals under thin-film confinement. By numerically solving these new Eliashberg-type equations, we find the dependence of the superconducting critical temperature on the film thickness $L$. This parameter-free theory predicts a maximum increase in the critical temperature for a specific value of the film thickness, which is a function of the number of free carriers in the material. Exploiting this fact, we predict that ultra-thin films of gold, silver and copper of suitable thickness could be superconductors at low but experimentally accessible temperatures. We demonstrate that this is a fine-tuning problem where the thickness must assume a very precise value, close to half a nanometer.</description>

      <title>Non-Ioffe-Larkin composition rule and spinon-dictated electric transport in doped Mott insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electric resistivity is examined in the constrained Hilbert space of a doped Mott insulator, which is dictated by a non-Ioffe-Larkin composition rule due to the underlying mutual Chern-Simons topological gauge structure. In the low-temperature pseudogap phase, where holons remain condensed while spinons proliferate, the charge transport is governed by a chiral spinon excitation, comprising a bosonic spin-$1/2$ at the core of a supercurrent vortex. It leads to a vanishing resistivity with the "confinement" of the spinons in the superconducting phase but a low-$T$ divergence of the resistivity once the spinon confinement is disrupted by external magnetic fields. In the latter, the chiral spinons will generate a Hall number $n_H =$ doping concentration $\delta$ and a Nernst effect to signal an underlying long-range entanglement between the charge and spin degrees of freedom. Their presence is further reflected in thermodynamic quantities such as specific heat and spin susceptibility. Finally, in the high-temperature spin-disordered phase, it is shown that the holons exhibit a linear-$T$ resistivity by scattering with the spinons acting as free local moments, which generate randomized gauge fluxes as perceived by the charge degree of freedom.</description>

      <title>Tuning electronic pairing by uniaxial strain in kagome lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay of attractive electron interactions and topological states in strained kagome lattices with spin-orbit coupling via a Hubbard Hamiltonian in the mean-field approximation. In the unstrained lattice, there is a topological phase transition from a quantum spin Hall state to a charge density wave (CDW) with increasing interaction strength. Upon applying a uniform uniaxial strain to the lattice, we find a new phase with coexisting CDWs and topological states. For increasing interaction strength or strain, the system is driven into a pure CDW, signaling topological phase transitions. The directionality (nematicity) of the CDW is controlled by the direction of the applied strain. When $s$ wave electronic pairing is allowed, the system develops a superconducting order beyond a threshold attraction, which is totally suppressed by the onset of a CDW with increasing interaction. Most interestingly, moderate strain allows the coexistence of superconductivity and CDWs for a range of interaction values. This illustrates how electronic interactions and single-particle topological structures compete to create unusual correlated phases in kagome systems.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the orbital flux phase in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ from polar Kerr effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$ K, Rb, Cs) family of Kagome metals hosts unconventional charge density wave order whose nature is still an open puzzle. Accumulated evidences point to a time-reversal symmetry breaking orbital flux phase that carries loop currents. Such an order may support anomalous Hall effect. However, the polar Kerr effect measurements that probe the a.c. anomalous Hall conductivity seems to have yielded contradictory results. We first argue on symmetry grounds that some previously proposed orbital flux order, most notably the one with Star-of-David distortion, shall not give rise to anomalous Hall or polar Kerr effects. We further take the tri-hexagonal orbital flux phase as an exemplary Kagome flux order that does exhibit anomalous Hall response, and show that the Kerr rotation angle at two relevant experimental optical frequencies generally reaches microradians to sub-milliradians levels. A particularly sharp resonance enhancement is observed at around $\hbar \omega =1$ eV, suggesting exceedingly large Kerr rotation at the corresponding probing frequencies not yet accessed by previous experiments. Our study can help to interpret the Kerr measurements on $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ and to eventually resolve the nature of their CDW order.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of non-Hermitian BCS superfluids in a dissipative asymmetric Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Fermi-Hubbard model with asymmetric hopping and complex-valued interactions, which should be realized by collective one-body loss and two-body loss. By means of the NH BCS theory, we find that the weak asymmetry of the hopping does not affect the BCS superfluidity since it only affects the imaginary part of the eigenvalues of the BdG Hamiltonian. Systematic analysis in the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattices clarifies that the singularity in the density of states affects the phase boundary between the normal and dissipation-induced superfluid states. Our results can be tested in ultracold atoms by using the photoassociation techniques and a nonlocal Rabi coupling with local losses and postselecting null measurement outcomes utilized by quantum-gas microscopes.</description>

      <title>Gigantic-oxidative atomically layered epitaxy for designed complex oxides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In designing material functionality within the intricate realm of transition metal oxides, lattice structure and d-orbital occupancy are two principal determinants of the correlated physical properties, such as superconductivity. However, the modulation of these two factors is inherently limited by the need to balance thermodynamic stability, kinetic mobility, and synthesis precision, particularly for oxidation-demanding phases. We introduce a methodology, namely the gigantic-oxidative atomically layered epitaxy (GOAL-Epitaxy), enhancing oxidation power 3-4 orders of magnitude beyond oxide molecular beam epitaxy (OMBE) and pulsed laser deposition (PLD), while ensuring atomic-layer-by-layer growth of designed complex structures. Consequently, thermodynamic stability is markedly augmented at elevated temperatures, improving growth kinetics. We demonstrate the accurate synthesis of complex nickelates and cuprates, especially an artificially designed structure as a parent of high-temperature superconductivity, in which alternating single and double NiO2 layers possess distinct nominal d-orbital occupancy. The GOAL-Epitaxy enables material discovery within the vastly broadened growth parameter space.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of local magnetism and superconductivity in the heavy-fermion CeRh$_2$As$_2$ revealed by $\mu$SR studies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconducting (SC) state ($T_\mathrm{c}$ = 0.3 K) of the heavy-fermion compound CeRh$_2$As$_2$, which undergoes an unusual field-induced transition to another high-field SC state, emerges from an unknown ordered state below $T_\mathrm{o}$ = 0.55 K. While an electronic multipolar order of itinerant Ce-4$f$ states was proposed to account for the $T_\mathrm{o}$ phase, the exact order parameter has not been known to date. Here, we report on muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) studies of the magnetic and SC properties in CeRh$_2$As$_2$ single crystals at low temperatures. We reveal a magnetic origin of the $T_\mathrm{o}$ order by identifying a spontaneous internal field below $T_\mathrm{o}$ = 0.55 K. Furthermore, we find evidence of a microscopic coexistence of local magnetism with bulk superconductivity. Our findings open the possibility that the $T_\mathrm{o}$ phase involves both dipole and higher order Ce-4$f$ moment degrees of freedom and accounts for the unusual non-Fermi liquid behavior.</description>

      <title>Monopole Superconductivity in Magnetically Doped Cd$_3$As$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.04249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When superconducting pairing occurs between Fermi surfaces with different Chern numbers, the Cooper pairs possess nontrivial pair Berry phase, which enforces pairing gap nodes. The resulting pairing order is further distinguished from the familiar $s$-, $p$-, and $d$-wave pairing orders by a nonzero pair monopole charge and is described by monopole harmonics. To date, this exotic monopole pairing order is yet to be achieved experimentally. We therefore study the magnetically doped Dirac semimetal Cd$_3$As$_2$ as a candidate material for realizing monopole superconductivity with pair monopole charges $q_p=1$ or $2$, depending on the chemical potential. For each case of pair monopole charge, we explore representatives of uniform pairing orders in all allowed irreducible representations of the $C_{4h}$ symmetry of magnetically doped Cd$_3$As$_2$. We demonstrate the distinctions in the monopole analogs of different higher partial wave superconducting orders that result from the combination of topological Fermi surfaces of higher Chern number and crystalline symmetry. In all cases, the patterns of the superconducting phase winding around a Fermi surface are constrained by the topologically invariant total winding number, which depends only on the pair monopole charge and requires nodes in the $q_p\neq 0$ superconducting order. Our work can guide further experimental investigation of monopole orders in the topological semimetal Cd$_3$As$_2$ and can be generalized to other materials with Fermi surfaces of higher Chern number, which enforce monopole pairing order in higher partial waves, such as the monopole analog of $f$-wave pairing.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the transport properties of a Cooper pair splitter device composed of two-point electrodes in contact with a ferromagnetic/superconductor (F/S) junction constructed on the surface of a topological insulator (TI). For the pair potential in the S region, we consider s- and d-wave symmetries, while for the F region, we focus on a magnetization vector normal to the TI surface. Non-local transport along the F/S interface is mediated by chiral Majorana edge states, with chirality controlled by the polarization of the magnetization vector. We demonstrate that crossed Andreev reflections slowly decays with the separation of the electrodes in standard clean samples. Our system exhibits a maximum Cooper pair-splitting efficiency of 80% for a symmetrical voltage configuration, even in high-temperature superconductor devices.</description>

Abstract: We explore electronic and structural properties of Fm$\overline{3}$m Lu-H-N structures with specific N,H ordering as plausible candidates for near-ambient superconductivity possibly originating from their remarkably narrow hydrogen-based bands at the Fermi level. Although LuH$_{2.875}$N$_{0.125}$ exhibits an instability persisting up to 17 GPa, it is anharmonically stable near ambient pressure when accounting for quantum nuclear effects. The presence of flat bands near $E_\text{F}$ is understood to arise from destructive\ quantum interference between N-p and surrounding H-s orbitals, with certain types of defects leaving the flat bands unaffected. The results suggest there is an optimal pressure near ambient where the superconducting $T_{\text{c}}$ is maximized in this structure by anharmonically-stabilized low-frequency and non-adiabatically coupled high-frequency hydrogen modes. Despite the metastability of this structure, its electronic properties and dynamical stability when calculated beyond a classical harmonic approach can explain the reported near-ambient superconductivity in Lu-H-N.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in metallic hydrogen</title>

Abstract: Superconductivity, the amazing phenomenon of lossless transmission of electric current through metallic wires, requires cooling of the wire to low temperatures. Metallic hydrogen is considered as the most likely candidate for superconductivity at very high temperatures, possibly even room temperature. However, as a result of various approximations used, conflicting theoretical predictions exist for the range of temperatures where superconductivity is expected to occur. Here we avoid those approximations and confirm that metallic hydrogen is indeed a superconductor, but this is limited to temperatures far below previous estimates. We exploit the "jellium" model proposed in 1966 by De Gennes, where superconductivity is caused by the combination of Coulomb repulsion between the electrons and Coulomb attraction between the protons and the electrons. We find that the superconducting order develops over an energy range far exceeding the characteristic phonon energy, and that the phase of the order parameter flips 180 degrees at the characteristic phonon energy above and below the Fermi energy.</description>

      <title>Highly Efficient Superconducting Diodes and Rectifiers for Quantum Circuitry</title>

Abstract: Superconducting electronics is essential for energy-efficient quantum and classical high-end computing applications. Towards this goal, non-reciprocal superconducting circuit elements, such as superconducting diodes (SDs) can fulfill many critical needs. SDs have been the subject of multiple studies, but integrating several SDs in a superconducting circuit remains a challenge. Here we implement the first SD bridge with multiple SDs exhibiting reproducible characteristics operating at temperatures of a few Kelvin. We demonstrate its functionality as a full wave rectifier using elemental superconductors and insulating ferromagnets, with efficiency up to 43%, and ac to dc signal conversion capabilities at frequencies up to 40 kHz. Our results show a pathway with a highly scalable thin film platform for nonreciprocal superconducting circuits. They could significantly reduce energy consumption as well as decohering thermal and electromagnetic noise in quantum computing.</description>

      <title>A tale of two pairs: on the origin of the pseudogap end point in the high-T$_{c}$ cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02785v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are two seemingly unrelated puzzles about the cuprate superconductors. The first puzzle concerns the strong non-BCS behavior around $x_{c}$, the end point of the superconducting dome on the overdoped side, where the cuparte is believed to be well described by the fermi liquid theory. This is the most evident in the observed $\rho_{s}(0)-T_{c}$ scaling and the large amount of uncondensed optical spectral weight at low energy. The second puzzle concerns the remarkable robustness of the d-wave pairing against the inevitable disorder effect in such a doped system, which is also totally unexpected from the conventional BCS picture. Here we show that these two puzzles are deeply connected to the origin of a third puzzle about the cuprate superconductors, namely, the mysterious quantum critical behavior observed around $x^{*}$, the so-called pseudogap end point. Through a systematic variational optimization of the disordered 2D $t-J$ model from the resonating valence bond(RVB) perspective, we find that the d-wave pairing in this model is remarkably more robust against the disorder effect than that in a conventional d-wave BCS superconductor. We find that such remarkable robustness can be attributed to the spin-charge separation mechanism in the RVB picture, through which the d-wave RVB pairing of the charge neutral spinons becomes essentially immune to the impurity potential except for the secondary effect related to the modulation of the local doping level by the disorder. We propose that there exists a Mott transition at $x^{*}$, where the RVB pairing in the underdoped regime is transmuted into the increasingly more BCS-like pairing for $x&gt;x^{*}$, whose increasing fragility against the disorder effect leads to the non-BCS behavior and the ultimate suppression of superconductivity around $x_{c}$.</description>
