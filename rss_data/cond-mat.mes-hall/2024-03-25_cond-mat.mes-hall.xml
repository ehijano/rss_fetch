      <title>High Harmonic Spectroscopy Probes Lattice Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probing of coherent lattice vibrations in solids has been conventionally carried out using time-resolved transient spectroscopy where only the relative oscillation amplitude can be obtained. Using time-resolved X-ray techniques, absolute electron-phonon coupling strength could be extracted. However, the complexity of such an experiment renders it impossible to be carried out in conventional laboratories. Here we demonstrate that the electron-phonon, anharmonic phonon-phonon coupling, and their relaxation dynamics can be probed in real-time using high-harmonic spectroscopy. Our technique is background-free and has extreme sensitivity directly in the energy domain. In combination with the optical deformation potential calculated from density functional perturbation theory and the absolute energy modulation depth, our measurement reveals the maximum displacement of neighboring oxygen atoms in {\alpha}-quartz crystal to tens of picometers in real space. By employing a straightforward and robust time-windowed Gabor analysis for the phonon-modulated high-harmonic spectrum, we successfully observe channel-resolved four-phonon scattering processes in such highly nonlinear interactions. Our work opens a new realm for accurate measurement of coherent phonons and their scattering dynamics, which allows for potential benchmarking ab-initio calculations in solids</description>

      <title>Super-Planckian radiative heat transfer between coplanar two-dimensional metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism to investigate the radiative heat transfer (RHT) between coplanar two-dimensional (2D) metals via a tight-binding square lattice model and the Drude model. Our results reveal that the RHT between coplanar 2D metals is significantly larger than black-body radiation in both the near and far fields, leading to a global super-Planckian RHT. As the separation distance increases, the heat flux density exhibits a rapid decrease in the near field, followed by a slower decrease and eventual $1/d$ dependence in the far field, while maintaining a much higher magnitude than black-body radiation. Evanescent waves dominate the heat transfer in the near field, while propagating waves dominate the far field. Surprisingly, the propagating heat flux remains almost constant over a wide range of distances, resulting in a super-Planckian behavior in the far field. The dispersion relation of the spectrum function reveals distinct contributions from propagating and evanescent waves, with possible origins from surface plasmon resonance. These findings provide insights into the unique characteristics of RHT between coplanar 2D metals and highlight the potential for achieving enhanced heat transfer beyond the black-body limit, with implications for thermal management and energy conversion applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Valley Hall effect without Berry curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum valley Hall effect (QVHE) is characterized by the valley Chern number (VCN) in a way that one-dimensional (1D) chiral metallic states are guaranteed to appear at the domain walls (DW) between two domains with opposite VCN for a given valley. Although in the case of QVHE, the total BC of the system is zero, the BC distributed locally around each valley makes the VCN well-defined as long as inter-valley scattering is negligible. Here, we propose a new type of valley-dependent topological phenomenon that occurs when the BC is strictly zero at each momentum. Such zero Berry curvature (ZBC) QVHE is characterized by the valley Euler number (VEN) which is computed by integrating the Euler curvature around a given valley in two-dimensional (2D) systems with space-time inversion symmetry. 1D helical metallic states can be topologically protected at the DW between two domains with the opposite VENs when the DW configuration preserves either the mirror symmetry with respect to the DW or the combination of the DW space-time inversion , and chiral symmetries. We establish the fundamental origin of ZBC-QVHE. Also, by combining tight-binding model study and first-principles calculations, we propose stacked hexagonal bilayer lattices including h-BX (X=As, P) and large-angle twisted bilayer graphenes as candidate systems with robust helical DW states protected by VEN.</description>

      <title>Interference patterns of propagating spin wave in spin Hall oscillator arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we discuss the observation of spin wave interference generated by magnetic oscillators. We employ micromagnetic simulations for two coherent spin Hall nanowire oscillators positioned nearby, horizontally or vertically. The two nanowires produce circular waves with short wavelengths on the order of 100 nm, which interfere with each other. In the horizontal configuration, the spin waves exhibit constructive and destructive fringes, indicating amplification or cancellation of the amplitudes, respectively. The synchronization of spin waves in the current geometry of the two nanowires is facilitated by the combination of dipolar field and propagating spin waves. Additionally, the vertical alignment results in standing spin waves characterized by multiple antinodes and nodes. These observations are interpreted using a wave model that incorporates the superposition principle for each case.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Bound States in the Continuum in InSb nanowire networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are exotic, localized states even though their energy lies in the continuum spectra. Since its discovery in 1929, the quest to unveil these exotic states in charge transport experiments remains an active pursuit in condensed matter physics. Here, we study charge transport in InSb nanowire networks in the ballistic regime and subject to a perpendicular magnetic field as ideal candidates to observe and control the appearance of BICs. We find that BICs reveal themselves as distinctive resonances or antiresonances in the conductance by varying the applied magnetic field and the Fermi energy. We systematically consider different lead connections in hashtag-like nanowire networks, finding the optimal configuration that enhances the features associated with the emergence of BICs. Finally, the investigation focuses on the effect of the Rashba spin-orbit interaction of InSb on the occurrence of BICs in nanowire networks. While the interaction generally plays a detrimental role in the signatures of the BICs in the conductance of the nanowire networks, it opens the possibility to operate these nanostructures as spin filters for spintronics. We believe that this work could pave the way for the unambiguous observation of BICs in charge transport experiments and for the development of advanced spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Spin Hall Effect: Symmetry Breaking, Twisting, and Giant Disorder Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically-thin materials based on transition metal dichalcogenides and graphene offer a promising avenue for unlocking the mechanisms underlying the spin Hall effect (SHE) in heterointerfaces. Here, we develop a microscopic theory of the SHE for twisted van der Waals heterostructures that fully incorporates twisting and disorder effects, and illustrate the critical role of symmetry breaking in the generation of spin-Hall currents. We find that an accurate treatment of vertex corrections leads to a qualitatively and quantitatively different SHE than that obtained from popular approaches like the ``$i\,\eta$'' and ladder approximations. A pronounced oscillatory behavior of skew-scattering processes with twist angle, $\theta$, is predicted, reflecting a non-trivial interplay of Rashba and valley-Zeeman effects and yields a vanishing SHE for $\theta = 30^\circ$ and, for graphene-WSe$_2$, an optimal SHE for $\theta \approx 17^\circ$. Our findings reveal disorder and broken symmetries as important knobs to optimize interfacial SHEs.</description>

      <title>Graph neural network coarse-grain force field for the molecular crystal RDX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Condense phase molecular systems organize in wide range of distinct molecular configurations, including amorphous melt and glass as well as crystals often exhibiting polymorphism, that originate from their intricate intra- and intermolecular forces. While accurate coarse-grain (CG) models for these materials are critical to understand phenomena beyond the reach of all-atom simulations, current models cannot capture the diversity of molecular structures. We introduce a generally applicable approach to develop CG force fields for molecular crystals combining graph neural networks (GNN) and data from an all-atom simulations and apply it to the high-energy density material RDX. We address the challenge of expanding the training data with relevant configurations via an iterative procedure that performs CG molecular dynamics of processes of interest and reconstructs the atomistic configurations using a pre-trained neural network decoder. The multi-site CG model uses a GNN architecture constructed to satisfy translational invariance and rotational covariance for forces. The resulting model captures both crystalline and amorphous states for a wide range of temperatures and densities.</description>

      <title>Theory of quasiparticle-induced errors in driven-dissipative Schr\"odinger cat qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms of qubit decoherence is a crucial prerequisite for improving the qubit performance. In this work we discuss the effects of residual Bogolyubov quasiparticles in Schr\"odinger cat qubits, either of the dissipative or Kerr type. The major difference from previous studies of quasiparticles in superconducting qubits is that the Schr\"odinger cat qubits are operated under non-equilibrium conditions. Indeed, an external microwave drive is needed to stabilize "cat states", which are superpositions of coherent degenerate eigenstates of an effective stationary Lindbladian in the rotating frame. We present a microscopic derivation of the master equation for cat qubits and express the effect of the quasiparticles as dissipators acting on the density matrix of the cat qubit. This enables us to determine the conditions under which the quasiparticles give a substantial contribution to the qubit errors.</description>

      <title>Fine phase control of domain walls in curved nanostripes: from bits to nits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a physical mechanism for fine-tuning the phase of a domain wall around the equilibrium directions involving the application of an external field and a spin polarized current in opposite directions. In this way, the position of the domain wall remains unchanged, but its phase can be slightly modified around the initial equilibrium positions, applying the external field/current smoothly. We point out a few applications to which this fine tuning may lead.</description>

      <title>Photonic cross noise spectroscopy of Majorana bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a route to detect Majorana bound states (MBSs) by coupling a topological superconductor to quantum dots (QDs) in a $pnp$ junction. Here, two MBSs are coherently coupled to electrons on two QDs, which recombine with holes to photons. We focus on the spectroscopy of cross-correlated shot noise and the polarization of the emitted photons. Our detection scheme allows us to probe the necessary condition for the emergence of MBSs, specifically, the existence of non-local triplet superconducting correlations and also the fundamental property that two MBSs comprise a single complex fermion. We compare our results to the ones obtained from non-topological quasi-MBSs (qMBSs) and establish a correspondence between the number of peaks in the cross-correlation with the number of MBSs in the system. Here, we can identify a tunneling regime that facilitates differentiation between topological MBSs and trivial qMBSs. Additionally, we test the robustness of the detection scheme by the addition of uncorrelated particles.</description>

      <title>Topological analysis and experimental control of transformations of domain walls in magnetic cylindrical nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology is a powerful tool for categorizing magnetization textures, highlighting specific features in both 2D systems, such as thin films or curved surfaces, and in 3D bulk systems. In the emerging field of 3D nanomagnetism within confined geometries, the contributions from both volume and surface must be considered, requiring appropriate topological analysis to obtain a complete view of the system. Here, we consider domain walls in cylindrical magnetic nanowires to illustrate the use of topological invariants. We begin with micromagnetic simulations of domain wall transformation under the stimulus of an \OErsted field, tracking bulk and surface topological signatures, and analyzing the interplay between multiple micromagnetic objects. For instance, the extensive analysis allowed us to highlight mechanisms of domain wall type conversion from topologically non-trivial to trivial states, a phenomenon disregarded in previous studies. Additionally, we provide experimental evidence of the transient states predicted to occur during the dynamical process.</description>

      <title>Crossover from relativistic to non-relativistic net magnetization for MnTe altermagnet candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally study magnetization reversal curves for MnTe single crystals, which is the altermagnetic candidate. Above 85~K temperature, we confirm the antiferromagnetic behavior of magnetization $M$, which is known for $\alpha$--MnTe. Below 85~K, we observe anomalous low-field magnetization behavior, which is accompanied by the sophisticated $M(\alpha)$ angle dependence with beating pattern as the interplay between $M(\alpha)$ maxima and minima: in low fields, $M(\alpha)$ shows ferromagnetic-like 180$^\circ$ periodicity, while at high magnetic fields, the periodicity is changed to the 90$^\circ$ one. This angle dependence is the most striking result of our experiment, while it can not be expected for standard magnetic systems. In contrast, in altermagnets, symmetry allows ferromagnetic behavior only due to the spin-orbit coupling. Thus, we claim that our experiment shows the effect of weak spin-orbit coupling in MnTe, with crossover from relativistic to non-relativistic net magnetization, and, therefore, we experimentally confirm altermagnetism in MnTe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of quantum states of matter that are compressible but have vanishing DC conductivity in the absence of disorder. We show that the composite Fermi liquid emerging from strong interaction in a generic Chern band has zero Drude weight, in stark contrast to normal Fermi liquids. Our work establishes the absence of Drude weight as the defining property of the composite Fermi liquid phase, which distinguishes it from the Fermi liquid or other types of non-Fermi liquids. Our findings point to a possibly wide class of gapless quantum phases with unexpected transport and optical properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the inadequacy of mean-field theory by exploring the effects of initial state correlations on the dynamics of continuous time crystals, necessitating higher-order cumulant expansions. We exemplify this using cat states for which the mean field fails to predict a phase transition but the second order cumulant expansion theory captures it. Motivated by the symmetries of the system, we choose a truncation of cumulant theory at the second-order and demonstrate that it is sufficient to accurately capture the dynamical features overlooked by the mean-field.</description>

      <title>Dipole-dipole interacting two-level emitters in a moderately intense laser field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the resonance fluorescence features of a small ensemble of closely packed and moderately laser pumped two-level emitters at resonance. The mean distance between any two-level radiators is smaller than the corresponding emission wavelength, such that the dipole-dipole interactions are not negligible. We have found that under the secular approximation, the collective resonance fluorescence spectrum consists of 2N+1 spectral lines, where N is the number of emitters from the sample. The 2N lateral spectral-bands, symmetrically located around the generalized Rabi frequency with respect to the central line at the laser frequency, are distinguishable if the dipole-dipole coupling strength is larger than the collective spontaneous decay rate. This way, one can extract the radiators number within the ensemble via measuring of the spontaneously scattered collective resonance fluorescence spectrum. Contrary, if the dipole-dipole coupling is of the order of or smaller than the cooperative spontaneous decay rate, but still non-negligible, the spectrum turns into a Mollow-like fluorescence spectrum, where the two lateral spectral lines broadens, proportional to the dipole-dipole coupling strength, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Generic Topological Criterion for Flat Bands in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the continuum limit of moir\'e graphene is described by a $(2+1)$-dimensional field theory of Dirac fermions coupled to two classical vector fields: a periodic gauge and spin field. We further show that the existence of a flat band implies an effective dimensional reduction, where the time dimension is ``removed.'' The resulting two-dimensional Euclidean theory contains the chiral anomaly. The associated Atiyah-Singer index theorem provides a self-consistency condition for flat bands. In the Abelian limit, where the spin field is disregarded, we reproduce a periodic series of quantized magic angles known to exist in twisted bilayer graphene in the chiral limit. However, the results are not exact. If the Abelian field has zero total flux, perfectly flat bands can not exist, because of the leakage of edge states into neighboring triangular patches with opposite field orientations. We demonstrate that the non-Abelian spin component can correct this and completely flatten the bands via an effective renormalization of the Abelian component into a configuration with a non-zero total flux. We present the Abelianization of the theory where the Abelianized flat band can be mapped to that of the lowest Landau level. We show that the Abelianization corrects the values of the magic angles consistent with numerical results. We also use this criterion to prove that an external magnetic field splits the series into pairs of magnetic field-dependent magic angles associated with flat moir\'e-Landau bands. The topological criterion and the Abelianization procedure provide a generic practical method for finding flat bands in a variety of material systems including but not limited to moir\'e bilayers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a gauge-invariant model of planar, square molecules coupled to a quantized spatially-varying cavity electromagnetic vector potential A(r). Specifically, we choose a temporally chiral cavity hosting a uniform magnetic field B, as this is the simplest instance in which a transverse spatially-varying A(r) is at play. We show that when the molecules are in the Van Vleck paramagnetic regime, an equilibrium quantum phase transition to a photon condensate state occurs.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we obtain the exact solutions for bound states of tilted anisotropic Dirac materials under the action of external electric and magnetic fields with translational symmetry. In order to solve the eigenvalue equation that arises from the effective Hamiltonian of these materials, we describe an algorithm that allow us to decouple the differential equations that are obtained for the spinor components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce feedback-measurement technologies to achieve flexible control of Weyl points and conduct the first experimental demonstration of Weyl type I-II transition in mechanical systems. We demonstrate that non-Hermiticity can expand the Fermi arc surface states from connecting Weyl points to Weyl rings, and lead to a localization transition of edge states influenced by the interplay between band topology and the non-Hermitian skin effect. Our findings offer valuable insights into the design and manipulation of Weyl points in mechanical systems, providing a promising avenue for manipulating topological modes in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Fate of the superconducting state in floating islands of hybrid nanowire devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of transport current on the superconducting order parameter in superconducting islands in full-shell epitaxial Al-InAs nanowires. Depending on a device layout, the suppression of superconductivity occurs in three fundamentally different ways -- by a critical current in the case of superconducting reservoirs and by a critical voltage or by a critical Joule power in the case of normal reservoirs. In the latter case, the collapse of the superconducting state depends on the ratio of the dwell time and the electron-phonon relaxation time of quasiparticles in the island. For low resistive and high resistive coupling to the reservoirs, respectively, the relaxation-free regime and the strong electron-phonon relaxation regime are realized. Our results shed light on potential shortcomings of finite-bias transport spectroscopy in floating islands.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry breaking and topological charge of graphene nanoribbons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the edge properties of rectangular graphene nanoribbons featuring two zigzag edges and two armchair edges. Although the self-consistent Hartree-Fock fields break chiral symmetry, our work demonstrates that graphene nanoribbons maintain their status as short-range entangled symmetry-protected topological insulators. The relevant symmetry involves combined mirror and time-reversal operations. In undoped ribbons displaying edge ferromagnetism, the band gap edge states with a topological charge form on the zigzag edges. An analysis of the anomalous continuity equation elucidates that this topological charge is induced by the gap term. In low-doped zigzag ribbons, where the ground state exhibits edge spin density waves, this topological charge appears as a nearly zero-energy edge mode. Our system is outside the conventional calssification for topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of Majorana zero modes in full-shell hybrid nanowires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Full-shell nanowires have been proposed as an alternative nanowire design in the search of topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs). They are hybrid nanostructures consisting of a semiconductor core fully covered by a thin superconductor shell and subject to a magnetic flux. In this work we critically examine this proposal, finding a very rich spectral phenomenology that combines the Little-Parks modulation of the parent-gap superconductor with flux, the presence of flux-dispersing Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) analog subgap states, and the emergence of MZMs across finite flux intervals that depend on the transverse wavefunction profile of the charge density in the core section. Through microscopic simulations and analytical derivations, we study different regimes for the semiconductor core, ranging from the hollow-core approximation, to the tubular-core nanowire appropriate for a semiconductor tube with an insulating core, to the solid-core nanowire. We compute the phase diagrams for the different models in cylindrical nanowires and find that MZMs typically coexist with CdGM analogs at zero energy, rendering them gapless. However, we also find topologically protected parameter regions, or islands, with gapped MZMs. In this sense, the most promising candidate to obtain topologically protected MZMs in a full-shell geometry is the nanowire with a tubular-shaped core. Moving beyond pristine nanowires, we study the effect of mode mixing perturbations. Strikingly, mode mixing can act like a topological $p$-wave pairing between particle-hole Bogoliubov partners, and is therefore able to create new topologically protected MZMs in regions of the phase diagram that were originally trivial. As a result, the phase diagram is utterly transformed and exhibits protected MZMs in around half of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Anomalous acousto-current within the quantum Hall plateaus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically study the acousto-current of two-dimensional electron systems in the integer and fractional quantum Hall regimes using surface acoustic waves. We are able to separate the co-existing acoustic scattering and drag, when phonons induce drag current and tune the electron conductivity, respectively. At large acoustic power, the drag current is finite when the system is compressible and exhibits minima when incompressible quantum Hall effects appear. Surprisingly, it exhibits anomalously large bipolar spikes within the quantum Hall plateaus while it vanishes linearly with reduced acoustic power at compressible phases. The current peaks reverse their polarity at the two flanks of exact integer or fractional fillings, consistent with the opposite electric charge of the quasiparticle/quasihole.</description>

      <title>Autoparametric resonance extending the bit-flip time of a cat qubit up to 0.3 s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cat qubits, for which logical $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ are coherent states $|\pm\alpha\rangle$ of a harmonic mode, offer a promising route towards quantum error correction. Using dissipation to our advantage so that photon pairs of the harmonic mode are exchanged with single photons of its environment, it is possible to stabilize the logical states and exponentially increase the bit-flip time of the cat qubit with the photon number $|\alpha|^2$. Large two-photon dissipation rate $\kappa_2$ ensures fast qubit manipulation and short error correction cycles, which are instrumental to correct the remaining phase-flip errors in a repetition code of cat qubits. Here we introduce and operate an autoparametric superconducting circuit that couples a mode containing the cat qubit to a lossy mode whose frequency is set at twice that of the cat mode. This passive coupling does not require a parametric pump and reaches a rate $\kappa_2/2\pi\approx 2~\mathrm{MHz}$. With such a strong two-photon dissipation, bit-flip errors of the autoparametric cat qubit are prevented for a characteristic time up to 0.3~s with only a mild impact on phase-flip errors. Besides, we illustrate how the phase of a quantum superposition between $|\alpha\rangle$ and $|-\alpha\rangle$ can be arbitrarily changed by driving the harmonic mode while keeping the engineered dissipation active.</description>

      <title>Interpreting X-ray absorption spectra of Vanadyl Phthalocyanines Spin Qubit Candidates using a Machine Learning-Assisted Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16415v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetic dilution of Vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc) within the isostructural diamagnetic Titanyl phthalocyanine (TiOPc) affords promising molecular spin qubit platforms for solid-state quantum computing. The development of quantitative methods for determining how the interactions with a supporting substrate impact the electronic structure of the system are fundamental to determine their potential integration in physical devices. In this work we propose a combined approach based on X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), atomic multiplet calculations, and density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the 3d orbital level structure of VOPc on TiOPc/Ag(100). We characterize VOPc in different molecular environments realized by changing the thickness of TiOPc interlayer and adsorption configuration on Ag(100). Depending on the molecular film structure, we find characteristic XAS features that we analyze using atomic multiplet calculations. We use a Bayesian optimization algorithm to accelerate the parameter search process in the multiplet calculations and identify the ground state properties, such as the 3d orbital occupancy and splitting, as well as intra-atomic interactions. Our analysis indicates that VOPc retains its spin S = 1/2 character in all configurations. Conversely, the energy separation and sequence of the unoccupied V 3d orbitals sensitively depend on the interaction with the surface and TiOPc interlayer. We validate the atomic orbital picture obtained from the multiplet model by comparison with DFT, which further allows us to understand the VOPc electronic properties using a molecular orbital description.</description>

      <title>Leading-logarithmic approximation by one-loop renormalization group within Matsubara formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how to devise a Matsubara-formalism-based one-loop approximation to the flow of the functional renormalization group (FRG) that reproduces identically the leading-logarithmic parquet approximation. This construction of a controlled fermionic FRG approximation in a regime not accessible by perturbation theory generalizes a previous study from the real-time zero-temperature formalism to the Matsubara formalism and thus to the de facto standard framework used for condensed-matter FRG studies. Our investigation is based on a simple model for the absorption of x rays in metals. It is a core part of our construction to exploit that in a suitable leading-logarithmic approximation the values of the particle-hole susceptibility on the real- and on the imaginary-frequency axes are identical.</description>
