      <title>Mammo-Clustering: Context Clustering based Multi-view Tri Level Information Fusion for Lesion Location and Classification in Mammography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast cancer is a significant global health issue, and the diagnosis of breast cancer through imaging remains challenging. Mammography images are characterized by extremely high resolution, while lesions often occupy only a small portion of the image. Down-sampling in neural networks can easily lead to the loss of microcalcifications or subtle structures. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Context Clustering based triple information fusion framework. First, in comparison to CNNs or transformers, we observe that Context clustering methods are (1) more computationally efficient and (2) better at associating structural or pathological features. This makes them particularly well-suited for mammography in clinical settings. Next, we propose a triple information fusion mechanism that integrates global, feature-based local, and patch-based local information. The proposed approach is rigorously evaluated on two public datasets, Vindr-Mammo and CBIS-DDSM, using five independent data splits to ensure statistical robustness. Our method achieves an AUC of 0.828 \pm 0.020 on Vindr-Mammo and 0.805 \pm 0.020 on CBIS-DDSM, outperforming the second best method by 3.5% and 2.5%, respectively. These improvements are statistically significant (p&lt;0.05), highlighting the advantages of the Context Clustering Network with triple information fusion. Overall, our Context Clustering framework demonstrates strong potential as a scalable and cost-effective solution for large-scale mammography screening, enabling more efficient and accurate breast cancer detection.

      <title>Self-organization drives symmetry-breaking, scaling, and critical growth transitions in stem cell-derived organoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of spatial patterns and organized growth is a hallmark of developing tissues. While symmetry-breaking and scaling laws govern these processes, how cells coordinate spatial patterning with size regulation remains unclear. Here, we combine quantitative imaging, a Turing activator-repressor model with self-organized reactive boundaries, and in vitro models of early mouse development to study mesodermal pattern formation in two-dimensional (2D) gastruloids. We show that colony size dictates symmetry: small colonies (radius approximately 100 micrometers) spontaneously break symmetry, while larger ones remain centro-symmetric, consistent with size-dependent positional information and model predictions. The mesodermal domain area scales robustly with colony size following a power law, independent of cell density, indicating that cells sense and respond to gastruloid size. Time-lapse imaging reveals a biphasic growth law: an early power-law expansion followed by exponential arrest, marking a dynamical phase transition. These dynamics, conserved across sizes, reflect features of criticality seen in physical systems, where self-organization, scaling, and boundary feedback converge. Our findings uncover a minimal mechanism for size-dependent pattern formation and growth control. This framework enables quantitative investigation of symmetry-breaking and scaling in self-organizing tissues, offering insights into the physical principles underlying multicellular organization.</description>
