      <title>Nonlinear van der Waals metasurfaces with resonantly enhanced light generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient nonlinear wave mixing is of paramount importance for a wide range of applications. However, weak optical nonlinearities pose significant challenges for accessing nonlinear light-matter interaction in compact systems. Here, we experimentally study second harmonic generation in deeply subwavelength 3R-MoS2 metasurfaces (&lt;\lambda/13 thick). Our measurements, supported by theoretical analysis, reveal a complex interplay and coupling between geometric resonances, optical extinction, and strong nonlinear susceptibility dispersion near excitons. We further demonstrate &gt;150-fold enhancement in second harmonic signal at 740 nm driven by the A exciton resonance. Additionally, our theoretical studies predict an enhancement of more than 10^6 in second harmonic generation in &lt;100 nm thick structures exhibiting bound states in the continuum resonance. These findings provide insight into accessing and harnessing the unprecedented 3R-MoS2 nonlinearities at a subwavelength scale, paving the way for ultracompact nonlinear photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Polariton Dynamics in a Multimode Cavity: Noise-enhanced Ballistic Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in optical measurements enable precise tracking of cavity polariton dynamics with exceptional spatiotemporal resolution. Building on these developments, we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of wave packet dynamics in a noisy emitter lattice embedded in a multi-mode microcavity. We uncover a series of dynamic phenomena in both the noise-free and noisy cases: (i) In the noise-free case, the emitters' probability density splits into two Gaussians whose group velocities are defined by the lower and upper polariton branches. (ii) Noise induces dephasing and leads to multiple dynamical stages with different time scales spanning several orders of magnitude. These stages include, in order of increasing duration: underdamped Rabi oscillations; damping of the center of mass velocity of the emitters' probability density; population thermalization; and the transition from the ballistic to the diffusive regimes of the probability density spreading. (iii) Most strikingly, dephasing enhances the ballistic spreading, which persists for several orders of magnitude longer than it does without a cavity. Some of our predictions align with recent experimental observations, while others can be tested in existing platforms. Understanding wave packet dynamics across multiple time scales in the presence of noise is crucial for optimizing polaritonic devices. This study paves the way for future experiments focused on light-matter interactions in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Meta-optical Imaging at Thermal Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of meta-optics has grown to include metalenses spanning the ultraviolet to terahertz regimes. Imaging is a key application of meta-optics, with recent works demonstrating meta-optical imaging with advanced functionalities including wide field of view, broadband operation, and polarization sensitivity. In this review, we focus on meta-optical imaging for thermal wavelengths. Thermal meta-optics are less well-studied than those in the visible range but have vast potential applications spanning defense, health, and geological sensing. We first introduce these applications and their specific challenges. With compact form-factor and multi-functional capabilities, we suggest that meta-optics are particularly well-suited to meet the needs of imaging in the mid- and long-wave infrared. Then, we review published experimental demonstrations of thermal imaging via meta-optics. These meta-optics vary in complexity from simple hyperboloid metalenses to complex systems composed of engineered meta-atoms and multiple layers of optics. Finally, we suggest some areas where thermal meta-optics may be useful, and we identify some emerging approaches to solve lingering challenges of meta-optical imaging.</description>

      <title>Optical matrix imaging applied to embryology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution label-free imaging of oocytes and embryos is essential for in vitro fertilization procedures. Yet conventional microscopy fails in this task because of aberrations and multiple scattering induced by refractive index heterogeneities inside the sample. These detrimental phenomena drastically degrade the images of early embryos particularly in depth. To overcome these fundamental problems without sacrificing the frame rate, optical matrix imaging (OMI) is a suitable tool. Relying on an ultra-fast measurement of the reflection matrix associated with the sample, it can compensate for aberration and forward multiple scattering in post-processing, thereby providing three-dimensional and highly contrasted images of embryos at a confocal resolution. As a first proof-of-concept, bovine oocytes and embryos are imaged at a 300 nm resolution almost in real time. Our system enables visualization of intracellular structures such as lipids and mitochondria in the cytoplasm or the zona pellucida surrounding it. Altogether, we demonstrate that OMI is a promising tool for research in developmental biology and for time-lapse monitoring of oocytes and embryos in assisted reproduction.</description>

      <title>Quasi-solitons and stable superluminal opto-acoustic pulses in Brillouin scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically and numerically study the evolution of soliton-like waves supported by stimulated Brillouin scattering. First, the emergence and unusual behaviour of resonant solitary waves are investigated for both backward and forward three wave interactions. We find that these waves can be characterized by the ratio between the optical and acoustic damping coefficients. We also examine a second class of non-resonant anti-symmetric soliton-like waves, which have a more complicated pulse shape than traditional solitons. These waves are superluminal, with pulse velocities that can be tuned by the input Stokes and pump fields. We discuss the excitation of these types of waves and the physical conditions required for their observation.</description>

      <title>Crossed laser phase plates for transmission electron microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For decades since the development of phase-contrast optical microscopy, an analogous approach has been sought for maximizing the image contrast of weakly-scattering objects in transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The recent development of the laser phase plate (LPP) has demonstrated that an amplified, focused laser standing wave can provide stable, tunable phase shift to the high-energy electron beam, thus achieving phase-contrast TEM. With the proof-of-concept experimental demonstrations of the LPP now completed, in this paper we explore how the design can be further improved by tailoring its properties to the needs of biological imaging. In particular, we introduce the approach of crossed laser phase plates (XLPP): two laser standing waves intersecting in the diffraction plane of the TEM, rather than a single beam as in the current LPP. We provide a theoretical model for the XLPP inside the microscope and use simulations to quantify its effect on image formation. We find that the XLPP offers a path to increase information transfer by the microscope at low spatial frequencies while also suppressing the ghost images formed by Kapitza-Dirac diffraction of the electron beam by the laser beam. We also demonstrate a simple acquisition scheme, enabled by the XLPP, which further suppresses unwanted diffraction effects. The results of this study chart the course for future developments of LPP hardware.</description>

      <title>An exploration of temporal coherence of light through holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstract The coherence time $\tau$ c of light is an important physical parameter in fundamental and applied optics and therefore, it is crucial that students understand its meaning. In this work, this notion is addressed through holography by simple experiments for bachelor and master students at Aix-Marseilles University. The coherence time of light sources used to make holograms is one of the key parameters for the success of such experiments; it must be large enough so that an optical wave train divided in two parts (reference/objects beams) interferes with itself to record the 3D shape of the object on the photosensitive medium. That is why laser sources, with much longer $\tau$ c than other light sources, are commonly used to make holograms. We have recently worked with students on this problem; is it possible not to use a laser to make holograms? Which coherence time do we need for which hologram? After a study of the coherence time of different light sources (HeNe laser, red Light-Emitting Diode (LED) with and without 1 nm wide interference filter and high pressure mercury lamp with green filter) by emission spectroscopy and by interferometry, an extremely simple experimental setup is used to realize holograms of a coin with them. The observation of these holograms, coupled to a scan of the coin shape with an optical microscope, enables the deduction of information on the coherence length of these light sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in high repetition-rate extreme ultraviolet (XUV) light sources and photoelectron analyzers have led to dramatic advances in the performance of time-resolved photoemission experiments. In this perspective article, we discuss the application of cavity-enhanced high-order harmonic generation (CE-HHG), with repetition rates exceeding 10 MHz, to photoemission experiments using advanced endstations incorporating time-of-flight photoelectron analyzers. We discuss recent results, perspective on future areas for further technological improvement, and the wide array of science enabled by ultrafast XUV photoemission experiments, now in a qualitatively new regime.</description>

      <title>The concentrated toroidal wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical solution to the Helmholtz wave equation in spherical coordinates is well known and has found many important applications in wave propagation, scattering, and imaging in optics and acoustics. The separable solution is comprised of spherical Bessel functions in the radial direction and spherical harmonics in the angular directions. The nature of the spherical Bessel functions includes a long asymptotic oscillatory tail at large radii, not conducive to applications where a tight concentration of wave amplitude around a ring is desired, for example in toroidal configurations. However, we have found that certain practical bandpass spectral shapes, centered around a peak frequency, can create a superposition of spherical Bessel functions that effectively concentrate the wave amplitude around a defined ring at the time instant of coherent addition, avoiding the long tail asymptotic oscillations of the single frequency solution. Theoretical solutions are shown for different bandpass spectra applied to the spherical Bessel functions, along with numerical solutions of transient wave propagation using practical hemispherical source shapes. These findings introduce a framework by which ring or toroidal concentrated waves can be produced with a simple bandpass superposition applied to hemispherical source shapes and with reference to the classical solutions in spherical coordinates.</description>

      <title>An experimental demonstration of neuromorphic sensing of chemical species using electro-optical reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A chemical discrimination system based on photonic reservoir computing is demonstrated experimentally for the first time. The system is inspired by the way humans perceive and process visual sensory information. The electro-optical reservoir computing system is a photonic analogue of the human nervous system with the read-out layer acting as the 'brain', and the sensor that of the human eye. A task-specific optimisation of the system is implemented, and the performance of the system for the discrimination between three chemicals is presented. The results are compared to the previously published numerical simulation. This publication provides a feasibility assessment and a demonstration of a practical realisation of photonic reservoir computing for a new neuromorphic sensing system - the next generation sensor with a built-in 'intelligence' which can be trained to 'understand' and to make a real time sensing decision based on the training data.</description>

      <title>Temporal resolution enhancement in Structured Illumination Microscopy using cascaded reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) allows access to spatial information beyond the diffraction limit by folding high frequency components into the optical system's base-band. Using various algorithmic techniques, an image containing sub-wavelength information can be reconstructed. While linear SIM is considered superior to other Super-Resolution methods in its compatibility with live cell imaging and optical setup simplicity, it is inherently limited in terms of its temporal resolution as each image requires multiple frames. Here we present a practical and efficient reconstruction approach supporting up to 3-fold temporal resolution increase with SIM, using overlapping regions in the folded frequency components within the Fourier domain. Our approach can be readily implemented in any previously introduced SIM realization to both improve the temporal resolution and to simplify the optical apparatus.</description>

      <title>Tactile Displays Driven by Projected Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tactile displays that lend tangible form to digital content could profoundly transform how we interact with computers, much like visual displays have driven successive revolutions in computing over the past 60 years. However, creating tactile displays with the actuation speeds, dynamic ranges, and resolutions that are required for perceptual fidelity has proved challenging. Here, we present a tactile display that directly converts projected light into visible tactile patterns using an energetically passive, photomechanical surface populated with arrays of millimeter-scale optotactile pixels. The pixels transduce incident light into mechanical displacements through rapid, light-stimulated thermal gas expansion, yielding displacements of up to 1 millimeter and response times of 2 to 100 milliseconds. Our use of projected light for power transmission and addressing enables these displays to be scaled in size and resolution at sustainable cost and complexity. We demonstrate devices with up to 1,511 independently addressable pixels. Perceptual studies confirm the capacity of the display to accurately reproduce tactile patterns in location, timing, frequency, and structure. This research establishes a foundation for practical, versatile high-resolution tactile displays driven by light.</description>

      <title>Bandwidth-tunable Telecom Single Photons Enabled by Low-noise Optomechanical Transduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon sources are of fundamental importance to emergent quantum technologies. Nano-structured optomechanical crystals provide an attractive platform for single photon generation due to their unique engineering freedom and compatibility with on-chip silicon fabrication. However, optical absorption heating has thus far prevented these systems from being widely used in practical applications. Here, we overcome this limitation through the use of a quasi-two-dimensional optomechanical crystal structure and demonstrate an on-chip source of single photons natively at telecom wavelength. We verify the low thermal noise and resulting high purity of the generated single photons through a Hanbury Brown-Twiss experiment with $g^{(2)}(0)=0.35^{+0.10}_{-0.08}$. Furthermore, we perform Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of the emitted photons showcasing the indistinguishability and coherence of photons generated from our source with visibility $V=0.52 \pm 0.15$ after 1.43 km of fiber delay line. With the possibility of using the mechanical mode as a quantum memory, we can retrieve the single photons on-demand. Crucial for applications, the optomechanical interaction at the heart of our device allows the bandwidth of emitted single photons to be tuned over a large range from 100 kHz to several hundreds of MHz, which makes them directly compatible with leading quantum memory platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol that accounts for fundamental practical challenges, including chromatic dispersion, time measurement uncertainty, and dark counts. Our analysis provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the impact of these physical phenomena on QKD efficiency, offering practical strategies for enhancing the robustness and security of quantum communication systems in real-world applications. In particular, by manipulating the chirp parameter of single-photon wave packets, we demonstrate significant improvements in key generation rates and an extended range of secure communication.</description>

Abstract: Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC) holds a pivotal role in quantum physics, facilitating the creation of entangled photon pairs, heralded single photons and squeezed light, critical resources for many applications in quantum technologies. However, their production is highly sensitive to physical variations, posing limitations on their robust utility. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a method to significantly enhance the reliability of entangled photon pair generation. Our approach involves introducing a composite design scheme to the SPDC process. The design is based on the development of a theoretical composite segments framework for SU(1,1), offering increased error resilience and robustness of the process. We experimentally demonstrate its practical application by modulating the nonlinear coefficient of a KTP crystal for degenerate 532nm to 1064nm conversion resulting in an effectiveness of sevenfold improvement in stability of photon-pair generation and coincidence rate against temperature fluctuations compared to conventional quasi-phase-matching techniques. Furthermore, the presented concept is applicable to other physical systems that exhibit SU(1,1) dynamics. Our methodology represents a monumental leap forward in quantum technologies, significantly enhancing stability and error tolerance that pave the way for a new generation of entangled photons sources, holding immense promise for quantum information processing, communication, and precision measurement applications.</description>

      <title>Cross-Dataset Generalization in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11207</link>

Abstract: Deep learning has been extensively used in various fields, such as phase imaging, 3D imaging reconstruction, phase unwrapping, and laser speckle reduction, particularly for complex problems that lack analytic models. Its data-driven nature allows for implicit construction of mathematical relationships within the network through training with abundant data. However, a critical challenge in practical applications is the generalization issue, where a network trained on one dataset struggles to recognize an unknown target from a different dataset. In this study, we investigate imaging through scattering media and discover that the mathematical relationship learned by the network is an approximation dependent on the training dataset, rather than the true mapping relationship of the model. We demonstrate that enhancing the diversity of the training dataset can improve this approximation, thereby achieving generalization across different datasets, as the mapping relationship of a linear physical model is independent of inputs. This study elucidates the nature of generalization across different datasets and provides insights into the design of training datasets to ultimately address the generalization issue in various deep learning-based applications.</description>

      <title>The Hong-Ou-Mandel effect is really odd</title>

Abstract: When quantum state amplitudes interfere, surprising non-classical features emerge which emphasis the roles of indistinguishability and discreteness in quantum mechanics. A famous example in quantum optics is the Hong Ou Mandel interference effect,a major ingredient in current quantum information processing using photonics. Traditionally the HOM features interference between amplitudes for two one-photon number states. Surprisingly, interference can be manifested when one amplitude represents that most classical of light field states, the coherent state, provided the partner state is non-classical (eg a single photon state or an odd photon number state). Imposing such nonclassical features on an otherwise classical state is the focus of this article. Recently, the HOM effect has been generalized to the multi-photon case, termed the extended HOM effect by the authors.The implication of the extended HOM effect is that if an odd parity state, comprising only odd numbers of photons, enters one input port of a 50:50 beam splitter, then regardless of the state entering the other input port, be it pure or mixed, there will no output coincident counts. In this work, we explain the extended HOM as arising from a sequence of pairwise HOM-like complete destructive interferences occurring simultaneously in the multicomponent amplitude for the output coincidence counts. We first demonstrate this diagrammatically in order to build physical intuition, before developing a general analytical proof. We then examine the case of a single photon interacting with a coherent state (and idealized laser), and consider prospects for experimental detection by including the effect of imperfect detection efficiency. This work highlights the importance of the non-classicality of light, and in particular the interference effects stemming from the discreteness of photon quanta.</description>

      <title>Molecular Quantum Control Algorithm Design by Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Precision measurements of polyatomic molecules offer an unparalleled paradigm to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. The rich internal structure within these molecules makes them exquisite sensors for detecting fundamental symmetry violations, local position invariance, and dark matter. While trapping and control of diatomic and a few very simple polyatomic molecules have been experimentally demonstrated, leveraging the complex rovibrational structure of more general polyatomics demands the development of robust and efficient quantum control schemes. In this study, we present a general, reinforcement-learning-designed, quantum logic approach to prepare molecular ions in a single, pure quantum state. The reinforcement learning agent optimizes the pulse sequence, each followed by a projective measurement, and probabilistically manipulates the collapse of the quantum system to a single state. The performance of the control algorithm is numerically demonstrated in the case of a CaH$^+$ ion, with up to 96 thermally populated eigenstates and under the disturbance of environmental thermal radiation. We expect that the method developed, with physics-informed learning, will be directly implemented for quantum control of polyatomic molecular ions with densely populated structures, enabling new experimental tests of fundamental theories.</description>

      <title>Disruptive Forces in Metamaterial Tweezers for Trapping 20 nm Nanoparticles Based on Molecular Graphene Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, plasmonic optical tweezers have been used to trap nanoparticles and study interactions with their environment. An unavoidable challenge is the plasmonic heating due to resonant excitation and the resulting temperature rise in the surrounding environment. In this work, we demonstrate trapping of custom-synthesized 20 nm nanoparticles based on molecular graphene quantum dots using metamaterial plasmonic tweezers. Superior trap stiffness values as high as 8.8 (fN/nm)/(mW/$\mu\mbox{m}^2$) were achieved with optical intensities lower than 1 mW/$\mu\mbox{m}^2$. By gradually increasing the laser intensity we identified a critical value beyond which the stiffness values dropped significantly. This value corresponded to a temperature rise of about 16$^o$C, evidently sufficient to create thermal flows and disrupt the trapping performance. We, therefore, identified a safe intensity regime for trapping nanoparticles without unwanted heat. Our platform can be used for efficient nanopositioning of fluorescent particles and quantum emitters in an array configuration, potentially acting as a single-photon source configuration.</description>

      <title>Frequency shifting of light via multiple ultrasound waves in scattering media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive analytical expressions to describe how light is frequency-shifted when interacting with ultrasound within scattering media, due to the modulation of the refractive index induced by the ultrasound pressure waves. The model is validated through Monte Carlo simulations, works for high ultrasound pressures, and allows for many simultaneous ultrasound waves or frequency components, which is important due to the non-linear propagation effects in tissue. We also provide critical insights into how the ultrasound properties can be optimized for an enhanced efficiency of the light to be frequency-shifted, facilitating applications in ultrasound optical tomography and other photonic diagnostic techniques.</description>
