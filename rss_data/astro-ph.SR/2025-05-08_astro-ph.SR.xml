      <title>A targeted search for binary white dwarf pulsars using Gaia and WISE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After its discovery in 2016, the white dwarf binary AR Scorpii (AR Sco) remained for several years the only white dwarf system to show pulsed radio emission associated with a fast-spinning white dwarf. The evolutionary origin and the emission mechanism for AR Sco are not completely understood, with different models proposed. Testing and improving these models requires observational input. Here we report the results of a targeted search for other binary white dwarf pulsars like AR Sco. Using data from Gaia and WISE, we identified 56 candidate systems with similar properties to AR Sco, of which 26 were previously uncharacterised. These were subject to spectroscopic and photometric follow-up observations. Aside from one new binary white dwarf pulsar found, J191213.72-441045.1, which was reported in a separate work, we find no other systems whose characteristics are akin to AR Sco. The newly characterised systems are primarily young stellar objects (with 10 found) or cataclysmic variables (7 identifications), with the remaining being either blended or non-variable on short timescales.</description>

      <title>Star formation and accretion rates within 500 pc as traced by Gaia DR3 XP spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion rates from protoplanetary disks onto forming stars are a key ingredient in star formation and protoplanetary disk evolution. Extensive efforts surveying individual star forming regions with spectroscopy and narrow-band photometry have been performed to derive accretion rates on large populations of young stellar objects (YSOs). We use Gaia DR3 XP spectra to perform the first all-sky homogeneous analysis of YSO accretion within 500 pc. We characterise the H$\alpha$ line emission of YSOs by using the H$\alpha$ pseudo-equivalent widths and XP spectra from Gaia DR3. We derive accretion luminosities, mass accretion rates and stellar parameters for 145 975 candidate YSO H$\alpha$ emitters all-sky. We describe filtering strategies to select specific sub-samples of YSOs from this catalogue. We identify a large population of low-accreting YSO candidates untraced by previous surveys. The population of low accreting YSOs is mostly spatially dispersed, away from star forming regions or more clustered environments of star formation. Many YSOs appear disconnected from young populations, reminiscent of 'Peter Pan' YSOs. We find $L_{acc}\propto L_\star^{1.41\pm0.02}$ and $\dot M_{acc}\propto M_\star^{2.4\pm0.1}$ for the purest all-sky sample of YSO candidates. By fitting an exponential to the fraction of accreting stars in clusters of different ages in the Sco-Cen complex, we obtain an accretion timescale of 2.7$\pm$0.4 Myr. The percentage of accretors found by fitting a power-law is 70% at 2 Myr and 2.8% at 10 Myr. With this new catalogue of H$\alpha$ emitters we significantly increase the number of YSO candidates with accretion rate estimations in the local neighbourhood. This allows us to study accretion timescales and the spatial and physical properties of YSO accretion from a large, all-sky, and homogeneous sample for the first time. [abridged]</description>

      <title>Data-driven radiative hydrodynamics simulations of the solar photosphere using physics-informed neural networks: proof of concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current, realistic numerical simulations of the solar atmosphere reproduce observations in a statistical sense; they do not replicate observations such as a movie of solar granulation. Inversions on the other hand reproduce observations by design, but the resulting models are often not physically self-consistent. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a new approach to solving the time-dependent radiative hydrodynamics equations and matching observations as boundary conditions. PINNs approximate the solution of the integro-differential equations with a deep neural network. The parameters of this network are determined by minimizing the residuals with respect to the physics equations and the observations. The resulting models are continuous in all dimensions, can zoom into local areas of interest in space and time, and provide information on physical parameters that are not necessarily directly observed such as horizontal velocities. Here we present the first proof of concept of this novel approach, explain the underlying methodology in detail, and provide an outlook to the many applications that PINNs enable.</description>

      <title>Convective shells in the interior of Cepheid variable stars: overshooting models based on hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because Cepheid variable stars have long been used as a cosmic benchmark, the accuracy of stellar evolution models for Cepheids have wide-reaching effects. Our goal is to provide a detailed multi-dimensional picture of hydrodynamic convection and convective boundary mixing in the interior of Cepheids. We perform 2D hydrodynamic simulations of six stars with the fully compressible Multidimensional Stellar Implicit Code (MUSIC). Our simulations do not model the radial pulsations but focus on the interior structure of Cepheids, which involves an interior convective shell and a convective envelope. We develop a new statistical analysis to examine overshooting in this inner convection zone. Using the extreme value theory, we find that overshooting above the convective shell fills the space between these convectively unstable layers. We develop a new statistical analysis that provides a clearer picture of how overshooting fills this layer, and also allows us to formulate a detailed comparison between overshooting above and below the convective shell. Our analysis effectively decomposes the overshooting layer into two layers: a weak and a strong overshooting layer. Statistically, this is accomplished by decomposing the strongly non-Gaussian probability density function into a mixture of Gamma distributions. Using our mixture model, we show that the ratio of overshooting lengths above and below the convective shell depends directly on the radial extent of the convective shell as well as its depth in the star. We propose a new form for the diffusion coefficient, which addresses the need for overlapping overshooting layers between convective shells. We introduce the idea of super-mixing layer where overshooting from both the convective shell and the convective envelope results in efficient mixing and could be viewed as merging the two adjacent convective zones.</description>

      <title>A Catalog of 12,766 Carbon-enhanced Metal-poor Stars from LAMOST Data Release 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-poor stars are a rare and ancient type of stars; Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars are a subset of these celestial bodies that show an enrichment of carbon relative to iron. They are believed to be formed from gas polluted by the first generation of stars after the Big Bang and are important objects for studying the early universe, galaxy evolution, and nucleosynthesis. Due to their rarity, the search for metal-poor stars and CEMP stars is a valuable task. This study investigates the search for CEMP stars based on the low-resolution stellar spectra from LAMOST DR8, and proposes a deep learning scheme. From the LAMOST DR8 spectral library, this work discovered 12,766 CEMP star candidates. For ease of reference and use, we provide the estimated parameters $T_\texttt{eff}$, $\log~g$, [Fe/H] and [C/H] for them.</description>

      <title>Metallicities of 20 Million Giant Stars Based on Gaia XP spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design an uncertainty-aware cost-sensitive neural network (UA-CSNet) to estimate metallicities from dereddened and corrected Gaia BP/RP (XP) spectra for giant stars. This method accounts for both stochastic errors in the input spectra and the imbalanced density distribution in [Fe/H] values. With a specialized architecture and training strategy, the UA-CSNet improves the precision of the predicted metallicities, especially for very metal-poor (VMP; $\rm [Fe/H] \leq -2.0$) stars. With the PASTEL catalog as the training sample, our model can estimate metallicities down to $\rm [Fe/H] \sim -4$. We compare our estimates with a number of external catalogs and conduct tests using star clusters, finding overall good agreement. We also confirm that our estimates for VMP stars are unaffected by carbon enhancement. Applying the UA-CSNet, we obtain reliable and precise metallicity estimates for approximately 20 million giant stars, including 360,000 VMP stars and 50,000 extremely metal-poor (EMP; $\rm [Fe/H] \leq -3.0$) stars. The resulting catalog is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.12149/101604. This work highlights the potential of low-resolution spectra for metallicity estimation and provides a valuable dataset for studying the formation and chemo-dynamical evolution of our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Near- to mid-infrared spectroscopic study of ice analysis using the AKARI/IRC and Spitzer/IRS spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the combined 2.5$-$30$\mu$m spectra of four protostars acquired with the infrared camera and the infrared spectrograph on board the AKARI and Spitzer space telescopes, respectively. To analyze the ice absorption features in the 8$-$22$\mu$m, we first performed a continuum determination process on mid-infrared spectra and applied a method to subtract the silicate absorption. We conducted a global fitting process to the absorption features in the combined infrared spectra using the experimental ice absorbance data to identify the intrinsic absorption of each ice component. We first derived the H$_{2}$O ice column densities of both stretch and libration modes at 3.05$\mu$m and 13.6$\mu$m simultaneously. We also identified the absorption features containing NH$_{3}$, CH$_{3}$OH, CO$_{2}$, and CO and decomposed their mixed components and compared their ice abundances at different evolutionary stages of the protostars. We explored possible absorptions of the organic ice species such as HCOOH, CH$_{3}$CHO, and CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$OH in the mid-infrared ranges. The ice analysis method developed in this study can be applied to the ice spectra obtained by the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Resolution of the Solar Convective Conundrum? New Results Using the Time-Distance Deep-Focus Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We re-examine the deep-focus methodology of time-distance helioseismology previously used to estimate the power spectrum of the solar convection at a depth of about 30 Mm, which was found to be significantly weaker than predicted by theory and simulations. The Global Acoustic, Linearized Euler (GALE) and Eulerian Lagrangian (EULAG) codes are used to generate ground-truth simulations through which the accuracy of the convective power spectrum can be evaluated. This validation process shows that the power spectrum diverges significantly from ground truth beyond spatial scales corresponding to the spherical harmonic degree $\ell=15$ - $30$ because of the limited resolution of helioseismic measurements. However, the power estimated at larger spatial scales ($\ell&lt;15$) is sufficiently accurate. We then apply the methodology to solar data and find a spectrum that is substantially stronger than previously reported. We discuss some possible differences in methodology that might have led to the initial under-estimation of solar convective power. The new spectra are in line with recent hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic simulations of solar convection and also consistent with the previous inferences obtained by the ring-diagram local-helioseismology method.</description>

      <title>Final Moments III: Explosion Properties and Progenitor Constraints of CSM-Interacting Type II Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present analysis of the plateau and late-time phase properties of a sample of 39 Type II supernovae (SNe II) that show narrow, transient, high-ionization emission lines (i.e., "IIn-like") in their early-time spectra from interaction with confined, dense circumstellar material (CSM). Originally presented by Jacobson-Gal\'an et al 2024a, this sample also includes multicolor light curves and spectra extending to late-time phases of 35 SNe with no evidence for IIn-like features at &lt;2 days after first light. We measure photospheric phase light-curve properties for the distance-corrected sample and find that SNe II with IIn-like features have significantly higher luminosities and decline rates at +50 days than the comparison sample, which could be connected to inflated progenitor radii, lower ejecta mass, and/or persistent CSM interaction. However, we find no statistical evidence that the measured plateau durations and $^{56}$Ni masses of SNe II with and without IIn-like features arise from different distributions. We estimate progenitor zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) masses for all SNe with nebular spectroscopy through spectral model comparisons and find that most objects, both with and without IIn-like features, are consistent with progenitor masses &lt;12.5 M$_{\odot}$. Combining progenitor ZAMS masses with CSM densities inferred from early-time spectra suggests multiple channels for enhanced mass loss in the final years before core collapse such as a convection-driven chromosphere or binary interaction. Finally, we find spectroscopic evidence for ongoing ejecta-CSM interaction at radii $&gt;10^{16}$ cm, consistent with substantial progenitor mass-loss rates of $\sim 10^{-4}$--$10^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($v_w &lt; 50$ km/s) in the final centuries to millennia before explosion.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Passing Field Stars on the Solar System's Dynamical Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The long-term dynamical future of the Sun's planets has been simulated and statistically analyzed in great detail, but most prior work considers the solar system as completely isolated, neglecting the potential influence of field star passages. To understand the dynamical significance of field star encounters, we simulate several thousand realizations of the modern solar system in the presence of passing field stars for 5 Gyrs. We find that the impulse gradient of the strongest stellar encounter largely determines the net dynamical effect of field stars. Because the expected strength of such an encounter is uncertain by multiple orders of magnitude, the possible significance of field stars can be large. Our simulations indicate that isolated models of the solar system can underestimate the degree of our giant planets' future secular orbital changes by over an order of magnitude. In addition, our planets and Pluto are significantly less stable than previously thought. Field stars transform Pluto from a completely stable object over 5 Gyrs to one with a ~5% instability probability. Furthermore, field stars increase the odds of Mercury's instability by ~50-80%. We also find a ~0.3% chance that Mars will be lost through collision or ejection and a ~0.2% probability that Earth will be involved in a planetary collision or ejected. Compared to previously studied instabilities in isolated solar systems models, those induced by field stars are much more likely to involve the loss of multiple planets. In addition, they typically happen sooner in our solar system's future, making field star passages the most likely cause of instability for the next 4-4.5 Gyrs.</description>

      <title>KMT-2022-BLG-1818Lb,c: A Cold Super-Jupiter with a Saturn Sibling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery and analysis of the sixth microlensing two-planet system, KMT-2022-BLG-1818Lb,c, detected by a follow-up program targeting high-magnification events. Both planets are subject to the well-known ''Close/Wide'' degeneracy, although for the first planet, which has a super-Jovian mass ratio of $q_2 \simeq 5\times 10^{-3}$ in both solutions, the Close topology, with a normalized separation of $s\simeq 0.70$, is clearly preferred by $\Delta\chi^2=26$. However, contrary to all previous two-planet microlensing systems, the mass ratio for the second planet, $q_3$, is substantially (factor of $\sim 10$) different for the Close and Wide topologies of the first planet. While this degeneracy is resolved in the present case due to high-cadence follow-up observations, the appearance of this new degeneracy indicates the need for caution in the analysis of future two-planet systems. A Bayesian analysis suggests that the host is likely a K-dwarf star in the Galactic disk. The first planet is probably a super-Jupiter on a Jupiter-like orbit, while the second planet is a Saturn-class planet on either a Mercury-like or Saturn-like orbit.</description>

      <title>No Planet around the K Giant Star 42 Draconis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Published radial velocity (RV) measurements of the K giant star 42 Dra reveal variations consistent with a 3.9 M_Jup mass companion in a 479-d orbit. This exoplanet can be confirmed if these variations are long-lived and coherent. Continued monitoring may also reveal other companions. We have acquired additional RV measurements of 42 Dra spanning fifteen years. Periodogram analyses were used to investigate the stability of the planet RV signal. We also investigated variations in the spectral line shapes using the bisector velocity span as well as infrared photometry from the COBE mission. The new RV measurements do not follow the published planet orbit. An orbital solution using the 2004 - 2011 data yields a period and eccentricity consistent with the published values, but the RV amplitude has decreased by a factor of four from the earlier measurements. Including some additional RV measurements taken between 2014 and 2018 reveal the presence of a second period at 530 d. The beating of this period with the one at 479-d may account for the observed amplitude variations. The planet hypothesis is conclusively ruled out by COBE/DIRBE 1.25 micron photometry that shows variations with the planet orbital period as well as an additional 170 d period. The amplitude variations in the RV as well the COBE/DIRBE photometry firmly establish that there is no giant planet around 42 Dra. The presence of multi-periodic variations suggests that these may be stellar oscillations, most likely oscillatory convection modes. These oscillations may account for some of the long period RV variations attributed to planets around K giant stars. This may skew the statistics of planet occurrence around intermediate mass stars. Long-term monitoring with excellent sampling is required to exclude amplitude variations in the long-periods found in radial velocity of K giant stars.</description>

      <title>Significant reflection and absorption effects in the X-ray emission of the Intermediate Polar IGR J17195-4100</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray emission is from shock-heated plasma in magnetic cataclysmic variables, and is processed by absorption and scattering before reaching the observer. We investigate these effects in the X-ray emission of the Intermediate Polar IGR J17195-4100 by carrying out the X-ray spectral analysis, spin modulation and hardness ratio. We present high-sensitivity broadband X-ray spectral analysis by combining NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations in the 0.3-78.0 keV energy range. The X-ray spectral analysis is performed using six composite models, including the angle-dependent reflection model (reflect), multi-temperature plasma emission models (CEVMKL, MKCFLOW), and photoionised and/or neutral partially covering absorption models (zxipcf, pcfabs) within XSPEC. We examine also the spin modulation in four energy ranges and the hardness ratio, to determine the absorption and scattering effects. We find that the spectrum is best modelled with a reflection amplitude ($\Omega$) of 0.58 $^{+0.38}_{-0.26}$, an ionisation parameter, log($\xi$), of 1.46$^{+0.44}_{-0.23}$ with an equivalent hydrogen column density of 3.09$^{+2.26}_{-0.68}$ $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, a neutral absorber, and a multi-temperature plasma temperature of 27.14$^{+2.0}_{-2.13}$ keV. In addition, we detect effects of electron scattering in the NuSTAR band, leading to modulation amplitude of about a steady 9$\%$ that increases up to 15$\%$ after 20 keV. We stress that these effects significantly affect the X-ray emission of intermediate polars and should be considered to obtain a good representation of the intrinsic spectrum.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismic Structure Inversions of Main-Sequence Solar-like Oscillators with Convective Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asteroseismic inferences of main-sequence solar-like oscillators often rely on best-fit models. However, these models cannot fully reproduce the observed mode frequencies, suggesting that the internal structure of the model does not fully match that of the star. Asteroseismic structure inversions provide a way to test the interior of our stellar models. Recently, structure inversion techniques were used to study 12 stars with radiative cores. In this work, we extend that analysis to 43 main-sequence stars with convective cores observed by Kepler to look for differences in the sound speed profiles in the inner 30% of the star by radius. For around half of our stars, the structure inversions show that our models reproduce the internal structure of the star, where the inversions are sensitive, within the observational uncertainties. For the stars where our inversions reveal significant differences, we find cases where our model sound speed is too high and cases where our model sound speed is too low. We use the star with the most significant differences to explore several changes to the physics of our model in an attempt to resolve the inferred differences. These changes include using a different overshoot prescription and including the effects of diffusion, gravitational settling, and radiative levitation. We find that the resulting changes to the model structure are too small to resolve the differences shown in our inversions.</description>

Abstract: Dwarf novae are astrophysical laboratories for probing the nature of accretion, binary mass transfer, and binary evolution -- yet their diverse observational characteristics continue to challenge our theoretical understanding. We here present the discovery of, and subsequent observing campaign on GOTO065054+593624 (hereafter GOTO0650), a dwarf nova of the WZ Sge type, discovered in real-time by citizen scientists via the Kilonova Seekers citizen science project, which has an outburst amplitude of 8.5 mag. An extensive dataset charts the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of this object, covering the 2024 superoutburst. GOTO0650 shows an absence of visible emission lines during the high state, strong H and barely-detected HeII emission, and high-amplitude echo outbursts with a rapidly decreasing timescale. The comprehensive dataset presented here marks GOTO0650 as a candidate period bouncer, and highlights the important contribution that citizen scientists can make to the study of Galactic transients.</description>

      <title>FLARE: A Framework for Stellar Flare Forecasting using Stellar Physical Properties and Historical Records</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar flare events are critical observational samples for astronomical research; however, recorded flare events remain limited. Stellar flare forecasting can provide additional flare event samples to support research efforts. Despite this potential, no specialized models for stellar flare forecasting have been proposed to date. In this paper, we present extensive experimental evidence demonstrating that both stellar physical properties and historical flare records are valuable inputs for flare forecasting tasks. We then introduce FLARE (Forecasting Light-curve-based Astronomical Records via features Ensemble), the first-of-its-kind large model specifically designed for stellar flare forecasting. FLARE integrates stellar physical properties and historical flare records through a novel Soft Prompt Module and Residual Record Fusion Module. Our experiments on the publicly available Kepler light curve dataset demonstrate that FLARE achieves superior performance compared to other methods across all evaluation metrics. Finally, we validate the forecast capability of our model through a comprehensive case study.</description>

      <title>Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM): Enhanced multiplicity of early B-type dwarfs and giants at $Z=0.2\,{\rm Z}_\odot$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21936v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early B-type stars ($M_i=8-15$ M$_\odot$) are frequently in multiple systems, as evidenced by spectroscopic campaigns in the Milky Way (MW) and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Previous studies have shown no strong metallicity dependence in the close-binary (a&gt;10 au) fraction or orbital-period distributions between the MW's solar metallicity (Z$_\odot$) and that of the LMC (Z=0.5 Z$_\odot$). However, similar analyses in more metal-poor environments are still scarce. We focus on 309 early B-type stars (luminosity classes III-V) from the Binarity at LOw Metallicity campaign in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC, Z=0.2 Z$_\odot$) using VLT/FLAMES multi-epoch spectroscopy. By applying binary detection criteria consistent with previous works, we identify 153 stars (91 SB1, 59 SB2, 3 SB3) exhibiting significant radial-velocity (RV) variations, resulting in an observed multiplicity fraction of $f^{obs}_{mult}=50\pm3\%$. Using Monte Carlo simulations to account for observational biases, we infer an intrinsic close-binary fraction of $f_{mult}=80\pm8\%$. A Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of the peak-to-peak RV distribution ($\Delta{\rm RV}_{\rm max}$) confirms a high multiplicity fraction of $f_{mult}=78\pm5\%$. These findings suggest a possible anti-correlation between metallicity and the fraction of close B-type binaries, with the SMC multiplicity fraction significantly exceeding previous measurements in the LMC and MW. The enhanced fraction of close binaries at SMC's low metallicity may have broad implications for massive-star evolution in the early Universe. More frequent mass transfer and envelope stripping could boost the production of exotic transients, stripped supernovae, gravitational-wave progenitors, and sustained UV ionising flux, potentially affecting cosmic reionisation. Theoretical predictions of binary evolution under metal-poor conditions will provide a key test of our results.</description>

      <title>Is the Symbiotic Recurrent Nova T CrB Late? Recent Photometric Evolution and Comparison with Past Pre-Outburst Behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: T CrB is a symbiotic recurrent nova that last erupted in 1946. Given its recurrence timescale of approximately 80 years, the next outburst is eagerly anticipated by the astronomical community. In this work, we analyse the optical light curves of T CrB, comparing recent photometric evolution with historical data to evaluate potential predictive indicators of nova eruptions. Although the "super-active" phases preceding both the 1946 and anticipated eruptions are strikingly similar, the subsequent photometric behaviour differs. We find that the decline in brightness observed in 2023, interpreted by some as a "pre-eruption dip", deviates from the deep minimum recorded prior to the 1946 event and does not reliably predict the eruption timing. Recent photometric and spectroscopic observations indicate that the system is returning to a high-accretion state. Given this, an eruption may be imminent, even without distinct precursors. While the next eruption of T CrB will be a major scientific event, its expected peak brightness of $V \sim 2$ mag highlights the importance of setting realistic public expectations for what will be a visually modest, yet astrophysically very significant, celestial event.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic investigations of a filament reconnecting with coronal loops during a two-ribbon solar flare</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the standard 2D model of eruption, the eruption of a magnetic flux rope is associated with magnetic reconnection occurring beneath it. However, in 3D, additional reconnection geometries are possible, in particular the AR-RF, where external reconnection involving the overlying arcades (A) and erupting flux rope (R) turns into another arcade and a flare loop (F). This process results in the drifting of the legs of the erupting flux rope. We investigated spectroscopic signatures of such AR-RF reconnection occurring in an erupting filament reconnecting with coronal arcades during a two-ribbon flare. The evolution of the erupting filament eruption is examined using observations by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). As the filament rises into the corona, it reconnects with the surrounding arcade of coronal loops with localized brightenings, resulting in the disappearance of the coronal loops and formation of a hot flux rope, showing slipping motion of its footpoints extending to the previous footpoints of the coronal loops (AR-RF reconnection) as predicted by the 3D extensions to the Standard solar flare model. These brightenings are accompanied by the presence of strong blue-shifts in both the IRIS Si IV and Mg II lines, upto about 200 km/s. The lines are also extremely wide, with non-thermal widths above 100 km/s. Furthermore, a strongly non-Gaussian profile of the most blue-shifted component is detected at the start of the AR-RF reconnection, indicating the presence of accelerated particles and MHD turbulence, and associated with the appearance of hot plasma in the AIA 94 A passband. For the first time, an observation has been reported in which the IRIS slit successfully captures AR-RF reconnection between a filament and overlying arcades, resulting in strong blue-shifts and very broad line profiles.</description>

      <title>Exploring the range of impacts of helium in the spectra of double detonation models for Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models of sub-Chandrasekhar mass double detonations for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) suggest a distinguishing property of this scenario is unburnt helium in the outer ejecta. However, modern explosion simulations suggest there may be significant variations in its mass and velocity distribution. We recently presented a NLTE (non local thermodynamic equilibrium) radiative transfer simulation for one realisation of the double detonation scenario with a modest He mass (0.018 M${\odot}$) present in the ejecta at relatively high velocities (${\sim}18000\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). That simulation predicted a He I 10830$\,\r{A}$ feature blueward of Mg II 10927$\,\r{A}$ consistent with near-infrared observations of "transitional" SNe Ia. To demonstrate the expected diversity in the helium signature, here we present a calculation for a double detonation model with a higher He mass (${\sim}$0.04 M${\odot}$) ejected at lower velocities (${\sim}13000\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). Despite our simulation predicting no clear optical or 2 micron helium features, a strong and persistent He I 10830$\,\r{A}$ absorption is present. The feature appears at wavelengths consistent with the extended blue wing of the Mg II 10927$\,\r{A}$ feature sometimes present in observations, suggesting this is a helium spectral signature (although for this particular model it is too strong and persistent to be consistent with normal SNe Ia). The significant differences in He I 10830$\,\r{A}$ predicted by the two simulations suggests helium spectral signatures likely show significant variation throughout the SNe Ia population. This motivates further work to use this observable signature to test the parameter space for double detonation models.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Jet-Bubble-Disk Interaction: Jet Feedback on a Protoplanetary Disk via an Expanding Bubble in WSB 52</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While stellar jets and outflows are fueled by accretion from disks, their direct influence on disks remain unexplored. Here we revisit ALMA observations of $^{12}\mathrm{CO}\,(J=2-1)$ line emission for the young stellar object WSB 52. We identify an expanding bubble that interacts with its protoplanetary disk. Given that the disk axis points toward the bubble center and the kinetic energy of the bubble is roughly $10^{41}$ erg, we postulate that stellar jets, aligned with the disk axis, have triggered the bubble. The bubble morphology is consistent with uniform expansion with partial concavity, implying the bubble-disk interaction. Correspondingly, the shape and the velocity field of protoplanetary disk appear to be deformed and exhibit high-velocity components, suggesting strong interactions and mass loss from the disk. The discovery of jet feedback onto the disk via the bubble -- which we term the jet-bubble-disk interaction -- sheds new light on the dynamical processes governing star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>Delayed Thermal Relaxation of Rapidly Cooling Neutron Stars: Nucleon Superfluidity and Non-nucleon Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermal relaxation time of neutron stars, typically defined by a sudden drop in surface temperature, is usually on the order of 10 to 100 years. In this study, we investigate neutron star thermal relaxation by incorporating nucleon superfluidity and non-nucleonic particles, specifically considering hyperons as a representative case. We find that rapidly cooling neutron stars driven by neutron superfluidity and direct Urca processes demonstrate delayed thermal relaxation under specific physical conditions. The former acquires that the neutron $^3P_2$ critical temperature is small enough, whereas the latter depends on the presence of a small core that permits direct Urca processes. To explore these scenarios, we propose simple theoretical frameworks to describe these delayed thermal relaxation behaviors and discuss how an recently-established enhanced modified Urca rate influences the relaxation time. By confronting the theoretical results with the observation of Cassiopeia A, we can effectively constrain the maximum neutron $^3P_2$ critical temperature.</description>

Abstract: We report on an observational campaign performed with Swift/XRT on the wind-fed supergiant X-ray binary 4U 1909+07 to investigate the nature of the orbital and superorbital modulation of its X-ray emission. A total of 137 XRT observations have been carried out, summing up to a total effective exposure time of 114 ks and covering a total of 66 orbital and 19 superorbital cycles of the source. The XRT data folded on the orbital period of the source confirmed and improved the previously reported variability in intensity and absorption column density, which can be ascribed to the neutron star accreting from the wind of its B supergiant companion across a fairly circular orbit. The XRT data folded on the superorbital period did not provide evidence of significant variations in either the absorption column density and/or the power-law photon index. This may be due to a significant weakening of the superorbital modulation during the times when the XRT observations were carried out, as confirmed by the BAT dynamic power spectrum. We discuss the implications of these findings within the corotating interaction region model proposed to interpret the superorbital variability in wind-fed supergiant X-ray binaries.</description>
