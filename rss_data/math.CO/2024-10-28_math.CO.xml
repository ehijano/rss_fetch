      <title>Longest cycles and longest chordless cycles in $2$-connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thomassen's chord conjecture from 1976 states that every longest cycle in a $3$-connected graph has a chord. The circumference $c(G)$ and induced circumference $c'(G)$ of a graph $G$ are the length of its longest cycles and the length of its longest chordless cycles, respectively. In $2017$, Harvey proposed a stronger conjecture: Every $2$-connected graph $G$ with minimum degree at least $3$ has $c(G)\geq c'(G)+2$. This conjecture implies Thomassen's chord conjecture. We observe that wheels are the unique hamiltonian graphs for which the circumference and the induced circumference differ by exactly one. Thus we need only consider non-hamiltonian graphs for Harvey's conjecture. In this paper, we propose a conjecture involving wheels that is equivalent to Harvey's conjecture on non-hamiltonian graphs. A graph is $\ell$-holed if its all holes have length exactly $\ell$. Furthermore, we prove that Harvey's conjecture holds for $\ell$-holed graphs and graphs with a small induced circumference. Consequently, Thomassen's conjecture also holds for this two classes of graphs.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Monochromatic Subgraphs of $K_{n,n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given any $r$-edge coloring of $K_{n,n}$, how large is the maximum (over all $r$ colors) sized monochromatic subgraph guaranteed to be? We give answers to this problem for $r \leq 8$, when $r$ is a perfect square, and when $r$ is one less than a perfect square all up to a constant additive term that depends on $r$. We give a lower bound on this quantity that holds for all $r$ and is sharp when $r$ is a perfect square up to a constant additive term that depends on $r$. Finally, we give a construction for all $r$ which provides an upper bound on this quantity up to a constant additive term that depends on $r$, and which we conjecture is also a lower bound.</description>

      <title>Slitherlink on Triangular Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a plane graph and let $C$ be a cycle in $G$. For each finite face of $G$, count the number of edges of $C$ the face contains. We call this the Slitherlink signature of $C$. The symmetric difference $A$ of two cycles with the same signature is totally even, meaning every vertex is incident to an even number of edges in $A$ and every face contains an even number of edges in $A$. In this paper, we completely characterize totally even subsets in the triangular grid, and count the number of edges in any totally even subset of the triangular grid. We also show that the size of the symmetric difference of two cycles with the same signature in the triangular grid is divisible by $12$; this is best possible since 12 is the greatest common divisor of all the sizes of the symmetric difference between two cycles with the same signature in a triangular grid.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning the Chromatic Symmetric Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a conjectural counting formula for the coefficients of the chromatic symmetric function of unit interval graphs using reinforcement learning. The formula counts specific disjoint cycle-tuples in the graphs, referred to as Eschers, which satisfy certain concatenation conditions. These conditions are identified by a reinforcement learning model and are independent of the particular unit interval graph, resulting a universal counting expression.</description>

      <title>Treewidth, Hadwiger Number, and Induced Minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Treewidth and Hadwiger number are two of the most important parameters in structural graph theory.
  This paper studies graph classes in which large treewidth implies the existence of a large complete graph minor.
  To formalise this, we say that a graph class $\mathcal{G}$ is (tw,had)-bounded if there is a function $f$ (called the (tw,had)-bounding function) such that tw$(G)$ $\leq$ $f$(had$(G)$) for every graph $G \in \mathcal{G}$.
  We characterise (tw,had)-bounded graph classes as those that exclude some planar graph as an induced minor, and use this characterisation to show that every proper vertex-minor-closed class is (tw,had)-bounded. Furthermore, we demonstrate that any (tw,had)-bounded graph class has a (tw,had)-bounding function in O(had$(G)^9$polylog(had$(G)$)). Our bound comes from the bound for the Grid Minor Theorem given by Chuzhoy and Tan, and any quantitative improvement to their result will lead directly to an improvement to our result.
  More strongly, we conjecture that every (tw,had)-bounded graph class has a linear (tw,had)-bounding function.
  In support of this conjecture, we show that it holds for the class of outer-string graphs, and for a natural generalisation of outer-string graphs: intersection graphs of strings rooted at the boundary of a fixed surface. We also verify our conjecture for low-rank perturbations of circle graphs, which is an important step towards verifying it for all proper vertex-minor-closed classes.</description>

      <title>Some open mathematical problems on fullerenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fullerenes are hollow carbon molecules where each atom is connected to exactly three other atoms, arranged in pentagonal and hexagonal rings. Mathematically, they can be combinatorially modeled as planar, 3-regular graphs with facets composed only of pentagons and hexagons. In this work, we outline a few of the many open questions about fullerenes, beginning with the problem of generating fullerenes randomly. We then introduce an infinite family of fullerenes on which the generalized Stone-Wales operation is inapplicable. Furthermore, we present numerical insights on a graph invariant, called \textit{character} of a fullerene, derived from its adjacency and degree matrices. This descriptor may lead to a new method for linear enumeration of all fullerenes.</description>

      <title>Distance cube polynomials of Fibonacci and Lucas-run graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fibonacci-run graphs R n are a familly of an induced subgraph of hypercubes introduced by Egecioglu and Ir\v{s}i\v{c} in 2021. A cyclic version of R n , the Lucas-run graph R l n , was also recently proposed (Jianxin Wei, 2024). We prove that the generating function previously given for the polynomial D Rn (x, q) which counts the number of hypercubes at a given distance in R n was erroneous and determine its correct expression. We also consider Lucas-run graphs and prove the conjecture proposed by Jianxin Wei establishing the link between cube polynomials of R l n and R n .</description>

      <title>Flag-transitive point-primitive quasi-symmetric $2$-designs with block intersection numbers $0$ and $y\leq10$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that for a non-trivial quasi-symmetric $2$-design $\mathcal{D}$ with two block intersection numbers $x=0$ and $2\leq y\leq10$, if $G\leq \mathrm{Aut}(\mathcal{D})$ is flag-transitive and point-primitive, then $G$ is either of affine type or almost simple type. Moreover, we prove that the socle of $G$ cannot be an alternating group. If the socle of $G$ is a sporadic group, then $\mathcal{D}$ and $G$ must be one of the following: $\mathcal{D}$ is a $2$-$(12,6,5)$ design with block intersection numbers $0,3$ and $G=\mathrm{M}_{11}$, or $\mathcal{D}$ is a $2$-$(22,6,5)$ design with block intersection numbers $0,2$ and $G=\mathrm{M}_{22}$ or $\mathrm{M}_{22}:2$.</description>

      <title>On combinatorial descriptions of faces of the cone of supermodular functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Five different ways of combinatorial description of non-empty faces of the cone of supermodular functions on the power set of a finite basic set $N$ are introduced. Their identification with faces of the cone of supermodular games allows one to associate to them certain polytopes in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$, known as cores (of these games) in context of cooperative game theory, or generalized permutohedra in context of polyhedral geometry. Non-empty faces of the supermodular cone then correspond to normal fans of those polytopes. This (basically) geometric way of description of faces of the cone then leads to the combinatorial ways of their description. The first combinatorial way is to identify the faces with certain partitions of the set of enumerations of $N$, known as rank tests in context of algebraic statistics. The second combinatorial way is to identify faces with certain collections of posets on $N$, known as (complete) fans of posets in context of polyhedral geometry. The third combinatorial way is to identify the faces with certain coverings of the power set of $N$, introduced relatively recently in context of cooperative game theory under name core structures. The fourth combinatorial way is to identify the faces with certain formal conditional independence structures, introduced formerly in context of multivariate statistics under name structural semi-graphoids. The fifth way is to identify the faces with certain subgraphs of the permutohedral graph, whose nodes are enumerations of $N$. We prove the equivalence of those six ways of description of non-empty faces of the supermodular cone. This result also allows one to describe the faces of the polyhedral cone of (rank functions of) polymatroids over $N$ and the faces of the submodular cone over $N$.</description>

      <title>Graphs with span 1 and shortest optimal walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A span of a given graph $G$ is the maximum distance that two players can keep at all times while visiting all vertices (edges) of $G$ and moving according to certain rules, that produce different variants of span. We prove that the vertex and edge span of the same variant can differ by at most 1 and present a graph where the difference is exactly 1. For all variants of vertex span we present a lower bound in terms of the girth of the graph. Then we study graphs with the strong vertex span equal to 1. We present some nice properties of such graphs and show that interval graphs are contained in the class of graphs having the strong vertex span equal to 1. Finally, we present an algorithm that returns the minimum number of moves needed such that both players traverse all vertices of the given graph $G$ such that in each move the distance between players equals at least the chosen span of $G$.</description>

      <title>On upper domatic number of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph where $V$ and $E$ are the vertex and edge sets, respectively. For two disjoint subsets $A$ and $B$ of $V$, we say $A$ \textit{dominates} $B$ if every vertex of $B$ is adjacent to at least one vertex of $A$ in $G$. A vertex partition $\pi = \{V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k\}$ of $G$ is called an \emph{upper domatic partition} of size $k$ if either $V_i$ dominates $V_j$ or $V_j$ dominates $V_i$ or both for all $i, j$, where $1\leq i&lt;j\leq k$. The maximum integer $k$ for which the above partition exists is called the \emph{upper domatic number} of $G$, and it is denoted by $D(G)$. The \textsc{Maximum upper domatic number Problem} involves finding an upper domatic partition of a given graph with the maximum number of parts. It was known that the maximum upper domatic problem can be solved in linear time for trees. In this paper, we prove that this problem can be solved in linear time for \emph{split graphs} and for the \emph{complement of bipartite chain graphs}, two subclasses of chordal graphs. Moreover, we show that this problem can be solved in polynomial time for unicyclic graphs. Finally, we partially solve a conjecture regarding the sink set posed by Haynes et al. [The upper domatic number of a graph, \emph{AKCE Int. J. Graphs Comb.}, 17, 2020].</description>

      <title>Hindrance from a wasteful partial linkage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ D=(V,E) $ be a (possibly infinite) digraph and $ A,B\subseteq V $. A hindrance consists of an $ AB $-separator $ S $ together with a set of disjoint $ AS $-paths linking a proper subset of $ A $ onto $ S $. Hindrances and configurations guaranteeing the existence of hindrances play an essential role in the proof of the infinite version of Menger's theorem and are important in the context of certain open problems as well. This motivates us to investigate circumstances under which hindrances appear. In this paper we show that if there is a ``wasteful partial linkage'', i.e. a set $ \mathcal{P} $ of disjoint $ AB $-paths with fewer unused vertices in $ B $, than in $ A $, then there exists a hindrance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A real matrix $Q$ is quasi-orthogonal if $Q^{\top}Q=qI$, for some positive real number $q$. We prove that any $n\times n$ skew-symmetric matrix $S$ is a principal sub-matrix of a skew-symmetric quasi-orthogonal matrix $Q$, called a quasi-orthogonal extension of $S$. Moreover, we determine the least integer $d$ such that $S$ has a quasi-orthogonal extension of order $n+d$. This integer is called the quasi-orthogonality index of $S$. Lastly, we give a spectral characterization of skew-adjacency matrices of tournaments with quasi-orthogonality index at most three.</description>

      <title>An explicit condition for boundedly supermultiplicative subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study some properties of the growth rate of $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{F})$, that is, the language of words over the alphabet $\mathcal{A}$ avoiding the set of forbidden factors $\mathcal{F}$. We first provide a sufficient condition on $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ for the growth of $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{F})$ to be boundedly supermultiplicative. That is, there exist constants $C&gt;0$ and $\alpha\ge0$, such that for all $n$, the number of words of length $n$ in $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{F})$ is between $\alpha^n$ and $C\alpha^n$. In some settings, our condition provides a way to compute $C$, which implies that $\alpha$, the growth rate of the language, is also computable whenever our condition holds.
  We also apply our technique to the specific setting of power-free words where the argument can be slightly refined to provide better bounds. Finally, we apply a similar idea to $\mathcal{F}$-free circular words and in particular we make progress toward a conjecture of Shur about the number of square-free circular words.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Andrews and Newman studied the minimal excludant of a partition, which is defined as the smallest positive integer that is not a part of a partition. In this article, we consider the minimal excludant size of an overpartition, which is an overpartition analogue of the minimal excludant of a partition. We define three types of overpartition related to the minimal excludant size.</description>

      <title>Some Results on Local Distance Antimagic Chromatic Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let G=(V,E) be a graph of order n without isolated vertices. A bijection f:V -- {1,2,...n} is called a local distance antimagic labeling if the weights of any two adjacent vertices are not equal, where the weight of a vertex is defined to be the sum of labels on adjacent vertices. The local distance antimagic chromatic number is defined to be the minimum number of colors taken over all colorings of G induced by local distance antimagic labelings of G. In this paper, we study the local distance antimagic chromatic number for the join of graphs and the lexicographic product of graphs with empty graphs.</description>

      <title>Paths and Intersections: Characterization of Quasi-metrics in Directed Okamura-Seymour Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the following distance realization problem. Given a quasi-metric $D$ on a set $T$ of terminals, does there exist a directed Okamura-Seymour graph that realizes $D$ as the (directed) shortest-path distance metric on $T$? We show that, if we are further given the circular ordering of terminals lying on the boundary, then Monge property is a sufficient and necessary condition. This generalizes previous results for undirected Okamura-Seymour instances.
  With the circular ordering, we give a greedy algorithm for constructing a directed Okamura-Seymour instance that realizes the input quasi-metric. The algorithm takes the dual perspective concerning flows and routings, and is based on a new way of analyzing graph structures, by viewing graphs as \emph{paths and their intersections}. We believe this new understanding is of independent interest and will prove useful in other problems in graph theory and graph algorithms.
  We also design an efficient algorithm for finding such a circular ordering that makes $D$ satisfy Monge property, if one exists. Combined with our result above, this gives an efficient algorithm for the distance realization problem.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal and symplectic orbits in the affine flag variety of type A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a classical result that the set $K\backslash G /B$ is finite, where $G$ is a reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed field with characteristic not equal to two, $B$ is a Borel subgroup of $G$, and $K = G^{\theta}$ is the fixed point subgroup of an involution of $G$. In this paper, we investigate the affine counterpart of the aforementioned set, where $G$ is the general linear group over formal Laurent series, $B$ is an Iwahori subgroup of $G$, and $K$ is either the orthogonal group or the symplectic group over formal Laurent series. We construct explicit bijections between the double cosets $K \backslash G/B$ and certain twisted affine involutions. This is the first combinatorial description of $K$-orbits in the affine flag variety of type A.</description>

      <title>On fundamental results for pushable homomorphisms of oriented graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article deals with homomorphisms of oriented graphs with respect to push equivalence. Here homomorphisms refer to arc preserving vertex mappings, and push equivalence refers to the equivalence class of orientations of a graph $G$ those can be obtained from one another by reversing arcs of an edge cut. We study and prove some fundamental properties of pushable homomorphisms, and establish its connections to homomorphisms of signed graphs and graph coloring. To list a few highlights of this work:
  $\bullet$ We characterize orientations of a graph up to push equivalence and show that it is possible to decide whether they are equivalent or not in polynomial time.
  $\bullet$ We give a canonical definition of pushable homomorphism - this answers a natural open question.
  $\bullet$ We build a one-to-one correspondence between the equivalence classes of oriented and signed bipartite graphs. Thus, it is possible to translate a number of important results directly from the theory of signed graphs to oriented graphs. In particular, we show that pushable homomorphisms of bipartite graphs capture the entire theory of graph coloring as a subcase.
  $\bullet$ Given a graph $G$, we build a gadget oriented graph $\overrightarrow{G}^{(k)}$ which admits a pushable homomorphism to a directed odd cycle of length $(2k+1)$ if and only if $G$ admits a $(2k+1)$-coloring.
  We also show that it is NP-complete to determine whether an oriented (sparse) graph admits a pushable homomorphism to a directed odd cycle or not.</description>

Abstract: We study the enumeration of different classes of grand knight's paths in the plane. In particular, we focus on the subsets of zigzag knight's paths that are subject to constraints. These constraints include ending at $y$-coordinate 0, bounded by a horizontal line, confined within a tube, among other considerations. We present our results using generating functions or direct closed-form expressions. We derive asymptotic results, finding approximations for quantities such as the probability that a zigzag knight's path stays in some area of the plane, or for the average of the altitude of such a path. Additionally, we exhibit some bijections between grand zigzag knight's paths and some pairs of compositions.</description>

      <title>Tropical twisted Hurwitz numbers for elliptic curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hurwitz numbers enumerate branched morphisms between Riemann surfaces. For a fixed elliptic target, Hurwitz numbers are intimately related to mirror symmetry following work of Dijkgraaf. In recent work of Chapuy and Dolega a new variant of Hurwitz numbers with fixed genus $0$ target was introduced that includes maps between between non-orientiable surfaces. These numbers are called $b$-Hurwitz numbers and are polynomials in a parameter $b$ which measures the non-orientability of the involved maps. An interpretation in terms of factorisations of $b$-Hurwitz numbers for $b=1$, so-called twisted Hurwitz numbers, was found in work of Burman and Fesler. In previous work, the authors derived a tropical geometry interpretation of these numbers. In this paper, we introduce a natural generalisation of twisted Hurwitz numbers with elliptic targets within the framework of symmetric groups. We derive a tropical interpretation of these invariants, relate them to Feynman integrals and derive an expression as a matrix element of an operator in the bosonic Fock space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce saturation and semisaturation functions of sequences, and we prove a number of fundamental results about these functions. Given a forbidden sequence $u$ with $r$ distinct letters, we say that a sequence $s$ on a given alphabet is $u$-saturated if $s$ is $r$-sparse, $u$-free, and adding any letter from the alphabet to an arbitrary position in $s$ violates $r$-sparsity or induces a copy of $u$. We say that $s$ is $u$-semisaturated if $s$ is $r$-sparse and adding any letter from the alphabet to $s$ violates $r$-sparsity or induces a new copy of $u$. Let the saturation function $\operatorname{Sat}(u, n)$ denote the minimum possible length of a $u$-saturated sequence on an alphabet of size $n$, and let the semisaturation function $\operatorname{Ssat}(u, n)$ denote the minimum possible length of a $u$-semisaturated sequence on an alphabet of size $n$. For alternating sequences, we determine both the saturation function and the semisaturation function up to a constant multiplicative factor. We show for every sequence that the semisaturation function is always either $O(1)$ or $\Theta(n)$. For the saturation function, we show that every sequence $u$ has either $\operatorname{Sat}(u, n) \ge n$ or $\operatorname{Sat}(u, n) = O(1)$. For every sequence with $2$ distinct letters, we show that the saturation function is always either $O(1)$ or $\Theta(n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hoffman's bound is a well-known spectral bound on the chromatic number of a graph, known to be tight for instance for bipartite graphs. While Hoffman colorings (colorings attaining the bound) were studied before for regular graphs, for irregular graphs not much is known. We investigate tightness of the Hoffman bound, with a particular focus on irregular graphs, obtaining several results on the graph structure of Hoffman colorings. In particular, we study the connection between Hoffman colorability and graph tensor products, and as a byproduct, we obtain constructions of infinite families of irregular Hoffman colorable graphs. Moreover, we present a Decomposition Theorem, which describes the structure of Hoffman colorings, and we use it to completely classify Hoffman colorability of cone graphs and line graphs. We also prove a partial converse, the Composition Theorem, leading to various new constructions of Hoffman colorable graphs and to an algorithm for computing all connected Hoffman colorable graphs for some given number of vertices and colors. Since several graph coloring parameters are known to be sandwiched between the Hoffman bound and the chromatic number, as a byproduct of our results on Hoffman colorability, we obtain the values of such chromatic parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present four different constructions of pattern-avoiding inversion sequences, and use them to obtain expressions for the enumeration sequences of 22 distinct open cases. This completes the enumeration of inversion sequences avoiding one or two patterns of length 3. Some of our constructions are based on generating trees. Others involve pattern-avoiding words, which we also count using generating trees. Furthermore, we introduce a generalization of inversion sequences, which we call shifted inversion sequences. It is sometimes easier to construct pattern-avoiding inversion sequences by seeing them as a particular case of shifted inversion sequences.</description>

Abstract: Let e_k(x_1,...,x_l) be an elementary symmetric polynomial and let mu = (mu_1,...,mu_l) be an integer partition. Define pre_k(mu) to be the partition whose parts are the summands in the evaluation e_k(mu_1,...,mu_l). The study of such partitions was initiated by Ballantine, Beck, and Merca who showed (among other things) that pre_2 is injective as a map on binary partitions of n. In the present work we derive a host of identities involving the sequences which count the number of parts of a given value in the image of pre_2. These include generating functions, explicit expressions, and formulas for forward differences. We generalize some of these to d-ary partitions and explore connections with color partitions. Our techniques include the use of generating functions and bijections on rooted partitions. We end with a list of conjectures and a direction for future research.</description>

Abstract: The inverse theory for Gowers uniformity norms is one of the central topics in additive combinatorics and one of the most important aspects of the theory is the question of bounds. In this paper, we prove a quasipolynomial inverse theorem for the $\mathsf{U}^4$ norm in finite vector spaces. The proof follows a different strategy compared to the existing quantitative inverse theorems. In particular, the argument relies on a novel argument, which we call the abstract Balog-Szemer\'edi-Gowers theorem, and combines several other ingredients such as algebraic regularity method, bilinear Bogolyubov argument and algebraic dependent random choice.</description>

      <title>Locally seeded embeddings, and Ramsey numbers of bipartite graphs with sublinear bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A seminal result of Lee asserts that the Ramsey number of any bipartite $d$-degenerate graph $H$ satisfies $\log r(H) = \log n + O(d)$. In particular, this bound applies to every bipartite graph of maximal degree $\Delta$. It remains a compelling challenge to identify conditions that guarantee that an $n$-vertex graph $H$ has Ramsey number linear in $n$, independently of $\Delta$. Our contribution is a characterization of bipartite graphs with linear-size Ramsey numbers in terms of graph bandwidth, a notion of local connectivity. We prove that for any $n$-vertex bipartite graph $H$ with maximal degree at most $\Delta$ and bandwidth $b(H)$ at most $\exp(-C\Delta\log\Delta)\,n$, we have $\log r(H) = \log n + O(1)$. This characterization is nearly optimal: for every $\Delta$ there exists an $n$-vertex bipartite graph $H$ of degree at most $\Delta$ and $b(H) \leq \exp(-c\Delta)\,n$, such that $\log r(H) = \log n + \Omega(\Delta)$. We also provide bounds interpolating between these two bandwidth regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.11099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fix a finite field $K$ of order $q$ and a word $w$ in a free group $F$ on $r$ generators. A $w$-random element in $GL_N(K)$ is obtained by sampling $r$ independent uniformly random elements $g_1,\ldots,g_r\in GL_N(K)$ and evaluating $w\left(g_1,\ldots,g_r\right)$. Consider $\mathbb{E}_w\left[\mathrm{fix}\right]$, the average number of vectors in $K^{N}$ fixed by a $w$-random element. We show that $\mathbb{E}_{w}\left[\mathrm{fix}\right]$ is a rational function in $q^{N}$. Moreover, if $w=u^{d}$ with $u$ a non-power, then the limit $\lim_{N\to\infty}\mathbb{E}_{w}\left[\mathrm{fix}\right]$ depends only on $d$ and not on $u$. These two phenomena generalize to all stable characters of the groups $\left\{ GL_N(K)\right\}_{N}$.
  A main feature of this work is the connection we establish between word measures on $GL_N(K)$ and the free group algebra $K\left[F\right]$. A classical result of Cohn [1964] and Lewin [1969] is that every one-sided ideal of $K\left[F\right]$ is a free $K\left[F\right]$-module with a well-defined rank. We show that for $w$ a non-power, $\mathbb{E}_{w}\left[\mathrm{fix}\right]=2+\frac{C}{q^{N}}+O\left(\frac{1}{q^{2N}}\right)$, where $C$ is the number of rank-2 right ideals $I\le K\left[F\right]$ which contain $w-1$ but not as a basis element. We describe a full conjectural picture generalizing this result, featuring a new invariant we call the $q$-primitivity rank of $w$.
  In the process, we prove several new results about free group algebras. For example, we show that if $T$ is any finite subtree of the Cayley graph of $F$, and $I\le K\left[F\right]$ is a right ideal with a generating set supported on $T$, then $I$ admits a basis supported on $T$. We also prove an analogue of Kaplansky's unit conjecture for certain $K\left[F\right]$-modules.</description>
