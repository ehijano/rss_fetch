      <title>Thermodynmics of Rotating AdS black holes in Kaniadakis statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we advance the understanding of thermodynamic properties and phase transitions in rotating anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes by applying the Kaniadakis(KD) entropy framework. This framework represents a non-extensive generalization of classical statistical mechanics, inspired by the symmetries of relativity and offering a novel perspective on black hole thermodynamics. Our focus is on investigating how Kaniadakis entropy modifies the thermodynamic phase space of rotating AdS black holes. To achieve this, we analyze three prominent rotating AdS black hole systems: the Kerr AdS black hole, the Kerr-Sen AdS black hole, and the Kerr-Newman AdS black hole. We assess their thermodynamic quantities, phase transitions, thermodynamic topology and thermodynamic geometry within the Kaniadakis statistical framework. Our analysis reveals notable deviations from the behaviour predicted by traditional Gibbs-Boltzmann(GB) statistics.</description>

      <title>Self-interacting axion clouds around rotating black holes in binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superradiant instability can form clouds around rotating black holes (BHs) composed of ultralight bosonic fields, such as axions. A BH with such a cloud in a binary system exhibits rich phenomena, and gravitational waves (GWs) from the BH merger provide a means to probe axions. For the first time, we study the evolution of axion clouds in a binary system during the inspiral phase, including axion self-interaction effects. When the self-interaction is significant, unlike in the negligible case, two types of clouds coexist through mode coupling. We examine the evolution of the system considering the effects of dissipation caused by both self-interaction and tidal interaction. For tidal interaction, in addition to the processes of emission to infinity and absorption by the BH, indirect emission via transitions (both resonant and off-resonant) is also considered as a second-order perturbation. Our results demonstrate that the signatures of axion self-interaction are imprinted in the modification of the GW phase. Furthermore, we find the possibility of a dynamical instability called bosenova during the binary inspiral phase.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Transformations in Cosmological and Black Hole Analytical Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the transformation of a very broad class of metrics that can be expressed in terms of static coordinates. Starting from a general ansatz, we obtain a relation for the parameters in which one can impose further symmetries or restrictions. One of the simplest restrictions leads to FLRW cases, while transforming from the initial static to other static-type coordinates can lead to near horizon coordinates, Wheeler--Regge, and isotropic coordinates, among others. As less restrictive cases, we show an indirect route for obtaining Kruskal-Szekeres within this approach, as well as Lema\^{\i}tre coordinates. We use Schwarzschild spacetime as a prototype for testing the procedure in individual cases. However, application to other spacetimes, such as de-Sitter, Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m, and Schwarzschild de Sitter, can be readily generalized.</description>

      <title>SLOCC and LU classification of black holes with eight electric and magnetic charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{Linde}, Kallosh and Linde discussed the SLOCC classification of black holes. However, the criteria for the SLOCC classification of black holes have not been given. In addition, the LU classification of black holes has not been studied in the past. In this paper we will consider both SLOCC and LU classification of the STU black holes with four integer electric charges $q_{i} $ and four integer magnetic charges $p^{i}$, $i=0,1,2,3$. Two STU black holes with eight charges are considered SLOCC (LU) equivalent if and only if their corresponding states of three qubits are SLOCC (LU) equivalent. Under this definition, we give criteria for the classification of the eight-charge STU black holes under SLOCC and under LU, respectively. We will study the classification of the black holes via the classification of SLOCC and LU entanglement of three qubits. We then identify a set of black holes corresponding to the state W of three qubits, which is of interest since it has the maximal average von Neumann entropy of entanglement. Via von Neumann entanglement entropy, we partition the STU black holes corresponding to pure states of GHZ SLOCC class into five families under LU.</description>

      <title>Static and stationary loop quantum black bounces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a static and stationary black bounce geometry inspired by Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), focusing on how LQG corrections and regularization parameters affect its properties. Building on the spherically symmetric and static black hole solution from \cite{Kelly:2020uwj}, we trace its origin to Non-Linear Electrodynamics (NED) with electric and magnetic charges and check the energy conditions (NEC, WEC, SEC). By extending the geometry using the Simpson-Visser procedure, we construct a black hole-wormhole bounce structure, influenced by LQG parameters. We analyze the horizon structure to constrain parameters for black holes and wormholes, and examine curvature and new sources including a phantom-type scalar field to ensure spacetime regularity and adherence to energy conditions. Thermodynamic properties are also studied, revealing the existence of remnants and phase transitions. Additionally, we derive a rotating black bounce solution, verifying its regularity, and putting forward that the spherical bouncing surface turns into an ellipsoid with no ring singularity. Finally, we find that increasing the LQG parameter leads to smaller ergospheres and reduced shadows, with potential implications for observational astrophysics and quantum gravitational signatures.</description>

      <title>What if the universe expands linearly? A local general relativity to solve the "zero active mass" problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern cosmology presents important challenges such as the \textit{Hubble tension}, \textit{El Gordo's collision} or the \textit{impossible galaxies} ($z &gt; 10$). Slight modifications to the standard model propose new parameters (e.g. the early and dynamical dark energy). On the other hand, alternatives such as the coasting universes (e.g. the \textit{hyperconical model} and the spatially flat $R_h = ct$ universe) are statistically compatible with most of observational tests, but still present theoretical problems in matching the observed matter contents since they predict a ``zero active gravitational mass.'' To solve these open issues, we suggest that general relativity might be not valid at cosmic scales, but it would be valid at local scales. This proposal is addressed from two main features of the embedding hyperconical model: 1) the background metric would be independent of the matter content, and 2) the observed cosmic acceleration would be fictitious and because of a distorted stereographic projection of coordinates that produce an apparent radial inhomogeneity from homogeneous manifolds. Finally, to support the discussion, standard observational tests were updated here, showing that the hyperconical model is adequately fitted to Type Ia Supernovae, quasars, galaxy clusters, BAO, and cosmic chronometer data sets.</description>

      <title>A local diagnostic program for unitary evolution in general space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a local framework for investigating non-unitary evolution groups pertinent to effective field theories in general semi-classical spacetimes. Our approach is based on a rigorous local stability analysis of the algebra of observables and solely employs geometric concepts in the functional representation of quantum field theory. In this representation, it is possible to construct infinitely many self-adjoint extensions of the canonical momentum field at the kinematic level, and by the usual functional calculus arguments this holds for the Hamiltonian, as well. However, these self-adjoint domains have only the trivial wave functional in common with the solution space of the functional Schr\"odinger equation. This is related to the existence of boundaries in configuration field space which can be penetrated by the probability flux, causing probability to leak into regions in configuration field space that require a more fundamental description. As a consequence the evolution admits no unitary representation. Instead, in the absence of ghosts, the evolution is represented by contractive semi-groups in the semiclassical approximation. This allows to quantify the unitarity loss and, in turn, to assess the quality of the semi-classical approximation. We perform numerical experiments based on our formal investigations to determine regions in cosmological spacetimes where the semiclassical approximation breaks down for free quantum fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a model for the initial state of the universe based on a gravitational path integral that includes connected geometries which simultaneously produce bra and ket of the wave function. We argue that a natural object to describe this state is the Wigner distribution, which is a function on a classical phase space obtained by a certain integral transform of the density matrix. We work with Lorentzian de Sitter Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity in which we find semiclassical saddle-points for pure gravity, as well as when we include matter components such as a CFT and a classical inflaton field. We also discuss different choices of fixing time reparametrizations. In the regime of large universes our connected geometry dominates over the Hartle-Hawking saddle and gives a distribution that has a meaningful probabilistic interpretation for local observables. It does not, however, give a normalizable probability measure on the entire phase space of the theory.</description>

      <title>Outflows from naked singularities, infall through the black hole horizon: hydrodynamic simulations of accretion in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed the first simulations of accretion onto the compact objects in the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) spacetime. The results obtained in general relativity are representative of those for spherically symmetric naked singularities and black holes in a number of modified gravity theories. A possible application of these calculations is to the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with their powerful jets. It is now possible to compare the results of such simulations with the accreting supermassive objects in our own Milky Way and the nearest spiral galaxy: observations of the core regions of galactic nuclei (Sgr A* and M87) performed with unprecedented resolution by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration allow fairly direct tests of the spacetime-metric of the central compact object. In this context we present general-relativistic hydrodynamical simulation results of accretion from an orbiting accretion torus (with a cusp) onto a RN black hole and a RN naked singularity. The results could not be more different for the two cases. For a black hole, just as in the familiar Kerr/Schwarzschild case, matter overflowing the cusp plunges into the black hole horizon. For the naked singularity, the accreting matter forms an inner structure of toroidal topology and leaves the system via powerful outflows. It is an open question whether this inner structure can give rise to an image quantitatively similar to the ones reported by EHT for M87 and Sgr A*.</description>

      <title>Breaking the cosmological invariance of the dark matter halos shape as a new probe of modified gravity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper in Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics, Alimi &amp; Koskas (2024) have highlighted in wCDM models derived from general relativity (with Dark Energy Universe numerical simulation data), a cosmological invariance of the distribution of dark matter (DM) halo shapes when expressed in terms of the non-linear fluctuations of the cosmic matter field. We show in this paper that this invariance persists when tested on numerical simulations performed with a different code, i.e. a different N-body solver, DUSTGRAIN-pathfinder simulation (Giocoli et al. 2018) and that it is also robust to the addition of neutrinos to the cold component of dark matter. However, this discovery raises crucial questions about the validity of this invariance in modified gravity models. Thus, we examine whether the invariance observed by Alimi &amp; Koskas (2024) remains robust in the case of Hu &amp; Sawicki models of modified gravity using numerical simulations performed by Giocoli et al. (2018). By comparing the results of advanced numerical simulations in these different theoretical frameworks, we found significant deviations from the invariance observed in the framework of wCDM models of GR. These deviations suggest that the nature of the gravitation significantly influences the shape of the DM halos. We then interpret this deviation observed in the modified gravity models from the GR models as due to the scalar-field screening effect corresponding to such f(R)-type theories. This one modifies the sphericalization process of DM halos during their formation, precisely because the critical mass at which this scalar field becomes non-negligible is the mass at which the deviation appears. To this extent, the deviation from cosmological invariance in the shape of DM halos is a cosmological probe of the nature of gravity, and the mass scale at which it appears can be used to estimate the $f_{R0}$ parameter of such theories.</description>

      <title>Parametrically amplified super-radiance towards hot big bang universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism of preheating stage after inflation, using a new idea of parametrically amplified super-radiance. Highly coherent state, characterized by macro-coherence of scalar field coupled to produced massless particle in pairs, is created by parametric resonance effects associated with field oscillation around its potential minimum, within a Hubble volume. The state is described effectively by the simple Dicke-type of super-radiance model, and super-radiant pulse is emitted within a Hubble time, justifying neglect of cosmic expansion. Produced particles are shown to interact to change their energy and momentum distribution to realize thermal hot big bang universe. A long standing problem of heating after inflation may thus be solved. A new dark matter candidate produced at the emergence of thermalized universe is suggested as well.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic universe with anisotropic dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate anisotropic equation of state parameterization of dark energy within the framework of an axisymmetric (planar) Bianchi-I universe. In addition to constraining the equation of state for anisotropic dark energy and other standard cosmological model parameters, we also constrain any underlying anisotropic axis using the latest Pantheon+ Type Ia Supernovae data set augmented by SH0ES Cepheid distance calibrators. The mean anisotropic dark energy equation of state and corresponding difference in the equation of states in and normal to the plane of our axisymmetric Bianchi-I space-time are found to be $\bar{w}=-0.90^{+0.16}_{-0.12}$ and $\delta_w=-0.140^{+0.11}_{-0.082}$ respectively. We also find an axis of anisotropy in this planar Bianchi-I model with anisotropic dark energy to be $\approx(279^{\circ} ,12^{\circ})$ in galactic coordinates. Our analysis of different cosmological models suggests that while a Bianchi-I universe with anisotropic dark energy (the $w_b$CDM model) shows some preference over other anisotropic models, it is still less likely than the standard $\Lambda$CDM model or a model with a constant dark energy equation of state ($w$CDM). Overall, the $\Lambda$CDM model remains the most probable model based on the Akaike Information Criterion.</description>

      <title>The Hierarchical Three-Body Problem at $\mathcal{O} (G^2)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing techniques from scattering amplitudes and effective field theory, we model the dynamics of hierarchical triples, which are three-body systems composed of two bodies separated by a distance $r$ and a third body a distance $\rho$ away, with $r \ll \rho$. We apply the method of regions to systematically expand in the small ratio $r/\rho$ and illustrate this approach for evaluating Fourier transform integrals, which have been the bottleneck for deriving complete results in position space. In the limit where the distant third body is much heavier than the other two, we derive new analytic results in position space for the three-body conservative potential at $\mathcal{O}(G^2)$ and at leading and next-to-leading order in $r/\rho$. We also provide necessary formulae for deriving results for arbitrary masses in the rest frame of the distant particle. Our results are exact in velocity, and can be used in analyses involving both bound and unbound hierarchical triples in astrophysical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If a set of massive objects collide in space and the fragments disperse, possibly forming black holes, then this process will emit gravitational waves. Computing the detailed gravitational wave-form associated with this process is a complicated problem, not only due to the non-linearity of gravity but also due to the fact that during the collision and subsequent fragmentation the objects could undergo complicated non-gravitational interactions. Nevertheless the classical soft graviton theorem determines the power law fall-off of the wave-form at late and early times, including logarithmic corrections, in terms of only the momenta of the incoming and outgoing objects without any reference to what transpired during the collision. In this short review I shall explain the results and very briefly outline the derivation of these results.</description>

Abstract: Considering an arbitrary dimensional FLRW universe in the framework of a generalized S\'{a}ez--Ballester (SB) theory, we establish a noncommutative (NC) cosmological model. We concentrate on the predictions of NC model and compare them with their commutative counterparts in both the classical and quantum regimes. For the classic case, taking a very small NC parameter, we apply two different methods to analyze the model features. First, we show through numerical analysis that our NC model is a successful inflationary model capable of overcoming the graceful exit and horizon problems. Furthermore, the NC traces are visible the late time, which supports the UV/IR mixing characteristic of the NC models. In the second method, we show that our NC model can correspond to the previously developed NC inflationary models. In the commutative quantum case, we obtain an exact wave function and then use the WKB approximation to show that the solutions of the corresponding classical regime are recovered. Finally, with regard to the NC quantum level, we focus on the special case for which we show that a constant of motion exists. The latter helps us to conveniently transform the corresponding complicated NC-WDW equation into an ordinary differential equation, which can be easily solved numerically for the general case or analytically for some special cases. The resultant solutions show a damping behavior in the wave function associated with the proposed NC model, which may be important in determining the viable initial states for the very early universe.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Signalling: Connections between Causal Inference and Space-time Geometry</title>

Abstract: Causality is pivotal to our understanding of the world, presenting itself in different forms: information-theoretic and relativistic, the former linked to the flow of information, the latter to the structure of space-time. Leveraging a framework introduced in PRA, 106, 032204 (2022), which formally connects these two notions in general physical theories, we study their interplay. Here, information-theoretic causality is defined through a causal modelling approach. First, we improve the characterization of information-theoretic signalling as defined through so-called affects relations. Specifically, we provide conditions for identifying redundancies in different parts of such a relation, introducing techniques for causal inference in unfaithful causal models (where the observable data does not "faithfully" reflect the causal dependences). In particular, this demonstrates the possibility of causal inference using the absence of signalling between certain nodes. Second, we define an order-theoretic property called conicality, showing that it is satisfied for light cones in Minkowski space-times with $d&gt;1$ spatial dimensions but violated for $d=1$. Finally, we study the embedding of information-theoretic causal models in space-time without violating relativistic principles such as no superluminal signalling (NSS). In general, we observe that constraints imposed by NSS in a space-time and those imposed by purely information-theoretic causal inference behave differently. We then prove a correspondence between conical space-times and faithful causal models: in both cases, there emerges a parallel between these two types of constraints. This indicates a connection between informational and geometric notions of causality, and offers new insights for studying the relations between the principles of NSS and no causal loops in different space-time geometries and theories of information processing.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic topology of Phantom AdS Black Holes in Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the thermodynamic topology of phantom AdS black holes in the context of massive gravity. To this end, we evaluate these black holes in two distinct ensembles: the canonical and grand canonical ensembles (GCE). We begin by examining the topological charge linked to the critical point and confirming the existence of a conventional critical point $(CP_{1})$ in the canonical ensemble (CE), this critical point has a topological charge of $-1$ and acts as a point of phase annihilation, this situation can only be considered within the context of the classical Einstein-Maxwell (CEM) theory $(\eta=1)$, while no critical point is identified in the GCE. Furthermore, we consider black holes as a topological defect within the thermodynamic space. To gain an understanding of the local and global topological configuration of this defect, we will analyze its winding numbers, and observe that the total topological charge in the CE consistently remains at $1$. When the system experiences a pressure below the critical threshold, it gives rise to the occurrence of annihilation and generation points. The value of electric potential determines whether the total topological charge in the GCE is zero or one. As a result, we detect a point of generation point or absence of generation/annihilation point. Based on our analysis, it can be inferred that ensembles significantly impact the topological class of phantom AdS black holes in massive gravity.</description>

      <title>Universality of the thermodynamics of a quantum-mechanically radiating black hole departing from thermality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathur and Mehta won the third prize in the 2023 Gravity Research Foundation Essay Competition for proving the universality of black hole (BH) thermodynamics. Specifically, they demonstrated that any Extremely Compact Object (ECO) must have the same BH thermodynamic properties regardless of whether or not the ECO possesses an event horizon. The result is remarkable, but it was obtained under the approximation according to which the BH emission spectrum has an exactly thermal character. In fact, strong arguments based on energy conservation and BH back reaction imply that the spectrum of the Hawking radiation cannot be exactly thermal. In this work the result of Mathur and Mehta will be extended to the case where the radiation spectrum is not exactly thermal using the concept of BH dynamical state.</description>

      <title>Spin-spin Interactions in General Relativity versus Linearized Massive Gravity: $N$-body Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulated spin-spin interactions of $N$-bodies in linearized General Relativity (GR) and linearized Massive Gravity of the Fierz-Pauli type (mGR). It was noted earlier that there is a discrete difference between the spin-spin interaction potential in GR and mGR for a $2$-body system, akin to the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity in the static Newton's potential. Specifically, at large distances, GR favors anti-parallel spin orientation with total spin pointing along the interaction axis, while mGR favors parallel spin orientation with total spin perpendicular to the axis between the sources. For an $N$-body system, a simulation in mGR hitherto has not been done and one would like to know the total spin of the system in both theories. Here we remedy this. In the simulations of GR, we observed that the total spin tends to decrease from a random initial configuration, while for mGR with a large distance, the total spin increases.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the behaviour of a minimally coupled tachyonic scalar field at inflection points in an accelerating universe. We consider the different expansion factors and obtain potentials of tachyonic scalar field. Inflection points of homogeneous tachyonic scalar field is calculated for these potentials.

      <title>Violation of causality in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is ongoing interest in the nonmetricity formulation of gravity. The nonlinear extension of the theory, called $f(Q)$ gravity, has recently been proposed and offers a promising avenue for addressing some of the long-standing challenges in cosmology and fundamental physics. A number of solutions have already been found that have confirmed the usefulness of the theory for astrophysics and cosmology. Motivated by earlier work on G\"odel-type spacetimes we investigate whether $f(Q)$ gravity admits such cosmological solutions, which entail causality violation. In the coincident gauge, which is shown to be a legitimate gauge because the connection field equations are satisfied, we find that G\"odel-type metrics are allowed by this modified gravity theory for any function $f(Q)$. As a matter of fact, out of all G\"odel-type metrics only G\"odel's original model is compatible with $f(Q)$ gravity, implying violation of causality. The requirement that energy conditions be obeyed by the matter content leads to mild restrictions on the function $f(Q)$.</description>

      <title>From the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularities to Einstein-Maxwell phantom wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Janis-Newman-Winicour spacetime corresponds to a static spherically symmetric solution of Einstein equations with the energy momentum tensor of a massless quintessence field. It is understood that the spacetime describes a naked singularity. The solution has two parameters, $b$ and $s$. To our knowledge, the exact physical meaning of the two parameters is still unclear. In this paper, starting from the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity solution, we first obtain a wormhole solution by a complex transformation. Then let the parameter $s$ approaching infinity, we obtain the well-known exponential wormhole solution. After that, we embed both the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity and its wormhole counterpart in the background of de Sitter or anti-de Sitter Universe with the energy momentum tensor of massive quintessence and massive phantom fields, respectively. To our surprise, the resulting quintessence potential is actually the dilaton potential found by one of us. It hints us that, by modulating the parameters in the charged dilaton black hole solutions we can get the Janis-Newman-Winicour solution. Furthermore, a charged wormhole solution is obtained by performing complex transformation on the charged dilaton black hole solutions in the background of de Sitter or anti-de Sitter Universe. We eventually find that $s$ is actually related to the coupling constant of dilaton field to Maxwell field and $b$ is related to a negative mass for the dilaton black holes. A negative black hole mass is physically forbidden. Therefore, we conclude that the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity solution is not physically allowed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the quasinormal modes, pseudospectrum and time evolution of a massive vector field around a quantum corrected black hole in de-Sitter spacetime. We start by parameterization and using orthonormal tetrads to get the effective potential. Methodologically we use the hyperboloidal framework together with discretizing the non-selfadjoint operator through Chebyshev-Gauss-Labatto grid to attain the QNMs. We explore the parametric instability of QNMs caused by quantum correction, cosmological constant and Proca mass, and these three factors show very different influences on the QNMs' migration flow. On the other hand, we discuss the instability of QNMs with arbitrary-shape perturbation and the effectiveness of numerical results through pseudospectrum. We use high frequency approximation to attain the expression of the time domain Green function and clarify the origin of two different stages in time evolution. Through numerical methods we confirm that no power-law late time tail is expected, and the possible impact on time evolution caused by quantum correction is discussed.</description>

      <title>Obstructions to distinguished Riemannian metrics via Lorentzian geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We approach the problem of finding obstructions to curvature distinguished Riemannian metrics by considering Lorentzian metrics to which they are dual in a suitable sense. Obstructions to the latter then yield obstructions to the former. This framework applies both locally and globally, including to compact manifolds, and is sensitive to various aspects of curvature. Here we apply it in two different ways. First, by embedding a Riemannian manifold into a Lorentzian one and utilizing Penrose's "plane wave limit," we find necessary local conditions, in terms of the Hessian of just one function, for large classes of Riemannian metrics to contain within them those that have parallel Ricci tensor, or are Ricci-flat, or are locally symmetric. Second, by considering Riemannian metrics dual to constant curvature Lorentzian metrics via a type of Wick rotation, we are able to rule out the existence of a family of compact Riemannian manifolds (in all dimensions) that deviate from constant curvature in a precise sense.</description>

      <title>Apparent parity violation in the observed galaxy trispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the 4-point correlation function in large-scale galaxy surveys have found apparent evidence of parity violation in the distribution of galaxies. This cannot happen via dynamical gravitational effects in general relativity. If such a violation arose from physics in the early Universe it could indicate important new physics beyond the standard model, and would be at odds with most models of inflation. It is therefore now timely to consider the galaxy trispectrum in more detail. While the intrinsic 4-point correlation function, or equivalently the trispectrum, its Fourier counterpart, is parity invariant, the observed trispectrum must take redshift-space distortions into account. Although the standard Newtonian correction also respects parity invariance, we show that sub-leading relativistic corrections do not. We demonstrate that these can be significant at intermediate linear scales and are dominant over the Newtonian parity-invariant part around the equality scale and above. Therefore when observing the galaxy 4-point correlation function, we should expect to detect parity violation on large scales.</description>

Abstract: In recent work, we demonstrated a double-copy relation between inclusive gluon radiation in shock wave collisions of ultrarelativistic nuclei and inclusive graviton radiation in trans-Planckian gravitational shock wave collisions. We compute here the corresponding gravitational shock wave propagators in general relativity and demonstrate that they too obey a double copy relation to gluon shock wave propagators computed previously. These results provide key input in a renormalization group approach towards computing the high frequency radiation spectrum in close black hole encounters.</description>
