Abstract: Many agent-based mathematical models of cranial neural crest cell (CNCC) migration impose a binary phenotypic partition of cells into either leaders or followers. In such models, the movement of leader cells at the front of collectives is guided by local chemoattractant gradients, while follower cells behind leaders move according to local cell-cell guidance cues. Although such model formulations have yielded many insights into the mechanisms underpinning CNCC migration, they rely on fixed phenotypic traits that are difficult to reconcile with evidence of phenotypic plasticity in vivo. A later agent-based model of CNCC migration aimed to address this limitation by allowing cells to adaptively combine chemotactic and cell-cell guidance cues during migration. In this model, cell behaviour adapts instantaneously in response to environmental cues, which precludes the identification of a persistent subset of cells as leader-like over biologically relevant timescales, as observed in vivo. Here, we build on previous leader-follower and adaptive phenotype models to develop a polarity-based agent-based model of CNCC migration, in which all cells evolve according to identical rules, interact via a pairwise interaction potential, and carry polarity vectors that evolve according to a dynamical system driven by time-averaged exposure to chemoattractant gradients. Numerical simulations of this model show that a leader-follower phenotypic partition emerges spontaneously from the underlying collective dynamics of the model. Furthermore, the model reproduces behaviour that is consistent with experimental observations of CNCC migration in the chick embryo. Thus, we provide an experimentally consistent, mechanistically-grounded mathematical model that captures the emergence of leader and follower cell phenotypes without their imposition a priori.</description>
