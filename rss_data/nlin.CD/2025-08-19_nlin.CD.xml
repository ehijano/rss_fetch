      <title>GBEES-GPU: An efficient parallel GPU algorithm for high-dimensional nonlinear uncertainty propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eulerian nonlinear uncertainty propagation methods often suffer from finite domain limitations and computational inefficiencies. A recent approach to this class of algorithm, Grid-based Bayesian Estimation Exploiting Sparsity, addresses the first challenge by dynamically allocating a discretized grid in regions of phase space where probability is non-negligible. However, the design of the original algorithm causes the second challenge to persist in high-dimensional systems. This paper presents an architectural optimization of the algorithm for CPU implementation, followed by its adaptation to the CUDA framework for single GPU execution. The algorithm is validated for accuracy and convergence, with performance evaluated across distinct GPUs. Tests include propagating a three-dimensional probability distribution subject to the Lorenz '63 model and a six-dimensional probability distribution subject to the Lorenz '96 model. The results imply that the improvements made result in a speedup of over 1000 times compared to the original implementation.</description>

      <title>Central Limit Behavior at the Edge of Chaos in the z-Logistic Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on the FeigenbaumCoulletTresser point of the dissipative one-dimensional z logistic map. We show that sums of iterates converge to q Gaussian distributions, which optimize the nonadditive entropic functional Sq under simple constraints. We derive a closedform prediction for the entropic index, and validate it numerically via data collapse for typical z values. The formula captures how the limiting law depends on the nonlinearity order and implies finite variance for z larger than 2 and divergent variance for z in between 1 and 2. These results extend edge of chaos central limit behavior beyond the standard case and provide a simple predictive law for unimodal maps with varying maximum order.</description>

      <title>DyMixOp: Guiding Neural Operator Design for PDEs from a Complex Dynamics Perspective with Local-Global-Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A primary challenge in using neural networks to approximate nonlinear dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is transforming these systems into a suitable format, especially when dealing with non-linearizable dynamics or the need for infinite-dimensional spaces for linearization. This paper introduces DyMixOp, a novel neural operator framework for PDEs that integrates insights from complex dynamical systems to address this challenge. Grounded in inertial manifold theory, DyMixOp transforms infinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into a finite-dimensional latent space, establishing a structured foundation that maintains essential nonlinear interactions and enhances physical interpretability. A key innovation is the Local-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation, inspired by convection dynamics in turbulence. This transformation effectively captures both fine-scale details and nonlinear interactions, while mitigating spectral bias commonly found in existing neural operators. The framework is further strengthened by a dynamics-informed architecture that connects multiple LGM layers to approximate linear and nonlinear dynamics, reflecting the temporal evolution of dynamical systems. Experimental results across diverse PDE benchmarks demonstrate that DyMixOp achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing prediction errors, particularly in convection-dominated scenarios reaching up to 86.7\%, while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos Diagnostics for Open Quantum Systems from Bi-Lanczos Krylov Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Hermitian systems, Krylov complexity has emerged as a powerful diagnostic of quantum dynamics, capable of distinguishing chaotic from integrable phases, in agreement with established probes such as spectral statistics and out-of-time-order correlators. By contrast, its role in non-Hermitian settings, relevant for modeling open quantum systems, remains less understood due to the challenges posed by complex eigenvalues and the limitations of standard approaches such as singular value decomposition. Here, we demonstrate that Krylov complexity, computed via the bi-Lanczos algorithm, effectively identifies chaotic and integrable phases in open quantum systems. The results align with complex spectral statistics and complex spacing ratios, highlighting the robustness of this approach. The universality of our findings is further supported through studies of both the non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and non-Hermitian random matrix ensembles.</description>

      <title>Chaos-Mediated Quantum State Discrimination Near Unit Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a ''quantum microscope'' for qubits based on nonlinear discrete-time chaotic dynamics, which exponentially amplifies the initially small fidelity of a pair of states to a large saturation value ( $\sim$ 1/2), thereby pushing the Helstrom bound to more accessible values. We show that Bell-type temporal correlations can capture even the minutest differences between two initial states, thus enabling their distinguishability. The cost of distinguishability is quantified in terms of the characteristic waiting time of the evolution, defined as the time after which the temporal correlation of a given initial state begins to diverge exponentially from that of a nearby state. The closer the two states are, the longer this waiting time becomes. By combining chaos with Bell-type temporal correlations, this approach opens unexplored avenues for pushing the limits of precision in quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of the butterfly velocity in holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15357v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study quantum chaos in a variety of holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potentials. This includes the 1 R-Charge black hole (1RCBH) model, the 2 R-Charge black hole (2RCBH) model, a potential reconstruction-based analytic bottom-up model, and a numerical bottom-up model. All these models are different avatars of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity action, distinguished by their specific choices of dilaton potentials and gauge-kinetic coupling functions. We focus on computing the chaos parameter, the butterfly velocity, using three distinct methods: entanglement wedge reconstruction, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and pole-skipping. We show that all three methods yield identical results for the butterfly velocity across all the holographic QCD models considered, further establishing the equivalence between the three approaches. Furthermore, we analyze in detail the behavior of the butterfly velocity as a function of chemical potential and temperature. Interestingly, a universal trend emerges across all models: the butterfly velocity increases/decreases with temperature/chemical potential for thermodynamically stable phases. Additionally, in the high-temperature limit, the butterfly velocity in all models approaches that of the chargeless plasma.</description>
