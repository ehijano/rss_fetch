      <title>Stochastic Kuramoto oscillators with inertia and higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impact of noise in coupled oscillators with pairwise interactions has been extensively explored. Here, we study stochastic second-order coupled Kuramoto oscillators with higher-order interactions, and show that as noise strength increases the critical points associated with synchronization transitions shift toward higher coupling values. By employing the perturbation analysis, we obtain an expression for the forward critical point as a function of inertia and noise strength. Further, for overdamped systems we show that as noise strength increases, the first-order transition switches to second-order even for higher-order couplings. We include a discussion on nature of critical points obtained through Ott-Antonsen ansatz.</description>

      <title>Dynamical analysis of a parameter-aware reservoir computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computing has been shown to be a useful framework for predicting critical transitions of a dynamical system if the bifurcation parameter is also provided as an input. Its utility is significant because in real-world scenarios, the exact model equations are unknown. This Letter shows how the theory of dynamical system provides the underlying mechanism behind the prediction. Using numerical methods, by considering dynamical systems which show Hopf bifurcation, we demonstrate that the map produced by the reservoir after a successful training undergoes a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation such that the critical point of the map is in immediate proximity to that of the original dynamical system. In addition, we have compared and analyzed different structures in the phase space. Our findings provide insight into the functioning of machine learning algorithms for predicting critical transitions.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Optimizes Power Dispatch in Decentralized Power Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective frequency control in power grids has become increasingly important with the increasing demand for renewable energy sources. Here, we propose a novel strategy for resolving this challenge using graph convolutional proximal policy optimization (GC-PPO). The GC-PPO method can optimally determine how much power individual buses dispatch to reduce frequency fluctuations across a power grid. We demonstrate its efficacy in controlling disturbances by applying the GC-PPO to the power grid of the UK. The performance of GC-PPO is outstanding compared to the classical methods. This result highlights the promising role of GC-PPO in enhancing the stability and reliability of power systems by switching lines or decentralizing grid topology.</description>

      <title>Understanding cell populations sharing information through the environment, as reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective migration is a phenomenon observed in various biological systems, where the cooperation of multiple cells leads to complex functions beyond individual capabilities, such as in immunity and development. A distinctive example is cell populations that not only ascend attractant gradient originating from targets, such as damaged tissue, but also actively modify the gradient, through their own production and degradation. While the optimality of single-cell information processing has been extensively studied, the optimality of the collective information processing that includes gradient sensing and gradient generation, remains underexplored. In this study, we formulated a cell population that produces and degrades an attractant while exploring the environment as an agent population performing distributed reinforcement learning. We demonstrated the existence of optimal couplings between gradient sensing and gradient generation, showing that the optimal gradient generation qualitatively differs depending on whether the gradient sensing is logarithmic or linear. The derived dynamics have a structure homogeneous to the Keller-Segel model, suggesting that cell populations might be learning. Additionally, we showed that the distributed information processing structure of the agent population enables a proportion of the population to robustly accumulate at the target. Our results provide a quantitative foundation for understanding the collective information processing mediated by attractants in extracellular environments.</description>

      <title>Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in the synchronization of oscillator lattices with time-dependent noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems of oscillators subject to time-dependent noise typically achieve synchronization for long times when their mutual coupling is sufficiently strong. The dynamical process whereby synchronization is reached can be thought of as a growth process in which an interface formed by the local phase field gradually roughens and eventually saturates. Such a process is here shown to display the generic scale invariance of the one-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class, including a Tracy-Widom probability distribution for phase fluctuations around their mean. This is revealed by numerical explorations of a variety of oscillator systems: rings of generic phase oscillators and rings of paradigmatic limit-cycle oscillators, like Stuart-Landau and van der Pol. It also agrees with analytical expectations derived under conditions of strong mutual coupling. The nonequilibrium critical behavior that we find is robust and transcends the details of the oscillators considered. Hence, it may well be accessible to experimental ensembles of oscillators in the presence of e.g. thermal noise.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of buyer populations in fresh product markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on empirical evidences and previous studies, we introduce and mathematically study a perception-driven model for the dynamics of buyer populations in markets of perishable goods. Buyer behaviours are driven partly by some loyalty to the sellers that they previously purchased at, and partly by the sensitivity to the intrinsic attractiveness of each seller in the market. On the other hand, the sellers update they attractiveness in time according to the difference between the volume of their clientele and the mean volume of buyers in the market, optimising either their profit when this difference is favourable or their competitiveness otherwise. While this negative feedback mechanism is a source of instability that promotes oscillatory behaviour, our analysis identifies the critical features of the dynamics that are responsible for the asymptotic stability of the stationary states, both in their immediate neighbourhood and globally in phase space. Altogether, this study provides mathematical insights into the consequences of introducing feedback into buyer-seller interactions in such markets, with emphasis on identifying conditions for long term constancy of clientele volumes.</description>

      <title>Emergence of autopoietic vesicles able to grow, repair and reproduce in a minimalist particle system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper describes a 2D particle system in which autopoietic vesicles that are able to grow, repair, and reproduce can emerge from an initial random distribution of individual components. The reproduction process also exhibits inheritance of the vesicle content that could in principle change from one generation to the next and influence fitness, making those autopoietic vesicles eligible to be acted upon by natural selection.
