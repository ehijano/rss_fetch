      <title>Properties and Characterisations of Cofree Cartesian Differential Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13886v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cartesian differential categories come equipped with a differential operator which formalises the total derivative from multivariable calculus. Cofree Cartesian differential categories always exist over a specified base category, where the general construction is based on Fa\`a di Bruno's formula. A natural question to ask is, when given an arbitrary Cartesian differential category, how can one check if it is cofree without knowing the base category? In this paper, we provide characterisations of cofree Cartesian differential categories without specifying a base category. The key to these characterisations is, surprisingly, maps whose derivatives are zero, which we call differential constants. One characterisation is in terms of the homsets being complete ultrametric spaces, where the ultrametric is induced by differential constants, which is similar to the metric for power series. Another characterisation is as algebras of a monad. In either characterisation, the base category is the category of differential constants. We also discuss other basic properties of cofree Cartesian differential categories, such as the linear maps, and explain how many well-known Cartesian differential categories (such as polynomial or smooth functions) are not cofree.</description>

      <title>Filter Quotient Model Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The filter quotient construction is a particular instance of a filtered colimit of categories. It has primarily been considered in the context of categorical logic, where it has been used effectively to construct non-trivial models, for example new models of set theory.
  In this work we prove that given a model category and a suitable notion of filter of subterminal objects, the filter quotient construction will preserve the model structure. We also show that this new model structure inherits certain important properties (such as being simplicial or proper), but not all (such as being cofibrantly generated). Finally, we show it is compatible with the construction of filter quotient $\infty$-categories.</description>

      <title>Non-Standard Models of Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homotopy type theory is a modern foundation for mathematics that introduces the univalence axiom and is particularly suitable for the study of homotopical mathematics and its formalization via proof assistants. In order to better comprehend the mathematical implications of homotopy type theory, a variety of models have been constructed and studied. Here a model is understood as a model category with suitable properties implementing the various type theoretical constructors and axioms. A first example is the simplicial model due to Kapulkin--Lumsdaine--Voevodsky. By now, many other models have been constructed, due to work of Arndt, Kapulkin, Lumsdaine, Warren and particularly Shulman, culminating in a proof that every Grothendieck $\infty$-topos can be obtained as the underlying $\infty$-category of a model category that models homotopy type theory.
  In this paper we propose the filter quotient construction as a new method to construct further models of homotopy type theory. Concretely, we prove that with minor assumptions, the filter quotient construction preserves all model categorical properties individually that implement various type theoretical constructors and axioms. On the other hand, the filter quotient construction does not preserve many external properties that are of set theoretical nature, such as cocompleteness, local presentability or cofibrant generation. Combining these, the filter quotient construction preserves models of homotopy type theory and can result in models that have not been considered before and exhibit behaviors that diverge from any of the established models.</description>

      <title>Simplicial Homotopy Type Theory is not just Simplicial: What are $\infty$-Categories?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\infty$-category theory was originally developed in the context of classical homotopy theory using standard set theoretical assumptions, but has since been extended to a variety of mathematical foundations. One such successful effort, primarily due to Martini and Wolf, introduced a theory of $\infty$-categories internal to the foundation of an arbitrary Grothendieck $\infty$-topos, meaning they used categorical foundations. Another approach, due to Riehl and Shulman, developed a theory of $\infty$-categories internal to their own type theory: simplicial homotopy type theory (sHoTT), meaning they employed a (homotopy) type theoretic foundation.
  One aspect of developing a theory of $\infty$-categories in different foundations consists of introducing ways to translate from one foundation to another. Concretely, as part of their work, Riehl and Shulman prove that $\infty$-categories internal to Grothendieck $\infty$-topoi give us categorical models of sHoTT. In fact the name ``simplicial'' in sHoTT suggests that all categorical models of sHoTT should be given by simplicial objects in suitable $\infty$-categories. In this paper we prove that contrary to this expectation, there are models of sHoTT that are not simply simplicial objects. This suggests that in a general foundations, the notion of $\infty$-category is more general than previously assumed.</description>

      <title>Relative singularity categories III: Cluster resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.09733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We build foundations of an approach to study canonical forms of $2$-Calabi--Yau triangulated categories with cluster-tilting objects, using dg algebras and relative singularity categories. This is motivated by cluster theory, singularity categories, Wemyss's Homological Minimal Model Program and the relations between these topics.</description>

      <title>Deformations of homotopy theories via algebraic theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.06801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a homotopical variant of the classic notion of an algebraic theory as a tool for producing deformations of homotopy theories. From this, we extract a framework for constructing and reasoning with obstruction theories and spectral sequences that compute homotopical data starting with purely algebraic data.</description>
