      <title>Meyer-Zheng topology and multi-asset behavioral portfolio selection under transaction costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper addresses a singular control problem, where controls are processes of finite variation, with a focus on portfolio investment under transaction costs. We establish the existence of an optimal strategy in the class of randomized strategies for a range of goal functionals, including cumulative prospect theory preferences, subject to the nonnegativity constraint on the portfolio wealth. Unlike the existing approaches, we employ a metrizable Meyer-Zheng topology. Additionally, we investigate the applicability of the Skorokhod convergence for processes, adapted to a specific filtration. The presented framework provides a clear distinction between constraints imposed on the market model and on the goal functional.</description>

      <title>Neural and Time-Series Approaches for Pricing Weather Derivatives: Performance and Regime Adaptation Using Satellite Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies pricing of weather-derivative (WD) contracts on temperature and precipitation. For temperature-linked strangles in Toronto and Chicago, we benchmark a harmonic-regression/ARMA model against a feed-forward neural network (NN), finding that the NN reduces out-of-sample mean-squared error (MSE) and materially shifts December fair values relative to both the time-series model and the industry-standard Historic Burn Approach (HBA).
  For precipitation, we employ a compound Poisson--Gamma framework: shape and scale parameters are estimated via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and via a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on 30-day rainfall sequences spanning multiple seasons. The CNN adaptively learns season-specific $(\alpha,\beta)$ mappings, thereby capturing heterogeneity across regimes that static i.i.d.\ fits miss. At valuation, we assume days are i.i.d.\ $\Gamma(\hat{\alpha},\hat{\beta})$ within each regime and apply a mean-count approximation (replacing the Poisson count by its mean ($n\hat{\lambda}$) to derive closed-form strangle prices.
  Exploratory analysis of 1981--2023 NASA POWER data confirms pronounced seasonal heterogeneity in $(\alpha,\beta)$ between summer and winter, demonstrating that static global fits are inadequate. Back-testing on Toronto and Chicago grids shows that our regime-adaptive CNN yields competitive valuations and underscores how model choice can shift strangle prices. Payoffs are evaluated analytically when possible and by simulation elsewhere, enabling a like-for-like comparison of forecasting and valuation methods.</description>

      <title>Non-concave stochastic optimal control in finite discrete time under model uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we present a general framework for non-concave robust stochastic control problems under model uncertainty in a discrete time finite horizon setting. Our framework allows to consider a variety of different path-dependent ambiguity sets of probability measures comprising, as a natural example, the ambiguity set defined via Wasserstein-balls around path-dependent reference measures with path-dependent radii, as well as parametric classes of probability distributions. We establish a dynamic programming principle which allows to derive both optimal control and worst-case measure by solving recursively a sequence of one-step optimization problems. Moreover, we derive upper bounds for the difference of the values of the robust and non-robust stochastic control problem in the Wasserstein uncertainty and parameter uncertainty case. As a concrete application, we study the robust hedging problem of financial derivatives under an asymmetric (and non-convex) loss function accounting for different preferences of sell- and buy side when it comes to the hedging of financial derivatives. As our entirely data-driven ambiguity set of probability measures, we consider Wasserstein-balls around the empirical measure derived from real financial data. We demonstrate that during adverse scenarios such as a financial crisis, our robust approach outperforms typical model-based hedging strategies such as the classical Delta-hedging strategy as well as the hedging strategy obtained in the non-robust setting with respect to the empirical measure and therefore overcomes the problem of model misspecification in such critical periods.</description>
