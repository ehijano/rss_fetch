      <title>Multistable Synaptic Plasticity induces Memory Effects and Cohabitation of Chimera and Bump States in Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chimera states and bump states are collective synchronization phenomena observed independently (at different parameter regions) in networks of coupled nonlinear oscillators. And while chimera states are characterized by coexistence of coherent and incoherent domains, bump states consist of active domains operating on a silent background. Multistable plasticity in the network connections originates from brain dynamics and is based on the idea that neural cells may transmit inhibitory or excitatory signals depending on various factors, such as local connectivity, influence of neighboring cells etc. During the system/network integration, the link weights adapt and, in the case of multistability, they may organize in coexisting excitatory and/or inhibitory domains. Here, we explore the influence of bistable plasticity on collective synchronization states and we numerically demonstrate that the dynamics of the linking may give rise to co-existence of bump-like and chimera-like states simultaneously in the network. In the case of bump and chimera co-existence, confinement effects are developed: the different domains stay localized and do not travel around the network. Memory effects are also reported in the sense that the final spatial arrangement of the coupling strengths reflects some of the local properties of the initial link distribution. For the quantification of the system's spatial and temporal features, the global and local entropy functions are employed as measures of the network organization, while the average firing rates account for the network evolution and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Almost-Linear RNNs Yield Highly Interpretable Symbolic Codes in Dynamical Systems Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems (DS) theory is fundamental for many areas of science and engineering. It can provide deep insights into the behavior of systems evolving in time, as typically described by differential or recursive equations. A common approach to facilitate mathematical tractability and interpretability of DS models involves decomposing nonlinear DS into multiple linear DS separated by switching manifolds, i.e. piecewise linear (PWL) systems. PWL models are popular in engineering and a frequent choice in mathematics for analyzing the topological properties of DS. However, hand-crafting such models is tedious and only possible for very low-dimensional scenarios, while inferring them from data usually gives rise to unnecessarily complex representations with very many linear subregions. Here we introduce Almost-Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (AL-RNNs) which automatically and robustly produce most parsimonious PWL representations of DS from time series data, using as few PWL nonlinearities as possible. AL-RNNs can be efficiently trained with any SOTA algorithm for dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR), and naturally give rise to a symbolic encoding of the underlying DS that provably preserves important topological properties. We show that for the Lorenz and R\"ossler systems, AL-RNNs discover, in a purely data-driven way, the known topologically minimal PWL representations of the corresponding chaotic attractors. We further illustrate on two challenging empirical datasets that interpretable symbolic encodings of the dynamics can be achieved, tremendously facilitating mathematical and computational analysis of the underlying systems.</description>

      <title>wavScalogram: an R package with wavelet scalogram tools for time series analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present the wavScalogram R package, which contains methods based on wavelet scalograms for time series analysis. These methods are related to two main wavelet tools: the windowed scalogram difference and the scale index. The windowed scalogram difference compares two time series, identifying if their scalograms follow similar patterns at different scales and times, and it is thus a useful complement to other comparison tools such as the squared wavelet coherence. On the other hand, the scale index provides a numerical estimation of the degree of non-periodicity of a time series and it is widely used in many scientific areas.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric limit cycles within Lorenz chaos induce anomalous mobility for a memory-driven active particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On applying a small bias force, non-equilibrium systems may respond in paradoxical ways such as with giant negative mobility (GNM) -- a large net drift opposite to the applied bias, or giant positive mobility (GPM) -- an anomalously large drift in the same direction as the applied bias. Such behaviors have been extensively studied in idealized models of externally driven passive inertial particles. Here, we consider a minimal model of a memory-driven active particle inspired from experiments with walking and superwalking droplets, whose equation of motion maps to the celebrated Lorenz system. By adding a small bias force to this Lorenz model for the active particle, we uncover a dynamical mechanism for simultaneous emergence of GNM and GPM in the parameter space. Within the chaotic sea of the parameter space, a symmetric pair of coexisting asymmetric limit cycles separate and migrate under applied bias force, resulting in anomalous transport behaviors that are sensitive to the active particle's memory. Our work highlights a general dynamical mechanism for the emergence of anomalous transport behaviors for active particles described by low-dimensional nonlinear models.</description>
