      <title>Biconservative Surfaces in Robertson-Walker Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly focus on space-like PMCV surfaces in Robertson-Walker spacetimes. First, we derive certain geometrical properties of biconservative surfaces in the Robertson-Walker space $L^n_1(f, c)$ of arbitrary dimension. Then, we get complete local classifications of such surfaces in $L^4_1(f,0)$, $L^5_1(f,0)$ and $L^5_1(1,\pm 1)$. Finally, we proved that a space-like PMCV biconservative surface in $L^n_1(f,0)$ lies on a totally geodesic submanifold with dimension $4$ or $5$.</description>

      <title>Positivity properties of the vector bundle Monge-Amp\`ere equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study MA-positivity, a notion of positivity relevant to a vector bundle version of the complex Monge--Amp\`ere equation introduced in an earlier work, and show that for rank-two holomorphic bundles over complex surfaces, MA-semi-positive solutions of the vector bundle Monge--Amp\`ere (vbMA) equation are also MA-positive. For vector bundles of rank-three and higher, over complex manifolds of dimension greater than one, we show that this positivity-preservation property need not hold for an algebraic solution of the vbMA equation treated as a purely algebraic equation at a given point. Finally, we set up a continuity path for certain classes of highly symmetric rank-two vector bundles over complex three-folds and prove a restricted version of positivity preservation which is nevertheless sufficient to prove openness along this continuity path.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a general class of elliptic equations on hypercomplex manifolds which includes the quaternionic Monge-Amp\`ere equation, the quaternionic Hessian equation and the Monge-Amp\`ere equation for quaternionic $(n-1)$-plurisubharmonic functions. We prove that under suitable assumptions the solutions to these equations on hyperk\"ahler manifolds satisfy a $C^{2,\alpha}$ a priori estimate.</description>

Abstract: We provide new type of decay estimate for scalar curvatures of steady gradient Ricci solitons. We also give certain upper bound for the diameter of a Riemannian manifold whose $\infty$-Bakry--Emery Ricci tensor is bounded by some positive constant from below. For the proofs, we use $\mu$-bubbles introduced by Gromov.</description>

      <title>Continuity method for the Mabuchi soliton on the extremal Fano manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We run the continuity method for Mabuchi's generalization of K\"{a}hler-Einstein metrics, assuming the existence of an extremal K\"{a}hler metric. It gives an analytic proof (without minimal model program) of the recent existence result obtained by Apostolov, Lahdili and Nitta. Our key observation is the boundedness of the energy functionals along the continuity method. The same argument can be applied to general $g$-solitons and $g$-extremal metrics.</description>

      <title>Alexandrov sphere theorems for $ W^{2,n} $-hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we extend Alexandrov's sphere theorems for higher-order mean curvature functions to $ W^{2,n} $-regular hypersurfaces under a general degenerate elliptic condition. The proof is based on the extension of the Montiel-Ros argument to the aforementioned class of hypersurfaces and on the existence of suitable Legendrian cycles over them. Using the latter we can also prove that there are $ n $-dimensional Legendrian cycles with $ 2n $-dimensional support, hence answering a question by Rataj and Zaehle. Finally we provide a very general version of the umbilicality theorem for Sobolev-type hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>Revisiting generic mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bamler--Kleiner recently proved a multiplicity-one theorem for mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and combined it with the authors' work on generic mean curvature flows to fully resolve Huisken's genericity conjecture. In this paper we show that a short density-drop theorem plus the Bamler--Kleiner multiplicity-one theorem for tangent flows at the first nongeneric singular time suffice to resolve Huisken's conjecture -- without relying on the strict genus drop theorem for one-sided ancient flows previously established by the authors.</description>

      <title>Cuspidal edges and generalized cuspidal edges in the Lorentz-Minkowski 3-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that every cuspidal edge in the Euclidean space E^3 cannot have a bounded mean curvature function. On the other hand, in the Lorentz-Minkowski space L^3, zero mean curvature surfaces admit cuspidal edges. One natural question is to ask when a cuspidal edge has bounded mean curvature in L^3. We show that such a phenomenon occurs only when the image of the singular set is a light-like curve in L^3. Moreover, we also investigate the behavior of principal curvatures in this case as well as other possible cases. In this paper, almost all calculations are given for generalized cuspidal edges as well as for cuspidal edges. We define the "order" at each generalized cuspidal edge singular point is introduced. As nice classes of zero-mean curvature surfaces in L^3,"maxfaces" and "minfaces" are known, and generalized cuspidal edge singular points on maxfaces and minfaces are of order four. One of the important results is that the generalized cuspidal edges of order four exhibit a quite similar behaviors as those on maxfaces and minfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce bi-slant Riemannian maps from Riemannian manifolds to Kenmotsu manifolds, which are the natural generalizations of invariant, anti-invariant, semi-invariant, slant, semi-slant and hemi-slant Riemannian maps, with nontrivial examples. We study these maps and give some curvature relations for $(rangeF_*)^\perp$. We construct Chen-Ricci inequalities, DDVV inequalities, and further some optimal inequalities involving Casorati curvatures from bi-slant Riemannian manifolds to Kenmotsu space forms.</description>

      <title>A formula for the \alpha-Futaki character</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alvarez-Consul--Garcia-Fernandez--Garcia-Prada introduced the K\"ahler-Yang-Mills equations. They also introduced the $\alpha$-Futaki character, an analog of the Futaki invariant, as an obstruction to the existence of the K\"ahler-Yang-Mills equations. The equations depend on a coupling constant $\alpha$. Solutions of these equations with coupling constant $\alpha&gt;0$ are of utmost importance. In this paper, we provide a formula for the $\alpha$-Futaki character on certain ample line bundles over toric manifolds. We then show that there are no solutions with $\alpha&gt;0$ on certain ample line bundles over certain toric manifolds and compute the value of $\alpha$ if a solution exists. We also relate our result to the existence result of Keller-Friedman in dimension-two.</description>

      <title>Semiholonomic jets and induced modules in Cartan geometry calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous Erlangen Programme was coined by Felix Klein in 1872 as an algebraic approach allowing to incorporate fixed symmetry groups as the core ingredient for geometric analysis, seeing the chosen symmetries as intrinsic invariance of all objects and tools. This idea was broadened essentially by Elie Cartan in the beginning of the last century, and we may consider (curved) geometries as modelled over certain (flat) Klein's models. The aim of this short survey is to explain carefully the basic concepts and algebraic tools built over several recent decades. We focus on the direct link between the jets of sections of homogeneous bundles and the associated induced modules, allowing us to understand the overall structure of invariant linear differential operators in purely algebraic terms. This allows us to extend essential parts of the concepts and procedures to the curved cases.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a generalized complex (GC) Stein manifold and provide complete characterizations in three fundamental aspects. First, we extend Cartan's Theorem A and B within the framework of GC geometry. Next, we define $L$-plurisubharmonic functions and develop an associated $L^2$ theory. This leads to a characterization of GC Stein manifolds using $L$-plurisubharmonic exhaustion functions. Finally, we establish the existence of a proper GH embedding from any GC Stein manifold into $\mathbb{R}^{2n-2k} \times \mathbb{C}^{2k+1}$, where $2n$ and $k$ denote the dimension and type of the GC Stein manifold, respectively. This provides a characterization of GC Stein manifolds via GH embeddings. Several examples of GC Stein manifolds are given.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we describe the geography of the Teichm\"uller stack of \cite{LMStacks} and of one of its variants we introduce here, giving some answers to questions as: which points are orbifold points? What are the different local models of special points?... We give a rough description in the general case, and we use the compacity of the cycle spaces to get a much more detailed picture in the K\"ahler setting.</description>

      <title>Difference Equations: from Berry Connections to the Coulomb Branch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work, we demonstrated that a spectral variety for the Berry connection of a 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ GLSM with K\"ahler vacuum moduli space $X$ and abelian flavour symmetry is the support of a sheaf induced by a certain action on the equivariant quantum cohomology of $X$. This action could be quantised to first-order matrix difference equations obeyed by brane amplitudes, and by taking the conformal limit, vortex partition functions. In this article, we elucidate how some of these results may be recovered from a 3d perspective, by placing the 2d theory at a boundary and gauging the flavour symmetry via a bulk A-twisted 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theory (a sandwich construction). We interpret the above action as that of the bulk Coulomb branch algebra on boundary twisted chiral operators. This relates our work to recent constructions of actions of Coulomb branch algebras on quantum equivariant cohomology, providing a novel correspondence between these actions and spectral data of generalised periodic monopoles. The effective IR description of the 2d theory in terms of a twisted superpotential allows for explicit computations of these actions, which we demonstrate for abelian GLSMs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article shows that the approach to generalised curvature and torsion pioneered by Polacek and Siegel [1] is a generalisation of Cartan Geometry -- rendering latter natural from the point of view of O(d,d)-generalised geometry. We present this approach in the generalised metric formalism and show that almost all parts of the additional higher generalised tensors appearing in this approach correspond to covariant derivatives of the generalised Riemann tensor.

      <title>Allard-type regularity theory for area minimizing currents at boundaries with arbitrary multiplicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is an announcement of a series of upcoming works on boundary regularity for area minimizing currents, one of which is in collaboration with Reinaldo Resende. The setting we consider is that of an area minimizing current with a smooth boundary taken with arbitrary multiplicity. The main result is a generalization of Allard's boundary regularity theorem from which we derive important structural consequences.</description>

      <title>Landau-Ginzburg models, Monge-Ampere domains and (pre-)Frobenius manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kontsevich suggested that the Landau-Ginzburg model presents a good formalism for homological mirror symmetry. In this paper we propose to investigate the LG theory from the viewpoint of Koopman-von Neumann's construction. New advances are thus provided, namely regarding a conjecture of Kontsevich--Soibelman (on a version of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow mirror problem). We show that there exists a Monge--Ampere domain Y, generated by a space of probability densities parametrising mirror dual Calabi-Yau manifolds. This provides torus fibrations over Y. The mirror pairs are obtained via the Berglund-Hubsch-Krawitz construction. We also show that the Monge-Ampere manifolds are pre-Frobenius manifolds. Our method allows to recover certain results concerning Lagrangian torus fibrations. We illustrate our construction on a concrete toy model, which allows us, additionally to deduce a relation between von Neumann algebras,, Monge--Ampere manifolds and pre-Frobenius manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a closed, connected and orientable Riemannian manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature. Consider a Lagrangian $L(x,v):TM\to\R$ defined by $L(x,v):=\frac 12g_x(v,v)-\omega(v)+c$, where $c\in\R$ and $\omega$ is a closed 1-form. From the perspective of differential geometry, we estimate the Laplacian of the weak KAM solution $u$ to the associated Hamilton-Jacobi equation $H(x,du)=c[L]$ in the barrier sense. This analysis enables us to prove that each weak KAM solution $u$ is constant if and only if $\omega$ is a harmonic 1-form. Furthermore, we explore several applications to the Mather quotient and Ma\~n\'e's Lagrangian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend two celebrated inequalities by Busemann -- the random simplex inequality and the intersection inequality -- to both complex and quaternionic vector spaces. Our proof leverages a monotonicity property under symmetrization with respect to complex or quaternionic hyperplanes. Notably, we demonstrate that the standard Steiner symmetrization, contrary to assertions in a paper by Grinberg, does not exhibit this monotonicity property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two tensor fields of type (1,1) on a smooth n-dimensional manifold M, such that all their Fr\"olicher-Nijenhuis brackets vanish, the algebra of differential forms on M becomes a bi-differential graded algebra. As a consequence, there are partial differential equation (PDE) systems associated with it, which arise as the integrability condition of a system of linear equations and possess a binary Darboux transformation to generate exact solutions. We recover chiral models and potential forms of the self-dual Yang-Mills, as well as corresponding generalizations to higher than four dimensions, and obtain new integrable non-autonomous nonlinear matrix PDEs and corresponding systems.</description>

      <title>A Note On Projective Structures On Compact Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Projective structures on topological surfaces support the structure of 2d CFTs with a degree of technical simplification. Arguments for their existence are reviewed along with their essential properties. We propose a complex analytic manifold $\mathcal{P}_g$ biholomorphic to $T^*_{(1,0)} \mathcal{M}_g$ as a pseudo moduli space of the projective structures of the genus $g$ topological surface. Explicit computations at $g=1$ including the analysis of transformations under the modular group support this proposal, and show that $\mathcal{P}_{g=1}$ naturally resolves the orbifold locus of the affine structure moduli space. For $g \geq 2$, whether $\mathcal{P}_g$ contains redundancy at each value of the complex structure moduli remains open.
  Physically, the space $\mathcal{P}_g$ represents the bundle of universal, stationary, chiral hydrodynamic flows spatially confined to compact genus-$g$ Riemann surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.03978v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that Calabi-Yau metrics on compact Calabi-Yau manifolds whose Kahler classes shrink the fibers of a holomorphic fibration have a priori estimates of all orders away from the singular fibers. To this end we prove an asymptotic expansion of these metrics in terms of powers of the fiber diameter, with k-th order remainders that satisfy uniform C^k-estimates with respect to a collapsing family of background metrics. The constants in these estimates are uniform not only in the sense that they are independent of the fiber diameter, but also in the sense that they only depend on the constant in the estimate for k=0 known from previous work of the second-named author. For k&gt;0 the new estimates are proved by blowup and contradiction, and each additional term of the expansion arises as the obstruction to proving a uniform bound on one additional derivative of the remainder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.03582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the set of curvature functions which a given compact manifold with boundary can possess. First, we prove that the sign demanded by the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem is a necessary and sufficient condition for a given function to be the geodesic curvature or the Gaussian curvature of some conformally equivalent metric. Our approach allows us to solve problems that are impossible to solve in the pointwise conformal case. Moreover, we obtain a deep and more delicate information on pointwise conformal deformations. We prove new existence and nonexistence results for metrics with prescribed curvature in the conformal setting, which depend on the Euler characteristic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.09208v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We endow the Banach-Lie structure group $Str(V)$ of an infinite dimensional JB-algebra $V$ with a left-invariant connection and Finsler metric, and we compute all the quantities of its connection. We show how this connection reduces to $G(\Omega)$, the group of transformations that preserve the positive cone $\Omega$ of the algebra $V$, and to $Aut(V)$, the group of Jordan automorphisms of the algebra. We present the cone $\Omega$ as an homogeneous space for the action of $G(\Omega)$, therefore inducing a quotient Finsler metric and distance. With the techniques introduced, we prove the minimality of the one-parameter groups in $\Omega$ for any symmetric gauge norm in $V$. We establish that the two presentations of the Finsler metric in $\Omega$ give the same distance there, which helps us prove the minimality of certain paths in $G(\Omega)$ for its left-invariant Finsler metric.</description>

We generalise Connes's tangent groupoid, by constructing a completion of the space $M\times M\times \mathbb{R}_+^\times$ using the sub-Riemannian metric. We use our space to calculate all the tangent cones of the sub-Riemannian metric in the sense of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance. This generalises a result of Bella\"iche.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish an equivalence between force-free fields and conformally geodesic fields, and between harmonic fields and conformally eikonal fields in the context of conformal geometry. In contrast to previous work, our approach and equivalence results generalize to arbitrary dimensions. In accordance with three-dimensional theory, our defining equations emerge as the Euler-Lagrange equations of hierarchies of variational principles - distinguished by the topological constraints they impose - and retain the known inclusions of the special cases from each other. Specifically, we relate stationary points of hierarchies of $L^2$ resp. $L^1$-optimization problems by a conformal change of metric, provide an explicit construction of the conformal factors relating the relevant metrics and identify the field lines of physical vector fields fields as conformal geodesics. Despite the allowed topological complexity of the fields under consideration, these observations reveal geometric order which is obtained by merely pointwise rescaling of the metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we consider diffeomorphism groups of manifolds with smooth boundary. We show that the diffeomorphism groups of the manifold and its boundary fit into a short exact sequence which admits local sections. In other words, they form an infinite-dimensional fibre bundle. Manifolds with boundary are of interest in numerical analysis and with a view towards applications in machine learning we establish controllability results for families of vector fields. This generalises older results due to Agrachev and Caponigro in the boundary-less case. Our results show in particular that the diffeomorphism group of a manifold with smooth boundary is generated by the image of the exponential map.</description>

      <title>First Eigenvalue Estimates for Asymptotically Hyperbolic Manifolds and their Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a sharp upper bound for the first eigenvalue $\lambda_{1,p}$ of the $p$-Laplacian on asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. We then prove that a particular class of conformally compact submanifolds within asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds are themselves asymptotically hyperbolic. As a corollary, we show that for any minimal conformally compact submanifold $Y^{k+1}$ within $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}(-1)$, $\lambda_{1,p}(Y)=\left(\frac{k}{p}\right)^{p}$. We then obtain lower bounds on $\lambda_{1,2}(Y)$ in the case where minimality is replaced with a bounded mean curvature assumption and where the ambient space is a general Poincar\'e-Einstein space whose conformal infinity is of non-negative Yamabe type. In the process, we introduce an invariant $\hat \beta^Y$ for each such submanifold, enabling us to generalize a result due to Cheung-Leung.</description>

Abstract: This paper contains corrections to Madea, Rosenberg, Torres-Ardila, "The Geometry of Loop Spaces II: Characteristic Classes," Advances in Math. (287), 2016, 485-518. The main change is that results about $\pi_1({\rm Diff}(M))$ are replaced by results about $\pi_1({\rm Isom}(M))$, where Diff$(M)$, Isom$(M)$ refer to the diffeomorphism and isometry group of the manifold $M$.</description>

      <title>Recent advances in branching problems of representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.00642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How does an irreducible representation of a group behave when restricted to a subgroup? This is part of branching problems, which are one of the fundamental problems in representation theory, and also interact naturally with other fields of mathematics.
  This expository paper is an up-to-date account on some new directions in representation theory highlighting the branching problems for real reductive groups and their related topics ranging from global analysis of manifolds via group actions to the theory of discontinuous groups beyond the classical Riemannian setting.
  This article is an outgrowth of the invited lecture that the author delivered at the commemorative event for the 70th anniversary of the re-establishment of the Mathematical Society of Japan, and originally appeared in Japanese in Sugaku 71 (2019).</description>

      <title>Retrieving Yang--Mills--Higgs fields in Minkowski space from active local measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.12776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that we can retrieve a Yang--Mills potential and a Higgs field (up to gauge) from source-to-solution type data associated with the classical Yang--Mills--Higgs equations in Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$. We impose natural non-degeneracy conditions on the representation for the Higgs field and on the Lie algebra of the structure group which are satisfied for the case of the Standard Model. Our approach exploits the non-linear interaction of waves generated by sources with values in the centre of the Lie algebra showing that abelian components can be used effectively to recover the Higgs field.</description>

      <title>Random Surfaces and Higher Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The space of surfaces $\mathbf{X}: [0,1]^2 \to \mathbb{R}^d$ is equipped with natural horizontal and vertical concatenation operations, and we study representations of surfaces which preserve this algebraic structure. The framework of higher category theory allows us to formalize this notion in terms of a functor between double groupoids. We construct such functors by generalizing the classical concept of the path-ordered exponential as a nonabelian path integral. This generalization yields a notion of nonabelian surface integration, and is known in higher gauge theory as surface holonomy (or higher parallel transport). We extend these constructions from smooth surfaces to bounded controlled $p$-variation surfaces in the Young regime, with $p &lt; 2$. By focusing on surface holonomy valued in higher generalizations of the classical matrix groups, called matrix double groups, we obtain explicit computations for piecewise linear approximations. Furthermore, we generalize the nonabelian Stokes' and Fubini theorems to the Young regime. Finally, we use these matrix surface holonomy functors to construct characteristic functions for random surfaces such as fractional Brownian sheets with Hurst parameter $h&gt; \frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>A groupoid approach to the Wodzicki residue and the Kontsevich-Vishik trace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on the work of Debord and Skandalis, van Erp and Yuncken introduced a groupoid approach to pseudo-differential operators which has various advantages over the classical approach using H\"ormander's symbolic calculus. In a recent work by Couchet and Yuncken, they showed that for pseudo-differential operators of order $-\dim(M)$ acting on a smooth manifold $M$ the Wodzicki residue can be naturally obtained from van Erp and Yuncken's approach. In this short note, we extend their work to pseudo-differential operators of any order. We also give a description of the Kontsevich-Vishik trace.</description>

      <title>Symmetries in Riemann-Cartan Geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Riemann-Cartan geometries are geometries that admit non-zero curvature and torsion tensors. These geometries have been investigated as geometric frameworks for potential theories in physics including quantum gravity theories and have many important differences when compared to Riemannian geometries. One notable difference, is the number of symmetries for a Riemann-Cartan geometry is potentially smaller than the number of Killing vector fields for the metric. In this paper, we will review the investigation of symmetries in Riemann-Cartan geometries and the mathematical tools used to determine geometries that admit a given group of symmetries. As an illustration, we present new results by determining all static spherically symmetric and all stationary spherically symmetric Riemann-Cartan geometries. Furthermore, we have determined the subclasses of spherically symmetric Riemann-Cartan geometries that admit a seven-dimensional group of symmetries.</description>

Abstract: The momentum ray transform $I_m^k$ integrates a rank $m$ symmetric tensor field $f$ on $\mathbb R^n$ over lines with the weight $t^k$, $I_m^kf(x,\xi)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty t^k\langle f(x+t\xi),\xi^m\rangle\,\mathrm{d}t$. We compute the normal operator $N_m^k=(I_m^k){}^*I_m^k$ and present an inversion formula recovering a rank $m$ tensor field $f$ from the data $(N_m^0f,\dots,N_m^mf)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10562v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2005 Lorenzoni and Magri showed that a hydrodynamic-type hierarchy determined by the powers of a type (1,1) tensor field (on a smooth manifold) with vanishing Nijenhuis torsion can be deformed to a more general hierarchy, with the help of a chain of conservation laws of the new hierarchy. We review this construction. The (1,1) tensor fields of the resulting hierarchy have non-vanishing Nijenhuis torsion, in general, but their Haantjes tensor vanishes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a broad class of fully nonlinear elliptic equations on Hermitian manifolds. On one hand, under the optimal structural assumptions we derive $C^{2,\alpha}$-estimate for solutions of the equations on closed Hermitian manifolds. On the other hand, we treat the Dirichlet problem. In both cases, we prove the existence theorems with unbounded condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an algebro-geometric or non-archimedean framework to study bubbling phenomena of Kahler metrics with Euclidean volume growth, after [DS17, Sun23, dBS23]. In particular, for any degenerating family to log terminal singularity, we algebraically construct a finite sequence of birational modifications of the family with milder degenerations, and compare with analytic bubbling constructions in loc.cit. We also provide approaches in terms of coordinates and valuations. Our discussion partially depends on the general framework of stability theory in our [Od24b] (arXiv:2406.02489) after [HL14, AHLH23].</description>

      <title>Circle Foliations Revisited: Periods of Flows whose Orbits are all Closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our purpose here is to adapt the results of Geodesic circle foliations for Reeb flows or Hamiltonian flows on contact manifolds. Consequently, all periods are exactly the same if the contact manifold is connected and all orbits on the contact manifold are closed. We also present concrete examples of periodic flows, all of whose orbits are closed, such as Harmonic oscillators, Lotka-Volterra systems, and others. Lotka-Volterra systems, Reeb flows, and some geodesic flows have non-trivial periods, whereas the periods of Harmonic oscillators and similar systems can be easily obtained through direct calculations. As an application to quantum mechanics, we examine the spectrum of semiclassical Shr\"odinger operators. Then we have one of the semiclassical analogies of the Helton-Guillemin theorem.</description>
