      <title>New approach for the quantification of uncertainties in reaction modeling via data-driven multi-objective optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new multi-objective optimization approach to determine uncertainty-quantified nuclear reaction parameters in the Hauser-Feshbach framework. By simultaneously accounting for all available data across multiple reaction channels we capture parameter correlations and estimate data-driven uncertainties. We implement in the Ni-Ge region yielding uncertainty-quantified model parameters for both stable and unstable isotopes. We estimate resonance spacings for nuclei beyond experimental reach and validate our method by calculating a known cross-section outside our optimization region.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic instabilities in quarkyonic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic properties of quarkyonic matter, which naturally bridges nuclear and quark matter at intermediate densities relevant to neutron star cores. We extend the quarkyonic model to include spin polarization, where nucleons near the Fermi surface can be polarized while quarks in the deep Fermi sea remain unpolarized due to strong Pauli blocking. After including neutron interactions with spin-dependent terms, we find that quarkyonic matter can develop ferromagnetic instabilities at low densities, characterized by negative magnetic susceptibility. This ferromagnetic behavior occurs in pure neutron matter, independent of proton contributions, and results from the competition between attractive spin-dependent interactions and kinetic energy costs. The system returns to paramagnetic behavior at higher densities when Pauli pressure dominates. Our results demonstrate that the splitting of Fermi momenta of quarkyonic matter produces fundamentally different magnetic responses compared to conventional nuclear matter, with important implications for neutron star magnetism and magnetar physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a class of NJL-like models fails to reproduce the expected conformal limit of the speed of sound, making them unsuitable for analyzing the equation of state of dense matter. We then demonstrate how this issue can be resolved within a simple dynamical quark model.</description>

      <title>Does HESS J1731-347 have a thick crust ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A relativistic mean-field model with a crossing term of isovector-scalar and isoscalar mesons, the Cracow crossing terms (CCT) model, has previously been shown to be capable of explaining the light and compact object HESS J1731-347. Here, the model is supplemented with a correct treatment of the phase transition. Applying the thermodynamically consistent Gibbs conditions shows that a mixed-phase system occurs in the core of the neutron star over a wide range of densities, extending up to the neutron star crust, leading to an intriguing stellar structure with a thick and massive crust.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Unfolding in Large Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose new methodologies in multi-dimensional unfolding in dense environments, and show that incorporating auxiliary observables can significantly improve performance. Our approach builds on the ML-based OmniFold algorithm, which we extend to account for background, detector acceptance, efficiency, and uncertainties, enabling its application in high-luminosity and heavy-ion collision settings. We derive this algorithm and demonstrate its mathematical and numerical equivalence to expectation-maximization and Iterative Bayesian Unfolding (IBU). We illustrate our method with a realistic jet substructure analysis incorporating both large background and detector simulation. Our analysis includes up to 18 observables, leading to significantly improved performance in the unfolding. We propose a method that integrates calibration and unfolding into a single, consistent framework, and demonstrate enhanced performance relative to traditional methods. These developments lay the groundwork for robust, high-dimensional, ML-based unfolding and calibration in complex collider environments across a wide range of analyses.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry breaking and pion condensation in the early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the possible trajectories the universe may have followed in the QCD phase diagram during the QCD epoch. We focus on the roles of chiral symmetry breaking and pion condensation under high imbalances in lepton asymmetry. Adopting the quark-meson model as an effective description of QCD at finite temperature, charge and baryon chemical potentials we show that, for sufficiently large but physically motivated asymmetries, the universe may have entered the pion condensation phase through a first-order phase transition, followed by a second-order phase transition when exiting it. Such a first-order phase transition represents a new possible source of primordial gravitational waves during the QCD epoch.</description>

      <title>Two-flavor color superconductivity in a general Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with color and charge neutrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using a general NJL model including as many interaction channels as possible, and taking into account the constraints imposed by color and charge neutrality, we analyze how the different interaction channels contribute to the charge-neutral two-flavor color-superconducting matter. After taking the Fierz transformation, the number of parameters in the NJL model is reduced and thereby quark-antiquark condensates and diquark condensates are related. Through a self-consistent solution of the gap equations, we find that in addition to the diquark and vector channels, the scalar-isovector, vector-isovector, and vector-isovector-color-octet channels are also important, while other channels can be neglected. Moreover, between the normal quark matter phase and two-flavor color-superconducting phase, there is a gapless two-flavor color-superconducting phase. The fractions of quarks with different flavors and colors are calculated in both gaped and gapless two-flavor color-superconducting phases. In addition, We illustrate the phase diagrams in the diquark coupling and chemical potential plane, and discuss in detail how the dominant channels influence these phase diagrams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transition between weak and strong coupling in thermal ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory as a function of 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$ for several quantities of phenomenological interest for which next-to-leading order calculations are available in both regimes. We use Pad\'e approximants to interpolate between the weak and strong coupling expansions and determine the location and width of the transition between the asymptotic regimes.</description>

Abstract: We perform a precision study of radii in Boron isotopes for multiple realistic interactions from chiral effective field theory. We obtain predictions of radii with combined many-body and interaction uncertainty quantification from ab initio no-core shell model calculations together with machine learning extrapolation methods. An extension to radius differences further allows us to investigate a potential proton halo in $^{8}$B and, moreover, provide predictions that relate directly to the isotope shift, which can be precisely measured in experiments.</description>

      <title>Giving wake to energy-energy correlators: Hydrodynamic response on the celestial sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observation of the medium response generated by the propagation of high energy partons in the quark gluon plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions would provide a clear and unmistakable evidence for the hydrodynamic behavior of the bulk. Recently, it has been argued that the features of the medium's back-reaction to the jet could be cleanly imprinted in the correlations of asymptotic energy flows, in principle allowing to isolate this signal from other uncorrelated physical processes. Nonetheless, the current limited theoretical understanding of these jet observables in heavy-ion collisions constrains their applicability as probes of the medium (hydro)dynamics. In this work, we provide an analytic picture for the medium back-reaction's effect on the energy flux and two point energy correlator. We show that the medium response leads to the emergence of an universal classical scaling law, competing with the perturbative QCD contribution at large angles. Comparing the associated correlator to recent experimental measurements, we find that the observed large angle features can be qualitatively described by a purely hydrodynamically driven response and its interplay with the hard jet component.</description>

      <title>Confined Monopoles in Chiral Bag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chiral bag model offers a dual description of hadron physics in terms of quarks and hadrons in the sense of Cheshire Cat principle. In this work, we find that, within the chiral bag, confinement is likely caused by monopole condensation. The chiral bag surface can be interpreted as an $\eta'$ domain wall, where a dynamical Chern-Simons theory emerges. Under level-rank duality, the Chern-Simons theory serves as the counterterm introduced to block the so-called color charge leakage. To ensure the correct net baryon number of the full chiral bag, an additional Chern-Simons theory involving the vector meson field arises on the bag surface and extends outside the bag. This leads to a Chern-Simons-Higgs theory localized on the $\eta'$ domain wall, as previously conjectured. We also propose that the skyrmion description of baryons could be understood as a system of monopoles enveloped by a meson cloud.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative heavy quark diffusion coefficients in a weakly magnetized thermal QCD medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02284v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, the perturbative and non-perturbative contributions to the heavy quark (HQ) momentum ($\kappa$) as well as spatial ($D_s$) diffusion coefficients are computed in a weak background magnetic field. The formalism adopted here involves calculation of the in-medium potential of the HQ in a weak magnetic field, which then serves as a proxy for the resummed gluon propagator in the calculation of HQ self-energy ($\Sigma$). The self-energy determines the scattering rate of HQs with light thermal partons, which is subsequently used to evaluate $\kappa$ and $D_s$. It is observed that non-perturbative effects play a dominant role at low temperature. The spatial diffusion coefficient $2\pi T D_s$, exhibits good agreement with recent LQCD results. These findings can be applied to calculate the heavy quark directed flow at RHIC and LHC energies. An extension of this formalism to the case of finite HQ momentum has also been attempted.</description>

      <title>Interface modes in inspiralling neutron stars: A gravitational-wave probe of first-order phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the extreme densities in neutron stars, a phase transition to deconfined quark matter is anticipated. Yet masses, radii and tidal deformabilities offer only indirect measures of a first-order phase transition, requiring many detections to resolve or being ineffective observables if the discontinuity exists at lower densities. We report on a smoking-gun gravitational-wave signature of a first-order transition: the resonant tidal excitation of an interface mode. Using relativistic perturbation theory with an equation-of-state family informed by chiral effective field theory, we show that such a resonance may be detectable with next-generation interferometers and possibly already with LIGO A+ for sufficiently loud events.</description>

      <title>Dependence of postmerger properties on the thermal heating efficiency in neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically perform numerical-relativity simulations for equal-mass binary neutron star mergers for the models varying the thermal index $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ with three different equations of state (EOSs) of the neutron stars (NSs), which are consistent with current multimessenger observational data and state-of-the-art theoretical calculations, and two different binary total mass ($m_0=2.7\ \text{and}\ 2.9~M_\odot$). By varying the value of $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ within the hybrid EOS framework, we investigate the thermal effects on the merger dynamics, gravitational waves (GWs), and the dynamical mass ejection process. We find that the choice of the constant $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ can change the outcome of the remnant for specific EOSs and $m_0$. We also show that the dynamical ejecta mass is affected by the $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ value in a different way for different EOSs: for a stiff EOS the ejecta mass is high when $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ is small, while for softer EOSs the largest ejecta is achieved when $\Gamma_{\rm th} = 1.3$--$1.4$. While the inspiral motion does not depend on the $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ value, the postmerger phase evolution is highly affected by that. We show that the dominant peak frequency $f_2$ of the postmerger GW spectrum monotonically decreases as the $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ increases. We find that the universal relations between NS macroscopic properties and postmerger GW frequencies are subject to non-negligible thermal uncertainties, which can obscure the universal relation between the tidal deformability and $f_2$.</description>

      <title>Entanglement, Trace Anomaly and Confinement in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate confinement in QCD as an entropic surface phenomenon. Quark and gluon quantum information is localized on a two-dimensional transverse sheet of radius $R_{\mathrm{EE}}$; at this radius the QCD vacuum -- partitioned by a hadron into interior and exterior regions -- reaches its maximal entanglement entropy. Lattice QCD determinations of scalar (trace) gravitational form factors of hadrons fix both $R_{\mathrm{EE}}$ and the transverse trace-anomaly density $\rho_h(R_{\mathrm{EE}})$ with percent-level accuracy, enabling a parameter-free mechanical entropy $S_{\mathrm{EE}}(y)=c_h\,y$ growing linearly with rapidity $y$. The associated entropy gradient changes sign at $R_{\mathrm{EE}}$: it repels color fields for $r&lt;R_{\mathrm{EE}}$ and attracts them for $r&gt;R_{\mathrm{EE}}$, trapping partons at all scales -- UV and IR -- in contrast to Wilson's area law, which probes only long distances. Squaring the entropy density, as required by unitarity, yields $\sigma\propto y^{\delta}$. World data demand $\delta=2$ for elastic $pp\,(p\bar p)$ scattering and heavy-quark photoproduction, but a softer $\delta=0.387$ for $\phi$ photoproduction, all two orders of magnitude below the Froissart--Martin bound. These results provide the first confinement criterion derived directly from nonperturbative QCD, unifying the trace anomaly, entanglement entropy, and high-energy scattering within a single quantitative framework.</description>
