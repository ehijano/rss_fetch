      <title>A quantum random access memory (QRAM) using a polynomial encoding of binary strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms claim significant speedup over their classical counterparts for solving many problems. An important aspect of many of these algorithms is the existence of a quantum oracle, which needs to be implemented efficiently in order to realize the claimed advantages. A quantum random access memory (QRAM) is a promising architecture for realizing these oracles. In this paper we develop a new design for QRAM and implement it with Clifford+T circuit. We focus on optimizing the T-count and T-depth since non-Clifford gates are the most expensive to implement fault-tolerantly. Integral to our design is a polynomial encoding of bit strings and so we refer to this design as $\text{QRAM}_{poly}$. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art bucket brigade architecture for QRAM, we achieve an exponential improvement in T-depth, while reducing T-count and keeping the qubit count same. Specifically, if $N$ is the number of memory locations, then $\text{QRAM}_{poly}$ has T-depth $O(\log\log N)$, T-count $O(N-\log N)$ and qubit count $O(N)$, while the bucket brigade circuit has T-depth $O(\log N)$, T-count $O(N)$ and qubit count $O(N)$. Combining two $\text{QRAM}_{poly}$ we design a quantum look-up-table, $\text{qLUT}_{poly}$, that has T-depth $O(\log\log N)$, T-count $O(\sqrt{N})$ and qubit count $O(\sqrt{N})$. A qLUT or quantum read-only memory (QROM) has restricted functionality than a QRAM and needs to be compiled each time the contents of the memory change. The previous state-of-the-art CSWAP architecture has T-depth $O(\sqrt{N})$, T-count $O(\sqrt{N})$ and qubit count $O(\sqrt{N})$. Thus we achieve a double exponential improvement in T-depth while keeping the T-count and qubit-count asymptotically same. Additionally, with our polynomial encoding of bit strings, we develop a method to optimize the Toffoli-count of circuits, specially those consisting of multi-controlled-NOT gates.</description>

      <title>Block encoding by signal processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Block Encoding (BE) is a crucial subroutine in many modern quantum algorithms, including those with near-optimal scaling for simulating quantum many-body systems, which often rely on Quantum Signal Processing (QSP). Currently, the primary methods for constructing BEs are the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) and the sparse oracle approach. In this work, we demonstrate that QSP-based techniques, such as Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) and Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation for Unitary Matrices (QETU), can themselves be efficiently utilized for BE implementation. Specifically, we present several examples of using QSVT and QETU algorithms, along with their combinations, to block encode Hamiltonians for lattice bosons, an essential ingredient in simulations of high-energy physics. We also introduce a straightforward approach to BE based on the exact implementation of Linear Operators Via Exponentiation and LCU (LOVE-LCU). We find that, while using QSVT for BE results in the best asymptotic gate count scaling with the number of qubits per site, LOVE-LCU outperforms all other methods for operators acting on up to $\lesssim11$ qubits, highlighting the importance of concrete circuit constructions over mere comparisons of asymptotic scalings. Using LOVE-LCU to implement the BE, we simulate the time evolution of single-site and two-site systems in the lattice $\varphi^4$ theory using the Generalized QSP algorithm and compare the gate counts to those required for Trotter simulation.</description>

      <title>Physical Security of Chip-Based Quantum Key Distribution Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The security proofs of the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols make certain assumptions about the operations of physical systems. Thus, appropriate modelling of devices to ensure that their operations are consistent with the models assumed in the security proof is imperative. In this paper, we explore the Trojan horse attack (THA) using Measurement Device Independent (MDI) QKD integrated photonic chips and how to avoid some of the security vulnerabilities using only on-chip components. We show that a monitor photodiode paired appropriately with enough optical isolation, given the sensitivity of the photodiode, can detect high power sniffing attacks. We also show that the placement of amplitude modulators with respect to back reflecting components and their switching time can be used to thwart a THA.</description>

      <title>Anomalous multi-gap topological phases in periodically driven quantum rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that periodically driven quantum rotors provide a promising and broadly applicable platform to implement multi-gap topological phases, where groups of bands can acquire topological invariants due to non-Abelian braiding of band degeneracies. By adiabatically varying the periodic kicks to the rotor we find nodal-line braiding, which causes sign flips of topological charges of band nodes and can prevent them from annihilating, indicated by non-zero values of the %non-Abelian patch Euler class. In particular, we report on the emergence of an anomalous Dirac string phase arising in the strongly driven regime, a truly out-of-equilibrium phase of the quantum rotor. This phase emanates from braiding processes involving all (quasienergy) gaps and manifests itself with edge states at zero angular momentum. Our results reveal direct applications in state-of-the-art experiments of quantum rotors, such as linear molecules driven by periodic far-off-resonant laser pulses or artificial quantum rotors in optical lattices, whose extensive versatility offers precise modification and observation of novel non-Abelian topological properties.</description>

      <title>Experimental measurement and a physical interpretation of quantum shadow enumerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Throughout its history, the theory of quantum error correction has heavily benefited from translating classical concepts into the quantum setting. In particular, classical notions of weight enumerators, which relate to the performance of an error-correcting code, and MacWilliams' identity, which helps to compute enumerators, have been generalized to the quantum case. In this work, we establish a distinct relationship between the theoretical machinery of quantum weight enumerators and a seemingly unrelated physics experiment: we prove that Rains' quantum shadow enumerators - a powerful mathematical tool - arise as probabilities of observing fixed numbers of triplets in a Bell sampling experiment. This insight allows us to develop here a rigorous framework for the direct measurement of quantum weight enumerators, thus enabling experimental and theoretical studies of the entanglement structure of any quantum error-correcting code or state under investigation. On top of that, we derive concrete sample complexity bounds and physically-motivated robustness guarantees against unavoidable experimental imperfections. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the possibility of directly measuring weight enumerators on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Our experimental findings are in good agreement with theoretical predictions and illuminate how entanglement theory and quantum error correction can cross-fertilize each other once Bell sampling experiments are combined with the theoretical machinery of quantum weight enumerators.</description>

      <title>Rapid, in-situ neutralization of nitrogen- and silicon-vacancy centers in diamond using above-band-gap optical excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charge state of a quantum point defect in a solid state host strongly determines its optical and spin characteristics. Consequently, techniques for controlling the charge state are required to realize technologies such as quantum networking and sensing. In this work we demonstrate the use of deep-ultraviolet (DUV) radiation to dynamically neutralize nitrogen- (NV) and silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers. We first examine the conversion between the neutral and negatively charged NV states by correlating the variation of their respective spectra, indicating that more than 99% of the population of NV centers can be initialized into the neutral charge state. We then examine the time dynamics of bleaching and recharging of negatively charged SiV$^-$ centers and observe an 80% reduction in SiV$^-$ photoluminescence within a single 100-$\mu$s DUV pulse. Finally we demonstrate that the bleaching of SiV$^-$ induced by the DUV is accompanied by a dramatic increase in the neutral SiV$^0$ population; SiV$^0$ remains robust to extended periods of near-infrared excitation despite being a non-equilibrium state. DUV excitation thus presents a reliable method of generating SiV$^0$, a desirable charge state for quantum network applications that is challenging to obtain by equilibrium Fermi engineering alone. Our results on two separate color centers at technologically relevant temperatures indicate a potential for above-band-gap excitation as a universal means of generating the neutral charge states of quantum point defects on demand.</description>

      <title>AI-driven Reverse Engineering of QML Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a rapidly emerging area of research, driven by the capabilities of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. With the progress in the research of QML models, there is a rise in third-party quantum cloud services to cater to the increasing demand for resources. New security concerns surface, specifically regarding the protection of intellectual property (IP) from untrustworthy service providers. One of the most pressing risks is the potential for reverse engineering (RE) by malicious actors who may steal proprietary quantum IPs such as trained parameters and QML architecture, modify them to remove additional watermarks or signatures and re-transpile them for other quantum hardware. Prior work presents a brute force approach to RE the QML parameters which takes exponential time overhead. In this paper, we introduce an autoencoder-based approach to extract the parameters from transpiled QML models deployed on untrusted third-party vendors. We experiment on multi-qubit classifiers and note that they can be reverse-engineered under restricted conditions with a mean error of order 10^-1. The amount of time taken to prepare the dataset and train the model to reverse engineer the QML circuit being of the order 10^3 seconds (which is 10^2x better than the previously reported value for 4-layered 4-qubit classifiers) makes the threat of RE highly potent, underscoring the need for continued development of effective defenses.</description>

      <title>Comparing quantum and classical Monte Carlo algorithms for estimating Betti numbers of clique complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several quantum and classical Monte Carlo algorithms for Betti Number Estimation (BNE) on clique complexes have recently been proposed, though it is unclear how their performances compare. We review these algorithms, emphasising their common Monte Carlo structure within a new modular framework. This framework allows us to directly compare these algorithms by calculating upper bounds on the minimum number of samples needed for convergence. By recombining the different modules, we create a new quantum algorithm with an exponentially-improved dependence in the sample complexity. We run classical simulations to verify convergence within the theoretical bounds and observe the predicted exponential separation, even though empirical convergence occurs substantially earlier than the conservative theoretical bounds.</description>

      <title>Experimental Verification of Demon-Involved Fluctuation Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limit of energy saving in the control of small systems has recently attracted much interest due to the concept refinement of the Maxwell demon. Inspired by a newly proposed set of fluctuation theorems, we report the first experimental verification of these equalities and inequalities in a ultracold 40Ca ion system, confirming the intrinsic nonequilibrium in the system due to involvement of the demon. Based on elaborately designed demon-involved control protocols, such as the Szilard engine protocol, we provide experimentally quantitative evidence of the dissipative information, and observe tighter bounds of both the extracted work and the demon's efficacy than the limits predicted by the Sagawa-Ueda theorem. Our results substantiate a close connection between the physical nature of information and nonequilibrium processes at the microscale, which help further understanding the thermodynamic characteristics of information and the optimal design of nanoscale and smaller systems.</description>

      <title>Study And Implementation of Unitary Gates in Quantum Computation Using Schrodinger Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis explores the concept of realizing quantum gates using physical systems like atoms and oscillators perturbed by electric and magnetic fields. The basic idea is that if a time-independent Hamiltonian $H_0$ is perturbed by a time-varying Hamiltonian of the form $f(t)V$, where $f(t)$ is a scalar function of time and $V$ is a Hermitian operator that does not commute with $H_0$, then a large class of unitary operators can be realized via the Schrodinger evolution corresponding to the time-varying Hamiltonian $H_0+f(t)V$. This is a consequence of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula in Lie groups and Lie algebras.
  The thesis addresses two problems based on this idea: first, taking a Harmonic oscillator and perturbing it with a time-independent anharmonic term, and then computing $U_g=e^{-\iota T H_1}$. Then, perturbing the harmonic Hamiltonian with a linear time-dependent term, and calculating the unitary evolution corresponding to $H(t)$ at time $T$. This gate can be expressed as $U(T)=U(T,\epsilon,f)=T\{e^{-\iota\int_0^TH(t)dt}\}$.
  The anharmonic gate $U_g$ is replaced by a host of commonly used gates in quantum computation, such as controlled unitary gates and quantum Fourier transform gates. The control electric field is selected appropriately.
  The thesis also addresses the controllability issue, determining under what conditions there exists a scalar real valued function of time $f(t), 0\leq t\leq T$ such that if $|\psi_\iota\rangle$ is any initial wave function and $|\psi_f\rangle$ is any final wave function, then $U(T,f)|\psi_i\rangle=|\psi_f\rangle$. A partial solution was obtained by replacing the unitary evolution kernel by its Dyson series truncated version.
  In all design procedures, the gates that appear are infinite-dimensional, with an interaction between the atom and the electromagnetic field modulated by a controllable function of time.</description>

      <title>Efficient generation of multiqubit entanglement states using rapid adiabatic passage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the implementation of a rapid adiabatic passage (RAP) scheme to generate entanglement in Rydberg atom-array systems. This method transforms a product state in a multi-qubit system into an entangled state with high fidelity and robustness. By employing global and continuous driving laser fields, we demonstrate the generation of two-qubit Bell state and three-qubit W state, via sequential RAP pulses within the Rydberg blockade regime. As an illustrative example, applying this technique to alkali atoms, we predict fidelities exceeding 0.9995 for two-qubit Bell and three-qubit W state, along with excellent robustness. Furthermore, our scheme can be extended to generate entanglement between weakly coupled atoms and to create four-qubit Greenberger- Horne-Zeilinger states through spatial correlations. Our approach holds the potential for extension to larger atomic arrays, offering a straightforward and efficient method to generate high-fidelity entangled states in neutral atom systems.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of strong coupling of a subradiant atom array to a cavity vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By considering linear (Rayleigh) scattering of cold atoms inside an undriven high-finesse optical resonator, we experimentally demonstrate effects unique to a strongly coupled vacuum field. Arranging the atoms in an incommensurate lattice, with respect to the resonator mode, the scattering can be suppressed by destructive interference: resulting in a subradiant atomic array. We show however, that strong coupling leads to a drastic modification of the excitation spectrum, as evidenced by well-resolved vacuum Rabi splitting in the intensity of the fluctuations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the strongly coupled vacuum mode induces polarization rotation in the linear scattering, which is incompatible with a linear polarizability model of isotropic objects.</description>

      <title>Simulating Feedback Cooling of Incoherent Quantum Mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new approach for efficient and scalable simulations of measurement and control of quantum systems built upon existing phase-space methods, namely the Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA). We benchmark against existing particle-filter methods by simulating measurement based feedback cooling in a two-mode system, whose low-dimensional nature permits a computation of an exact solution. The advantage of our method is multi-mode scalability, which we demonstrate through the first successful simulation of measurement-based feedback cooling of an incoherent quasi-1D thermal ensemble to quantum degeneracy. As the underlying principle of our approach exploits a general correspondence between measurement and coherent feedback, we anticipate it is also applicable across a broad range of other quantum control scenarios.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Learning algorithms, such as those used in Reinforcement Learning, often require large quantities of data to train effectively. In most cases, the availability of data is not a significant issue. However, for some contexts, such as in autonomous cyber defence, we require data efficient methods. Recently, Quantum Machine Learning and Boltzmann Machines have been proposed as solutions to this challenge. In this work we build upon the pre-existing work to extend the use of Deep Boltzmann Machines to the cutting edge algorithm Proximal Policy Optimisation in a Reinforcement Learning cyber defence environment. We show that this approach, when solved using a D-WAVE quantum annealer, can lead to a two-fold increase in data efficiency. We therefore expect it to be used by the machine learning and quantum communities who are hoping to capitalise on data-efficient Reinforcement Learning methods.</description>

      <title>Resource state generation in a hybrid matter-photon quantum information processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum architectures that integrate matter and photonic degrees of freedom present a promising pathway toward scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computing. This approach needs to combine well-established entangling operations between distant registers using photonic degrees of freedom with direct interactions between matter qubits within a solid-state register. The high-fidelity control of such a register, however, poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these challenges with pulsed control sequences which modulate all inter-spin interactions to preserve the nearest-neighbor couplings while eliminating unwanted long-range interactions. We derive pulse sequences, including broadband and selective gates, using composite pulse and shaped pulse techniques as well as optimal control methods. This ensures robustness against uncertainties in spin positions, static offset detunings, and Rabi frequency fluctuations of the control fields. The control techniques developed here apply well beyond the present setting to a broad range of physical platforms. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods for the resource state generation for fusion-based quantum computing in four- and six-spin systems encoded in the electronic ground states of nitrogen-vacancy centers. We also outline other elements of the proposed architecture, highlighting its potential for advancing quantum computing technology.</description>

      <title>A Limit on the Power of Entanglement-Assistance in Quantum Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal rate of reliable communication over a quantum channel can be enhanced by pre-shared entanglement. Whereas the enhancement may be unbounded in infinite-dimensional settings even when the input power is constrained, a long-standing conjecture asserts that the ratio between the entanglement-assisted and unassisted classical capacities is bounded in finite-dimensional settings [Bennett et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 3081 (2002)]. In this work, we prove this conjecture by showing that their ratio is upper bounded by $o(d^2)$, where $d$ is the input dimension of the channel. An application to quantum communication with noisy encoders and decoders is given.</description>

      <title>Modeling flux tunability in Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers with an open-source frequency-domain simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (JTWPAs) are integral parts of many experiments carried out in quantum technologies. Being composed of hundreds of Josephson junction-based unit cells, such devices exhibit complex nonlinear behavior that typically cannot be fully explained with simple analytical models, thus necessitating the use of numerical simulators. A very useful characteristic of JTWPAs is the possibility of being biased by an external magnetic flux, allowing insitu control of the nonlinearity. It is therefore very desirable for numerical simulators to support this feature. Open-source numerical tools that allow to model JTWPA flux biasing, such as WRSPICE or PSCAN2, are based on time-domain approaches,which typically require long simulation times to get accurate results. In this work, we model the gain performance in a prototypical flux-tunable JTWPA by using JosephsonCircuits.jl,a recently developed frequency-domain open-source numerical simulator, which has the benefit of simulation times about 10,000 faster than time-domain methods. By comparing the numerical and experimental results, we validate this approach for modeling the flux dependent behavior of JTWPAs.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum simulation of ground states and thermal states for lattice gauge theory with multi-objective optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms provide feasible approaches for simulating quantum systems and are applied widely. For lattice gauge theory, however, variational quantum simulation faces a challenge as local gauge invariance enforces a constraint on the physical Hilbert space. In this paper, we incorporate multi-objective optimization for variational quantum simulation of lattice gauge theory at zero and finite temperatures. By setting energy or free energy of the system and penalty for enforcing the local gauge invariance as two objectives, the multi-objective optimization can self-adjust the proper weighting for two objectives and thus faithfully simulate the gauge theory in the physical Hilbert space. Specifically, we propose variational quantum eigensolver and variational quantum thermalizer for preparing the ground states and thermal states of lattice gauge theory, respectively. We demonstrate the quantum algorithms for a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory with spinless fermion in one dimension. With numeral simulations, the multi-objective optimization shows that minimizing energy~(free energy) and enforcing the local gauge invariance can be achieved simultaneously at zero temperature~(finite temperature). The multi-objective optimization suggests a feasible ingredient for quantum simulation of complicated physical systems on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>A Passive and Self-Characterizing Cross-Encoded Receiver for Reference-Frame-Independent Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) promises to revolutionize the field of security in communication, with applications ranging from state secrets to personal data, making it a key player in the ongoing battle against cyber threats. Reference-Frame-Independent (RFI) QKD aims to simplify QKD implementations by allowing to reduce the requirements of alignment on a shared reference frame. This is done by performing two mutually unbiased measurements on the control states. In this work, we present a novel fully passive receiver for time-bin encoded RFI-QKD. Conversion of time-bin to polarization is employed to perform the required quantum measurement in a fully passive manner. Furthermore, to overcome experimental errors, we retrieved a complete description of our measurement apparatus by employing a recently introduced Quantum Detector Self-Characterization technique, without performing tomographic studies on the detection stage. In fact, the security analysis carried out in this work uses experimentally retrieved Positive Operator Valued Measurements, which consider our receiver defects, substituting the ideal expected operators and thus increasing the overall level of secrecy. Lastly, we conducted a proof-of-principle experiment that validated the feasibility of our method and its applicability to QKD applications.</description>

      <title>A zero-entropy classical shadow reconstruction of density state operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical shadow (CS) has opened the door to predicting the characteristics of quantum systems using very few measurements. As quantum systems grow in size, new ways to characterize them are needed to show the quality of their qubits, gates, and how noise affects them. In this work, we explore the capabilities of CS for reconstructing density state operators of sections of quantum devices to make a diagnostic of their qubits quality. We introduce zero-entropy classical shadow (ZECS), a methodology that focuses on reconstructing a positive semidefinite and unit trace density state operator using the CS information. This procedure makes a reliable reconstruction of the density state operator removing partially the errors associated with a limited sampling and quantum device noise. It gives a threshold of the maximum coherent information that qubits on a quantum device have. We test ZECS on ibm_lagos and ibm_brisbane using up to 10,000 shots. We show that with only 6,000 shots, we can make a diagnostic of the properties of groups of 2, 3, and 4 qubits on the 127-qubits ibm_brisbane device. We show two applications of ZECS: as a routing technique and as a detector for non-local noisy correlations. In the routing technique, an optimal set of 20 ibm_brisbane qubits is selected based on the ZECS procedure and used for a quantum optimization application. This method improves the solution quality by 10% and extends the quantum algorithm's lifetime by 33% when compared to the qubits chosen by the best transpilation procedure in Qiskit. Additionally, with the detector of non-local correlations, we identify regions of ibm\_brisbane that are not directly connected but have a strong correlation that maintains in time, suggesting some non-local crosstalk that can come, for example, at the multiplexing readout stage.</description>

      <title>Phase error rate estimation with basis-efficiency mismatch for decoy-state BB84</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a finite-size security proof of the BB84 QKD protocol against coherent attacks, using entropic uncertainty relations, in the presence of imperfectly characterized basis-efficiency mismatch. Our proof requires no new modifications to the protocol steps or hardware, and works by obtaining a suitable bound on the phase error rate. It is applicable to imperfectly characterized detectors, and only requires the maximum relative difference in detection efficiencies and dark count rates of the detectors to be characterized. Moreover, our proof allows Eve to use any spatio-temporal degree of freedom in each round to choose detector efficiencies and dark count rates in their allowed ranges, thereby addressing an important problem of detector side channels. We prove security in the variable-length framework, where users are allowed to adaptively determine the length of key to be produced, and number of bits to be used for error-correction, based on observations made during the protocol. We quantitatively demonstrate the effect of basis-efficiency mismatch by applying our results to the decoy-state BB84 protocol.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamical Casimir effect and Unruh entanglement in waveguide QED with parametrically modulated coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study theoretically an array of two-level qubits moving relative to a one-dimensional waveguide. This motion can be implemented mechanically or simulated via the modulation of the couplings between the qubits and the waveguide. When the frequency of this motion approaches twice the qubit resonance frequency, it induces parametric generation of photons and excitation of the qubits. The proposed quantum optomechanical system offers a plethora of possibilities for exploring various quantum electrodynamics phenomena. However, their theoretical analysis is challenging due to the presence of quantum nonlinearity, a continuum of propagating photonic modes, and the excitation of strongly nonequilibrium qubit states, which make many conventional analytical tools inapplicable. To address these challenges, we develop a comprehensive general theoretical framework that incorporates both perturbative diagrammatic techniques and a rigorous master-equation approach. Our calculations reveal several intriguing effects, including the directional dynamical Casimir effect, where momenta of emitted photon pairs are correlated, and the waveguide-mediated collective Unruh effect, where motion drives the qubits to a nontrivial steady state that can be entangled and exhibit phase transitions. Additionally, we examine the radiation back-action on the qubit motion, which becomes particularly pronounced when subradiant modes in the qubit array are excited. The back-action can significantly alter the mechanical spectra, potentially leading to the formation of hybrid phonon-biphoton modes.</description>

      <title>Hybrid encoder for discrete and continuous variable QKD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution is emerging as a cutting-edge application of quantum technology, gradually integrating into the industrial landscape. Many protocols employing discrete or continuous variables have been developed over time. Whereas the firsts usually excel in covering longer distances, the seconds are typically superior in producing higher secret key rates at short distances. Present efforts aim to create systems that can exploit both these strengths, foreseeing the future challenge regarding the realization of a quantum network consisting of multiple and heterogeneous interconnected nodes. Within such a context, a possible solution is systems able to efficiently toggle between discrete and continuous variable working modes with hybrid quantum state encoders. Therefore, this study presents a new hybrid encoder based on an iPOGNAC modulator, ensuring compatibility with DV and CV QKD systems that can be assembled entirely with commercial-off-the-shelf components. The proposed scheme is the first supporting DV polarization protocols, thus making it an appealing candidate for space nodes of a future quantum network, given that polarization-based protocols are well suited for space links.</description>

      <title>Real-time Simultaneous Dual Sensing of Temperature and Magnetic Field using NV-based Nano-diamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensors based on Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are highly capable of sensing multiple physical quantities. In this study, we use amplitude-modulated lock-in detection of optically detected magnetic resonance of NV nanodiamonds (NVND) to investigate the link between temperature (T) and the zero-field splitting parameter (D) and also the relationship between magnetic field values and the difference of resonance frequencies. We also present NVNDs' capacity to simultaneously sense both thermal and magnetic fields in real time. This dual-sensing approach is beneficial for studying magnetic materials whose magnetization depends on temperature and the applied magnetic field, such as certain ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials. Integrating real-time thermal and magnetic field measurements provides unique opportunities for failure analysis in the integrated circuit (IC) industry and for studying thermodynamic processes in cell physiology. The ability to concurrently monitor temperature and magnetic field variations offers a powerful toolset for advancing precision diagnostics and monitoring in these fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum state testing with restricted measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum state testing where the goal is to test whether $\rho=\rho_0\in\mathbb{C}^{d\times d}$ or $\|\rho-\rho_0\|_1&gt;\varepsilon$, given $n$ copies of $\rho$ and a known state description $\rho_0$. In practice, not all measurements can be easily applied, even using unentangled measurements where each copy is measured separately. We develop an information-theoretic framework that yields unified copy complexity lower bounds for restricted families of non-adaptive measurements through a novel measurement information channel. Using this framework, we obtain the optimal bounds for a natural family of $k$-outcome measurements with fixed and randomized schemes. We demonstrate a separation between these two schemes, showing the power of randomized measurement schemes over fixed ones. Previously, little was known for fixed schemes, and tight bounds were only known for randomized schemes with $k\ge d$ and Pauli observables, a special class of 2-outcome measurements. Our work bridges this gap in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement-based feedback (MBF) control offers several powerful means for preparing the desired target quantum state. Therefore, it is important to investigate fundamental properties of MBF. In particular, how the entropy of the controlled system under the MBF behaves is of great interest. In this study, we examine this problem by deriving a sufficient condition that the time derivative of the von Neumann entropy is nonnegative under the MBF control. This result is rigorously characterized by the variance of the system observable and the quantumness of a given decoherence. We show the validity of the result and physical interpretation in the example of qubit stabilizing.</description>

      <title>Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers with Plasma oscillation phase-matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High gain and large bandwidth of traveling-wave parametric amplifier exploiting the nonlinearity of Josephson Junctions can be achieved by fulfilling the so-called phase-matching condition. This condition is usually addressed by placing resonant structures along the waveguide or by periodic modulations of its parameters, creating gaps in the waveguide's dispersion. Here, we propose to employ the Josephson junctions, which constitute the centerline of the amplifier, as resonant elements for phase matching. By numerical simulations in JoSIM (and WRspice) software, we show that Josephson plasma oscillations can be utilized to create wavevector mismatch sufficient for phase matching as well as to prevent the conversion of the pump energy to higher harmonics. The proposed TWPA design has a gain of 15 dB and a 3.5 GHz bandwidth, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art TWPAs.</description>

      <title>Algebraic method of group classification for semi-normalized classes of differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the notion of semi-normalized classes of systems of differential equations, study properties of such classes and extend the algebraic method of group classification to them. In particular, we prove the important theorems on factoring out symmetry groups and invariance algebras of systems from semi-normalized classes and on splitting such groups and algebras within disjointedly semi-normalized classes. Nontrivial particular examples of classes that arise in real-world applications and showcase the relevance of the developed theory are provided. To convincingly illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method, we apply it to the group classification problem for the class of linear Schr\"odinger equations with complex-valued potentials and the general value of the space dimension. We compute the equivalence groupoid of the class by the direct method and thus show that this class is uniformly semi-normalized with respect to the linear superposition of solutions. This is why the group classification problem reduces to the classification of specific low-dimensional subalgebras of the associated equivalence algebra, which is completely realized for the case of space dimension two. Splitting into different classification cases is based on three integer parameters that are invariant with respect to equivalence transformations. We also single out those of the obtained results that are relevant to linear Schr\"odinger equations with real-valued potentials.</description>

      <title>Universal Stochastic Equations of Monitored Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the monitored quantum dynamics of Gaussian mixed states and derive the universal Fokker-Planck equations that govern the stochastic time evolution of entire density-matrix spectra, obtaining their exact solutions. From these equations, we reveal an even-odd effect in purification dynamics: whereas entropy exhibits exponential decay for an even number $N$ of complex fermions, algebraic decay with divergent purification time occurs for odd $N$ as a manifestation of dynamical criticality. Additionally, we identify the universal fluctuations of entropy in the chaotic regime, serving as a non-unitary counterpart of the universal conductance fluctuations in mesoscopic electronic transport phenomena. Furthermore, we elucidate and classify the universality classes of non-unitary quantum dynamics based on fundamental symmetry. We also validate the universality of these analytical results through extensive numerical simulations across different types of models.</description>

      <title>Dirac bilinears in condensed matter physics: Relativistic correction for observables and conjugate electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent developments in electron chirality, we reconsider some microscopic physical quantities that have been overlooked or have received little attention in condensed matter physics, based on the non-relativistic limit of the Dirac bilinears in relativistic quantum theory. We identify the expression of physical quantities defined by the four-component Dirac field in terms of the two-component Schr\"odinger field, which is usually used in condensed matter physics, and clarify its conjugate electromagnetic field. This consideration bridges the fields of condensed matter physics, quantum chemistry, and particle physics, and paves the way to electromagnetic control of matter. Our findings provide a means of {\it ab initio} quantification of material characters such as chirality and axiality that are unique to low-symmetry materials, and stimulate the systematic search for useful, new functionalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) provides a powerful way to shape laser beams into arbitrary intensity patterns, but at the cost of a hard computational problem of determining an appropriate SLM phase. Here we show that optimal transport methods can generate approximate solutions to this problem that serve as excellent initializations for iterative phase retrieval algorithms, yielding vortex-free solutions with superior accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, we show that analogous algorithms can be used to measure the intensity and phase of the input beam incident upon the SLM via phase diversity imaging. These techniques furnish flexible and convenient solutions to the computational challenges of beam shaping with an SLM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonance states in quantum chaotic scattering systems have a multifractal structure that depends on their decay rate. We show how classical dynamics describes resonance states of all decay rates in the semiclassical limit. This result for chaotic scattering systems corresponds to the well-established quantum ergodicity for closed chaotic systems. Specifically, we generalize Ulam's matrix approximation of the Perron-Frobenius operator, giving rise to conditionally invariant measures of various decay rates. There are many matrix approximations leading to the same decay rate and we conjecture a criterion for selecting the one relevant for resonance states. Numerically, we demonstrate that resonance states in the semiclassical limit converge to the selected measure. Example systems are a dielectric cavity, the three-disk scattering system, and open quantum maps.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for predicting control landscape maps of quantum molecular dynamics: Laser-induced three-dimensional alignment of asymmetric top molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning for predicting control landscape maps of full quantum molecular dynamics is examined through a case study of the laser-induced three-dimensional (3D) alignment of asymmetric top molecules, an essential technique for observing and/or manipulating molecular dynamics in a molecule-fixed frame. We consider the "prolate-type" asymmetryic top molecules with the asymmetry parameters $-1 &lt; \kappa &lt; 0$ and the C2v symmetry in the low-temperature limiting case, which are aligned by using mutually orthogonal linearly polarized double laser pulses. The landscape map for each molecule consists of 6000 pixels, each pixel of which represents the maximum degree of alignment achieved by each set of control parameters. After examining ways to deal with the markedly different molecular parameters in a unified manner for suitably training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, we train the CNN model by using 55 training sample molecules to predict the control landscape maps of 35 test sample molecules with reasonably high accuracy. As the predicted landscape maps provide a big picture of the alignment control, we show, for example, that the double pulse control scheme is especially effective for a molecule having a polarizability component that is much larger in value than the other two components.</description>

      <title>Efficient and systematic calculation of arbitrary observables for the matrix product state excitation ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical methods based on matrix product states (MPSs) are currently the de facto standard for calculating the ground state properties of (quasi-)one-dimensional quantum many-body systems. While the properties of the low-lying excitations in such systems are often studied in this MPS framework through _dynamics_ by means of time-evolution simulations, we can also look at their _statics_ by directly calculating eigenstates corresponding to these excitations. The so-called MPS excitation ansatz is a powerful method for finding such eigenstates with a single-particle character in the thermodynamic limit. Although this excitation ansatz has been used quite extensively, a general method for calculating expectation values for these states is lacking in the literature: we aim to fill this gap by presenting a recursive algorithm to calculate arbitrary observables expressed as matrix product operators. This method concisely encapsulates existing methods for -- as well as extensions to -- the excitation ansatz, such as excitations with a larger spatial support and multi-particle excitations, and is robust to handle further innovations. We demonstrate the versatility of our method by studying the low-lying excitations in the spin-1 Heisenberg chain and the one-dimensional Hubbard model, looking at how the excitations converge in the former, while in the latter, we present a novel method of targeting single-particle excitations inside of a continuum by minimizing the energy _variance_ rather than the energy itself. We hope that this technique will foster further advancements with the excitation ansatz.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium regimes for quasiparticles in superconducting qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Qubits with gap asymmetry larger than their transition energy are less susceptible to quasiparticle decoherence as the quasiparticles are mostly trapped in the low-gap side of the junction. Because of this trapping, the gap asymmetry can contribute to maintaining the quasiparticles out of equilibrium. Here we address the temperature evolution of the quasiparticle densities in the two sides of the junction. We show that four qualitatively different regimes are possible with increasing temperature: i) nonequilibrium, ii) local quasiequilibrium, iii) global quasiequilibrium, and iv) full equilibrium. We identify shortcomings in assuming global quasiequilibrium when interpreting experimental data, highlighting how measurements in the presence of magnetic field can aid the accurate determination of the junction parameters, and hence the identification of the nonequilibrium regimes.</description>

      <title>Neutron-proton pairing correlations described on quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ADAPT-VQE approach is used to solve the neutron-proton pairing problem in atomic nuclei. This variational approach is considered today as one of the most powerful methods to iteratively find the ground state of a many-body problem, provided a performing set of operators, called the pool of operators, is used to explore the Hilbert space of many-body wave-functions. Three different pools of operators, which might eventually break one or several symmetries of the Hamiltonian during the descent to the ground state, are tested for the neutron-proton pairing problem. We observe that the breaking of some symmetries during the optimization of the trial wave-function might, in general, help to speed up the convergence towards the ground state. Still, we rejected the pool of operators that might explicitly break the total particle number because they become uncontrollable during the optimization process. Overall, we observed that the iterative optimization process rapidly becomes a delicate problem when the number of parameters to build the ansatz increases, and the energy might get stuck at energies higher than the ground state energy. To improve the convergence in this case, several techniques have been proposed, with some better controlling the symmetries during the energy minimization. Among the proposed methods, two have proven effective: one based on an embedding technique and the other on a randomized preparation of the initial state. We conclude that the ADAPT-VQE, complemented by these techniques, can provide a very accurate description of the neutron-proton pairing problem, and can outperform other standardly used techniques that break the particle number symmetry and restore afterwards.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transfer of population between two intersecting quantum states is the most fundamental dynamical event that governs a broad variety of processes in physics, chemistry, biology and material science. Whereas any two-state description implies that population leaving one state instantaneously appears in the other state, we show that coupling to additional states, present in all real-world systems, can cause a measurable delay in population transfer. Using attosecond spectroscopy supported by advanced quantum-chemical calculations, we measure a delay of 1.46$\pm$0.41 fs at a charge-transfer state crossing in CF$_3$I$^+$, where an electron hole moves from the fluorine atoms to iodine. Our measurements also fully resolve the other fundamental quantum-dynamical processes involved in the charge-transfer reaction: a vibrational rearrangement time of 9.38$\pm$0.21 fs (during which the vibrational wave packet travels to the state crossing) and a population-transfer time of 2.3-2.4 fs. Our experimental results and theoretical simulations show that delays in population transfer readily appear in otherwise-adiabatic reactions and are typically on the order of 1 fs for intersecting molecular valence states. These results have implications for many research areas, such as atomic and molecular physics, charge transfer or light harvesting.</description>

We apply the special limit of this GUP form to the one-dimension linear potential to calculate the energy correction and the modified wave function. We also discuss the deformation effect on one dimensional delta potential well and one dimensional delta potential barrier. Moreover, we pay attention to the deformation effect on one dimensional hydrogen atom and investigate the Stark effect on the atom separately. Finally, we make a short conclusion.</description>

Abstract: The quantization of gravity is widely believed to result in gravitons -- particles of discrete energy that form gravitational waves. But their detection has so far been considered impossible. Here we show that signatures of single graviton exchange can be observed in laboratory experiments. We show that stimulated and spontaneous single-graviton processes can become relevant for massive quantum acoustic resonators and that stimulated absorption can be resolved through continuous sensing of quantum jumps. We analyze the feasibility of observing the exchange of single energy quanta between matter and gravitational waves. Our results show that single graviton signatures are within reach of experiments. In analogy to the discovery of the photo-electric effect for photons, such signatures can provide the first experimental clue of the quantization of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14263v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum optics, measurement statistics -- for example, photocounting statistics -- are considered nonclassical if they cannot be reproduced with statistical mixtures of classical radiation fields. We have formulated a necessary and sufficient condition for such nonclassicality. This condition is given by a set of inequalities that tightly bound the convex set of probabilities associated with classical electromagnetic radiation. Analytical forms for full sets and subsets of these inequalities are obtained for important cases of realistic photocounting measurements and unbalanced homodyne detection. As an example, we consider photocounting statistics of phase-squeezed coherent states. Contrary to a common intuition, the analysis developed here reveals distinct nonclassical properties of these statistics that can be experimentally corroborated with minimal resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate quantum computing relies on the precision of quantum gates. However, quantum gates in practice are generally affected by dissipative environments, which can significantly reduce their fidelity. In this study, we elucidate fundamental relations between the average fidelity of generic quantum gates and the dissipation that occurs during the computing processes. Considering scenarios in which a quantum gate is subject to Markovian environments, we rigorously derive fidelity-dissipation relations that hold for arbitrary operational times. Intriguingly, when the quantum gate undergoes thermal relaxation, the result can be used as a valuable tool for estimating dissipation through experimentally measurable fidelity, without requiring detailed knowledge of the dissipative structure. For the case of arbitrary environments, we uncover a trade-off relation between the average fidelity and energy dissipation, implying that these quantities cannot be large simultaneously. Our results unveil the computational limitations imposed by thermodynamics, shedding light on the profound connection between thermodynamics and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Improved real-space parallelizable matrix-product state compression and its application to unitary quantum dynamics simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Towards the efficient simulation of near-term quantum devices using tensor network states, we introduce an improved real-space parallelizable matrix-product state (MPS) compression method. This method enables efficient compression of all virtual bonds in constant time, irrespective of the system size, with controlled accuracy, while it maintains the stability of the wavefunction norm without necessitating sequential renormalization procedures. In addition, we introduce a parallel regauging technique to partially restore the deviated canonical form, thereby improving the accuracy of the simulation in subsequent steps. We further apply this method to simulate unitary quantum dynamics and introduce an improved parallel time-evolving block-decimation (pTEBD) algorithm. We employ the improved pTEBD algorithm for extensive simulations of typical one- and two-dimensional quantum circuits, involving over 1000 qubits. The obtained numerical results unequivocally demonstrate that the improved pTEBD algorithm achieves the same level of simulation precision as the current state-of-the-art MPS algorithm but in polynomially shorter time, exhibiting nearly perfect weak scaling performance on a modern supercomputer.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the Coherence Time Barrier in Quantum Machine Learning on Temporal Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Practical implementation of many quantum algorithms known today is limited by the coherence time of the executing quantum hardware and quantum sampling noise. Here we present a machine learning algorithm, NISQRC, for qubit-based quantum systems that enables inference on temporal data over durations unconstrained by decoherence. NISQRC leverages mid-circuit measurements and deterministic reset operations to reduce circuit executions, while still maintaining an appropriate length persistent temporal memory in quantum system, confirmed through the proposed Volterra Series analysis. This enables NISQRC to overcome not only limitations imposed by finite coherence, but also information scrambling in monitored circuits and sampling noise, problems that persist even in hypothetical fault-tolerant quantum computers that have yet to be realized. To validate our approach, we consider the channel equalization task to recover test signal symbols that are subject to a distorting channel. Through simulations and experiments on a 7-qubit quantum processor we demonstrate that NISQRC can recover arbitrarily long test signals, not limited by coherence time.</description>

      <title>Low loss hybrid Nb/Au superconducting resonators for quantum circuit applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting resonators play a crucial role in developing forthcoming quantum technologies such as quantum computing or high performance detectors. Yet, one of their main limitations regarding to noise and sensitivity is the interaction with two-level systems present in oxide layers in the device. Focused on mitigating this problem, we study a superconducting device combining a niobium circuit with a 10 nm gold capping layer. Our investigation covers a wide range of temperatures and driving powers, revealing that adding the Au layer reduces the density of two-level system defects while maintaining a very high quality factor. Moreover, an increase in the non-linearity response is also observed. Our findings suggest the potential of Nb/Au lumped element resonators as versatile and promising tools for advancing superconducting quantum technologies. Among others, the presence of gold allows anchoring alkyl thiol groups to form self-assembled monolayers, improving the integration with molecular spin qubits for the development of hybrid quantum processors.</description>

Abstract: Distributed quantum computing (DQC), provides a way to scale quantum computers using multiple quantum processing units (QPU) which are connected through quantum communication links. In this paper, we have built a distributed quantum computing simulator and used the simulator to investigate quantum algorithms such as the quantum Fourier transform, quantum phase estimation, quantum amplitude estimation, and the generation of probability distribution in DQC. The simulator can be used to generate and execute distributed quantum circuits with ease, obtain and benchmark DQC parameters such as the fidelity of the algorithm and the number of entanglement generation steps, and use dynamic circuits in a distributed setting to improve results. We show the applicability of dynamic quantum circuits in DQC, where mid-circuit measurements, local operations, and classical communication are used in place of noisy inter-processor (nonlocal) quantum gates.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Annealing-Inspired Algorithms for Track Reconstruction at High-Energy Colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charged particle reconstruction or track reconstruction is one of the most crucial components of pattern recognition in high-energy collider physics. It is known to entail enormous consumption of computing resources, especially when the particle multiplicity is high, which will be the conditions at future colliders, such as the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider and Super Proton-Proton Collider. Track reconstruction can be formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, for which various quantum algorithms have been investigated and evaluated with both a quantum simulator and hardware. Simulated bifurcation algorithms are a set of quantum-annealing-inspired algorithms, known to be serious competitors to other Ising machines. In this study, we show that simulated bifurcation algorithms can be employed to solve the particle tracking problem. The simulated bifurcation algorithms run on classical computers and are suitable for parallel processing and usage of graphical processing units, and they can handle significantly large amounts of data at high speed. These algorithms exhibit reconstruction efficiency and purity comparable to or sometimes improved over those of simulated annealing, but the running time can be reduced by as much as four orders of magnitude. These results suggest that QUBO models together with quantum-annealing-inspired algorithms are valuable for current and future particle tracking problems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Distance Approximation for Persistence Diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological Data Analysis methods can be useful for classification and clustering tasks in many different fields as they can provide two dimensional persistence diagrams that summarize important information about the shape of potentially complex and high dimensional data sets. The space of persistence diagrams can be endowed with various metrics such as the Wasserstein distance which admit a statistical structure and allow to use these summaries for machine learning algorithms. However, computing the distance between two persistence diagrams involves finding an optimal way to match the points of the two diagrams and may not always be an easy task for classical computers. In this work we explore the potential of quantum computers to estimate the distance between persistence diagrams, in particular we propose variational quantum algorithms for the Wasserstein distance as well as the $d^{c}_{p}$ distance. Our implementation is a weighted version of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm that relies on control clauses to encode the constraints of the optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Reducing the error rate of a superconducting logical qubit using analog readout information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction enables the preservation of logical qubits with a lower logical error rate than the physical error rate, with performance depending on the decoding method. Traditional error decoding approaches, relying on the binarization (`hardening') of readout data, often ignore valuable information embedded in the analog (`soft') readout signal. We present experimental results showcasing the advantages of incorporating soft information into the decoding process of a distance-three ($d=3$) bit-flip surface code with transmons. To this end, we use the $3\times3$ data-qubit array to encode each of the $16$ computational states that make up the logical state $\ket{0_{\mathrm{L}}}$, and protect them against bit-flip errors by performing repeated $Z$-basis stabilizer measurements. To infer the logical fidelity for the $\ket{0_{\mathrm{L}}}$ state, we average across the $16$ computational states and employ two decoding strategies: minimum weight perfect matching and a recurrent neural network. Our results show a reduction of up to $6.8\%$ in the extracted logical error rate with the use of soft information. Decoding with soft information is widely applicable, independent of the physical qubit platform, and could reduce the readout duration, further minimizing logical error rates.</description>

      <title>The incompatibility of quantum channels in general probabilistic theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum theory, there exist sets of operations that cannot be performed simultaneously. These sets of operations are referred to as incompatible. While this definition of incompatibility extends to general probabilistic theories (GPTs), the dependency of the set of compatible sets on the definition of composite systems has not been thoroughly investigated. For quantum channels, compatibility is defined using the tensor product of Hilbert spaces, based on the conventional composite system. However, in GPTs, composite systems are not uniquely defined, and the set of states can vary from the minimal tensor to the maximal tensor.In this paper, in addition to the usual quantum compatibility, we introduce min-tensor-compatibility using the minimal tensor on the composite system of effect spaces and investigate their relationship employing noisy identity channels on qubits. As a result, we found that the set of min-tensor-compatible channel pairs is strictly broader than the set of quantum-compatible channel pairs. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of almost quantum compatible pairs of channels from an operational perspective. This concept corresponds to cases where the correlation functions in the verification of compatibility can be realized through a channel and local reinterpretation of effects. We demonstrate that the set of all almost quantum compatible channel pairs is strictly narrower than the set of all min-tensor-compatible channel pairs.</description>

      <title>Low-density parity-check representation of fault-tolerant quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In fault-tolerant quantum computing, quantum algorithms are implemented through quantum circuits capable of error correction. These circuits are typically constructed based on specific quantum error correction codes, with consideration given to the characteristics of the underlying physical platforms. Optimising these circuits within the constraints of today's quantum computing technologies, particularly in terms of error rates, qubit counts, and network topologies, holds substantial implications for the feasibility of quantum applications in the near future. This paper presents a toolkit for designing and analysing fault-tolerant quantum circuits. We introduce a framework for representing stabiliser circuits using classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Each codeword in the representation corresponds to a quantum-mechanical equation regarding the circuit, formalising the correlations utilised in parity checks and delineating logical operations within the circuit. Consequently, the LDPC code provides a means of quantifying fault tolerance and verifying logical operations. We outline the procedure for generating LDPC codes from circuits using the Tanner graph notation, alongside proposing graph-theory tools for constructing fault-tolerant quantum circuits from classical LDPC codes. These findings offer a systematic approach to applying classical error correction techniques in optimising existing fault-tolerant protocols and developing new ones.
  As an example, we develop a resource-efficient scheme for universal fault-tolerant quantum computing on hypergraph product codes based on the LDPC representation.</description>

Abstract: Few-level systems coupled to thermal baths provide useful models for quantum thermodynamics and to understand the role of heat currents in quantum information settings. Useful operations such as cooling or thermal masers have been proposed in autonomous three-level systems. In this work, we propose the coherent coupling of two qutrits as a simultaneous refrigerator and heat pump of two reservoirs forming a system. This occurs thanks to the coupling to two other reservoirs which are out of equilibrium but do not inject heat in the system. We explore the thermodynamic performance of such operation and discuss whether it can be distinguished from the action of a Maxwell demon via measurements of current fluctuations limited to the working substance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was recently demonstrated that a multitude of realizations of several magnetic sensing technologies satisfy the energy resolution limit, which connects a quantity composed by the variance of the magnetic field estimate, the sensor volume and the measurement time, and having units of action, with $\hbar$. A first-principles derivation of this limit is still elusive. We here present such a derivation based on quantum thermodynamic arguments. We show that the energy resolution limit is a result of quantum thermodynamic work necessarily associated with quantum measurement and Landauer erasure, the work being exchanged with the magnetic field. We apply these considerations to atomic magnetometers, diamond magnetometers, and SQUIDs, spanning an energy resolution limit from $10^0\hbar$ to $10^7\hbar$. This connection between quantum thermodynamics and magnetometry can help advance quantum sensing technologies towards even more sensitive devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the relationships between quantum state synthesis complexity classes (a recent concept in computational complexity that focuses on the complexity of preparing quantum states) and traditional decision complexity classes. We especially investigate the role of the synthesis error parameter, which characterizes the quality of the synthesis in quantum state synthesis complexity classes. We first show that in the high synthesis error regime, collapse of synthesis classes implies collapse of the equivalent decision classes. For more reasonable synthesis error, we then show a similar relationships for BQP and QCMA. Finally, we show that for quantum state synthesis classes it is in general impossible to improve the quality of the synthesis: unlike the completeness and soundness parameters (which can be improved via repetition), the synthesis error cannot be reduced, even with arbitrary computational power.</description>

      <title>Is the Born rule a result of measurement noise?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Born rule asserts the probability distribution of eigenstates observed in unbiased quantum measurements, but the reason it holds remains elusive. This manuscript discusses how the Born rule might be explained by Schrodinger equation dynamics, if a measurement comprises a system responding to random fluctuations until it is within an arbitrarily small tolerance of a measurement eigenstate. We describe the random walk dynamics that produce this behavior in terms of a class of time-dependent, stochastic unitary matrices U(t). We also discuss the class of stochastic potential energies in the Schrodinger equation that is equivalent to this class of unitary matrices.
  This analysis raises some questions worth considering, including how to determine if any measurements actually follow the predicted random walk mechanism and whether a reliable measurement apparatus could be designed that deviates from Born rule probabilities. Interestingly, if any measurements do follow this random walk mechanism, then exposing a quantum system to stochastic 'noise' is an intrinsic part of such a measurement, not merely an unwanted side effect. This characteristic would have implications for reducing noise in quantum sensing and quantum computing.
  This is a draft of a work in progress. Questions and suggestions are welcome.</description>

Abstract: We analyze dynamics of the Rabi model describing interactions of a qubit with a single soft-mode oscillator. We show that the model with a slightly violated parity generates symmetric Schr{\"o}dinger cat states of the oscillator, which suddenly perish in a spontaneous unitary process similar to the measurement-induced wave-function collapse. The effect is sufficiently robust to be tested experimentally, e.g., with trapped ions, macroscopic mechanical oscillators or superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>An iterative transversal CNOT decoder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern platforms for potential qubit candidates, such as trapped ions or neutral atoms, allow long range connectivity between distant physical qubits through shuttling. This opens up an avenue for transversal logical CNOT gates between distant logical qubits, whereby physical CNOT gates are performed between each corresponding physical qubit on the control and target logical qubits. However, the transversal CNOT can propagate errors from one logical qubit to another, leading to correlated errors between logical qubits. We have developed a multi-pass iterative decoder that decodes each logical qubit separately to deal with this correlated error. We show that under circuit-level noise and only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ code cycles, a threshold can still persist, and the logical error rate will not be significantly degraded, matching the sub-threshold logical error rate scaling of $p^{\lfloor\frac{d}{2}\rfloor}$ for a distance $d$ rotated surface code.</description>

Abstract: We have established the method of characterizing the unitary design generated by a symmetric local random circuit. Concretely, we have shown that the necessary and sufficient condition for the circuit forming an approximate t-design is given by simple integer optimization for general symmetry and locality. By using the result, we explicitly give the maximal order of unitary design under the $\mathbb{Z}_2$, U(1), and SU(2) symmetries for general locality. This work reveals the relation between the fundamental notions of symmetry and locality in terms of randomness.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared characterization of NbTiN superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors on silicon-on-insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors are widely used for detecting individual photons across various wavelengths from ultraviolet to near-infrared range. Recently, there has been increasing interest in enhancing their sensitivity to single photons in the mid-infrared spectrum, driven by applications in quantum communication, spectroscopy and astrophysics. Here, we present our efforts to expand the spectral detection capabilities of U-shaped NbTiN-based superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, fabricated in a 2-wire configuration on a silicon-on-insulator substrate, into the mid-infrared range. We demonstrate saturated internal detection efficiency extending up to a wavelength of 3.5 {\mu}m for a 5 nm thick and 50 nm wide NbTiN nanowire with a dark count rate less than 10 counts per second at 0.9 K and a rapid recovery time of 4.3 ns. The detectors are engineered for integration on waveguides in a silicon-on-insulator platform for compact, multi-channel device applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement and Chocolates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two statistical ensembles of chocolates are constructed to mimic two quantum entangled states, the spin singlet state and the GHZ state. Despite great efforts to achieve the closest possible resemblance in terms of probability distribution and correlation, subtle differences remain. The differences reveal and illustrate a fundamental characteristic that distinguishes quantum entanglement from classical correlation.</description>

      <title>Multi-Reference UCCSD Variational Quantum Algorithm for Molecular Ground State Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement the Multi-Reference Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (MR-UCCSD) model with a quantum circuit that conserves the particle number to study the ground state energies of LiH, BeH$_2$, and H$_6$. This approach simplifies the MR-UCCSD computation by integrating quantum computing techniques, and reduces its complexity. As a profit of the better MR states, our MR-UCCSD approach satisfies systematically the predefined errors below 10$^{-5}$ Hartree,which is the highest precision of single reference UCCSD approach, along the whole bond length with only hundreds of CNOT gates, and meets satisfactory the requirements of both computational precision and quantum resource reduction.</description>

      <title>A Causal Model for Quantifying Multipartite Classical and Quantum Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16414v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an operational definition of information-theoretic resources within a given multipartite classical or quantum correlation. We present our causal model that serves as the source coding side of this correlation and introduce a novel concept of resource rate. We argue that, beyond classical secrecy, additional resources exist that are useful for the security of distributed computing problems, which can be captured by the resource rate. Furthermore, we establish a relationship between resource rate and an extension of Shannon's logarithmic information measure, namely, total correlation.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution of ultrafast pulses via spectral inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The resolution limits of classical spectroscopy can be surpassed by quantum-inspired methods leveraging the information contained in the phase of the complex electromagnetic field. Their counterpart in spatial imaging has been widely discussed and demonstrated; however, the spectral-domain implementations are few and scarce. We experimentally demonstrate a spectroscopic super-resolution method aimed at broadband light (10s to 100s of GHz), and based on the spectral-domain analog of image inversion interferometry. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we study the paradigmatic problem of estimating a small separation between two incoherent spectral features of equal brightness, with a small number of photons per coherence time. On the grounds of asymptotic estimation theory, more than a $2$-fold improvement over the spectral direct imaging is demonstrated in terms of required resources (photons) for a given estimator variance. The setup is based on an actively stabilized Mach-Zehnder-type interferometer with electro-optic time lenses and passive spectral dispersers implementing the inversion. As such, the method promises on-chip integration, good scalability, and further applications e.g. for mode sorting.</description>

      <title>Solving the homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation with a quantum annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation (hBSE), describing a bound system in a genuinely relativistic quantum-field theory framework, was solved for the first time by using a D-Wave quantum annealer. After applying standard techniques of discretization, the hBSE, in ladder approximation, can be formally transformed in a generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP), with two square matrices: one symmetric and the other non symmetric. The latter matrix poses the challenge of obtaining a suitable formal approach for investigating the non symmetric GEVP by means of a quantum annealer, i.e to recast it as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem. A broad numerical analysis of the proposed algorithms, applied to matrices of dimension up to 64, was carried out by using both the proprietary simulated-anneaing package and the D-Wave Advantage 4.1 system. The numerical results very nicely compare with those obtained with standard classical algorithms, and also show interesting scalability features.</description>

      <title>Ground-state phase diagram of the SU($4$) Heisenberg model on a plaquette lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ground state of the SU($4$) Heisenberg model on a square lattice with spatial anisotropy on each plaquette bond using the tensor-network method based on infinite projected entangled pair states. We find that the SU($4$) singlet ground state appears in the strongly anisotropic limit, whereas N\'eel and valence-bond crystal orders coexist in the nearly isotropic limit. By examining the intermediate parameter region, we identify a phase transition between these phases. The nature of the phase transition is likely to be of first order, and the transition point is estimated to be around $J'/J\approx 0.85(5)$, where $J$ and $J'$ are the interaction strengths of intra- and interplaquette bonds, respectively. We also calculate the anisotropy dependence of singlet correlations on a plaquette bond, which will be useful for future experiments of ultracold atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Efficient post-selection in light-cone correlations of monitored quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider how to target evolution conditioned on atypical measurement outcomes in monitored quantum circuits, i.e., the post-selection problem. We show that for a simple class of measurement schemes, post-selected light-cone dynamical correlation functions can be obtained efficiently from the averaged correlations of a different unitary circuit. This connects rare measurement outcomes in one circuit to typical outcomes in another one. We derive conditions for the existence of this rare-to-typical mapping in brickwork quantum circuits made of XYZ gates. We illustrate these general results with a model system that exhibits a dynamical crossover (a smoothed dynamical transition) in event statistics, and discuss extensions to more general dynamical correlations.</description>

      <title>Quantum tunneling in a quintessence background and the role of GUP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we studied quantum tunneling of massless and massive particles pertaining to a Schwarzschild black hole in a quintessence background, and explored the consequences emerging from a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). For the quintessence scenario, we considered two specific cases of $w$, which is the ratio of the pressure and energy density, namely $w=-1/3$ and $w=-2/3$. For the GUP, we used a modified Schwarzschild metric and employed a unique choice of contour integration to compute the tunneling amplitudes. An analysis and comparative study of the respective temperature profiles have been made.</description>
