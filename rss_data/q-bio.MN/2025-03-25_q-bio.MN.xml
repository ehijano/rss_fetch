      <title>Implementation of Support Vector Machines using Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can machine learning algorithms be implemented using chemical reaction networks? We demonstrate that this is possible in the case of support vector machines (SVMs). SVMs are powerful tools for data classification, leveraging VC theory to handle high-dimensional data and small datasets effectively. In this work, we propose a reaction network scheme for implementing SVMs, utilizing the steady-state behavior of reaction network dynamics to model key computational aspects of SVMs. This approach introduces a novel biochemical framework for implementing machine learning algorithms in non-traditional computational environments.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of chemical reaction networks: Cramer-Rao bound and absolute sensitivity revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information geometry is based on classical Legendre duality but allows to incorporate additional structure such as algebraic constraints and Bregman divergence functions. It is naturally suited, and has been successfully used, to describe the thermodynamics of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) based on the Legendre duality between concentration and potential spaces, where algebraic constraints are enforced by the stoichiometry. In this article, the Riemannian geometrical aspects of the theory are explored. It is shown that duality between concentration and potential spaces and the natural parametrizations of equilibrium subspace are isometries, which leads to a multivariate Cramer-Rao bound through the comparison of two Riemannian metric tensors.
  In the subsequent part, the theory is applied to the recently introduced concept of absolute sensitivity. Using the Riemannian geometric tools, it is proven that the absolute sensitivity is a projection operator onto the tangent bundle of the equilibrium manifold. A linear algebraic characterization and explicit results on first order corrections to the thermodynamics of ideal solutions are provided. Finally, the theory is applied to the IDHKP-IDH glyoxylate bypass regulation system.
  The novelty of the theory is that it is applicable to CRNs with non-ideal thermodynamical behavior, which are prevalent in highly crowded cellular environments due to various interactions between the chemicals. Indeed, the analyzed example shows remarkable behavior ranging from hypersensitivity to negative-self regulations. These are effects which usually require strongly nonlinear reaction kinetics. However, here, they are obtained by tuning thermodynamical interactions providing a complementary, and physically well-founded, viewpoint on such phenomena.</description>

      <title>Modeling Platelet P2Y$_1$/$_{12}$ Pathway to Integrin Activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through experimental studies, many details of the pathway of integrin $\alpha_{\rm IIb}\beta_3$ activation by ADP during the platelet aggregation process have been mapped out. ADP binds to two separate G protein coupled receptors on platelet surfaces, leading to alterations in the regulation of the small GTPase RAP1. We seek to (1) gain insights into the relative contributions of both pathways to RAP1-mediated integrin activation and to (2) predict wildtype and mutated cell behavior in response to a continuous range of external agonist concentrations. To this end, we develop a dynamical systems model detailing the action of each protein in the two pathways up to the regulation of RAP1. We perform a parameter estimation using flow cytometry data to determine a number of unknown rate constants. We then validate with already published data; in particular, the model confirmed the effect of impaired P2Y$_1$ receptor desensitization or reduced RASA3 expression on RAP1 activation. We then predict the effect of protein expression levels on integrin activation and show that components of the P2Y$_{12}$ pathway are critical to the regulation of integrin. This model aids in our understanding of interindividual variability in platelet response to ADP and therapeutic P2Y$_{12}$ inhibition. It also provides a more detailed view of platelet activation in the ongoing mathematical study of platelet aggregation.</description>
