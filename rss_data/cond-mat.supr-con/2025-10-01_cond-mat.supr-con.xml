      <title>Interplay of competing bond-order and loop-current fluctuations as a possible mechanism for superconductivity in kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pairing symmetry and underlying mechanism for superconducting state of AV${}_3$Sb${}_5$ (A=K, Rb, Cs) kagome metal has been a topic of intense investigation. In this work, we consider an 8-band minimal model, which includes V, and the two types of Sb, both within and above/below the kagome plane. This model captures the Fermi surface pocket with significant in-plane Sb contribution near the zone center, and also has the two types of van Hove singularities (VHS), one of which has a strong out of plane Sb weight. By including V-V and V-planar Sb nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions, we obtain the susceptibilities for fluctuating bond-order and loop-current in both charge and spin channels, and examine the resulting superconducting instabilities. In particular, we find that the time-reversal odd (even) charge-loop-current (charge bond-order) fluctuations favor unconventional (conventional) pairing symmetry such as $s_{+-}$ and $d+id$ ($s_{++}$). Recent experimental works have highlighted the presence of $s$-wave pairing with two distinct gaps, one isotropic and one anisotropic. We discuss how this scenario may be compatible with either $s_{++}$ or $s_{+-}$ pairing, with an isotropic gap on the pocket dominated by in-plane Sb, but a highly anisotropic gap on V-dominated bands.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Tunable Thermal Diode Based on Bulk Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal diode is a growing technology and important for active thermal flow control. Since the theoretical designing of thermal diode in 2004, various kinds of solid-state thermal diodes have been theoretically and experimentally investigated. Here, we report on the observation of thermal rectification in bulk-size superconductor-normal metal junctions. High-purity (5N) wires of Pb and Al are soldered, and thermal conductivity (\k{appa}) of the junctions is measured in two different directions of the heat flow, forward (\k{appa}F) and reverse (\k{appa}R) directions. Thermal rectification ratio (\k{appa}F / \k{appa}R) of 1.75 is obtained at T ~ 5.2 K with H = 400 Oe. The merit of the Pb-Al junction is a large difference of \k{appa} in an order of several hundred W m-1 K-1 and magneto-tunability of the working temperature.</description>

      <title>Field-free Superconducting Diode Effect in FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) - the asymmetry of critical currents with respect to current direction - is a pivotal advancement in non-reciprocal superconductivity. While SDE has been realized in diverse systems, a fundamental challenge remains achieving field-free operation in iron-based superconductors with simple device geometries. Here, we report a non-volatile, field-free SDE in thin crystalline FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$(FTS), showing asymmetric critical currents with a rectification coefficient of 1.9% and operating temperatures up to 9 K. Intriguingly, a pronounced non-zero second harmonic resistance emerges at the superconducting transition, exhibiting a sign reversal under varying current and temperature. The SDE persists at zero magnetic field and the rectification coefficient($\eta$) exhibits an even symmetric dependence on the magnetic field, distinguishing it from magnetic chirality anisotropy mechanisms. In addition to this, we systematically ruled out influences from dynamic superconducting domains, thermal gradients, and sample geometry, while establishing that localized stress amplifies the rectification coefficient, likely constituting one of the principal contributing factors. These results establish FTS as a robust platform for realizing field-free superconducting diodes in a structurally simple platform.</description>

      <title>Large superconducting diode effect driven by edge states in twisted iron-chalcogenide Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE)-the unidirectional, dissipationless flow of supercurrent-is a critical element for future superconducting electronics. Achieving high efficiency under zero magnetic field is a key requirement. The Josephson junction constitutes a versatile SDE platform for exploiting quantum materials that exhibit ferromagnetism, topology, or unconventional superconductivity. However, a single two-dimensional material system that inherently offers these properties and allows for precise interface engineering, such as twisting, remains elusive. Here we report a record-high, field-free diode efficiency of ~30% in twist van der Waals Josephson heterostructures of the sign-change iron-chalcogenide superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45 and the conventional transition-metal dichalcogenide superconductor 2H-NbSe2. The diode response shows a striking twist-angle dependence: the efficiency peaks at crystallographic alignment and collapses with a small misorientation of ~7 deg. Importantly, the twist-angle evolution of superconducting interference measurements reveals that efficient nonreciprocity arises from asymmetric edge supercurrents, whereas bulk transport suppresses the effect. These findings establish edge states as the driving mechanism of the unconventional SDE, linking it to exotic pairing and topology in multiband iron-based superconductors. Our findings reveal intricate physics involving novel pairing symmetry, magnetism, and topology in the multiband iron-based superconductor, and offer a new route to high-performance superconducting diodes.</description>

      <title>Energy-density-driven ultrafast electronic excitations in a cuprate superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum materials requires ultrafast probes with spectral selectivity. We report femtosecond reflectivity measurements on the cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ using free-electron laser extreme-ultraviolet (23.5--177~eV) and near-infrared (1.5~eV) pump pulses. EUV pulses access deep electronic states, while NIR light excites valence-band transitions. Despite these distinct channels, both schemes produce nearly identical dynamics: above $T_c$, excitations relax through fast (100--300~fs) and slower (1--5~ps) channels; below $T_c$, a delayed component signals quasiparticle recombination and condensate recovery. We find that when electronic excitations are involved, the ultrafast response is governed mainly by absorbed energy rather than by the microscopic nature of the excitation. In contrast, bosonic driving in the THz or mid-infrared produces qualitatively different dynamics. By demonstrating that EUV excitation of a correlated superconductor yields macroscopic dynamics converging with those from optical pumping, this work defines a new experimental paradigm: FEL pulses at core-level energies provide a powerful means to probe and control nonequilibrium electronic states in quantum materials on their intrinsic femtosecond timescales. This establishes FEL-based EUV pumping as a new capability for ultrafast materials science, opening routes toward soft X-ray and attosecond studies of correlated dynamics.</description>

      <title>An InAsSb surface quantum well with in-situ deposited Nb as a platform for semiconductor-superconductor hybrid devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel semiconductor-superconductor hybrid material based on a molecular beam epitaxially grown InAsSb surface quantum well with an in-situ deposited Nb top layer. Relative to conventional Al-InAs based systems, the InAsSb surface quantum well offers a lower effective mass and stronger spin-orbit interaction, while the Nb layer has a higher critical temperature and a larger critical magnetic field. The in-situ deposition of the Nb results in a high-quality interface that enables strong coupling to the InAsSb quantum well. Transport measurements on Josephson junctions reveal an induced superconducting gap of 1.3 meV. Furthermore, a planar asymmetric SQUID is realized, exhibiting gate-tunable superimposed oscillations originating from both the individual Josephson junction and the full SQUID loop. The large induced superconducting gap combined with strong spin-orbit interaction position this material as an attractive platform for experiments exploring gate-tunable superconductivity and topological superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable Josephson parametric amplifiers based on semiconductor nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductor-semiconductor hybrid materials have been extensively used for experiments on electrically tunable quantum devices. Notably, Josephson junctions utilizing nanowire weak links have enabled a number of new gate-tunable qubits, including gatemons, Andreev level qubits and spin qubits. Conversely, superconducting parametric amplifiers based on Josephson junctions have not yet been implemented using nanowires, even though such nearly quantum limited amplifiers are key elements in experiments on quantum circuits. Here we present Josephson parametric amplifiers based on arrays of parallel InAs nanowires that feature a large critical current as required for linear amplification. The resonance frequency of the devices is gate-tunable by almost 1 GHz, with a gain exceeding 20 dB in multiple frequencies and noise approaching the quantum-limit. This new platform enables on-chip integration of gate-tunable qubits with quantum limited amplifiers using the same hybrid materials and on any substrate.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative fluctuation effects of charged bosonic fields: A quark-diquark model study at nonzero density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the renormalization group flow of the scale-dependent effective potential of a quark-diquark model with full field dependence at nonzero chemical potential. This includes a discussion of approximations in relation to complex bosonic fields and the Silver-Blaze property. The resulting flow equation for the scale-dependent effective potential can in principle be solved down to the infrared limit. For our quark-diquark model, which may serve as a low-energy model for dense strong-interaction matter, we find that a competition between the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer singularity and bosonic fluctuations can trigger a first-order phase transition at low temperatures that turns into a second-order phase transition at a tricritical point as the temperature increases.</description>

      <title>Scheme for braiding Majorana zero modes in vortices using an STT-matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18578v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs), promising for topological quantum computation, are naturally hosted in vortices of two-dimensional topological superconductors (TSCs). However, precise control and braiding of these vortex-bound MZMs remains a significant challenge. This work proposes and numerically demonstrates a novel braiding scheme utilizing a programmable matrix of spin transfer torque (STT) devices (STT-matrix) integrated with a TSC layer. By selectively activating individual STT elements, their localized stray fields enable deterministic manipulation, including driving, braiding, and fusion, of superconducting vortices and their associated MZMs. We establish a comprehensive simulation framework combining finite element analysis for STT-induced vortex formation, time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations for vortex dynamics and time-dependent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for MZM evolution. Simulations confirm the STT-matrix's capability for high-fidelity vortex manipulation and demonstrate MZM braiding dynamics. We quantify the impact of vortex acceleration and finite MZM coupling on braiding fidelity, showing it can be optimized by adjusting STT spacing and vortex separation. Furthermore, we demonstrate controlled MZM fusion and measure the resultant energy splitting. This STT-matrix-based approach offers a highly versatile, scalable, and potentially practical platform for operating MZMs within TSC vortices, advancing towards fault-tolerant topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Axion electrodynamics of Weyl superconductors with broken time-reversal symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low-energy effective description of Weyl semimetals is defined by the axion electrodynamics, which captures the effects arising due to the presence of nodes of opposite chirality in the electronic structure. Here we explore the magnetoelectric response of time-reversal breaking (TRB) Weyl superconductors in the London regime. The influence of the axion contribution leads to an increase in the London penetration depth$-$a behavior that can be anticipated by first considering the photon spectrum of a TRB Weyl semimetal. Moreover, we find that both the Meissner state and the vortex phase feature an interplay between the electric and magnetic fields. This leads to a nonvanishing electromagnetic angular momentum, which we calculate for a number of geometrical configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diodes have a nonreciprocal voltage versus current relationship, produced by breaking the space and time reversal symmetry. However, developing high-end superconducting computers requires a superconducting analogue of the traditional semiconductor diode. Such a superconducting diode exhibits non-reciprocity, or a high asymmetry in its critical currents. We present a model of a perfect superconducting diode based on a superconducting quantum interference device made with multiple superconducting nanowires. The diode predicted by our model has a large positive critical current, while the negative critical current can be exactly zero. This 100\% diode efficiency ($\eta = 1$) remains stable against small changes of the magnetic field. Another important result is that under certain and quite broad conditions such devices can act as supercurrent range controllers. In such device a supercurrent can flow with zero voltage applied, but only if the supercurrent is contained in some narrow, adjustable range, which excludes zero current.</description>

      <title>Thermal rectification in jointless Pb solid wire</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal rectification is observed in jointless Pb wires at temperatures near the superconducting transition of Pb under magnetic fields. Using different magnetic-field (H) response of temperature dependence of thermal conductivity (\k{appa}-T) under H parallel to J and H perpendicular to J where J is heat flow, we fabricated a jointless thermal diode. Thermal rectification is observed with the thermal rectification ratio (TRR) of 1.5 and the difference in \k{appa} of 330 W m-1 K-1 at T = 5.11 K under H = 400 Oe for a Pb wire with a 50%-bent (H perpendicular to J) and 50%-straight (H parallel to J) structure. The peak temperature of TRR can be tuned by the strength of applied magnetic field. By changing bent ratio to 40%-bent, a higher TRR exceeding 2 was observed. The Pb-jointless thermal diode will be a useful material for thermal management at cryogenic temperatures.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting circuits comprising Josephson junctions have spurred significant research activity due to their promise to realize scalable quantum computers. Effective Hamiltonians for these systems have traditionally been derived assuming the junction connects superconducting islands of infinite size. We derive a quantized Hamiltonian for a Josephson junction between finite-sized islands and predict measurable corrections to the qubit frequency and charge susceptibility to test the theory.</description>

Abstract: Two-level systems (TLSs) are tunneling states commonly found in amorphous materials that electrically couple to qubits, resonators, and vibrational modes in materials, leading to energy loss in those systems. Recent studies suggest that applying a large alternating electric field changes the oxide structure, potentially improving the performance of qubits and resonators. In this study, we probe the effect of alternating bias at cryogenic temperatures on TLS dynamics within amorphous oxide parallel-plate capacitors operating in the strongly coupled regime. We bias the TLSs in the capacitors using an electric field. This allows us to spectroscopically image TLSs and extract their densities and dipole moments. When an in-situ alternating bias is applied, the steady-state spectra from the standard TLS model disappear. Post-alternating bias TLS spectroscopy reveals transient behavior, in which the TLS frequency fluctuates on the order of minutes. Thermal cycling above 10 K reverses these effects, restoring the TLS spectrum to its original state, indicating a reversible mechanism. Importantly, the intrinsic loss tangent of the LC oscillator remains unchanged before and after the application of the alternating bias. We propose that the disappearance of the steady-state spectrum are caused by non-equilibrium energy build up from strain in the oxide film introduced by the pulsed voltage bias sequence. Understanding this non-equilibrium energy could inform future models of time-dependent TLS dynamics.</description>
