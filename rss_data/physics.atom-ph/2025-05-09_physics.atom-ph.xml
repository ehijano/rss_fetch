      <title>Photoionization time delays probe electron correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photoelectric effect, explained by Einstein in 1905, is often regarded as a one-electron phenomenon. However, in multi-electron systems, the interaction of the escaping electron with other electrons, referred to as electron correlation, plays an important role. For example, electron correlations in photoionization of the outer $s$-subshells of rare gas atoms lead to a substantial minimum in the ionization probability, which was theoretically predicted in 1972 and experimentally confirmed using synchrotron radiation. However, recent attosecond photoionization time delay measurements in argon strongly disagree with theory, thus raising questions on the nature of electron correlations leading to this minimum. In this work, combining high-spectral resolution attosecond interferometry experiments and novel theoretical calculations allows us to identify the most essential electron correlations affecting the photoemission. The measurement of time delays gives unprecedented insight into the photoionization process, unraveling details of the atomic potential experienced by the escaping electron and capturing its dynamics.</description>

      <title>Theoretical characterisation of the Barium II and Radium II ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental advances, including the ongoing development of an optical atomic clock in singly ionised radium, we perform a detailed theoretical characterisation of Ra+ and its lighter analogue, Ba+. Both ions are of interest for precision studies, including for atomic parity violation and searches for new physics beyond the standard model. Using the all-orders correlation potential method, including Breit and radiative quantum electrodynamics corrections, we perform high-accuracy calculations of electric-dipole (E1), electric-quadrupole (E2), and magnetic-dipole (M1) transition matrix elements between the low-lying s, p, and d states of these ions, as well as the excited-state lifetimes, polarizabilities, magic wavelengths, and magnetic dipole (A) hyperfine structure constants. By combining lifetime measurements with precise theoretical ratios, we extract high-accuracy determinations of the s-d_1/2 and s-d_3/2 E2 matrix elements. By combining hyperfine measurements with atomic theory, we extract parameters of the nuclear magnetisation distribution (the Bohr-Weisskopf effect) for 135-, 137-Ba and 223-, 225-Ra. These results provide theoretical input for ongoing and future experimental programs in fundamental physics and precision metrology.</description>

      <title>Single-bounce quantum gravimeter to measure the free-fall of anti-hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an innovative concept for a matter-wave gravimeter, where atoms prepared in a Heisenberg-limited quantum state perform a single bounce on a surface followed by a free fall that reveals interferences. This new approach to quantum gravimetry produces a more robust interference pattern compared to previous multi-bounce proposals. We specify numbers and expected performance for the GBAR experiment, which aims at measuring the free-fall acceleration of antihydrogen at CERN antimatter facilities, and show that this approach improves the expected accuracy of the measurement. Our method opens the door to gravity measurements on rare or exotic atomic species, especially in situations where experimental time or detection events are fundamentally constrained.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Raman scattering out of a metastable atomic qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metastable qubits in atomic systems can enable large-scale quantum computing by simplifying hardware requirements and adding efficient erasure conversion to the pre-existing toolbox of high-fidelity laser-based control. For trapped atomic ions, the fundamental error floor of this control is given by spontaneous Raman and Rayleigh scattering from short-lived excited states. We measure spontaneous Raman scattering rates out of a metastable $D_{5/2}$ qubit manifold of a single trapped $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion illuminated by 976 nm light that is -44 THz detuned from the dipole-allowed transition to the $P_{3/2}$ manifold. This supports the calculation of error rates from both types of scattering during one- and two-qubit gates on this platform, thus demonstrating that infidelities $&lt;10^{-4}$ are possible.</description>

      <title>Isotope-selective Ion Trapping via Sympathetic Cooling using a Surface-Electrode Trap with a Hole for Collimated Atomic Loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a surface-electrode ion trap with a square hole measuring $40\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ for atomic loading. The hole was fabricated using anisotropic etching of a silicon substrate and was designed to minimize potential distortion in the trapping region. By introducing the atomic beam through the hole, we achieved enhanced isotope selectivity and experimentally demonstrated the selective trapping of calcium isotope ions using an atomic oven. We successfully prepared isotope ion pairs directly from the oven via sympathetic cooling at a rate comparable to that achieved using ablation loading. The sympathetic cooling process occurred on the order of a few seconds. We demonstrated the direct generation of an ion chain above the through-hole. This approach can be applied for trapping a wide range of ion species using a remarkably simple experimental setup, making it desirable for several applications such as quantum-charge-coupled-device (QCCD) architectures and precision measurements of isotope shifts.</description>

      <title>Electron polarization in the resonant inelastic scattering on hydrogen-like ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the polarization of the electron beam acquired during the inelastic resonant scattering on hydrogen-like ions initially being in the ground state. The formation and subsequent Auger decay of the intermediate (3l3l') doubly excited states in the resonant channel modify the mechanism of polarization change by enhancing both spin-orbit and exchange interactions. Consequently, in the presence of the resonant channel, the acquired polarization can be clearly observed even for light ions when it is challenging to discern which state of the ion was excited in the process. We also show that the energy dependence of the polarization parameter clearly demonstrates strong interference both between the contributions of specific autoionizing states in the resonant channel and between the non-resonant and resonant channels.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal Monte Carlo modeling of loading and decay dynamics in an optical dipole trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we present our studies on intra-trap dynamics of an optical dipole trap (ODT) loaded from a Magneto-optical trap (MOT) of $^{87}$Rb atoms. A spatio-temporal Monte Carlo (MC) simulation approach has been employed in conjunction with the semi-classical theory based calculations for estimation of various intra-trap two-body loss parameters in the ODT. The temporal MC method based on estimated parameters from spatial MC, gives a close estimation of the experimentally observed atom-number evolution in ODT. We also find that, the decay rate of atoms in an ODT is dominated by momentum-transfer elastic collisions in the absence of MOT beams. However, in presence of MOT beams, the radiative escape process is the dominant two-body loss mechanism in the trap, which surpasses the fine-structure changing and hyperfine changing collisional losses by nearly an order of magnitude.</description>
