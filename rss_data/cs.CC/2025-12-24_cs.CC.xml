      <title>Reduction from the partition problem: Dynamic lot sizing problem with polynomial complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05017v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we polynomially reduce an instance of the partition problem to a dynamic lot sizing problem, and show that solving the latter problem solves the former problem. By solving the dynamic program formulation of the dynamic lot sizing problem, we show that the instance of the partition problem can be solved with pseudo-polynomial time complexity. Numerical results on solving instances of the partition problem are also provided using an implementation of the algorithm that solves the dynamic program. We conclude by discussing polynomial time solvability of the partition problem through further observation on the dynamic program formulation of the dynamic lot sizing problem.</description>

      <title>Lossless Model Compression via Joint Low-Rank Factorization Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-rank factorization is a popular model compression technique that minimizes the error $\delta$ between approximated and original weight matrices. Despite achieving performances close to the original models when $\delta$ is optimized, a performance discrepancy remains due to the separate optimization processes for low-rank factorization and model performance, resulting in unavoidable losses. We address this issue by introducing a novel joint optimization strategy for lossless low-rank weight factorization, which, for the first time, enhances the model's performance beyond the original. Our approach begins with a theoretical analysis of the relationship between low-rank factorization and model optimization objectives, establishing a precise perturbation range for matrix factorization errors on model performance. This challenge is then reformulated as a numerical rank deficiency problem with inequality constraints and develop a joint objective that simultaneously addresses factorization error and model performance. Based on the above analysis, we propose two optimization algorithms: \textbf{a lossless optimization algorithm} that maximizes model accuracy while ensuring compression, and \textbf{a compact optimization algorithm} that minimizes model size while preserving performance. These algorithms do not require fine-tuning and can directly compress numerous deep models to achieve lossless results. Our methods demonstrate robust efficacy across various vision and language tasks. For example, the compressed model reduced by 70\% on ResNext50 outperforms the original. Our code will be made public.</description>
