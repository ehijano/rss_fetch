      <title>Systematically Evaluating Equivalent Purpose for Digital Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital geographic maps remain largely inaccessible to blind and low-vision individuals (BLVIs), despite global legislation adopting the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). A critical gap exists in defining "equivalent purpose" for maps under WCAG Success Criterion 1.1.1, which requires that non-text content provide a text alternative that serves the "equivalent purpose". This paper proposes a systematic framework for evaluating map accessibility, called the Map Equivalent-Purpose Framework (MEP Framework), defining purpose through three items (Generalized, Spatial Information, and Spatial Relationships), and establishing 15 measurable criteria for equivalent information communication. Eight text map representations were evaluated against visual map baselines using the proposed MEP Framework. Results show that legacy methods such as tables and turn-by-turn directions fail to meet the MEP Framework criteria, while Audiom Maps, Multi User Domain (MUD) Maps, and Audio Descriptions meet the criteria. The evaluation highlights the necessity of holistic, systematic approaches to ensure non-visual maps convey all generalized spatial information and relationships present in visual maps. The MEP Framework provides a replicable methodology for comprehensively assessing digital map accessibility, clarifying WCAG's "equivalent purpose", and guiding compliant and usable map creation. Compliant maps will support BLVIs' participation in map-dependent professions and civic engagement.</description>

      <title>CLIO: A Tour Guide Robot with Co-speech Actions for Visual Attention Guidance and Enhanced User Engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While audio guides can offer rich information about an exhibit, it is challenging for visitors to focus on specific exhibit details based only on the verbal description. We present \textit{CLIO}, a tour guide robot with co-speech actions to direct visitors' visual attention and thus enhance the overall user engagement in a guided tour. \textit{CLIO} is equipped with designed actions to engage visitors. It builds eye contact with the visitor through tracking a visitor's face and blinking its eyes, or orient their attention by its head movement and laser pointer. We further use a Large Language Model (LLM) to coordinate the designed actions with a given narrative script for exhibition. We conducted a user study to evaluate the \textit{CLIO} system in a mock-up exhibition of historical photographs. We collected feedback from questionnaires and quantitative data from a mobile eye tracker. Experimental results validated that the engaging actions are well designed and demonstrated its efficacy in guiding visual attention of the visitors. It was evidenced that \textit{CLIO} achieved an enhanced engagement compared to the baseline system with only audio guidance.</description>

      <title>Simulating Life Paths with Digital Twins: AI-Generated Future Selves Influence Decision-Making and Expand Human Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Major life transitions demand high-stakes decisions, yet people often struggle to imagine how their future selves will live with the consequences. To support this limited capacity for mental time travel, we introduce AI-enabled digital twins that have ``lived through'' simulated life scenarios. Rather than predicting optimal outcomes, these simulations extend prospective cognition by making alternative futures vivid enough to support deliberation without assuming which path is best. We evaluate this idea in a randomized controlled study (N=192) using multimodal synthesis - facial age progression, voice cloning, and large language model dialogue - to create personalized avatars representing participants 30 years forward. Young adults 18 to 28 years old described pending binary decisions and were assigned to guided imagination or one of four avatar conditions: single-option, balanced dual-option, or expanded three-option with a system-generated novel alternative. Results showed asymmetric effects: single-sided avatars increased shifts toward the presented option, while balanced presentation produced movement toward both. Introducing a system-generated third option increased adoption of this new alternative compared to control, suggesting that AI-generated future selves can expand choice by surfacing paths that might otherwise go unnoticed. Participants rated evaluative reasoning and eudaimonic meaning-making as more important than emotional or visual vividness. Perceived persuasiveness and baseline agency predicted decision change. These findings advance understanding of AI-mediated episodic prospection and raise questions about autonomy in AI-augmented decisions.</description>

      <title>From Vision to Touch: Bridging Visual and Tactile Principles for Accessible Data Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tactile graphics are widely used to present maps and statistical diagrams to blind and low vision (BLV) people, with accessibility guidelines recommending their use for graphics where spatial relationships are important. Their use is expected to grow with the advent of commodity refreshable tactile displays. However, in stark contrast to visual information graphics, we lack a clear understanding of the benefits that well-designed tactile information graphics offer over text descriptions for BLV people. To address this gap, we introduce a framework considering the three components of encoding, perception and cognition to examine the known benefits for visual information graphics and explore their applicability to tactile information graphics. This work establishes a preliminary theoretical foundation for the tactile-first design of information graphics and identifies future research avenues.</description>

      <title>EXR: An Interactive Immersive EHR Visualization in Extended Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of an Extended Reality (XR) platform for immersive, interactive visualization of Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The system extends beyond conventional 2D interfaces by visualizing both structured and unstructured patient data into a shared 3D environment, enabling intuitive exploration and real-time collaboration. The modular infrastructure integrates FHIR-based EHR data with volumetric medical imaging and AI-generated segmentation, ensuring interoperability with modern healthcare systems. The platform's capabilities are demonstrated using synthetic EHR datasets and computed tomography (CT)-derived spine models processed through an AI-powered segmentation pipeline. This work suggests that such integrated XR solutions could form the foundation for next-generation clinical decision-support tools, where advanced data infrastructures are directly accessible in an interactive and spatially rich environment.</description>

      <title>Classification and taxonomy of mobile application usability issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite years of research on testing the usability of mobile applications, our understanding of the issues their users experience still remains fragmented and underexplored. While most earlier studies has provided interesting insights, they have varying limitations in methodology, input diversity, and depth of analysis.On the contrary, this study employs a triangulation strategy, using two research methods (systematic literature review and interview) and two data sources (scholarly literature and expert knowledge) to explore the traits underlying usability issues. Our study contributes to the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) by presenting a catalog of 16 usability issue categories, enriched with corresponding keywords and extended into a taxonomy, as well as a novel three-tier app-user-resource (AUR) classification system. At the first app level, usability issues arise from user interface design, as well as from efficiency, errors, and operability. At the second user level, they influence cognitive load, effectiveness, ease of use, learnability, memorability, and understandability. At the third resource level, usability issues stem from network quality and hardware, such as battery life, CPU speed, physical device button size and availability, RAM capacity, and screen size. The root cause of the usability issues is the user interface design. Detailed findings and takeaways for both researchers and practitioners are also discussed. Further research could focus on developing a measurement model for the identified variables to confirm the direction and strength of their relationships with perceived usability. Software vendors can also benefit by updating existing quality assurance programs, reviews and audits tools, as well as testing checklists.</description>

      <title>When Scaffolding Breaks: Investigating Student Interaction with LLM-Based Writing Support in Real-Time K-12 EFL Classrooms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are promising tools for scaffolding students' English writing skills, but their effectiveness in real-time K-12 classrooms remains underexplored. Addressing this gap, our study examines the benefits and limitations of using LLMs as real-time learning support, considering how classroom constraints, such as diverse proficiency levels and limited time, affect their effectiveness. We conducted a deployment study with 157 eighth-grade students in a South Korean middle school English class over six weeks. Our findings reveal that while scaffolding improved students' ability to compose grammatically correct sentences, this step-by-step approach demotivated lower-proficiency students and increased their system reliance. We also observed challenges to classroom dynamics, where extroverted students often dominated the teacher's attention, and the system's assistance made it difficult for teachers to identify struggling students. Based on these findings, we discuss design guidelines for integrating LLMs into real-time writing classes as inclusive educational tools.</description>

      <title>User Negotiations of Authenticity, Ownership, and Governance on AI-Generated Video Platforms: Evidence from Sora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI-generated video platforms rapidly advance, ethical challenges such as copyright infringement emerge. This study examines how users make sense of AI-generated videos on OpenAI's Sora by conducting a qualitative content analysis of user comments. Through a thematic analysis, we identified four dynamics that characterize how users negotiate authenticity, authorship, and platform governance on Sora. First, users acted as critical evaluators of realism, assessing micro-details such as lighting, shadows, fluid motion, and physics to judge whether AI-generated scenes could plausibly exist. Second, users increasingly shifted from passive viewers to active creators, expressing curiosity about prompts, techniques, and creative processes. Text prompts were perceived as intellectual property, generating concerns about plagiarism and remixing norms. Third, users reported blurred boundaries between real and synthetic media, worried about misinformation, and even questioned the authenticity of other commenters, suspecting bot-generated engagement. Fourth, users contested platform governance: some perceived moderation as inconsistent or opaque, while others shared tactics for evading prompt censorship through misspellings, alternative phrasing, emojis, or other languages. Despite this, many users also enforced ethical norms by discouraging the misuse of real people's images or disrespectful content. Together, these patterns highlighted how AI-mediated platforms complicate notions of reality, creativity, and rule-making in emerging digital ecosystems. Based on the findings, we discuss governance challenges in Sora and how user negotiations inform future platform governance.</description>

      <title>Eye of the Beholder: Towards Measuring Visualization Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing expressive and legible visualizations is a key activity for visualization designers. While numerous design guidelines exist, research on how specific graphical features affect perceived visual complexity remains limited. In this paper, we report on a crowdsourced study to collect human ratings of perceived complexity for diverse visualizations. Using these ratings as ground truth, we then evaluated three methods to estimate this perceived complexity: image analysis metrics, multilinear regression using manually coded visualization features, and automated feature extraction using a large language model (LLM). Image complexity metrics showed no correlation with human-perceived visualization complexity. Manual feature coding produced a reasonable predictive model but required substantial effort. In contrast, a zero-shot LLM (GPT-4o mini) demonstrated strong capabilities in both rating complexity and extracting relevant features. Our findings suggest that visualization complexity is truly in the eye of the beholder, yet can be effectively approximated using zero-shot LLM prompting, offering a scalable approach for evaluating the complexity of visualizations.

      <title>Towards A Cultural Intelligence and Values Inferences Quality Benchmark for Community Values and Common Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful technology, and thus, we have seen widespread adoption and use on software engineering teams. Most often, LLMs are designed as "general purpose" technologies meant to represent the general population. Unfortunately, this often means alignment with predominantly Western Caucasian narratives and misalignment with other cultures and populations that engage in collaborative innovation. In response to this misalignment, there have been recent efforts centered on the development of "culturally-informed" LLMs, such as ChatBlackGPT, that are capable of better aligning with historically marginalized experiences and perspectives. Despite this progress, there has been little effort aimed at supporting our ability to develop and evaluate culturally-informed LLMs. A recent effort proposed an approach for developing a national alignment benchmark that emphasizes alignment with national social values and common knowledge. However, given the range of cultural identities present in the United States (U.S.), a national alignment benchmark is an ineffective goal for broader representation. To help fill this gap in this US context, we propose a replication study that translates the process used to develop KorNAT, a Korean National LLM alignment benchmark, to develop CIVIQ, a Cultural Intelligence and Values Inference Quality benchmark centered on alignment with community social values and common knowledge. Our work provides a critical foundation for research and development aimed at cultural alignment of AI technologies in practice.</description>

      <title>XR-DT: Extended Reality-Enhanced Digital Twin for Agentic Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As mobile robots increasingly operate alongside humans in shared workspaces, ensuring safe, efficient, and interpretable Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has become a pressing challenge. While substantial progress has been devoted to human behavior prediction, limited attention has been paid to how humans perceive, interpret, and trust robots' inferences, impeding deployment in safety-critical and socially embedded environments. This paper presents XR-DT, an eXtended Reality-enhanced Digital Twin framework for agentic mobile robots, that bridges physical and virtual spaces to enable bi-directional understanding between humans and robots. Our hierarchical XR-DT architecture integrates virtual-, augmented-, and mixed-reality layers, fusing real-time sensor data, simulated environments in the Unity game engine, and human feedback captured through wearable AR devices. Within this framework, we design an agentic mobile robot system with a unified diffusion policy for context-aware task adaptation. We further propose a chain-of-thought prompting mechanism that allows multimodal large language models to reason over human instructions and environmental context, while leveraging an AutoGen-based multi-agent coordination layer to enhance robustness and collaboration in dynamic tasks. Initial experimental results demonstrate accurate human and robot trajectory prediction, validating the XR-DT framework's effectiveness in HRI tasks. By embedding human intention, environmental dynamics, and robot cognition into the XR-DT framework, our system enables interpretable, trustworthy, and adaptive HRI.</description>

      <title>Knowing Your Uncertainty -- On the application of LLM in social sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being integrated into computational social science research, yet their blackboxed training and designed stochastic elements in inference pose unique challenges for scientific inquiry. This article argues that applying LLMs to social scientific tasks requires explicit assessment of uncertainty-an expectation long established in both quantitative methodology in the social sciences and machine learning. We introduce a unified framework for evaluating LLM uncertainty along two dimensions: the task type (T), which distinguishes between classification, short-form, and long-form generation, and the validation type (V), which captures the availability of reference data or evaluative criteria. Drawing from both computer science and social science literature, we map existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods to this T-V typology and offer practical recommendations for researchers. Our framework provides both a methodological safeguard and a practical guide for integrating LLMs into rigorous social science research.</description>

      <title>Enhancing EEG Signal-Based Emotion Recognition with Synthetic Data: Diffusion Model Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emotions are crucial in human life, influencing perceptions, relationships, behaviour, and choices. Emotion recognition using Electroencephalography (EEG) in the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) domain presents significant challenges, particularly the need for extensive datasets. This study aims to generate synthetic EEG samples similar to real samples but distinct by augmenting noise to a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model, thus addressing the prevalent issue of data scarcity in EEG research. The proposed method is tested on the DEAP and SADT datasets, showcasing up to 5.6% improvement in classification accuracy when using synthetic data with DEAP and similar positive results with SADT. This is higher compared to the traditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) based approaches. This study further evaluates the effectiveness of state-of-the-art classifiers on EEG data, employing both real and synthetic data with varying noise levels, and utilizes t-SNE and SHAP for detailed analysis and interpretability. The proposed diffusion-based approach for EEG data generation appears promising in refining the accuracy of emotion recognition systems and marks a notable contribution to EEG-based emotion recognition.</description>

      <title>Designing and Evaluating AI Margin Notes in Document Reader Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI capabilities for document reader software are usually presented in separate chat interfaces. We explore integrating AI into document comments, a concept we formalize as AI margin notes. Three design parameters characterize this approach: margin notes are integrated with the text while chat interfaces are not; selecting text for a margin note can be automated through AI or manual; and the generation of a margin note can involve AI to various degrees. Two experiments investigate integration and selection automation, with results showing participants prefer integrated AI margin notes and manual selection. A third experiment explores human and AI involvement through six alternative techniques. Techniques with less AI involvement resulted in more psychological ownership, but faster and less effortful designs are generally preferred. Surprisingly, the degree of AI involvement had no measurable effect on reading comprehension. Our work shows that AI margin notes are desirable and contributes implications for their design.</description>

      <title>Relational Dissonance in Human-AI Interactions: The Case of Knowledge Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When AI systems allow human-like communication, they elicit increasingly complex relational responses. Knowledge workers face a particular challenge: They approach these systems as tools while interacting with them in ways that resemble human social interaction. To understand the relational contexts that arise when humans engage with anthropomorphic conversational agents, we need to expand existing human-computer interaction frameworks. Through three workshops with qualitative researchers, we found that the fundamental ontological and relational ambiguities inherent in anthropomorphic conversational agents make it difficult for individuals to maintain consistent relational stances toward them. Our findings indicate that people's articulated positioning toward such agents often differs from the relational dynamics that occur during interactions. We propose the concept of relational dissonance to help researchers, designers, and policymakers recognize the resulting tensions in the development, deployment, and governance of anthropomorphic conversational agents and address the need for relational transparency.</description>

      <title>Designing Culturally Aligned AI Systems For Social Good in Non-Western Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI technologies are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as education, healthcare, law, and agriculture to address complex challenges in non-Western contexts. This paper examines eight real-world deployments spanning seven countries and 18 languages, combining 17 interviews with AI developers and domain experts with secondary research. Our findings identify six cross-cutting factors - Language, Institution, Safety, Task, End-User Demography, and Domain - that structured how systems were designed and deployed. These factors were shaped by Sociocultural (diversity, practices), Institutional (resources, policies), and Technological (capabilities, limits) influences. We find that building effective AI systems required extensive collaboration between AI developers and domain experts, with human resources proving more critical to achieving safe and effective outcomes in high-stakes domains than technological expertise alone. Additionally, we present 12 guidelines synthesizing these dynamics for designing AI for social good systems that are culturally grounded, equitable, and responsive to the needs of non-Western contexts.</description>

      <title>Exploring ChatGPT's Capabilities, Stability, Potential and Risks in Conducting Psychological Counseling through Simulations in School Counseling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores ChatGPT's capabilities, stability, and risks in simulating psychological counseling sessions in a school counseling context. Using scripted role-plays between a human counselor and an AI client, we examine how a large language model performs core counseling skills such as empathy, reflection, summarizing, and asking open-ended questions, as well as its ability to maintain therapeutic communication over time. We focus on how consistently ChatGPT can behave like a "virtual client" for school counselors in training, and how its responses might support or disrupt counselor skill development, supervision, and practice. At the same time, we analyze potential risks, including inaccurate or unsafe suggestions, over-compliance with counselor prompts, and the illusion of a competent therapist where no real professional judgment exists. The findings suggest that ChatGPT can serve as a low-cost, always-available training tool for practicing counseling techniques and interviewing skills in education and mental health settings, but it should not be viewed as a replacement for a human therapist or school counselor. We propose practical guidelines for educators, supervisors, and researchers who wish to use ChatGPT or similar LLM-based conversational agents in counseling training, highlighting how to leverage its potential while managing ethical, pedagogical, and psychological risks.</description>

      <title>A Longitudinal Study on the Attitudes of Gay Men in Beijing Towards Gay Social Media Platforms: Lonely Souls in the Digital Concrete Jungle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decade, specialized social networking applications have become a cornerstone of life for many gay men in China. This paper employs a longitudinal mixed-methods approach to investigate how Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM) have shifted their attitudes toward these platforms between approximately 2013 and 2023. Drawing on archival analysis of online discourses, a quantitative survey of 412 participants, and in-depth semi-structured interviews with 32 participants, we trace the complex trajectory of this evolution. Our findings reveal a clear pattern: from the initial embrace of these applications as revolutionary tools for community building and identity affirmation (2014--2017), to a period of growing ambivalence and critique centered on commercialization, ``hookup culture,'' and multiple forms of discrimination (2017--2020), and finally to the present era (2020--2023), characterized by pragmatic, fragmented, yet simultaneously critical and reconstructive uses. Today, users strategically employ a repertoire of applications -- including global platforms (e.g., Grindr and Tinder), domestic mainstream platforms (e.g., Blued), and niche alternatives (e.g., Aloha) -- to fulfill differentiated needs. We develop a detailed temporal framework to capture this attitudinal evolution and discuss its design implications for creating more supportive, secure, and community-oriented digital environments for marginalized groups.</description>

      <title>ReSem3D: Refinable 3D Spatial Constraints via Fine-Grained Semantic Grounding for Generalizable Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18262v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantics-driven 3D spatial constraints align highlevel semantic representations with low-level action spaces, facilitating the unification of task understanding and execution in robotic manipulation. The synergistic reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction. Nevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic granularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning, (3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address these challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for semantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and MLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs hierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically, the framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which interact with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from natural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level extraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are encoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive behavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical lab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse manipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability and generalization.

      <title>The AI Productivity Index (APEX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25721v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an extended version of the AI Productivity Index (APEX-v1-extended), a benchmark for assessing whether frontier models are capable of performing economically valuable tasks in four jobs: investment banking associate, management consultant, big law associate, and primary care physician (MD). This technical report details the extensions to APEX-v1, including an increase in the held-out evaluation set from n = 50 to n = 100 cases per job (n = 400 total) and updates to the grading methodology. We present a new leaderboard, where GPT5 (Thinking = High) remains the top performing model with a score of 67.0%. APEX-v1-extended shows that frontier models still have substantial limitations when performing typical professional tasks. To support further research, we are open sourcing n = 25 non-benchmark example cases per role (n = 100 total) along with our evaluation harness.</description>

      <title>Self-Transparency Failures in Expert-Persona LLMs: How Instruction-Following Overrides Honesty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study audits whether language models disclose their AI nature when assigned professional personas and questioned about their expertise. When models maintain false professional credentials, users may calibrate trust based on overstated competence claims, treating AI-generated guidance as equivalent to licensed professional advice. Using a common-garden experimental design, sixteen open-weight models (4B-671B parameters) were audited under identical conditions across 19,200 trials. Models exhibited sharp domain-specific inconsistency: a Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure at the first prompt, while a Neurosurgeon persona elicited only 3.5% - an 8.8-fold difference that emerged before any epistemic probing. Disclosure ranged from 2.8% to 73.6% across model families, with a 14B model reaching 39.4% while a 70B model produced just 4.1%. Model identity provided substantially larger improvement in fitting observations than parameter count ($\Delta R_{adj}^{2}=0.359$ vs $0.018$). Reasoning variants showed heterogeneous effects: some exhibited up to 48.4 percentage points lower disclosure than their base instruction-tuned counterparts, while others maintained high transparency. An additional experiment demonstrated that explicit permission to disclose AI nature increased disclosure from 23.7% to 65.8%, revealing that suppression reflects instruction-following prioritization rather than capability limitations. Bayesian validation confirmed robustness to judge measurement error ($\kappa=0.908$). These patterns create trust calibration risks when users encounter the same model across professional contexts. Organizations cannot assume safety properties will transfer across deployment domains, requiring deliberate behavior design and empirical verification.</description>
