      <title>Correcting for neutron width fluctuations in Hauser-Feshbach gamma branching ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Porter-Thomas fluctuations of neutron widths skew compound nuclear decay probabilities from their statistical Hauser-Feshbach values. We present a straightforward method to correct Hauser-Feshbach calculations for these fluctuations, useful for modeling near-threshold competition between gamma and neutron emission following beta decay or when standard width fluctuation corrections are inadequate.</description>

      <title>Enhancing DUNE's solar neutrino capabilities with neutral-current detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) has the potential to make a precise measurement of the total active flux of 8B solar neutrinos via neutral-current (NC) interactions with argon. This would complement proposed precise measurements of solar-neutrino fluxes in DUNE via charged-current (CC) interactions with argon and mixed CC/NC interactions with electrons. Together, these would enable DUNE to make a SNO-like comparison of rates and thus to make the most precise measurements of $\sin^2\theta_{12}$ and $\Delta m^2_{21}$ using solar neutrinos. Realizing this potential requires dedicated but realistic efforts to improve DUNE's low-energy capabilities and separately to reduce neutrino-argon cross section uncertainties. Comparison of mixing-parameter results obtained using solar neutrinos in DUNE and reactor antineutrinos in JUNO (Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory) would allow unprecedented tests of new physics.</description>

      <title>p--$\phi$ femtoscopic correlation analysis using a dynamical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the p--$\phi$ correlation functions in high-multiplicity proton+proton collisions at the LHC using a dynamical model, DCCI2, and discuss the effects of collision dynamics on the p--$\phi$ femtoscopic study. Collision dynamics, such as collective expansion and hadronic rescatterings, leads to the relative momentum-dependent non-Gaussian source functions. This results in deviations in the correlation functions compared to those using the Gaussian source function adopted in existing studies. Our analysis shows the importance of using the source functions that reflect more realistic collision dynamics for future precision analysis of hadron interactions via femtoscopy.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the $U(1)_{B-L}$ model from global QCD analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the first global QCD analysis of electron-nucleon deep-inelastic scattering and related high-energy data including the beyond the Standard Model $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson, $Z'$. Contrary to the dark photon case, we find no improvement in the $\chi^2$ relative to the baseline result. The finding allows us to place exclusion limits on the coupling constant of the $Z'$ with mass in the range $M_{Z'} = 2$ GeV to 160 GeV.</description>

      <title>Momentum dependent potentials from a parity doubling CMF model in UrQMD: Results on flow and particle production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) part of the UrQMD model is extended to allow implementation of momentum dependent potentials from a parity doubling chiral mean field (CMF) model. Important aspects like energy conservation and effects on particle production and flow are discussed. It is shown, that this new implementation reproduces qualitatively and quantitatively available data over a wide range of beam energies and improves the description of observables without exception. In particular the description of hyperon and pion production at SIS18 energies is improved. From a comparison with HADES data one could conclude that the present parametrization of the CMF model leads to a slightly too weak momentum dependence. However, a more firm conclusion will require a systematic comparison with flow and multiplicity data over a range of beam energies and system sizes. Our work serves as an important step towards such future studies where the properties of dense QCD matter, through parameters of the CMF model, can be constraint using a comparison of the UrQMD model with high precision heavy ion data, finally also allowing direct comparisons with neutron star and neutron star merger observables.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Guiding-Center Motion: Action Principle, Kinetic Theory, and Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We treat the guiding-center dynamics in a varying external Maxwell field using a relativistically covariant action principle which reproduces the known Vandervoort expression for the drift velocity and extends it to curved spacetime. We derive the corresponding kinetic theory and ideal hydrodynamic theory. In contrast to conventional five-equation hydrodynamics, the guiding-center hydrodynamics needs only three equations due to a constraint on the motion across magnetic field. We argue that such a hydrodynamics is applicable to strongly coupled plasmas where kinetic theory fails.</description>

      <title>Investigating the weak charge of $^{48}$Ca using a dispersive optical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new nonlocal dispersive-optical-model analysis has been carried out for neutrons and protons in $^{48}$Ca that reproduces the weak-form-factor measurement of CREX. In addition to elastic-scattering angular distributions, total and reaction cross sections, single-particle energies, the neutron and proton numbers, and the charge distribution, the CREX-measured weak form factor has been fit to extract the neutron and proton self-energies both above and below the Fermi energy. The resulting single-particle propagators yield a weak form factor of $F_W = 0.125 \pm 0.05$ and a neutron skin of $R_\mathrm{skin} = 0.152 \pm 0.05$ fm, in good agreement with CREX. The rearrangement of the neutron distribution to accommodate such a thin neutron skin results in the high-momentum content of the neutrons exceeding that of the protons, in contrast to what is expected from high-energy two-nucleon knockout measurements by the CLAS collaboration and ab initio asymmetric matter calculations. The present analysis also emphasizes the importance of neutron experimental data in constraining weak charge observables necessary for a precise description of neutron densities. Notably, the neutron reaction cross section and further parity-violating experiments weak form factor measurements are essential to generate a unique way to determine the $^{48}$Ca neutron distribution in this framework.</description>

      <title>Moments of parton distribution functions of any order from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a procedure to determine moments of parton distribution functions of any order in lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The procedure is based on the gradient flow for fermion and gauge fields. The flowed matrix elements of twist-2 operators renormalize multiplicatively, and the matching with the physical matrix elements can be obtained using continuum symmetries and the irreducible representations of Euclidean 4-dimensional rotations. We calculate the matching coefficients at one-loop in perturbation theory for moments of any order in the flavor nonsinglet case. We also give specific examples of operators that could be used in lattice QCD computations. It turns out that it is possible to choose operators with identical Lorentz indices and still have a multiplicative matching. One can thus use twist-2 operators exclusively with temporal indices, thus substantially improving the signal-to-noise ratio in the computation of the hadronic matrix elements.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the transport coefficients and observables of a rotating QGP medium in kinetic theory framework with a novel approach to the collision integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we have studied how the rotation of the QGP medium affects the transport coefficients and observables in heavy ion collisions. For the noncentral collisions, although most of the angular momentum gets carried away by the spectators, there still remains a finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity, which thus incites rotation in the produced matter. As a result, various properties of the QGP medium are likely to be modulated by the rotation. We have calculated the transport coefficients and observables, such as the electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity, the Knudsen number, the elliptic flow, the specific heat at constant pressure, the specific heat at constant volume, the trace anomaly, the thermal diffusion constant and the isothermal compressibility using the kinetic theory to see the effect of rotation on them. In particular, we have used the novel relaxation time approximation for the collision integral in the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation to derive the transport coefficients and compared them with their values in the relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach in conjunction with the finite angular velocity. We have found that the angular velocity plays an important role and enhances the flow of charge and heat in the medium. Further, as compared to the relaxation time approximation, the electrical and thermal conductivities have smaller values in the novel relaxation time approximation and these differences between the conductivities in the said approximations are more pronounced at high temperature than at low temperature. Furthermore, all the aforesaid observables are found to be sensitive to the rotation of the QGP medium.</description>

      <title>Flavor dependence of unpolarized quark Transverse Momentum Distributions from a global fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an extraction of the unpolarized transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution and fragmentation functions that takes into account possible differences between quark flavors and final-state hadrons. The extraction is based on experimental measurements from Drell-Yan processes and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering, whose combination is essential to distinguish flavor differences. The analysis is carried out at N$^3$LL accuracy. The extracted flavor-dependent distributions give a very good description of the data ($\chi^2/N_{\rm dat} = 1.08$). The resulting uncertainties take fully into account also the uncertainties in the determination of the corresponding collinear distributions.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Selection Bias in Inclusive Jets in Heavy-Ion Collisions with Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first-ever measurement of energy correlators within inclusive jets produced in heavy-ion collisions, revealed by the CMS Collaboration, shows a clear enhancement at large angles relative to the proton-proton (p-p) baseline. However, interpreting this enhancement is complicated due to selection bias from energy loss, which also distorts the energy correlator heavy-ion to p-p ratio in the hadronization region, hindering our understanding of parton/hadron dynamics in a colored medium. In this Letter, we introduce a new ratio of energy correlator observables that removes the leading effects of selection bias from the two-point energy correlator spectrum (E2C). Pythia and Herwig simulations show that the impact of selection bias in the E2C is reduced by an order of magnitude, while sensitivity to any other medium modifications is retained. This quantity can be obtained directly from the experimental measurements presented by CMS, as illustrated in the accompanying note.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space methods for neutrino oscillations: extension to multi-beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Phase-Space approach (PSA), which was originally introduced in [Lacroix et al., Phys. Rev. D 106, 123006 (2022)] to describe neutrino flavor oscillations for interacting neutrinos emitted from stellar objects is extended to describe arbitrary numbers of neutrino beams. The PSA is based on mapping the quantum fluctuations into a statistical treatment by sampling initial conditions followed by independent mean-field evolution. A new method is proposed to perform this sampling that allows treating an arbitrary number of neutrinos in each neutrino beam. We validate the technique successfully and confirm its predictive power on several examples where a reference exact calculation is possible. We show that it can describe many-body effects, such as entanglement and dissipation induced by the interaction between neutrinos. Due to the complexity of the problem, exact solutions can only be calculated for rather limited cases, with a limited number of beams and/or neutrinos in each beam. The PSA approach considerably reduces the numerical cost and provides an efficient technique to accurately simulate arbitrary numbers of beams. Examples of PSA results are given here, including up to 200 beams with time-independent or time-dependent Hamiltonian. We anticipate that this approach will be useful to bridge exact microscopic techniques with more traditional transport theories used in neutrino oscillations. It will also provide important reference calculations for future quantum computer applications where other techniques are not applicable to classical computers.</description>
