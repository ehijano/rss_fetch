      <title>Electron polarization induced by electroweak interaction in high-energy scattering off light nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron polarization plays a significant role in studies on nuclear scattering. Nevertheless, the development of a comprehensive approach to such a problem remains challenging, particularly at the relativistic electron-energy scale. Herein, we present a theoretical approach to investigate the impact of electron polarization in scattering off unoriented light nuclei, based on the multipole expansion for the scattering cross section at high energies. Numerical calculations for stable $^{6,7}$Li and unstable $^{7}$Be nuclei show that the longitudinal polarization and weak interaction are not explicitly correlated when electrons scatter at 0$^{\circ}$ for all energy scales. In contrast, their correlation is strongly exhibited at other scattering angles when energy exceeds 10 GeV. A comparison between stable and unstable nuclei reveals that the stability of nuclei significantly affects the electron polarization contribution to the scattering cross section. This study opens new approaches to the nuclear structure problems, in particular the EMC effect, via the deep inelastic electron-nucleus scattering using the unified electroweak theory.</description>

      <title>Ideal Boson Particle-Antiparticle System at Finite Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamic properties of an ideal bosonic system composed of particles and antiparticles at finite temperatures are examined within the framework of a scalar field model. It is assumed that particle-antiparticle pair creation occurs; however, the system is simultaneously subject to exact charge (isospin) conservation. To implement this constraint, we first consider the system within the Grand Canonical Ensemble and then transform to the Canonical Ensemble using a Legendre transformation. This procedure provides a formally consistent scheme for incorporating the chemical potential at the microscopic level into the Canonical Ensemble framework. To enforce exact conservation of charge (isospin, N_I), we further analyze the thermodynamic properties of the system within the extended Canonical Ensemble, in which the chemical potential becomes a thermodynamic function of the temperature and conserved charge. It is shown that as the temperature decreases, the system undergoes a second-order phase transition to a Bose-Einstein condensate at the critical temperature T_c, but only when the conserved charge is finite, N_I=const \ne 0. In a particle-antiparticle system, the condensate forms exclusively in the component with the dominant particle number density, which determines the excess charge. We demonstrate that the symmetry breaking of the ground state at T=0 results from a first-order phase transition associated with the formation of a Bose-Einstein condensate. Although the transition involves symmetry breaking, it is not spontaneous in the strict field-theoretic sense, but is instead induced by the external injection of particles. Potential experimental signals of Bose-Einstein condensation of pions produced in high-energy nuclear collisions are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Nucleus-nucleus potentials in the scattering of tightly and weakly bound systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \begin{description} \item[Background] Fusion reactions play an important role in nucleosynthesis and in applications to society. Yet they remain challenging to model. \item[Purpose] In this work, we investigate the features of the nucleus-nucleus potentials that describe fusion cross sections and compare with those needed for realistic calculations of elastic scattering and other direct-reaction cross sections. \item[Method] We perform coupled-channel calculations for studying elastic and fusion reactions around the Coulomb barrier with a tightly bound projectile ($^{16}$O+$^{144}$Sm). We also perform Continuum Discretized Coupled Channel calculations to study elastic ($^{8}$B+$^{58}$Ni) and fusion ($^{6}$Li+$^{198}$Pt) of loosely bound projectiles in the same energy regime. \item[Results] We contrast the coupled-channel results with those obtained in a single-channel solution with different assumptions for polarization potentials to shed light on the relevant absorption terms required for the two different reaction channels. \item[Conclusions] Our results suggest that different approximations may be required for modeling direct processes and for modeling fusion reactions. \end{description}</description>

      <title>Giant Dipole Resonance and Related Spin-dependent Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) and related spin-dependent excitations in heavy even-even axial nuclei are studied within the Wigner Function Moments method. The calculations are based on the Time Dependent Hartree-Fock equations for the density matrix which are converted into the equations for the spin-dependent Wigner function. Integrating them over the phase space with the weights $r_\mu$ and $p_\mu$ one gets the equations that describe the coupled dynamics of the first rank tensors associated with electric dipole ($E1$) and magnetic quadrupole ($M2$) responses.
  The energies and excitation probabilities of the $K^\pi=0^-$ and $K^\pi=1^-$ GDR components are calculated. The influence of spin degrees of freedom on the characteristics of GDR is estimated. The spin degrees of freedom give rise to the charge-conserving electric Spin Dipole Resonance (SDR) and magnetic quadrupole excitations. The properties of the SDR are studied. The energies of the magnetic quadrupole isovector and isoscalar excitations as well as the spin contribution to the corresponding transition strengths are estimated. The induced by deformation $K$-splitting of the $M2$ excitations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Tidal deformability and compactness of neutron stars and massive pulsars from semi-microscopic equations of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal deformability measures how NS can comfortably deform as a response to an applied tidal field. We use updated constraints on the mass, radius, and tidal deformability of neutron star (NS) objects and pulsars to examine nuclear equations of state (EOS) based on realistic finite-range M3Y nucleon-nucleon interaction, which have been successfully used to describe low- and high-dense nuclear matter (NM). We then employ these EOSs to examine the impact of tidal deformability and compactness of NSs on their structure. We found that the EOSs from CDM3Y-230 to CDM3Y-330 characterized with the saturation incompressibility ${K}_{0}=230-330$ MeV together yield more limited ranges of tidal deformability and radius for NS objects than their experimentally inferred ranges. For light NS ($M&lt;\text{M}_{\odot}$), both ${k}_{2}$ and $\mathcal{C}$ decreases upon decreasing the NS mass, which enhances its tidal deformability. The stiffness of the NS core matter has shown a minor effect on the tidal deformability of such NS ($M&lt;\text{M}_{\odot}$). An opposite behavior is obtained as an increase in the tidal Love number but a decrease in the more effective compactness of NS ($M&gt;\text{M}_{\odot}$), upon increasing (decreasing) the stiffness of the employed EOS (its mass). This appears as enhanced tidal deformability indicated at a larger radius for NS of stiffer NM and for the lighter NS above $\text{M}_{\odot}$. Unified description of some correlations between tidal deformability, tidal Love number, and NS compactness is provided independent of the details of the considered EOS.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Model Selection and Uncertainty Propagation for Beam Energy Scan Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the Bayesian model selection method (based on the Bayes factor) to optimize $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$-dependence in the phenomenological parameters of the (3+1)-dimensional hybrid framework for describing relativistic heavy-ion collisions within the Beam Energy Scan program at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider. The effects of various experimental measurements on the posterior distribution are investigated. We also make model predictions for longitudinal flow decorrelation, rapidity-dependent anisotropic flow and identified particle $v_0(p_\mathrm{T})$ in Au+Au collisions, as well as anisotropic flow coefficients in small systems. Systematic uncertainties in the model predictions are estimated using the variance of the simulation results with a few parameter sets sampled from the posterior distributions.</description>

      <title>Oscillations of hypothetical strange stars as an efficient source ultra-high-energy particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical behavior of strange quark matter (SQM) objects, such as stars and planets, when subjected to radial oscillations induced by tidal interactions in stellar systems. Our study demonstrates that SQM objects can efficiently convert mechanical energy into hadronic energy due to the critical mass density at their surfaces of 4.7*10^{14} g/cm^3, below which SQM becomes unstable and decays into photons, hadrons, and leptons. We show that even small-amplitude radial oscillations, with a radius change of as little as 0.1%, can result in significant excitation energies near the surface of SQM stars. This excitation energy is rapidly converted into electromagnetic energy over short timescales approximately 1 ms, potentially leading to observable astrophysical phenomena. Higher amplitude oscillations may cause fragmentation or dissolution of SQM stars, which has important implications for the evolution of binary systems containing SQM objects and the emission of gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD Study of Positive Parity Dibaryons with Maximal Charm and Strangeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the ground-state energy spectra of dibaryons composed of single-flavor quarks, specifically systems with strangeness $\mathcal{S} = -6$ and charm $\mathcal{C} = 6$. Our lattice QCD study is based on $N_f=2+1+1$ MILC ensembles with highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) sea quarks, spanning four lattice spacings and two spatial volumes. We employ valence quark propagators realized using a relativistic overlap action, evaluate correlation matrices with carefully designed operator bases, and extract reliable ground-state energy estimates in the $S = 0$ and $S = 2$ spin channels. We explore their binding characteristics and interaction dynamics by examining the energy separation between the dibaryon states and the corresponding two-baryon thresholds. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of single-flavor dibaryon states as a function of the quark masses. In the $S=0$ channel, the $\Omega_{ccc}$-$\Omega_{ccc}$ system exhibits a clear signal of a bound state, while the $\Omega$-$\Omega$ system lies very close to the threshold, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. For $S=2$, both systems are found to be unbound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves emitted in the late inspiral of binary neutron stars are affected by their tidal deformation. We study the tidal dynamics in full general relativity through matched-asymptotic expansions and prove that the dynamical tidal response can be expanded in a complete set of modes. We further prove that the mode amplitudes satisfy an effective, forced harmonic oscillator equation, which generalizes the overlap-integral formulation of Newtonian gravity. Our relativistic treatment of dynamical tides will avoid systematic biases in future gravitational-wave parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological Scaling Relations for SQM Stars with a Massive s-Quark in Gravitationally Strong Magnetic Fields under the Spherical Symmetry Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling relations with the bag constant parameter are investigated for Strange Quark Matter (SQM) stars in the presence of gravitationally strong magnetic fields minimally coupled with matter, considering both massless and massive strange quark scenarios. Assuming a simple model for such coupling under the approximation of spherical symmetry, a phenomenological scaling formula for the maximum mass of stars is derived as a function of the surface magnetic field and the strange quark mass. This formula is applicable for all formally admissible values of the free parameters, and strict scaling with the bag constant is retained only for a vanishing strange quark mass.
  As a byproduct of this study, the mathematical structure of the equation of state for the relativistic SQM model with a massive strange quark is revisited without approximations. It is observed that the contribution of the electron term to the energy density cannot be neglected in the theoretical limit of large strange quark masses. Consequently, the maximum mass of SQM stars increases with sufficiently large strange quark mass, contrasting with the behavior observed for low strange quark masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider generation from the vacuum of a scalar charged field in a rigidly rotating frame. Adding an external magnetic field opens the way to Bose condensation of the field. This phenomenon has been studied for external uniform magnetic field occupying the whole volume of the uniformly rotating cylindrical system of finite radius $R$ with a Dirichlet boundary condition imposed on it. Besides continuing this study, we consider the field formed by a flux tube of small radius. We find numerical solutions of the Ginzburg-Pitaevskii equation for the charged scalar field, the critical rotation frequencies, the mean radii and the condensate energies, and compare them with those found in a linearization scheme and with approximate analytical solutions. We show that for the same input parameters the energy of the condensate in the case of the flux tube is lower than in the case of uniform magnetic field in the whole cylinder.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Kinetic Mixing of Dark Photons from Dilepton Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark photons, the hypothetical gauge bosons associated with an additional $U(1)^{\prime}$ symmetry, can couple to Standard Model particles through a small kinetic mixing parameter $\varepsilon$ with the ordinary photon. This mechanism provides a portal between the dark sector and visible matter. In this study, we present a procedure to derive theoretical upper bounds on the kinetic mixing parameter $\varepsilon^2(M_U)$ by analyzing dilepton spectra from heavy-ion collisions across a broad energy range, from SIS to LHC energies. Our analysis is based on the microscopic Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach, which successfully reproduces the measured dilepton spectra in $p+p$, $p+A$, and $A+A$ collisions across the same energy range. Besides the dilepton channels resulting from interactions and decays of Standard Model particles (such as mesons and baryons), the PHSD has been extended to include the decay of hypothetical dark photons into dileptons, $U \to e^+ e^-$. The production of these dark photons occurs via Dalitz decays of $\pi^0$, $\eta$, $\omega$, $\eta^{\prime}$, and $\Delta$ resonances; direct decays of $\rho$, $\omega$, and $\phi$; the kaon mode $K^+ \to \pi^+ U$; and thermal $q\bar q$ annihilation in the quark-gluon plasma. Our results show that high-precision measurements of dilepton spectra in heavy-ion collisions provide a sensitive and competitive probe of dark photons in the MeV to multi-GeV mass range. Furthermore, we quantify the experimental accuracy required to constrain the remaining viable parameter space of kinetic mixing in dark photon scenarios.</description>

      <title>Do massive neutrino states really exist?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In neutrino physics, it is conventional to work with massive states corresponding to defined neutrino masses. However, in weak interaction processes, only flavor states participate, and the propagation can be described by an off-diagonal mass matrix. In this work, we operate directly with the non-diagonal mass matrix and employ a quantum field theory approach to describe neutrino oscillations within the plane-wave approximation, circumventing the use of wave packets. Within this framework, numerical estimates for the amplitude of a local process involving lepton interactions via virtual neutrino exchange yield values of order $10^{-53}$. For macroscopic processes with neutrino exchange, application of the matrix propagator reproduces the standard quantum mechanical neutrino oscillation probability formula while preserving relativistic invariance.</description>

      <title>Nuclear modification factor within a dynamical approach to the complex entropic index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel approach to the nuclear deformation factor $R_{AA}$, grounded in the dynamical effects of the Quark-Gluon Plasma on parton momentum. The approach uses the Blast-Wave method combined with Tsallis Statistics, within the Copper-Frye freeze-out framework and, by profiting from appropriate simplifications, it gives analytical expressions that describe the observed $R_{AA}$ for two sets of independent measurements at $\sqrt{s}=2.76$ TeV and $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV. A nonlinear dynamical equation describes the dynamics and leads to log-periodic oscillations. With the analytical solutions for that equation, it is possible to link the dynamical approach with the complex-$q$ formalism, which was proposed to describe the log-oscillations observed in experimental data.</description>

      <title>Dihadron Fragmentation and the Confinement Transition in Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we relate the factorization for $e^+e^- \to h_1 h_2 X$ to the factorization for energy-energy correlators in the collinear limit. This enables us to give a nonperturbative proof of factorization for the energy correlators, relate the energy correlator jet function to transverse-momentum-sensitive dihadron fragmentation functions, and provide a rigorous description of the confinement transition region.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Theory of Quasiparticles, Retarded Correlators and Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the relaxation time approximation under a constant mass profile, we investigate the collective dynamics of a system of massive relativistic particles described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution. We analytically derive the two-point retarded correlation functions for both charge and energy-momentum tensor components at arbitrary momentum and frequency. We expand our results in the limits of very small and very large mass-to-temperature ratios ($m/T$). Similar to the massless case, we identify a critical threshold in ($k \tau$) below which the correlators permit physical solutions. This behavior arises from a logarithmic branch cut in the spectral function. At higher momenta, solutions emerge significantly below this cut, corresponding to non-hydrodynamic modes. Our analysis demonstrates that hydrodynamic poles dominate in the strong coupling regime, while the weak coupling regime features a logarithmic branch cut extending along $\omega = k$ and $\omega = -k$. Notably, in the sound channel, finite mass modifies the standard propagating sound mode, converting it into a purely imaginary mode. In contrast, the shear channel exhibits modes that asymptotically converge to their massless counterparts. Additionally, we compute the transport coefficients for shear and bulk viscosity, along with higher-order gradient corrections up to third order, expressed as perturbative expansions in both the small and large ($m/T$) regimes.</description>

      <title>Global coupled-channel analysis of $e^+e^-\to c\bar{c}$ processes in $\sqrt{s}=3.75-4.7$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17658v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent high-precision $e^+e^-\to c\bar{c}$ data from the BESIII and Belle are highly useful to understand vector charmonium ($\psi$) pole structures and puzzling lineshapes due to the exotic hadron candidates $Y$. We thus perform a global coupled-channel analysis of most of the available data (10 two-body, 9 three-body, and 1 four-body final states) in $\sqrt{s}=3.75-4.7$ GeV. Not only cross sections but also invariant-mass distributions of subsystems are fitted. The $e^+e^-\to \mu^+\mu^-$ cross sections are also predicted. Our model includes dozens of (quasi) two-body states that nonperturbatively couple with each other through bare $\psi$ excitations, particle-exchange, and short-range mechanisms; approximate three-body unitarity is considered. The amplitudes obtained from the fit are analytically continued to $\psi$ and $Z_c$ poles. We find $\psi$ states similar to those in the Particle Data Group listing and $Y(4320)$. Moreover, several $\psi$ states, including new ones, are found close to open charm thresholds. Trajectories and compositeness of the near-threshold poles suggest dominant hadron-molecule contents in their internal structures. Two $Z_c$ poles are found as virtual states $\sim$40 MeV below the $D^*\bar{D}^{(*)}$ thresholds, being consistent with lattice QCD results. This work presents the first global analysis to determine $\psi$ and $Z_c$ poles, thereby paving the way to extracting detailed properties of the prominent exotic hadron candidates from data.</description>

      <title>Symmetry verification for noisy quantum simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian gauge theories underlie our understanding of fundamental forces of modern physics. Simulating them on quantum hardware is an outstanding challenge in the rapidly evolving field of quantum simulation. A key prerequisite is the protection of local gauge symmetries against errors that, if unchecked, would lead to unphysical results. While an extensive toolkit devoted to identifying, mitigating, and ultimately correcting such errors has been developed for Abelian groups, non-commuting symmetry operators complicate the implementation of similar schemes in non-Abelian theories. Here, we discuss two techniques for error mitigation through symmetry verification, tailored for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories implemented in noisy qudit hardware: dynamical post-selection (DPS), based on mid-circuit measurements without active feedback, and post-processed symmetry verification (PSV), which combines measurements of correlations between target observables and gauge transformations. We illustrate both approaches for the discrete non-Abelian group $D_3$ in 2+1 dimensions, explaining their usefulness for current NISQ devices even in the presence of fast fluctuating noise. Our results open new avenues for robust quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories, for further development of error-mitigation techniques, and for measurement-based control methods in qudit platforms.</description>

      <title>Two- and three-meson scattering amplitudes with physical quark masses from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study systems of two and three mesons composed of pions and kaons at maximal isospin using four CLS ensembles with $a\approx 0.063\;$fm, including one with approximately physical quark masses. Using the stochastic Laplacian-Heaviside method, we determine the energy spectrum of these systems including many levels in different momentum frames and irreducible representations. Using the relativistic two- and three-body finite-volume formalism, we constrain the two and three-meson K matrices, including not only the leading $s$ wave, but also $p$ and $d$ waves. By solving the three-body integral equations, we determine, for the first time, the physical-point scattering amplitudes for $3\pi^+$, $3K^+$, $\pi^+\pi^+ K^+$ and $K^+ K^+ \pi^+$ systems. These are determined for total angular momentum $J^P=0^-$, $1^+$, and $2^-$. We also obtain accurate results for $2\pi^+$, $\pi^+ K^+$, and $2K^+$ phase shifts. We compare our results to Chiral Perturbation Theory, and to phenomenological fits.</description>

      <title>Directed flow from parton spin-orbit coupling in $pp$ and $pA$ collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out a novel mechanism to generate $\cos \phi$ two-particle azimuthal correlation (`directed flow') in unpolarized proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions in the forward rapidity region of the projectile proton. This is a direct consequence of the recently discovered strong spin-orbit coupling in gluons at small-$x$. The observable simultaneously serves as a unique probe into the double helicity parton distribution functions of the proton.</description>

      <title>Training neural control variates using correlated configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural control variates (NCVs) have emerged as a powerful tool for variance reduction in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, particularly in high-dimensional problems where traditional control variates are difficult to construct analytically. By training neural networks to learn auxiliary functions correlated with the target observable, NCVs can significantly reduce estimator variance while preserving unbiasedness. However, a critical but often overlooked aspect of NCV training is the role of autocorrelated samples generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). While such samples are typically discarded for error estimation due to their statistical redundancy, they may contain useful information about the structure of the underlying probability distribution that can benefit the training process. In this work, we systematically examine the effect of using correlated configurations in training neural control variates. We demonstrate, both conceptually and numerically, that training on correlated data can improve control variate performance, especially in settings with limited computational resources. Our analysis includes empirical results from $U(1)$ gauge theory and scalar field theory, illustrating when and how autocorrelated samples enhance NCV construction. These findings provide practical guidance for the efficient use of MCMC data in training neural networks.</description>
