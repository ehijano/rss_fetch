      <title>Two dimensional potential theory with a view towards vortex motion: Energy, capacity and Green functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper reviews some parts of classical potential theory with applications to two dimensional fluid dynamics, in particular vortex motion. Energy and forces within a system of point vortices are similar to those for point charges when the vortices are kept fixed, but the dynamics is different in the case of free vortices. Starting from Bernoulli's equation we derive these laws. Letting the number of vortices tend to infinity leads in the limit to considerations of capacity, harmonic measure and many other notions in potential theory. In particular various kinds of Green functions have a central role in the paper, where we make a difference between electrostatic and hydrodynamic Green function.
  We also consider the corresponding concepts in the case of closed Riemann surfaces provided with a metric. From a canonically defined monopole Green function we rederive much of the classical theory of harmonic and analytic forms. In the final section of the paper we return to the planar case, then reappearing in form of a symmetric Riemann surface, the Schottky double. Bergman kernels, electrostatic and hydrodynamic, come up naturally, and associated to the Green function the is a certain Robin function which is important for vortex motion and which also relates to capacity functions in classical potential theory.</description>

      <title>Brenke polynomials with real zeros and the Riemann Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If $A(z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nz^n$ and $B(z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty b_nz^n$ are two formal power series, with $a_n,b_n\in \mathbb{R}$, the polynomials $(p_n)_n$ defined by the generating function $$ A(z)B(xz)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty p_n(x)z^n $$ are called the Brenke polynomials generated by $A$ and associated to $B$. We say that $A\in \mathcal{R}_B$ if the Brenke polynomials $(p_n)_n$ have only real zeros. Among other results, in this paper we find necessary and sufficient conditions on $B$ such that $\mathcal{R}_B=\mathcal{L}\text{-}\mathcal{P}$, where $\mathcal{L}\text{-}\mathcal{P}$ denotes the Laguerre-P\'olya class (of entire functions). These results can be considered an extension to Brenke polynomials of the Jensen, and P\'olya and Schur characterization $\mathcal{R}_{e^z}=\mathcal{L}\text{-}\mathcal{P}$, for Appell polynomials. When applying our results to a relative of the Riemann zeta function, we find new equivalencies for the Riemann Hypothesis in terms of real-rootedness of some sequences of Brenke polynomials.</description>

      <title>Full Asymptotic Expansion of Monodromy Data for the First Painlev\'{e} Transcendent: Applications to Connection Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the full asymptotic expansion of the monodromy data ({\it i.e.}, Stokes multipliers) for the first Painlev\'{e} transcendent (PI) with large initial data or large pole parameters. Our primary approach involves refining the complex WKB method, also known as the method of uniform asymptotics, to approximate the second-order ODEs derived from PI's Lax pair with higher-order accuracy. As an application, we provide a rigorous proof of the full asymptotic expansion of the nonlinear eigenvalues proposed numerically by Bender, Komijani, and Wang. Additionally, we present the full asymptotic expansion for the pole parameters $(p_{n}, H_{n})$ corresponding to the $n$-th pole of the real tritronqu\'{e}e solution of the PI equation as $n \to +\infty$.</description>

      <title>Almost holomorphic curves in real analytic hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the theory of exterior differential systems, we study the existence of germ of pseudo-holomorphic disk in a real analytic hypersurface locally defined in a complex manifold equipped with J a real analytic almost complex structure. The integrable case in C n with J the multiplication by i has been intensively studied by several authors [DF], [DA1] and [DA2] for example. The non integrable case is drastically different essentially due to the following fact : in generic case, there is no J-invariant objects of dimension bigger than one. This simple observation leads to the non existence of some equivalents of Segree varieties or ideals of holomorphic functions which play a fundamental role in the complex case. Nevertheless in the almost complex case, we adopt the exterior differential system point of view of E.Cartan developed and clarified in [BCGGG].</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the absolute period foliation of a stratum of holomorphic 1-forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.12669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a connected component of a stratum of the moduli space of holomorphic $1$-forms of genus $g$. We show that the absolute period foliation of $\mathcal{C}$ is ergodic on the area-$1$ locus, and that the non-dense leaves lie in an explicit countable union of suborbifolds, subject to a mild assumption on $\mathcal{C}$. We show similar results for subspaces of $\mathcal{C}$ defined by topological restrictions on the absolute periods. We obtain these dynamical results by showing that for a typical positive cohomology class in $H^1(S_g;\mathbb{C})$, the associated space of isoperiodic forms in $\mathcal{C}$ is connected. Lastly, we show that certain covering constructions provide examples of spaces of isoperiodic forms with positive dimension and infinitely many connected components.</description>

      <title>Reductive Shafarevich Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the holomorphic convexity of the covering of a complex projective {normal} variety $X$, which corresponds to the intersection of kernels of reductive representations $\rho:\pi_1(X)\to {\rm GL}_{N}(\mathbb{C})$, therefore answering a question by Eyssidieux, Katzarkov, Pantev, and Ramachandran in 2012. It is worth noting that Eyssidieux had previously proven this result in 2004 when $X$ is smooth. While our approach follows the general strategy employed in Eyssidieux's proof, it introduces several improvements and simplifications. Notably, it avoids the necessity of using the reduction mod $p$ method in Eyssidieux's original proof.
  Additionally, we construct the Shafarevich morphism for complex reductive representations of fundamental groups of complex quasi-projective varieties unconditionally, and proving its algebraic nature at the function field level.</description>

      <title>Local geometry of Equilibria and a Poincar\'e-Bendixson-type Theorem for Holomorphic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07612v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the local geometry of dynamical systems $\dot{x}=F(x)$ with real time parameterization, where $F$ is holomorphic on connected open subsets of $\mathbb{C}\stackrel{\sim}{=}\mathbb{R}^2$. We describe the geometry of first-order equilibria. For equilibria of higher orders, we establish an equivalent condition for "definite directions", allowing us to reverse the implication in Theorem 2 of Chapter 2.10 in [Differential equations and dynamical systems, Lawrence Perko (1990)] under the additional condition of holomorphy. This enables the geometric construction of a finite elliptic decomposition. We derive a holomorphic Poincar\'e-Bendixson-type theorem, leading to the conclusion that bounded non-periodic orbits are always homoclinic or heteroclinic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a criterion for higher-dimensional Gaussian Gabor frames, which is a reformulation of one of the main results in a previous article by the first and last authors in more explicit terms. We also show that this density criterion for Gaussian Gabor frames is generic in a certain sense.</description>
