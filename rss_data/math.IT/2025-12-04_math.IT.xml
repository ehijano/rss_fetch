      <title>CFO-Robust Detection for 5G PRACH under Fading Channels: Analytical Modeling and Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) is essential for initial access and synchronization in both 5G and future 6G networks; however, its detection is highly sensitive to impairments such as high user density, large carrier frequency offset (CFO), and fast fading. Although prior studies have examined PRACH detection, they are often restricted to specific scenarios or lack a comprehensive analytical characterization of performance. We introduce a unified analytical framework that characterizes the statistical distribution of the received power delay profile (PDP) under flat Rayleigh fading and supports both coherent combining (CC) and power combining (PC) repetition strategies. For each strategy, we derive optimal threshold expressions and closed-form detection probabilities. Furthermore, we analyze two key cases depending on the coherence time: identical and independent channel realizations per repetition. Secondly, we exploit the correlation induced by CFO across cyclic shifts to design a novel low-complexity detector that exploits PDP dependencies. Numerical results indicate that PC outperforms CC when repetitions experience independent channels, while CC can be preferable under identical realizations in limited settings. On the other hand, the proposed CFO-aware detector delivers improved robustness under severe CFO conditions.</description>

      <title>Strengthening Han's Fourier Entropy-Influence Inequality via an Information-Theoretic Proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We strengthen Han's Fourier entropy-influence inequality $$ H[\widehat{f}] \leq C_{1}I(f) + C_{2}\sum_{i\in [n]}I_{i}(f)\ln\frac{1}{I_{i}(f)} $$ originally proved for $\{-1,1\}$-valued Boolean functions with $C_{1}=3+2\ln 2$ and $C_{2}=1$. We show, by a short information-theoretic proof, that it in fact holds with sharp constants $C_{1}=C_{2}=1$ for all real-valued Boolean functions of unit $L^{2}$-norm, thereby establishing the inequality as an elementary structural property of Shannon entropy and influence.</description>

      <title>Multi-Source M/G/1/1 Queues with Probabilistic Preemption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a multi-source status update system consisting of multiple independent sources, a single server, and a single sink. Each source generates packets according to a Poisson process, and packets are served according to a general service time distribution. The system has a capacity of one packet, i.e., no waiting buffer, and is modeled as a multi-source M/G/1/1 queueing system. We introduce a probabilistically preemptive packet management policy, under which an existing packet from the same source in the system is replaced by an arriving packet with a fixed probability. We derive the moment generating functions (MGFs) of the age of information (AoI) and peak AoI (PAoI) for each source under this policy. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed packet management policy.</description>

      <title>Generalized Orthogonal Approximate Message-Passing for Sublinear Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the reconstruction of sparse signals from generalized linear measurements. Signal sparsity is assumed to be sublinear in the signal dimension while it was proportional to the signal dimension in conventional research. Approximate message-passing (AMP) has poor convergence properties for sensing matrices beyond standard Gaussian matrices. To solve this convergence issue, generalized orthogonal AMP (GOAMP) is proposed for signals with sublinear sparsity. The main feature of GOAMP is the so-called Onsager correction to realize asymptotic Gaussianity of estimation errors. The Onsager correction in GOAMP is designed via state evolution for orthogonally invariant sensing matrices in the sublinear sparsity limit, where the signal sparsity and measurement dimension tend to infinity at sublinear speed in the signal dimension. When the support of non-zero signals does not contain a neighborhood of the origin, GOAMP using Bayesian denoisers is proved to achieve error-free signal reconstruction for linear measurements if and only if the measurement dimension is larger than a threshold, which is equal to that of AMP for standard Gaussian sensing matrices. Numerical simulations are also presented for linear measurements and 1-bit compressed sensing. When ill-conditioned sensing matrices are used, GOAMP for sublinear sparsity is shown to outperform existing reconstruction algorithms, including generalized AMP for sublinear sparsity.</description>

      <title>From Reliability to Security: How RIS-Assisted Adaptive SM and SSK Enhances Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes two novel wireless transmission schemes, namely reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted received adaptive spatial modulation (RASM) scheme and RIS-assisted received adaptive space shift keying (RASSK) scheme, designed to enhance spectral efficiency (SE) and physical layer security (PLS).In both proposed schemes, transmitting bits are dynamically mapped at receive antennas by leveraging the characteristics of the RIS in each time slot, which enables the enhancement of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at specific selected antennas with near few power, thus leading a reliable and green wireless communication. This adaptive approach facilitates the conveyance of extra bits to the receiver, which means it needs less cost of radio-frequency chains at transmitter while improving SE. Besides, the proposed schemes offer an inherent PLS security advantage, as the eavesdropper is unable to completely detect signals reflected from the RIS. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of the proposed RASM and RASSK schemes, this paper presents a detailed analytical performance of their spectral efficiency, detection complexity, bit error rate, and secrecy rate, which are accompanied by insightful findings and conclusions. Simulation and analytical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed schemes, showcasing their improved error performance and robustness against wiretapping, while also highlighting the potential of the RASM and RASSK schemes for future wireless applications.</description>

      <title>Expected Confidence Dependency: A Novel Rough Set-Based Approach to Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes Expected Confidence Dependency (ECD), a novel, soft computing-oriented, accuracy driven dependency measure for feature selection within the rough set theory framework. Unlike traditional rough set dependency measures that rely on binary characterizations of conditional blocks, ECD assigns confidence-based contributions to individual equivalence blocks and aggregates them through a normalized expectation operator. We formally establish several desirable properties of ECD, including normalization, compatibility with classical dependency, monotonicity, and invariance under structural and label-preserving transformations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-the-Air Federated Learning (AirFL) is an emerging paradigm that tightly integrates wireless signal processing and distributed machine learning to enable scalable AI at the network edge. By leveraging the superposition property of wireless signals, AirFL performs communication and model aggregation of the learning process simultaneously, significantly reducing latency, bandwidth, and energy consumption. This article offers a tutorial treatment of AirFL, presenting a novel classification into three design approaches: CSIT-aware, blind, and weighted AirFL. We provide a comprehensive guide to theoretical foundations, performance analysis, complexity considerations, practical limitations, and prospective research directions.</description>

      <title>Movable Signals with Dual-Polarized Fixed Intelligent Surfaces: Beyond Diagonal Reflection Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates wireless systems aided by dual-polarized intelligent surfaces. We compare reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), which adjust their reflection matrices, with movable signals operating with fixed intelligent surface (FIS), which adjust the signal frequency while the surface properties remain fixed. For both RIS and FIS, we consider surfaces with a diagonal reflection matrix, named diagonal RIS/FIS, and surfaces with a reflection matrix not limited to being diagonal, named beyond-diagonal RIS/FIS. Movable signals with FIS always outperform RIS, achieving at least a fourfold gain. When transmitter and receiver polarizations differ, beyond-diagonal FIS further enhances performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on entropy and symmetrical uncertainty (SU), we define a metric for categorical random variables and show that this metric can be promoted into an appropriate quotient space of categorical random variables. Moreover, we also show that there is a natural commutative monoid structure in the same quotient space, which is compatible with the topology induced by the metric, in the sense that the monoid operation is continuous.</description>

      <title>Semi-Markov Decision Process Framework for Age of Incorrect Information Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a remote estimation system, we study age of incorrect information (AoII), which is a recently proposed semantic-aware freshness metric. In particular, we assume an information source observing a discrete-time finite-state Markov chain (DTMC) and employing push-based transmissions of status update packets towards the monitor which is tasked with remote estimation of the source. The source-to-monitor channel delay is assumed to have a general discrete-time phase-type (DPH) distribution, whereas the zero-delay reverse channel ensures that the source has perfect information on AoII and the remote estimate. A multi-threshold transmission policy is employed where packet transmissions are initiated when the AoII process exceeds a threshold which may be different for each estimation value. In this general setting, our goal is to minimize the weighted sum of time average of an arbitrary function of AoII and estimation, and transmission costs, by suitable choice of the thresholds. We formulate the problem as a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) with the same state-space as the original DTMC to obtain the optimum multi-threshold policy whereas the parameters of the SMDP are obtained by using a novel stochastic tool called dual-regime absorbing Markov chain (DR-AMC), and its corresponding absorption time distribution named as dual-regime DPH (DR-DPH).</description>

      <title>Rethinking Security in Semantic Communication: Latent Manipulation as a New Threat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising paradigm for next-generation wireless networks, offering superior transmission efficiency by extracting and conveying task-relevant semantic latent representations rather than raw data. However, the openness of the wireless medium and the intrinsic vulnerability of semantic latent representations expose such systems to previously unrecognized security risks. In this paper, we uncover a fundamental latent-space vulnerability that enables Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacker to covertly manipulate the transmitted semantics while preserving the statistical properties of the transmitted latent representations. We first present a Diffusion-based Re-encoding Attack (DiR), wherein the attacker employs a diffusion model to synthesize an attacker-designed semantic variant, and re-encodes it into a valid latent representation compatible with the SemCom decoder. Beyond this model-dependent pathway, we further propose a model-agnostic and training-free Test-Time Adaptation Latent Manipulation attack (TTA-LM), in which the attacker perturbs and steers the intercepted latent representation toward an attacker-specified semantic target by leveraging the gradient of a target loss function. In contrast to diffusion-based manipulation, TTA-LM does not rely on any generative model and does not impose modality-specific or task-specific assumptions, thereby enabling efficient and broadly applicable latent-space tampering across diverse SemCom architectures. Extensive experiments on representative semantic communication architectures demonstrate that both attacks can significantly alter the decoded semantics while preserving natural latent-space distributions, making the attacks covert and difficult to detect.</description>

      <title>Double-Edge-Assisted Computation Offloading and Resource Allocation for Space-Air-Marine Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a double-edge-assisted computation offloading and resource allocation scheme tailored for space-air-marine integrated networks (SAMINs). Specifically, we consider a scenario where both unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and a low earth orbit (LEO) satellite are equipped with edge servers, providing computing services for maritime autonomous surface ships (MASSs). Partial computation workloads of MASSs can be offloaded to both UAVs and the LEO satellite, concurrently, for processing via a multi-access approach. To minimize the energy consumption of SAMINs under latency constraints, we formulate an optimization problem and propose energy efficient algorithms to jointly optimize offloading mode, offloading volume, and computing resource allocation of the LEO satellite and the UAVs, respectively. We further exploit an alternating optimization (AO) method and a layered approach to decompose the original problem to attain the optimal solutions. Finally, we conduct simulations to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme in comparison with benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <title>CaFTRA: Frequency-Domain Correlation-Aware Feedback-Free MIMO Transmission and Resource Allocation for 6G and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental design of wireless systems toward AI-native 6G and beyond is driven by the need for ever-increasing demand of mobile data traffic, extreme spectral efficiency, and adaptability across diverse service scenarios. To overcome the limitations posed by feedback-based multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) transmission, we propose a novel frequency-domain Correlation-aware Feedback-free MIMO Transmission and Resource Allocation (CaFTRA) framework tailored for fully-decoupled radio access networks (FD-RAN) to meet the emerging requirements of AI-Native 6G and beyond. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), CaFTRA effectively eliminates real-time uplink feedback by predicting channel state information (CSI) based solely on user geolocation. We introduce a Learnable Queries-driven Transformer Network for CSI mapping from user geolocation, which utilizes multi-head attention and learnable query embeddings to accurately capture frequency-domain correlations among resource blocks (RBs), thereby significantly improving the precision of CSI prediction. Once base stations (BSs) adopt feedback-free transmission, their downlink transmission coverage can be significantly expanded due to the elimination of frequent uplink feedback. To enable efficient resource scheduling under such extensive-coverage scenarios, we apply a low-complexity many-to-one matching theory-based algorithm for efficient multi-BS association and multi-RB resource allocation, which is proven to converge to a stable matching within limited iterations. Simulation results demonstrate that CaFTRA achieves stable matching convergence and significant gains in spectral efficiency and user fairness compared to 5G, underscoring its potential value for 6G standardization efforts.</description>

      <title>An Information Theory of Finite Abstractions and their Fundamental Scalability Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite abstractions are discrete approximations of dynamical systems, such that the set of abstraction trajectories contains, in a formal sense, all system trajectories. There is a consensus that abstractions suffer from the curse of dimensionality: for the same ``accuracy" (how closely the abstraction represents the system), the abstraction size scales poorly with system dimensions. And, yet, after decades of research on abstractions, there are no formal results concerning their accuracy-size tradeoff. In this work, we derive a statistical, quantitative theory of abstractions' accuracy-size tradeoff and uncover fundamental limits on their scalability, through rate-distortion theory -- the branch of information theory studying lossy compression. Abstractions are viewed as encoder-decoder pairs, encoding trajectories of dynamical systems in a higher-dimensional ambient space. Rate represents abstraction size, while distortion describes abstraction accuracy, defined as the spatial average deviation between abstract trajectories and system ones. We obtain a fundamental lower bound on the minimum abstraction distortion, given the system dynamics and a threshold on abstraction size. The bound depends on the complexity of the dynamics, through generalized entropy. We demonstrate the bound's tightness on certain dynamical systems. Finally, we showcase how the developed theory can be employed to construct optimal abstractions, in terms of the size-accuracy tradeoff, through an example on a chaotic system.</description>

      <title>Capacity Bounds and Low-Complexity Constellation Shaping under Mixed Gaussian-Impulsive Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the bounds on channel capacity and constellation shaping under memoryless mixed noise, which is composed of impulsive noise (IN) and white Gaussian noise (WGN). The capacity bounds are derived using the entropy power inequality and the dual expression of capacity. It is then shown that the proposed lower and upper bounds asymptotically converge to the true channel capacity, and the analytic asymptotic capacity expression is obtained. Leveraging this property, we design a low-complexity constellation shaping method that operates without iterative procedures. Simulation results demonstrate that the derived bounds are remarkably tight, and the shaped constellation achieves the highest mutual information among all considered baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>Degradedness Under Cooperation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08987v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study cooperation problems in broadcast and relay networks, where the receivers do not satisfy the classical physical degradedness assumptions. New notions of degradedness, \emph{strongly less noisy} and \emph{strongly more capable} are introduced. We show that under these conditions, decode and forward (D\&amp;F) is optimal for classes of cooperative systems with limited conference rates, thus yielding new capacity results for these systems. In particular, we derive bounds on the capacity region of a class of broadcast channels with cooperation, that are tight on part of the capacity region. It is shown that the cut-set bound is tight for classes of primitive relay and diamond channels, beyond the physically or stochastically degraded models.</description>

      <title>Analog Computing for Signal Processing and Communications -- Part I: Computing with Microwave Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06790v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analog computing has been recently revived due to its potential for energy-efficient and highly parallel computations. In this two-part paper, we explore analog computers that linearly process microwave signals, named microwave linear analog computers (MiLACs), and their applications in signal processing and communications. In Part I of this paper, we model a MiLAC as a multiport microwave network with tunable impedance components, enabling the execution of mathematical operations by reconfiguring the microwave network and applying input signals at its ports. We demonstrate that a MiLAC can efficiently compute the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator and matrix inversion, with remarkably low computational complexity. Specifically, a matrix can be inverted with complexity growing with the square of its size. We also show how a MiLAC can be used jointly with digital operations to implement sophisticated algorithms such as the Kalman filter. To enhance practicability, we propose a design of MiLAC based on lossless impedance components, reducing power consumption and eliminating the need for costly active components. In Part II of this paper, we investigate the applications of MiLACs in wireless communications, highlighting their potential to enable future wireless systems by executing computations and beamforming in the analog domain.</description>

      <title>Analog Computing for Signal Processing and Communications -- Part II: Toward Gigantic MIMO Beamforming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analog-domain operations offer a promising solution to accelerating signal processing and enabling future multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications with thousands of antennas. In Part I of this paper, we have introduced a microwave linear analog computer (MiLAC) as an analog computer that processes microwave signals linearly, demonstrating its potential to reduce the computational complexity of specific signal processing tasks. In Part II of this paper, we extend these benefits to wireless communications, showcasing how MiLAC enables gigantic MIMO beamforming entirely in the analog domain. MiLAC-aided beamforming enables the maximum flexibility and performance of digital beamforming, while significantly reducing hardware costs by minimizing the number of radio-frequency (RF) chains and only relying on low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs). In addition, it eliminates per-symbol operations by completely avoiding digital-domain processing and remarkably reduces the computational complexity of zero-forcing (ZF), which scales quadratically with the number of antennas instead of cubically. It also processes signals with fixed matrices, e.g., the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), directly in the analog domain. Numerical results show that it can perform ZF and DFT with a computational complexity reduction of up to $1.5\times 10^4$ and $4.0\times 10^7$ times, respectively, compared to digital beamforming.</description>

      <title>Super-Linear Growth of the Capacity-Achieving Input Support for the Amplitude-Constrained AWGN Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the growth of the support size of the capacity-achieving input distribution for the amplitude-constrained additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. While it is known since Smith (1971) that the optimal input is discrete with finitely many mass points, tight bounds on the number of support points $K_A$ as the amplitude constraint $A$ increases remain open. Not much is known until recently, when Dytso et al. (2019) proved that $K_A$ grows at least linearly and at most quadratically in $A$. Here, we provide a novel method, building on Ma et al. (2024); Zhang (1994), to derive the first non-trivial lower bound showing that KA grows super-linearly in A.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann-Shannon Index: A Geometric-Aware Measure of Clustering Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Boltzmann-Shannon Index (BSI), a normalized measure for clustered continuous data that captures the interaction between frequency-based and geometry-based probability distributions. Building on ideas from geometric coarse-graining and information theory, the BSI quantifies how well a partition reflects both the population of each cluster and its effective geometric extent. We illustrate its behavior on synthetic Gaussian mixtures, the Iris benchmark, and a high-imbalance resource-allocation scenario, showing that the index provides a coherent assessment even when traditional metrics give incomplete or misleading signals. Moreover, in resource-allocation settings, we demonstrate that BSI not only detects severe density-geometry inconsistency with high sensitivity, but also offers a smooth, optimization-ready objective that naturally favors allocations balancing demographic weight with each group's effective spread in the outcome space, while providing a smooth, gradient-friendly regularizer that can be easily embedded in modern policy-making and algorithmic governance optimization frameworks.</description>

      <title>Scheduling and Aggregation Design for Asynchronous Federated Learning over Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07356v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning (ML) framework that combines on-device training and server-based aggregation to train a common ML model among distributed agents. In this work, we propose an asynchronous FL design with periodic aggregation to tackle the straggler issue in FL systems. Considering limited wireless communication resources, we investigate the effect of different scheduling policies and aggregation designs on the convergence performance. Driven by the importance of reducing the bias and variance of the aggregated model updates, we propose a scheduling policy that jointly considers the channel quality and training data representation of user devices. The effectiveness of our channel-aware data-importance-based scheduling policy, compared with state-of-the-art methods proposed for synchronous FL, is validated through simulations. Moreover, we show that an ``age-aware'' aggregation weighting design can significantly improve the learning performance in an asynchronous FL setting.</description>

      <title>A Novel Discrete-time Model of Information Diffusion on Social Networks Considering Users Behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the SDIR (Susceptible-Delayable-Infected-Recovered) model, an extension of the classical SIR epidemic framework, to provide a more explicit characterization of user behavior in online social networks. The newly merged state D (delayable) represents users who have received the information but delayed its spreading and may eventually choose not to share it at all. Based on the mean-field approximation method, we derive the dynamical equations of the model and investigate its convergence and stability conditions. Under these conditions, we further propose an approximation algorithm for the edge-deletion problem, aiming to minimize the influence of information diffusion by identifying approximate solutions.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Aspect of Information: The Physical Reality of Asymmetric "Distance"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that when a Brownian bridge is physically constrained to satisfy a canonical condition, its time evolution exactly coincides with an m-geodesic on the statistical manifold of Gaussian distributions. This identification provides a direct physical realization of a geometric concept in information geometry. It implies that purely random processes evolve along informationally straight trajectories, analogous to geodesics in general relativity. Our findings suggest that the asymmetry of informational ``distance" (divergence) plays a fundamental physical role, offering a concrete step toward an equivalence principle for information.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Fairness Aware Multi Task Federated Learning for VR Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wireless connectivity promises to unshackle virtual reality (VR) experiences, allowing users to engage from anywhere, anytime. However, delivering seamless, high-quality, real-time VR video wirelessly is challenging due to the stringent quality of experience requirements, low latency constraints, and limited VR device capabilities. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel decentralized multi task fair federated learning (DMTFL) based caching that caches and prefetches each VR user's field of view (FOV) at base stations (BSs) based on the caching strategies tailored to each BS. In federated learning (FL) in its naive form, often biases toward certain users, and a single global model fails to capture the statistical heterogeneity across users and BSs. In contrast, the proposed DMTFL algorithm personalizes content delivery by learning individual caching models at each BS. These models are further optimized to perform well under any target distribution, while providing theoretical guarantees via Rademacher complexity and a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound on the loss. Using a realistic VR head-tracking dataset, our simulations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DMTFL algorithm compared to baseline algorithms.</description>
