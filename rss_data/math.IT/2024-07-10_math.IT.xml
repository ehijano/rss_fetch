      <title>Tight bounds for stream decodable error-correcting codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to communicate a message over a noisy channel, a sender (Alice) uses an error-correcting code to encode her message $x$ into a codeword. The receiver (Bob) decodes it correctly whenever there is at most a small constant fraction of adversarial error in the transmitted codeword. This work investigates the setting where Bob is computationally bounded. Specifically, Bob receives the message as a stream and must process it and write $x$ in order to a write-only tape while using low (say polylogarithmic) space. We show three basic results about this setting, which are informally as follows:
  (1) There is a stream decodable code of near-quadratic length.
  (2) There is no stream decodable code of sub-quadratic length.
  (3) If Bob need only compute a private linear function of the input bits, instead of writing them all to the output tape, there is a stream decodable code of near-linear length.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Joint Target Sensing and Proactive Eavesdropping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the beamforming design in the joint target sensing and proactive eavesdropping (JTSAPE) system. The JTSAPE base station (BS) receives the information transmitted by the illegal transmitter and transmits the waveform for target sensing. The shared waveform also serves as artificial noise to interfere with the illegal receiver, thereby achieving proactive eavesdropping. We firstly optimize the transmitting beam of the BS to maximize the eavesdropping signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio or minimize the target estimation parameter Cram{\'{e}}r-Rao bound, respectively. Then, the joint optimization of proactive eavesdropping and target sensing is investigated, and the normalized weighted optimization problem is formulated. To address the complexity of the original problem, the formulated problem is decomposed into two subproblems: proactive eavesdropping and target sensing, which are solved by the semi-definite relaxation technique. Furthermore, the scenario in which the quality of the eavesdropping channel is stronger than that of the illegal channel is considered. We utilize the sequential rank-one constraint relaxation method and iteration technique to obtain the high-quality suboptimal solution of the beam transmit covariance matrix. Numerical simulation shows the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Rate-Loss Regions for Polynomial Regression with Side Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of goal-oriented communications, this paper addresses the achievable rate versus generalization error region of a learning task applied on compressed data. The study focuses on the distributed setup where a source is compressed and transmitted through a noiseless channel to a receiver performing polynomial regression, aided by side information available at the decoder. The paper provides the asymptotic rate generalization error region, and extends the analysis to the non-asymptotic regime.Additionally, it investigates the asymptotic trade-off between polynomial regression and data reconstruction under communication constraints. The proposed achievable scheme is shown to achieve the minimum generalization error as well as the optimal rate-distortion region.</description>

      <title>OFDM Achieves the Lowest Ranging Sidelobe Under Random ISAC Signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to answer a fundamental question in the area of Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC): What is the optimal communication-centric ISAC waveform for ranging? Towards that end, we first established a generic framework to analyze the sensing performance of communication-centric ISAC waveforms built upon orthonormal signaling bases and random data symbols. Then, we evaluated their ranging performance by adopting both the periodic and aperiodic auto-correlation functions (P-ACF and A-ACF), and defined the expectation of the integrated sidelobe level (EISL) as a sensing performance metric. On top of that, we proved that among all communication waveforms with cyclic prefix (CP), the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation is the only globally optimal waveform that achieves the lowest ranging sidelobe for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and phase shift keying (PSK) constellations, in terms of both the EISL and the sidelobe level at each individual lag of the P-ACF. As a step forward, we proved that among all communication waveforms without CP, OFDM is a locally optimal waveform for QAM/PSK in the sense that it achieves a local minimum of the EISL of the A-ACF. Finally, we demonstrated by numerical results that under QAM/PSK constellations, there is no other orthogonal communication-centric waveform that achieves a lower ranging sidelobe level than that of the OFDM, in terms of both P-ACF and A-ACF cases.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Robustness and Security in ISAC Network Design: Leveraging Transmissive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface with RSMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surface transceiver-enhanced robust and secure integrated sensing and communication network. A time-division sensing communication mechanism is designed for the scenario, which enables communication and sensing to share wireless resources. To address the interference management problem and hinder eavesdropping, we implement rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), where the common stream is designed as a useful signal and an artificial noise, while taking into account the imperfect channel state information and modeling the channel for the illegal users in a fine-grained manner as well as giving an upper bound on the error. We introduce the secrecy outage probability and construct an optimization problem with secrecy sum-rate as the objective functions to optimize the common stream beamforming matrix, the private stream beamforming matrix and the timeslot duration variable. Due to the coupling of the optimization variables and the infinity of the error set, the proposed problem is a nonconvex optimization problem that cannot be solved directly. In order to address the above challenges, the block coordinate descent-based second-order cone programming algorithm is used to decouple the optimization variables and solving the problem. Specifically, the problem is decoupled into two subproblems concerning the common stream beamforming matrix, the private stream beamforming matrix, and the timeslot duration variable, which are solved by alternating optimization until convergence is reached. To solve the problem, S-procedure, Bernstein's inequality and successive convex approximation are employed to deal with the objective function and non-convex constraints. Numerical simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed scheme in improving the secrecy energy efficiency and the Cram\'{e}r-Rao boundary.</description>

      <title>Revealing the evanescent components in Kronecker-product based codebooks: insights and implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orthogonal bases of discrete Fourier transform (DFT) has been recognized as the standard spatial-domain bases for Type I, Type II and enhanced Type II codewords by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). For uniform planar arrays, these spatial-domain bases are derived as the Kronecker product of one-dimensional DFT bases. Theoretically, each spatial basis corresponds to a beam directed towards a specific angle of departure and the set of bases represent the orthogonal beams that cover the front hemisphere of an array. While the Kronecker-product based precoding scheme facilitates the concise indexing of a codeword in the codebooks through precoding matrix indicators (PMIs) in channel state information feedback, it introduces redundant spatial beams characterized by high spatial-frequency components. This paper investigates the presence of codewords representing high spatial-frequency components within the Kronecker-product based codebooks. Through theoretical analysis and simulations, we confirm the redundancy of these codewords in MIMO communications, advocating for their removal from the codebooks to enhance system performance. Several topics relevant to the high spatial components are also involved in the discussion. Practical suggestions regarding future standard design are provided based on our theoretical analysis and simulation results.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficient Fair STAR-RIS for Mobile Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a method to improve the energy efficiency and fairness of simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) for mobile users, ensuring reduced power consumption while maintaining reliable communication. To achieve this, we introduce a new parameter known as the subsurface assignment variable, which determines the number of STAR-RIS elements allocated to each user. We then formulate a novel optimization problem by concurrently optimizing the phase shifts of the STAR-RIS and subsurface assignment variable. We leverage the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique to address this optimization problem. The DRL model predicts the phase shifts of the STAR-RIS and efficiently allocates elements of STAR-RIS to the users. Additionally, we incorporate a penalty term in the DRL model to facilitate intelligent deactivation of STAR-RIS elements when not in use to enhance energy efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we show that the proposed method can achieve fairly high and nearly equal data rates for all users in both the transmission and reflection spaces in an energy-efficient manner.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Received Adaptive Spatial Modulation for Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel wireless transmission scheme, as named the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted received adaptive spatial modulation (RASM) scheme, is proposed in this paper. In this scheme, the adaptive spatial modulation (ASM)-based antennas selection works at the receiver by employing the characteristics of the RIS in each time slot, where the signal-to-noise ratio at specific selected antennas can be further enhanced with near few powers. Besides for the bits from constellation symbols, the extra bits can be mapped into the indices of receive antenna combinations and conveyed to the receiver through the ASM-based antenna-combination selection, thus providing higher spectral efficiency. To explicitly present the RASM scheme, the analytical performance of bit error rate of it is discussed in this paper. As a trade-off selection, the proposed scheme shows higher spectral efficiency and remains the satisfactory error performance. Simulation and analytical results demonstrate the better performance and exhibit more potential to apply in practical wireless communication.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Spatial Information for Self-Supervised Place Cell Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mammals navigate novel environments and exhibit resilience to sparse environmental sensory cues via place and grid cells, which encode position in space. While the efficiency of grid cell coding has been extensively studied, the computational role of place cells is less well understood. This gap arises partially because spatial information measures have, until now, been limited to single place cells. We derive and implement a higher-order spatial information measure, allowing for the study of the emergence of multiple place cells in a self-supervised manner. We show that emergent place cells have many desirable features, including high-accuracy spatial decoding. This is the first work in which higher-order spatial information measures that depend solely on place cells' firing rates have been derived and which focuses on the emergence of multiple place cells via self-supervised learning. By quantifying the spatial information of multiple place cells, we enhance our understanding of place cell formation and capabilities in recurrent neural networks, thereby improving the potential navigation capabilities of artificial systems in novel environments without objective location information.</description>

      <title>Josephson oscillations of two weakly coupled Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A numerical experiment based on a particle number-conserving quantum field theory is performed for two initially independent Bose-Einstein condensates that are coherently coupled at two temperatures. The present model illustrates ab initio that the initial relative phase of each of the two condensates doesn't remain random, but is distributed around integer multiple values of $2\pi$ from the interference and thermalization of forward and backward propagating matter waves at the Boltzmann equilibrium, that intrinsically measures zero average phases for each of the two independent condensates. Following this approach, focus is put on the original Gedanken experiment of Anderson on whether a Josephson current between two initially separated Bose-Einstein condensates occurs in a deterministic way or not, depending on the initial phase distribution.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication in Multi-team Dynamic Games: A Mean Field Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coordinating communication and control is a key component in the stability and performance of networked multi-agent systems. While single user networked control systems have gained a lot of attention within this domain, in this work, we address the more challenging problem of large population multi-team dynamic games. In particular, each team constitutes two decision makers (namely, the sensor and the controller) who coordinate over a shared network to control a dynamically evolving state of interest under costs on both actuation and sensing/communication. Due to the shared nature of the wireless channel, the overall cost of each team depends on other teams' policies, thereby leading to a noncooperative game setup. Due to the presence of a large number of teams, we compute approximate decentralized Nash equilibrium policies for each team using the paradigm of (extended) mean-field games, which is governed by (1) the mean traffic flowing over the channel, and (2) the value of information at the sensor, which highlights the semantic nature of the ensuing communication. In the process, we compute optimal controller policies and approximately optimal sensor policies for each representative team of the mean-field system to alleviate the problem of general non-contractivity of the mean-field fixed point operator associated with the finite cardinality of the sensor action space. Consequently, we also prove the $\epsilon$--Nash property of the mean-field equilibrium solution which essentially characterizes how well the solution derived using mean-field analysis performs on the finite-team system. Finally, we provide extensive numerical simulations, which corroborate the theoretical findings and lead to additional insights on the properties of the results presented.</description>

      <title>Low-cost noise reduction for Clifford circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Clifford noise reduction (CliNR) scheme that provides a reduction of the logical error rate of Clifford circuit with lower overhead than error correction and without the exponential sampling overhead of error mitigation. CliNR implements Clifford circuits by splitting them into sub-circuits that are performed using gate teleportation. A few random stabilizer measurements are used to detect errors in the resources states consumed by the gate teleportation. This can be seen as a teleported version of the CPC scheme, with offline fault-detection making it scalable. We prove that CliNR achieves a vanishing logical error rate for families of $n$-qubit Clifford circuits with size $s$ such that $nsp^2$ goes to 0, where $p$ is the physical error rate, meaning that it reaches the regime $ns = o(1/p^2)$ whereas the direct implementation is limited to $s = o(1/p)$. Moreover, CliNR uses only $3n+1$ qubits, $2s + o(s)$ gates and has zero rejection rate. This small overhead makes it more practical than quantum error correction in the near term and our numerical simulations show that CliNR provides a reduction of the logical error rate in relevant noise regimes.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic classification of the cutoff phenomenon in Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cutoff phenomenon for Markov processes under information divergences such as $f$-divergences and R\'enyi divergences. We classify most common divergences into four types, namely $L^2$-type, $\mathrm{TV}$-type, separation-type and $\mathrm{KL}$ divergence, in which we prove that the cutoff phenomenon are equivalent and relate the cutoff time and window among members within each type. To justify that this classification is natural, we provide examples in which the family of Markov processes exhibit cutoff in one type but not in another. We also establish new product conditions in these settings for the processes to exhibit cutoff, along with new results in non-reversible or non-normal situations. The proofs rely on a functional analytic approach towards cutoff.</description>

      <title>Constructing $k$-ary Orientable Sequences with Asymptotically Optimal Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An orientable sequence of order $n$ over an alphabet $\{0,1,\ldots, k{-}1\}$ is a cyclic sequence such that each length-$n$ substring appears at most once \emph{in either direction}. When $k= 2$, efficient algorithms are known to construct binary orientable sequences, with asymptotically optimal length, by applying the classic cycle-joining technique. The key to the construction is the definition of a parent rule to construct a cycle-joining tree of asymmetric bracelets. Unfortunately, the parent rule does not generalize to larger alphabets. Furthermore, unlike the binary case, a cycle-joining tree does not immediately lead to a simple successor-rule when $k \geq 3$ unless the tree has certain properties. In this paper, we derive a parent rule to derive a cycle-joining tree of $k$-ary asymmetric bracelets. This leads to a successor rule that constructs asymptotically optimal $k$-ary orientable sequences in $O(n)$ time per symbol using $O(n)$ space. In the special case when $n=2$, we provide a simple construction of $k$-ary orientable sequences of maximal length.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13415v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize staircase codes and tiled diagonal zipper codes, preserving their key properties while allowing each coded symbol to be protected by arbitrarily many component codewords rather than only two. This generalization which we term "higher-order staircase codes" arises from the marriage of two distinct combinatorial objects: difference triangle sets and finite-geometric nets, which have typically been applied separately to code design. We demonstrate one possible realization of these codes, obtaining powerful, high-rate, low-error-floor, and low-complexity coding schemes based on simple iterative syndrome-domain decoding of coupled Hamming component codes. We anticipate that the proposed codes could improve performance--complexity--latency tradeoffs in high-throughput communications applications, most notably fiber-optic, in which classical staircase codes and zipper codes have been applied. We consider the construction of difference triangle sets having minimum scope and sum-of-lengths, which lead to memory-optimal realizations of higher-order staircase codes. These results also enable memory reductions for early families of convolutional codes constructed from difference triangle sets.</description>

Abstract: Ferrers diagram rank-metric codes were introduced by Etzion and Silberstein in 2009. In their work, they proposed a conjecture on the largest dimension of a space of matrices over a finite field whose nonzero elements are supported on a given Ferrers diagram and all have rank lower bounded by a fixed positive integer $d$. Since stated, the Etzion-Silberstein conjecture has been verified in a number of cases, often requiring additional constraints on the field size or on the minimum rank $d$ in dependence of the corresponding Ferrers diagram. As of today, this conjecture still remains widely open. Using modular methods, we give a constructive proof of the Etzion-Silberstein conjecture for the class of strictly monotone Ferrers diagrams, which does not depend on the minimum rank $d$ and holds over every finite field. In addition, we leverage on the last result to also prove the conjecture for the class of MDS-constructible Ferrers diagrams, without requiring any restriction on the field size.</description>
