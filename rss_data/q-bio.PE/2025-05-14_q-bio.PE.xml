      <title>Emergent dynamical phases and collective motion in termites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Termites which are able to forage in the open can be often seen, in the field or in the lab: (i) wandering around, forming no observable pattern, or (ii) clustering themselves in a dense and almost immobile pack, or (iii) milling about in a circular movement. Despite been well reported patterns, they are normally regarded as independent phenomena whose specific traits have never been properly quantified. Evidence, however, favours the hypothesis that these are interdependent patterns, arisen from self-organised interactions and movement among workers. After all, termites are a form of active matter where blind cooperative individuals are self-propelled and lack the possibility of visual cues to spatially orientate and align. It follows that their non-trivial close-contact patterns could generate motion-collision induced phase separations. This would then trigger the emergence of these three patterns (disorder, clustering, milling) as parts of the same continuum. By inspecting termite groups confined in arenas, we could quantitatively describe each one of these patterns in detail. We identified disorder, clustering and milling spatial patterns. These phases and their transitions are characterised aiming to offer refinements in the understanding of these aspects of self-propelled particles in active matter where close-range contacts and collisions are important.</description>

      <title>RDA-PSO: A computational method to quantify the diffusive dispersal of insects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a computational method, called "Recapture of Diffusive Agents &amp; Particle Swarm Optimization" (RDA-PSO), designed to estimate the dispersal parameter of diffusive insects in mark-release-recapture (MRR) field experiments. In addition to describing the method, its properties are discussed, with particular focus on robustness in estimating the observed diffusion coefficient. It is shown that RDA-PSO provides a simple and reliable approach to quantify mosquito dispersal that outperforms other techniques based on the solution of the diffusion equation, three of which are also introduced in this work. Examples of application to both synthetic and real field data for the yellow fever mosquito are provided.</description>

      <title>Tropical Fermat-Weber Points over Bergman Fans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite set $[p]:= \{1, \ldots , p\}$, it is well known that the space of all ultrametrics on $[p]$ is the Bergman fan associated to the matroid underlying the complete graph of the vertex set $[p]$. Lin et al.~showed that the set of tropical Fermat-Weber points might not be contained in the space of ultrametrics on $[p]$ even if all input data points are in the space. Here we consider a more general set up and we focus on Fermat-Weber points with respect to the tropical metric over the Bergman fan associated with a matroid with the ground set of $q$ elements. We show that there always exists a Fermat-Weber point in the Bergman fan for data in the Bergman fan and we describe explicitly the set of all Fermat-Weber points in the Bergman fan. Then we introduce the natural extension of the safety radius introduced by Atteson to the set of Fermat-Weber points in the Bergman fan of a matroid.</description>
