      <title>Teaching Mathematics and Sustainability (A narration of a rough journey)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note presents reflections drawn from my recent experiences in teaching a course on mathematics and sustainability, with a particular emphasis on raising awareness of the topic and its broader implications. The lectures were structured to bridge conceptual understanding with practical engagement--combining mathematical modeling, critical discussion, and case studies on real-world sustainability challenges. Much of the actual work was done through interactive problem-solving sessions, group discussions, and short projects where students explored how quantitative reasoning can inform sustainable decision-making. The aim was not only to convey technical tools, but also to cultivate a deeper appreciation of how mathematics can serve as a framework for interpreting and addressing complex societal issues.</description>

      <title>A Vector-Algebraic Reconstruction of the Medieval Arab Formula for the Shadow of a Gnomon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a modern reconstruction of the classical formula, first derived by medieval Arab astronomers, that describes the trajectory of the tip of a gnomon's shadow during the day as a function of latitude, solar declination, and gnomon height. Unlike the traditional derivations based on spherical trigonometry, our approach uses only elementary vector algebra and rotation matrices. The same vector framework naturally extends to other classical relations used in sundial construction.</description>

      <title>On Physical Mathematics: an approach through Gilles Ch\^atelet's philosophy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from Greg Moore's description about Physical Mathematics, a framework is proposed in order to understand it, based on Gilles Ch\^atelet's philosophy. It will be argued that Ch\^atelet's ideas of inverting, splitting, augmenting and virtuality are crucial in the discussion about the nature of Physical Mathematics. Along this line, it will be proposed that mirror symmetry is a natural study case to test Ch\^atelet's ideas in this context. This should be considered as a first step in a long term project aiming to study the relations among mathematics, physics and philosophy in the construction of a global understanding of the structure of the universe, as it was envisioned by Grothendieck in the late 80's of the last century and it was started to be developed independently by Ch\^atelet in the beginning of the 90's. The main suggestion of the essay is that it is in the relations between mathematics, physics and philosophy that new knowledge arises.</description>
