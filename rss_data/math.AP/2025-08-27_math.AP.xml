      <title>Higher-order homogenization for equations of linearized elasticity using the operator-asymptotic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The operator-asymptotic approach was introduced by Lim-\v{Z}ubrini\'c in [Asymptotic Analysis. 141(4), p. 211-256 (2025)] for the homogenization of an $\varepsilon\mathbb{Z}^d$-periodic composite media. In this article, we consider the setting of three-dimensional linearized elasticity, and extend the approach to obtain higher-order convergence rates. In particular, we consider the so-called ``Bloch approximation'' for vector-valued functions with compact Fourier support, and demonstrate that under such data, the approach provides an expansion that yields an error of order $\varepsilon^{n+1}$ in $L^2$ and $\varepsilon^n$ in $H^1$, for any $n$.</description>

      <title>Maximal estimates for orthonormal systems of wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates maximal estimates of the wave operators for orthonormal families of initial data. We extend the classical maximal estimates for the wave operator by making partial progress on maximal estimates for orthonormal systems in low dimensions. Our novel approach is based on a geometric analysis of the kernel of wave operators within the framework of Schatten $2$ estimates. In particular, we exploit Wolff's geometric lemma on the intersection patterns of thickened spheres.</description>

      <title>Maximal estimates for orthonormal systems of wave equations with sharp regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study maximal estimates for the wave equation with orthonormal initial data. In dimension $d=3$, we establish optimal results with the sharp regularity exponent up to the endpoint. In higher dimensions $d \ge 4$ and also in $d=2$, we obtain sharp bounds for the Schatten exponent (summability index) $\beta\in [2, \infty]$ when $d\ge4$, and $\beta\in[1, 2]$ when $d=2$, improving upon the previous estimates due to Kinoshita--Ko--Shiraki. Our approach is based on a novel analysis of a key integral arising in the case $\beta=2$, which allows us to refine existing techniques and achieve the optimal estimates.</description>

      <title>Global regularity of Leray-Hopf weak solutions to 3D Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any Leray-Hopf weak solution to 3D Navier-Stokes equations with initial values u0 2 H1=2(R3) belong to L1(0; 1; H1=2(R3)) and thus it is regular. For the proof, flrst, we construct a supercritical space, the norm of which is compared to the homogeneous Sobolev H_ 1=2-norm in that it has inverse logarithmic weight very sparsely in the frequency domain. Then we obtain the energy estimates of high frequency parts of the solution which involve the supercritical norm on the right-hand side. Finally, we superpose the energy norm of high frequency parts of the solution to get estimates of the critical norms of the weak solution via the re-scaling argument.</description>

      <title>Backward Harnack inequality and Hamilton estimates for heat type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on gradient estimates for the heat equation by Hamilton, we discover a backward in time Harnack inequality for positive solutions on compact manifolds without further restrictions such as boundedness or vanishing boundary value for solutions. Contrary to the usual Harnack inequality, it allows comparison of the values of a solution at two different space time points, in both directions of time. In view of the importance of the usual Harnack inequality, further application is expected.</description>

      <title>Controllability of a One-Dimensional Dynamic Debonding Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional dynamic debonding model, introduced by Freund (1990), in which the wave equation is coupled with a Griffith criterion governing the propagation of the fracture. In particular, we study the boundary controllability of the system to a prescribed target state. Our main results provide precise characterizations of the reachable target states, in both \( C^{ 0, 1 } \) and \( C^1 \) regularity settings, and construct exact controls toward these target states.</description>

      <title>Unconditional Uniqueness of 5th Order KP Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the $5$th Order Kadomstev-Petviashvili (KP) equations posed on the real line. In particular we adapt the energy estimate argument from Guo-Molinet (arXiv:2404.12364v1 [math.AP]) to conclude unconditional uniqueness of the solution to data map for $5$th order KP type equations. Applying short-time $X^{s,b}$ methods to improve classical energy estimates provides more than sufficient decay when considering estimates on the interior of the time interval $[0,T]$. The issue is how we deal with the boundary. By abusing symmetry we can apply multilinear interpolation to gain access to $L^4$ Strichartz estimates, which provide improved derivative gain. When taken together, the regularity of our resultant function space can be arbitrarily close to $L^2$, which in the context of unconditional uniqueness results is almost sharp.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a fractional $p$-Laplace equation involving a variable exponent singular nonlinearity in the framework of the Heisenberg group. We first establish the existence and regularity of weak solutions. In the case of a constant singular exponent, we further prove the uniqueness of solutions and characterize the extremals of a related Sobolev-type inequality. Additionally, we demonstrate a connection between the solutions of the singular problem and these extremals. To the best of our knowledge, these findings provide new insights even in the classical case $p=2$.</description>

      <title>Existence for accreting viscoelastic solids at large strains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By revisiting a model proposed in [45], we address the accretive growth of a viscoelastic solid at large strains. The accreted material is assumed to accumulate at the boundary of the body in an unstressed state. The growth process is driven by the deformation state of the solid. The progressive build-up of incompatible strains in the material is modeled by considering an additional backstrain. The model is regularized by postulating the presence of a fictitious compliant material surrounding the accreting body. We show the existence of solutions to the coupled accretion and viscoelastic equilibrium problem.</description>

      <title>Quantitative stability for the conformally invariant Chang-Gui inequality on the exponentiation of functions on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on a recent variant of the Trudinger-Moser-Onofri inequality introduced by S. Y. Alice Chang and Changfeng Gui \cite{CG-2023}: \begin{align*} \alpha\int_{\mathbb{S}^2}|\nabla_{\mathbb{S}^2}u|^2 {\rm d}\omega+2 \int_{\mathbb{S}^2} u {\rm d}\omega -\frac{1}{2}\ln\left[\left(\int_{\mathbb{s}^2}e^{2u}{\rm d}\omega\right)^2-\sum_{i=1}^3\left(\int_{\mathbb{s}^2}\omega_i e^{2u}{\rm d} \omega\right)^2\right] \geq 0 \end{align*} holds on $H^1(\mathbb{S}^2)$ if and only if $\alpha \geq \frac{2}{3}$. In this regime, the infimum is attained only by trivial functions when $\alpha &gt; \frac{2}{3},$ whereas for the critical value $\alpha = \frac{2}{3}$ nontrivial extremals exist, and Chang-Gui further provided a complete classification of such solutions.
  Building upon their result, we found a nice conformal invariance of the associated functional. Exploiting this invariance, we were able to characterize the full family of extremals in terms of conformal maps of $\mathbb{S}^2$ and, moreover, establish a sharp quantitative stability result in the gradient norm.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-breaking bifurcation of periodic solutions for a free-boundary tumor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a free boundary multi-layer tumor model that incorporates a $T-$periodic provision of external nutrients $\Phi(t)$. The simplified model contains three parameters: the mean of periodic external nutrients $\Phi(t)$, the threshold concentration $\widetilde{\sigma}$ for proliferation and the cell to cell adhesiveness coefficient $\gamma$. We first study the flat solution and give a complete classification about $\frac{1}{T} \int_0^T \Phi(t) d t$ and $\widetilde{\sigma}$ according to global stability of zero equilibrium solution or global stability of the positive periodic solution. Precisely, (i) a zero flat solution is globally stable under the flat perturbations if and only if $\widetilde{\sigma} \geqslant \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T \Phi(t) d t$; (ii) If $\widetilde{\sigma}&lt;\frac{1}{T} \int_0^T \Phi(t) d t$, then there exists a unique positive flat solution $\left(\sigma_*(y, t), p_*(y, t), { \rho_*(t)}\right)$ with period $T$ and it is a global attractor of all positive flat solutions for all $\gamma&gt;0$. We further investigate periodic solutions bifurcating from the flat periodic solution $\left(\sigma_*(y, t), p_*(y, t), { \rho_*(t)}\right)$. By periodicity and symmetry, we not only give symmetry-breaking periodic solutions for all positive parameter $\gamma_j$, but also show the existence of a plethora of periodic bifurcations. For the free boundary tumor problem, this is the first result of the existence of periodic bifurcations.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of oscillations for axisymmetric solar backgrounds with differential rotation and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local helioseismology comprises of imaging and inversion techniques employed to reconstruct the dynamic and interior of the Sun from correlations of oscillations observed on the surface, all of which require modeling solar oscillations and computing Green's kernels. In this context, we implement and investigate the robustness of the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method in solving the equation modeling stellar oscillations for realistic solar backgrounds containing gravity and differential rotation. While a common choice for modeling stellar oscillations is the Galbrun's equation, our working equations are derived from an equivalent variant, involving less regularity in its coefficients, working with Lagrangian displacement and pressure perturbation as unknowns. Under differential rotation and axisymmetric assumption, the system is solved in azimuthal decomposition with the HDG method. Compared to no-gravity approximations, the mathematical nature of the wave operator is now linked to the profile of the solar buoyancy frequency N which encodes gravity, and leads to distinction into regions of elliptic or hyperbolic behavior of the wave operator at zero attenuation. While small attenuation is systematically included to guarantee theoretical well-posedness, the above phenomenon affects the numerical solutions in terms of amplitude and oscillation pattern, and requires a judicious choice of stabilization. We investigate the stabilization of the HDG discretization scheme, and demonstrate its importance to ensure the accuracy of numerical results, which is shown to depend on frequencies relative to N, and on the position of the Dirac source. As validations, the numerical power spectra reproduce accurately the observed effects of the solar rotation on acoustic waves.</description>

      <title>Global mild solution with polynomial tail for the Boltzmann equation in the whole space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.04676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are concerned with the Cauchy problem on the Boltzmann equation in the whole space. The goal is to construct global-in-time bounded mild solutions near Maxwellians with the perturbation admitting a polynomial tail in large velocities. The proof is based on the Caflisch's decomposition together with the $L^2- L^\infty$ interplay technique developed by Guo. The full range of both hard and soft potentials under the Grad's cutoff assumption can be covered. The main difficulty to be overcome in case of the whole space is the polynomial time decay of solutions which is much slower than the exponential rate in contrast with the torus case.</description>

      <title>Ground state solution for a generalized Choquard Schrodinger equation with vanishing potential in homogeneous fractional Musielak Sobolev spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to establish the existence of a weak solution for the following problem: \begin{equation*} (-\Delta)^{s}_{\mathcal{H}}u(x) +V(x)h(x,x,|u|)u(x)=\left(\int_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}\dfrac{K(y)F(u(y))}{|x-y|^\lambda}dy \right) K(x)f(u(x)) \ \hbox{in} \ \mathbb{R}^{N}, \end{equation*} where $N\geq 1$, $s\in(0,1), \lambda\in(0,N), \mathcal{H}(x,y,t)=\int_{0}^{|t|} h(x,y,r)r\ dr,$ $ h:\mathbb{R}^{N}\times\mathbb{R}^{N}\times [0,\infty)\rightarrow[0,\infty)$ is a generalized $N$-function and $(-\Delta)^{s}_{\mathcal{H}}$ is a generalized fractional Laplace operator. The functions $V,K:\mathbb{R}^{N}\rightarrow (0,\infty)$, non-linear function $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are continuous and $ F(t)=\int_{0}^{t}f(r)dr.$ First, we introduce the homogeneous fractional Musielak-Sobolev space and investigate their properties. After that, we pose the given problem in that space. To establish our existence results, we prove and use the suitable version of Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality for Lebesque Musielak spaces together with variational technique based on the mountain pass theorem. We also prove the existence of a ground state solution by the method of Nehari manifold.</description>

Abstract: For $p \in (1, \infty)$ and $s \in (0,1)$, we consider the following mixed local-nonlocal equation
  $$ - \Delta_p u + (-\Delta_p)^s u = f \; \text{in} \; \Omega,$$ where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is a bounded domain and the function $f \in L_{loc}^1(\Omega)$. Depending on the dimension $d$, we prove gradient potential estimates of weak solutions for the entire ranges of $p$ and $s$. As a byproduct, we recover the corresponding estimates in the purely diffusive setup, providing connections between the local and nonlocal aspects of the equation. Our results are new, even for the linear case $p=2$.</description>

      <title>A quasilinear Keller-Segel model with saturated discontinuous advection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the singular limit of a chemotaxis model of bacterial collective motion recently introduced in arXiv:2009.11048 [math.AP]. The equation models aggregation-diffusion phenomena with advection that is discontinuous and depends sharply on the gradient of the density itself. The quasi-linearity of the problem poses major challenges in the construction of the solution and complications arise in the proof of regularity. Our method overcomes these obstacle by relying solely on entropy inequalities and the theory of monotone operators. We provide existence, uniqueness and smoothing estimates in any dimensional space.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability for active suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01906v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the nonlinear analysis of a kinetic model introduced by Saintillan and Shelley to describe suspensions of active rodlike particles in viscous flows. We investigate the stability of the constant state $\Psi(t,x,p) = \frac{1}{4\pi}$ corresponding to a distribution of particles that is homogeneous in space (variable $x \in \mathbb{T}^3$) and uniform in orientation (variable $p \in \mathbb{S}^2$). We prove its nonlinear stability under the optimal condition of linearized spectral stability. The main achievement in this work is that the smallness condition on the initial perturbation is independent of the translational diffusion and only depends on the rotational diffusion, which is particularly relevant for dilute suspensions. Upgrading our previous linear study to such nonlinear stability result requires new mathematical ideas, due to the presence of a quasilinear term in $x$ associated with nonlinear convection. This term cannot be treated as a source, because it is not controllable by the rotational diffusion in $p$. Also, it prevents the decoupling of $x$-Fourier modes crucially used in our previous paper. A key feature of our work is an analysis of enhanced dissipation and mixing properties of the advection diffusion operator $\partial_t + (p + u(t,x)) \cdot \nabla_x - \nu \Delta_p$ on $\mathbb{T}^3 \times \mathbb{S}^2$ for a given appropriately small vector field $u$. We hope this linear analysis to be of independent interest, and useful in other contexts with partial or anisotropic diffusions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate normalized solutions for doubly nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on the real line with a defocusing standard nonlinearity and a focusing nonlinear point interaction of $\delta$--type at the origin. We provide a complete characterization of existence and uniqueness for normalized solutions and for energy ground states for every value of the nonlinearity powers. We show that the interplay between a defocusing standard and a focusing point nonlinearity gives rise to new phenomena with respect to those observed with single nonlinearities, standard combined nonlinearities, and combined focusing standard and pointwise nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>The conformal logarithmic Laplacian on the sphere: Yamabe-type problems and Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the conformal logarithmic Laplacian on the sphere, an explicit singular integral operator that arises as the derivative (with respect to the order parameter) of the conformal fractional Laplacian at zero. Our analysis provides a detailed investigation of its spectral properties, its conformal invariance, and the associated \(Q\)-curvature problem. Furthermore, we establish a precise connection between this operator on the sphere and the logarithmic Laplacian in \(\mathbb{R}^N\) via stereographic projection. This correspondence bridges classification results for two Yamabe-type problems previously studied in the literature, extending one of them to the weak setting. To this end, we introduce a Hilbert space that serves as the logarithmic counterpart of the homogeneous fractional Sobolev space, offering a natural functional framework for the variational study of logarithmic-type equations in unbounded domains.</description>

      <title>Stable Determination of Coefficients in Nonlinear Dynamical Schr\"odinger Equations by Carleman Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of recovering stationary coefficients in a class of dynamical Schr\"odinger equations with locally analytic nonlinear terms. Upon treating the well-posedness for small initial data and trivial boundary data, we proceed to establish stable and unique determination provided knowledge of the coefficients near the boundary and the measured Neumann data of the solution. We discuss both the case of measurement on a subset of the boundary large enough to satisfy a certain geometrical condition and, under stronger assumptions on the regularity and size of the coefficients, the case of measurement on arbitrary subsets of the boundary. Our argument relies on high-order linearization and Carleman estimates for the linear Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Efficient PINNs via Multi-Head Unimodular Regularization of the Solutions Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-linear differential equations are a fundamental tool to describe different phenomena in nature. However, we still lack a well-established method to tackle stiff differential equations. Here we present a machine learning framework to facilitate the solution of nonlinear multiscale differential equations and, especially, inverse problems using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). This framework is based on what is called \textit{multi-head} (MH) training, which involves training the network to learn a general space of all solutions for a given set of equations with certain variability, rather than learning a specific solution of the system. This setup is used with a second novel technique that we call Unimodular Regularization (UR) of the latent space of solutions. We show that the multi-head approach, combined with Unimodular Regularization, significantly improves the efficiency of PINNs by facilitating the transfer learning process thereby enabling the finding of solutions for nonlinear, coupled, and multiscale differential equations.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear SPDEs and Maximal Regularity: An Extended Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18561v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this survey, we provide an in-depth exposition of our recent results on the well-posedness theory for stochastic evolution equations, employing maximal regularity techniques. The core of our approach is an abstract notion of critical spaces, which, when applied to nonlinear SPDEs, coincides with the concept of scaling-invariant spaces. This framework leads to several sharp blow-up criteria and enables one to obtain instantaneous regularization results. Additionally, we refine and unify our previous results, while also presenting several new contributions.
  In the second part of the survey, we apply the abstract results to several concrete SPDEs. In particular, we give applications to stochastic perturbations of quasi-geostrophic equations, Navier-Stokes equations, and reaction-diffusion systems (including Allen--Cahn, Cahn--Hilliard and Lotka--Volterra models). Moreover, for the Navier--Stokes equations, we establish new Serrin-type blow-up criteria. While some applications are addressed using $L^2$-theory, many require a more general $L^p(L^q)$-framework. In the final section, we outline several open problems, covering both abstract aspects of stochastic evolution equations, and concrete questions in the study of linear and nonlinear SPDEs.</description>
