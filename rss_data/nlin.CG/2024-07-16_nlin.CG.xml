      <title>Intrinsic Universality in Seeded Active Tile Self-Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tile Automata (TA) model describes self-assembly systems in which monomers can build structures and transition with an adjacent monomer to change their states. This paper shows that seeded TA is a non-committal intrinsically universal model of self-assembly. We present a single universal Tile Automata system containing approximately 4600 states that can simulate (a) the output assemblies created by any other Tile Automata system G, (b) the dynamics involved in building G's assemblies, and (c) G's internal state transitions. It does so in a non-committal way: it preserves the full non-deterministic dynamics of a tile's potential attachment or transition by selecting its state in a single step, considering all possible outcomes until the moment of selection.
  The system uses supertiles, each encoding the complete system being simulated. The universal system builds supertiles from its seed, each representing a single tile in G, transferring the information to simulate G to each new tile. Supertiles may also asynchronously transition states according to the rules of G. This result directly transfers to a restricted version of asynchronous Cellular Automata: pairwise Cellular Automata.</description>

      <title>Quantum and Classical Dynamics with Random Permutation Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding thermalisation in quantum many-body systems is among the most enduring problems in modern physics. A particularly interesting question concerns the role played by quantum mechanics in this process, i.e. whether thermalisation in quantum many-body systems is fundamentally different from that in classical many-body systems and, if so, which of its features are genuinely quantum. Here we study this question in minimally structured many-body systems which are only constrained to have local interactions, i.e. local random circuits. We introduce a class of random permutation circuits (RPCs), where the gates locally permute basis states modelling generic microscopic classical dynamics, and compare them to random unitary circuits (RUCs), a standard toy model for generic quantum dynamics. We show that, like RUCs, RPCs permit the analytical computation of several key quantities such as out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs), or entanglement entropies. RPCs can be interpreted both as quantum or classical dynamics, which we use to find similarities and differences between the two. Performing the average over all random circuits, we discover a series of exact relations, connecting quantities in RUC and (quantum) RPCs. In the classical setting, we obtain similar exact results relating (quantum) purity to (classical) growth of mutual information and (quantum) OTOCs to (classical) decorrelators. Our results indicate that despite of the fundamental differences between quantum and classical systems, their dynamics exhibits qualitatively similar behaviours.</description>
