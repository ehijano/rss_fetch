      <title>Boundedness of the Cherednik kernel and its limit transition from type BC to type A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Cherednik kernel and a hypergeometric function for integral root systems and prove their relation to spherical functions associated with Riemannian symmetric spaces of reductive Lie groups. Furthermore, we characterize the spectral parameters for which the Cherednik kernel is a bounded function. In the case of a crystallographic root system, this characterization was proven by Narayanan, Pasquale and Pusti for the hypergeometric function. This result generalizes the Helgason- Johnson theorem from 1969, which characterizes the bounded spherical functions of a Riemannian symmetric space. The characterization for the Cherednik kernel is based on recurrence relations for the associated Cherednik operators under the dual affine Weyl group going back to Sahi. These recurrence relations are also used to prove a limit transition between the Cherednik kernel of type A and of type B, which generalizes an already known result for the associated hypergeometric functions by R\"osler, Koornwinder, and Voit.</description>

      <title>Real-variable Theory of Anisotropic Musielak-Orlicz-Lorentz Hardy Spaces with Applications to Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\varphi: \mathbb{R}^{n}\times[0,\infty)\rightarrow[0,\infty)$ be a Musielak-Orlicz function satisfying the uniformly anisotropic Muckenhoupt condition and be of uniformly lower type $p^-_{\varphi}$ and of uniformly upper type $p^+_{\varphi}$ with $0&lt;p^-_{\varphi}\leq p^+_{\varphi}&lt;\infty$, $q\in(0,\infty]$, and $A$ be a general expansive matrix on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. In this article, the authors first introduce the anisotropic Musielak-Orlicz-Lorentz Hardy space $H^{\varphi,q}_A(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ which, when $q=\infty$, coincides with the known anisotropic weak Musielak-Orlicz Hardy space $H^{\varphi,\infty}_A(\mathbb{R}^{n})$, and then establish atomic and molecular characterizations of $H^{\varphi,q}_A(\mathbb{R}^{n})$. As applications, the authors prove the boundedness of anisotropic Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators on $H^{\varphi,q}_A(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ when $q\in(0,\infty)$ or from the anisotropic Musielak-Orlicz Hardy space $H^{\varphi}_A(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ to $H^{\varphi,\infty}_A(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ in the critical case. The ranges of all the exponents under consideration are the best possible admissible ones which particularly improve all the known corresponding results for $H^{\varphi,\infty}_A(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ via widening the original assumption $0&lt;p^-_{\varphi}\leq p^+_{\varphi}\leq1$ into the full range $0&lt;p^-_{\varphi}\leq p^+_{\varphi}&lt;\infty$, and all the results when $q\in(0,\infty)$ are new and generalized from isotropic setting to anisotropic setting.</description>

      <title>A signal recovery guarantee with Restricted Isometry Property and Null Space Property for weighted $\ell_1$ minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signal reconstruction is a crucial aspect of compressive sensing. In weighted cases, there are two common types of weights. In order to establish a unified framework for handling various types of weights, the sparse function is introduced. By employing this sparse function, a generalized form of the weighted null space property is developed, which is sufficient and necessary to exact recovery through weighted $\ell_1$ minimization. This paper will provide a new recovery guarantee called $\omega$-RIP-NSP with the weighted $\ell_1$ minimization, combining the weighted null space property and the weighted restricted isometry property. The new recovery guarantee only depends on the kernel of matrices and provides robust and stable error bounds. The third aim is to explain the relationships between $\omega$-RIP, $\omega$-RIP-NSP and $\omega$-NSP. $\omega$-RIP is obviously stronger than $\omega$-RIP-NSP by definition. We show that $\omega$-RIP-NSP is stronger than the weighted null space property by constructing a matrix that satisfies the weighted null space property but not $\omega$-RIP-NSP.</description>

      <title>On the projections of Ahlfors regular sets in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A_{1},A_{2} \subset [0,1]$ be closed Ahlfors $s_{j}$-regular sets. I prove that $$ \dim_{\mathrm{H}} \{\theta \in [0,1] : \dim_{\mathrm{H}} (A + \theta B) &lt; \min\{s_{1} + s_{2},1\}\} = 0.$$ As a corollary, $$\dim_{\mathrm{H}} (A_{1}A_{2} + A_{1}A_{2}) \geq \min\{s_{1} + s_{2},1\}. $$ I also prove the following $\delta$-discretised theorem for general Ahlfors $s$-regular sets.
  For all $C,\epsilon &gt; 0$ and $s \in [0,1]$, there exists $\kappa &gt; 0$ such that the following holds for all $\delta &gt; 0$ small enough. Let $\nu$ be a non-zero measure on $[0,1]$ satisfying $\nu(B(x,r)) \leq Cr^{\epsilon}$ for all $x \in S^{1}$ and $r &gt; 0$. Let $K \subset B(1) \subset \mathbb{R}^{2}$ be Ahlfors $s$-regular with constant at most $C$. Then, there exists a vector $\theta \in \mathrm{spt\,} \nu$ such that $$|\pi_{\theta}(F)|_{\delta} \geq \delta^{\epsilon - s}$$ for all $F \subset K$ with $|F|_{\delta} \geq \delta^{\kappa - s}$. Here $\pi_{\theta}(x,y) = x + \theta y$.</description>

      <title>Higher Order Approximation of Functions by Modified Goodman-Sharma Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we study the approximation properties of a modified Goodman-Sharma operator recently considered by Acu and Agrawal in 2019. This operator is linear but not positive. It has the advantage of a higher order of approximation of functions compared with the Goodman-Sharma operator. We prove direct and strong converse theorems in terms of a related K-functional.</description>

      <title>Autonomous second-order ODEs: a geometric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07082v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an autonomous second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE), we define a Riemannian metric on an open subset of the first-order jet bundle. A relationship is established between the solutions of the ODE and the geodesic curves with respect to the defined metric. We introduce the notion of energy foliation for autonomous ODEs, and highlight its connection to the classical energy concept. Additionally, we explore the geometry of the leaves of the foliation. Finally, the results are applied to the analysis of Lagrangian mechanical systems. In particular, we provide an autonomous Lagrangian for the damped harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Restriction of Fractional Derivatives of the Fourier Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we showed that for suitable $(\beta,p, s,\ell)$ the $\beta$-order fractional derivative with respect to the last coordinate of the Fourier transform of an $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ function is in $H^{-s}$ after restricting to a graph of a function with non-vanishing Gaussian curvature provided that the restriction of the Fourier transform of such function to the surface is in $H^{\ell}$. This is a generalization of the result in \cite{GoldStol}*{Theorem 1.12}.</description>

      <title>When Joints Meet Extremal Graph Theory: Hypergraph Joints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kruskal--Katona theorem determines the maximum number of $d$-cliques in an $n$-edge $(d-1)$-uniform hypergraph. A generalization of the theorem was proposed by Bollob\'as and Eccles, called the partial shadow problem. The problem asks to determine the maximum number of $r$-sets of vertices that contain at least $d$ edges in an $n$-edge $(d-1)$-uniform hypergraph. In our previous work, we obtained an asymptotically tight upper bound via its connection to the joints problem, a problem in incidence geometry. In a different direction, Friedgut and Kahn generalized the Kruskal--Katona theorem by determining the maximum number of copies of any fixed hypergraph in an $n$-edge hypergraph, up to a multiplicative factor.
  In this paper, using the connection to the joints problem again, we generalize our previous work to show an analogous partial shadow phenomenon for any hypergraph, generalizing Friedgut and Kahn's result. The key idea is to encode the graph-theoretic problem with new kinds of joints that we call hypergraph joints. Our main theorem is a generalization of the joints theorem that upper bounds the number of hypergraph joints, which the partial shadow phenomenon immediately follows from. In addition, with an appropriate notion of multiplicities, our theorem also generalizes a generalization of H\"older's inequality considered by Finner.</description>

      <title>Bidiagonal matrix factorisations associated with symmetric multiple orthogonal polynomials and lattice paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The central object of study in this paper are infinite banded Hessenberg matrices admitting factorisations as products of bidiagonal matrices. In the two main results of this paper, we show that these Hessenberg matrices are associated with the decomposition of $(r+1)$-fold symmetric $r$-orthogonal polynomials and are the production matrices of the generating polynomials of $r$-Dyck paths.
  Then, we use these factorisations and the recently found connection of multiple orthogonal polynomials with lattice paths and branched continued fractions to study $(r+1)$-fold symmetric $r$-orthogonal polynomials on a star-like set of the complex plane and their decomposition via multiple orthogonal polynomials on the positive real line. As an example, we give explicit formulas as terminating hypergeometric series for the Appell sequences of $(r+1)$-fold symmetric $r$-orthogonal polynomials on a star-like set and show that the densities of their orthogonality measures can be expressed via Meijer G-functions on the positive real line.</description>

Abstract: We use a deterministic construction to prove the optimality of the exponent in the Mockenhaupt-Mitsis-Bak-Seeger Fourier restriction theorem for dimension $d=1$ and parameter range $0 &lt; a,b \leq d$ and $b\leq 2a$. Previous constructions by Hambrook and {\L}aba \cite{HL2013} and Chen \cite{chen} required randomness and only covered the range $0 &lt; b \leq a \leq d=1$. We also resolve a question of Seeger \cite{seeger-private} about the Fourier restriction inequality on the sets of well-approximable numbers.</description>

      <title>Better estimates of H\"older thickness of fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dimensions of level sets of generic continuous functions and generic H\"older functions defined on a fractal $F$ encode information about the geometry, ``the thickness" of $F$. While in the continuous case this quantity is related to a reasonably tame dimension notion which is called the topological Hausdorff dimension of $F$, the H\"older case seems to be highly nontrivial. A number of earlier papers attempted to deal with this problem, carrying out investigation in the case of Hausdorff dimension and box dimension. In this paper we continue our study of the Hausdorff dimension of almost every level set of generic $1$-H\"older-$ {\alpha}$ functions, denoted by $D_{*}( {\alpha}, F)$. We substantially improve previous lower and upper bounds on $D_{*}( {\alpha}, \Delta)$, where $\Delta$ is the Sierpi\'nski triangle, achieving asymptotically equal bounds as $\alpha\to 0+$. Using a similar argument, we also give an even stronger lower bound on the generic lower box dimension of level sets. Finally, we construct a connected fractal $F$ on which there is a phase transition of $D_{*}( {\alpha}, F)$, thus providing the first example exhibiting this behavior.</description>

      <title>A generalized Legendre duality relation and Gaussian saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the barycenter problem in optimal transportation theory, Kolesnikov--Werner recently extended the notion of the Legendre duality relation for two functions to the case for multiple functions. We further generalize the duality relation and then establish the centered Gaussian saturation property for a Blaschke--Santal\'{o} type inequality associated with it. Our approach to the understanding such a generalized Legendre duality relation is based on our earlier observation that directly links Legendre duality with the inverse Brascamp--Lieb inequality. More precisely, for a large family of degenerate Brascamp--Lieb data, we prove that the centered Gaussian saturation property for the inverse Brascamp--Lieb inequality holds true when inputs are restricted to even and log-concave functions.
  As an application to convex geometry, we establish the most important case of a conjecture of Kolesnikov and Werner about the Blaschke--Santal\'{o} inequality for multiple even functions as well as multiple symmetric convex bodies. Furthermore, in the direction of information theory and optimal transportation theory, this provides an affirmative answer to another conjecture of Kolesnikov--Werner about a Talagrand type inequality for multiple even probability measures that involves the Wasserstein barycenter.</description>

      <title>Upcoming Terminology in the World of Function Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is the purpose of this article to compare various concepts of ``function spaces''. In particular we compare notions of the concept of Banach Function Spaces (in the spirit of Luxemburg-Zaanen) to the setting of solid BF-spaces as it is widely used in a number of papers in Time-Frequency Analysis or Coorbit Theory.
  More recently ball quasi-Banach function spaces come into the picture. In a way this note is a companion to the authors' article entitled ``Choosing Function Spaces in Harmonic Analysis'' (from 2015, February Fourier Talks at the Norbert Wiener Center, Vol.4) and the recent article by E.~Lorist and Z.Nieraeth, entitled ``Banach Function Spaces done right'' (Indag. Math., 2023). We restrict our attention to the Banach space case, avoiding the complications arising in the quasi-Banach case.</description>
