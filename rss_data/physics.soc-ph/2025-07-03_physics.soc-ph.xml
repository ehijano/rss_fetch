      <title>The optimal degree for maximizing rumor spreading on a ring lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ring lattice with $n$ nodes, each connected to the $2k$ nearest neighbors, has been utilized as the basis for several models of small-world networks, obtained by rewiring or adding edges to generate shortcuts. It is well-known that when a rumor process is embedded in these networks, the system exhibits a transition between localization and propagation at a finite value of the network mean degree, emphasizing the importance of incorporating shortcuts to optimize the dissemination process. We adopt a complementary approach by examining the rumor process exclusively within the context of the ring lattice. Our objective is to determine the optimal value of $k$ as a function of $n$ to maximize the dissemination of the rumor. We assume that the lattice is subdivided into three classes of agents: ignorants, spreaders, and stiflers. A spreader transmits the rumor to any of its ignorant neighbors at rate one. At the same rate, a spreader transitions to a stifler after contact with other spreaders or stiflers. The rumor model is a continuous-time Markov chain, which can be used to model the state of each node at any given time. Following an analysis of contrasting examples, and an examination of the general case through a numerical approach, we demonstrate that, even in the absence of shortcuts, the model can exhibit a behavior concerning the proportion of nodes reached by the information that is analogous to that observed in homogeneously mixed populations. This is observed provided $k=k(n)$ is of the order of $\log n$.</description>

      <title>Public perspectives on the design of fusion energy facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As fusion energy technologies approach demonstration and commercial deployment, understanding public perspectives on future fusion facilities will be critical for achieving social license, especially because fusion energy facilities, unlike large fission reactors, may be sited in closer proximity to people and communities, due to distinct regulatory frameworks. In a departure from the 'decide-announce-defend' approach typically used to site energy infrastructure, we develop a participatory design methodology for collaboratively designing fusion energy facilities with prospective host communities. We present here our findings from a participatory design workshop that brought together 22 community participants and 34 engineering students. Our analysis of the textual and visual data from this workshop shows a range of design values and decision-making criteria with 'integrity' and 'respect' ranking highest among values and 'economic benefits' and 'environmental protection/safety' ranking highest among decision-making criteria. Salient design themes that emerge across facility concepts include connecting the history and legacy of the community to the design of the facility, care for workers, transparency and access to the facility, and health and safety of the host community. Participants reported predominantly positive sentiments, expressing joy and surprise as the workshop progressed from learning about fusion to designing the hypothetical facility. Our findings suggest that carrying out participatory design in the early stages of technology development can invite and make concrete public hopes and concerns, improve understanding of, and curiosity about, an emerging technology, build toward social license, and inform context-specific development of fusion energy facilities.</description>

      <title>Source Detection in Hypergraph Epidemic Dynamics using a Higher-Order Dynamic Message Passing Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source detection is crucial for capturing the dynamics of real-world infectious diseases and informing effective containment strategies. Most existing approaches to source detection focus on conventional pairwise networks, whereas recent efforts on both mathematical modeling and analysis of contact data suggest that higher-order (e.g., group) interactions among individuals may both account for a large fraction of infection events and change our understanding of how epidemic spreading proceeds in empirical populations. In the present study, we propose a message-passing algorithm, called the HDMPN, for source detection for a stochastic susceptible-infectious dynamics on hypergraphs. By modulating the likelihood maximization method by the fraction of infectious neighbors, HDMPN aims to capture the influence of higher-order structures and do better than the conventional likelihood maximization. We numerically show that, in most cases, HDMPN outperforms benchmarks including the likelihood maximization method without modification.</description>

      <title>Defining and classifying models of groups: The social ontology of higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In complex systems research, the study of higher-order interactions has exploded in recent years. Researchers have formalized various types of group interactions, such as public goods games, biological contagion, and information broadcasting, showing how higher-order networks can capture group effects more directly than pairwise models. However, equating hyperedges-edges involving more than two agents-with groups can be misleading, as it obscures the polysemous nature of ``group interactions''. For instance, many models of higher-order interactions focus on the internal state of the hyperedge, specifying dynamical rules at the group level. These models often neglect how interactions with external groups can influence behaviors and dynamics within the group. Yet, anthropologists and philosophers remind us that external norms, factors, and forces governing intergroup behavior are essential to defining within-group dynamics. In this paper, we synthesize concepts from social ontology relevant to the emerging physics of higher-order networks. We propose a typology for classifying models of group interactions based on two perspectives. The first focuses on individuals within groups engaging in collective action, where shared agency serves as the binding force. The second adopts a group-first approach, emphasizing institutional facts that extend beyond the specific individuals involved. Building on these perspectives, we introduce four dimensions to classify models of group interactions: persistence, coupling, reducibility, and alignment. For the physics of higher-order networks, we provide a hierarchy of nested mathematical models to explore the complex properties of social groups. We highlight social interactions not yet explored in the literature on higher-order networks and propose future research avenues to foster collaboration between social ontology and the physics of complex systems.</description>

      <title>When Influence Misleads: Informational and Strategic Limits of Social Learning in Trading Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social learning is a fundamental mechanism shaping decision-making across numerous social networks, including social trading platforms. In those platforms, investors combine traditional investing with copying the behavior of others. However, the underlying factors that drive mirroring decisions and their impact on performance remain poorly understood. Using high-resolution data on trades and social interactions from a large social trading platform, we uncover a fundamental tension between popularity and performance in shaping imitation behavior. Despite having access to performance data, people overwhelmingly choose whom to mirror based on social popularity, a signal poorly correlated with actual performance. This bias, reinforced by cognitive constraints and slow-changing popularity dynamics, results in widespread underperformance. However, traders who frequently revise their mirroring choices (trading explorers) consistently outperform those who maintain more static connections. Building an accurate model of social trading based on our findings, we show that prioritizing performance over popularity in social signals dramatically improves both individual and collective outcomes in trading platforms. These findings expose the hidden inefficiencies of social learning and suggest design principles for building more effective platforms.</description>
