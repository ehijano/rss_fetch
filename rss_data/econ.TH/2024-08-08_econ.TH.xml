      <title>The Design and Price of Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sender has a privately known preference over the action chosen by a receiver. The sender would like to influence the receiver's decision by providing information, in the form of a statistical experiment or test. The technology for information production is controlled by a monopolist intermediary, who offers a menu of tests and prices to screen the sender's type, possibly including a "threat" test to punish nonparticipation. We characterize the intermediary's optimal screening menu and the associated distortions, which we show may benefit the receiver. We compare the sale of persuasive information with other forms of influence -- overt bribery and controlling access.</description>

      <title>Ignorance Is Bliss: The Screening Effect of (Noisy) Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the value of a firm's internal information when the firm faces an adverse selection problem arising from unobservable managerial abilities. While more precise information allows the firm to make ex post more efficient investment decisions, noisier information has an ex ante screening effect that allows the firm to attract on-average better managers. The trade-off between more effective screening of managers and more informed investment implies a non-monotonic relationship between firm value and information quality. A marginal improvement in information quality does not necessarily lead to an overall improvement in firm value.</description>

      <title>Robust Design of Persuasion Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02465v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze many-sender Bayesian persuasion games where receiver can contract their action on senders' choices of Blackwell experiment and realized signals. We characterize robust mechanisms: those that induce the same joint distributions of actions and senders' private types for all possible prior beliefs. These mechanisms take a simple form: they (1) incentivize maximally informative experiments, and (2) depend only on the induced posterior. We prove a grim-trigger-like principle for unilateral deviations, and show robustness is pinned down by a finite set of linear inequalities. We apply our model to allocation problems with either type-dependent outside options or allocation externalities and identify conditions where the efficient outcome is robust. Finally, we uncover a novel justification for deferred acceptance via informational incentives in two-sided matching when school preferences depend on students' unknown ability.</description>
