      <title>Odd-Cycle-Packing-treewidth: On the Maximum Independent Set problem in odd-minor-free graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the tree-decomposition-based graph parameter Odd-Cycle-Packing-treewidth (OCP-tw) as a width parameter that asks to decompose a given graph into pieces of bounded odd cycle packing number. The parameter OCP-tw is monotone under the odd-minor-relation and we provide an analogue to the celebrated Grid Theorem of Robertson and Seymour for OCP-tw. That is, we identify two infinite families of grid-like graphs whose presence as odd-minors implies large OCP-tw and prove that their absence implies bounded OCP-tw. This structural result is constructive and implies a 2^(poly(k))poly(n)-time parameterized poly(k)-approximation algorithm for OCP-tw.
  Moreover, we show that the (weighted) Maximum Independent Set problem (MIS) can be solved in polynomial time on graphs of bounded OCP-tw. Finally, we lift the concept of OCP-tw to a parameter for matrices of integer programs. To this end, we show that our strategy can be applied to efficiently solve integer programs whose matrices can be "tree-decomposed" into totally delta-modular matrices with at most two non-zero entries per row.</description>

      <title>Witness Set in Monotone Polygons: Exact and Approximate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a simple polygon $\mathscr{P}$, two points $x$ and $y$ within $\mathscr{P}$ are {\em visible} to each other if the line segment between $x$ and $y$ is contained in $\mathscr{P}$. The {\em visibility region} of a point $x$ includes all points in $\mathscr{P}$ that are visible from $x$. A point set $Q$ within a polygon $\mathscr{P}$ is said to be a \emph{witness set} for $\mathscr{P}$ if each point in $\mathscr{P}$ is visible from at most one point from $Q$. The problem of finding the largest size witness set in a given polygon was introduced by Amit et al. [Int. J. Comput. Geom. Appl. 2010]. Recently, Daescu et al. [Comput. Geom. 2019] gave a linear-time algorithm for this problem on monotone mountains. In this study, we contribute to this field by obtaining the largest witness set within both continuous and discrete models.
  In the {\sc Witness Set (WS)} problem, the input is a polygon $\mathscr{P}$, and the goal is to find a maximum-sized witness set in $\mathscr{P}$. In the {\sc Discrete Witness Set (DisWS)} problem, one is given a finite set of points $S$ alongside $\mathscr{P}$, and the task is to find a witness set $Q \subseteq S$ that maximizes $|Q|$. We investigate {\sc DisWS} in simple polygons, but consider {\sc WS} specifically for monotone polygons. Our main contribution is as follows: (1) a polynomial time algorithm for {\sc DisWS} for general polygons and (2) the discretization of the {\sc WS} problem for monotone polygons. Specifically, given a monotone polygon with $r$ reflex vertices, and a positive integer $k$ we generate a point set $Q$ with size $r^{O(k)} \cdot n$ such that $Q$ contains an witness set of size $k$ (if exists). This leads to an exact algorithm for {\sc WS} problem in monotone polygons running in time $r^{O(k)} \cdot n^{O(1)}$. We also provide a PTAS for this with running time $r^{O(1/\epsilon)} n^2$.</description>

      <title>Homomorphism Counts to Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19147v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a pair of non-isomorphic, bipartite graphs which are not distinguished by counting the number of homomorphisms to any tree. This answers a question motivated by Atserias et al. (LICS 2021). In order to establish the construction, we analyse the equivalence relations induced by counting homomorphisms to trees of diameter two and three and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for two graphs to be equivalent. We show that three is the optimal diameter for our construction.</description>
