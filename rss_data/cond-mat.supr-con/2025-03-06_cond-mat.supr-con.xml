      <title>Vortex Motion Induced Losses in Tantalum Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tantalum (Ta) based superconducting circuits have been demonstrated to enable record qubit coherence times and quality factors, motivating a careful study of the microscopic origin of the remaining losses that limit their performance. We have recently shown that the losses in Ta-based resonators are dominated by two-level systems (TLSs) at low microwave powers and millikelvin temperatures. We also observe that some devices exhibit loss that is exponentially activated at a lower temperature inconsistent with the superconducting critical temperature (Tc) of the constituent film. Specifically, dc resistivity measurements show a Tc of over 4 K, while microwave measurements of resonators fabricated from these films show losses that increase exponentially with temperature with an activation energy as low as 0.3 K. Here, we present a comparative study of the structural and thermodynamic properties of Ta-based resonators and identify vortex motion-induced loss as the source of thermally activated microwave loss. Through careful magnetoresistance and x-ray diffraction measurements, we observe that the increased loss occurs for films that are in the clean limit, where the superconducting coherence length is shorter than the mean free path. Vortex motion-induced losses are suppressed for films in the dirty limit, which show evidence of structural defects that can pin vortices. We verify this hypothesis by explicitly pinning vortices via patterning and find that we can suppress the loss by microfabrication.</description>

      <title>Pressure-driven superconductivity in the topological insulator GeBi4Te7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The van der Waals, pseudo-binary chalcogenides (ACh)m(Pn2Ch3)n (A = Ge, Mn, Pb, etc.; Pn = Sb or Bi; Ch = Te, Se) have recently been reported to host a vast landscape of topological phases of matter, including the quantum anomalous Hall state and topological axion state with quantized magnetoelectric effect. A subgroup in this series, like MnSb4Te7 and GeSb4Te7, can be driven to a superconducting state by applying a physical pressure, making them viable candidates to realize so-called topological superconductivity. However, the role of magnetic fluctuations in this pressure-induced superconductivity remains unclear. Here, we report the pressure-induced multiple superconducting phases in the nonmagnetic GeBi4Te7, accompanied by corresponding structural transitions evidenced from the high-pressure Raman scattering. In comparison with other members in this family, we find the superconducting transition temperature of the nonmagnetic subgroup is significantly higher than their magnetic homologues, possibly hinting at the detrimental role played by the magnetic fluctuations in the superconductivity formation, at least in this pseudo-binary chalcogenide family.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking induced by electronic instability in the normal state of La_{1-x} Sr_{x} NiO_{2}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking (RSB), a hallmark phenomenon in cuprates and iron-based high-temperature superconductors, originates from intricate interactions between superconducting order and competing quantum states. Understanding this mechanism is pivotal for unraveling the microscopic origin of unconventional superconductivity. Although infinite-layer nickelates (ILNs) share similar crystalline structure and the same nominal 3d-electron configurations with cuprates, they have significant differences in Fermi surface topology, electronic band characteristics, and charge order. These distinctions make ILNs an ideal platform for studying RSB in unconventional superconductors. Through angular-resolved resistivity measurements within a large temperature and doping range, we identify pronounced RSB signatures near doping concentrations x=0.05 and 0.25. Based on the strongly correlated electronic structures from combined density functional theory and dynamical mean field theory calculations, we find that the calculated electronic susceptibility has a peak structure at the corresponding doping concentration, indicating pronounced electronic instabilities which drive RSB. Our findings reveal the important role of electronic correlation and Fermi surface nesting in the emergence of RSB. Our work not only deepens the understanding of electronic behavior in ILNs, but also provides new ideas and methods for exploring RSB in other unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Geometric Asymmetry-Enhanced Nonreciprocal Supercurrent Transport Revealed by Second-Harmonic Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal transport in superconducting systems serves as a powerful probe of symmetry-breaking mechanisms, with the superconducting diode effect emerging as a key manifestation enabling cryogenic rectification. While theoretical models have extensively explored superconducting nonreciprocity, experimental verification remains challenging, as conventional transport measurements struggle to disentangle intrinsic and extrinsic contributions. Nonlinear transport analysis, particularly second-harmonic response, offers an alternative approach by providing a sensitive probe for detecting spatial inversion symmetry breaking in the presence of time-reversal symmetry violation. Here, we systematically investigate the influence of geometric symmetry on nonreciprocal transport by comparing two triangular-extended Hall bar configurations with a symmetric Hall bar control. Second-harmonic nonlinear transport measurements reveal that the triangular extension significantly enhances nonreciprocal response, exhibiting a clear dependence on the base angle of the extension. These findings establish a direct connection between mesoscopic geometry and macroscopic nonreciprocity, demonstrating how spatial symmetry and vortex dynamics govern nonlinear transport. This insight offers a guiding principle for designing superconducting rectification architectures.</description>

      <title>Revealing the electron-spin fluctuation coupling by photoemission in CaKFe4As4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-boson coupling in unconventional superconductors is one of the key parameters in understanding the superconducting pairing symmetry. Here, we report definitive photoemission evidence of electron-spin exciton coupling in the iron-based superconductor CaKFe4As4, obtained via high-resolution ARPES. Our study identifies a distinct kink structure on the {\alpha} band, observable only in the superconducting phase and closely linked with the superconductivity, indicative of strong electron-boson interactions. Notably, this kink structure corresponds to two distinct bosonic modes at 11 meV and 13 meV, aligning with spin resonance modes previously observed in inelastic neutron scattering experiments. This alignment underscores the significant role of antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the pairing mechanism of this superconductor. Furthermore, the unique momentum-dependent and orbital-selective properties of the coupling revealed by ARPES provide profound insights into the pairing symmetry, suggesting predominantly s_+- wave pairing facilitated by spin fluctuations. Our findings not only highlight the pivotal role of spin resonance in the superconductivity of CaKFe4As4 but also enhance understanding of the electron-spin exciton interactions in unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>IsoME: Streamlining High-Precision Eliashberg Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Julia package IsoME, an easy-to-use yet accurate and robust computational tool designed to calculate superconducting properties. Multiple levels of approximation are supported, ranging from the basic McMillan-Allen-Dynes formula and its machine learning-enhanced variant to Eliashberg theory including static Coulomb interactions derived from $GW$ calculations, offering a fully ab initio approach to determine superconducting properties, such as the critical superconducting temperature ($T_\text{c}$) and the superconducting gap function ($\Delta$). We validate IsoME by benchmarking it against various materials, demonstrating its versatility and performance across different theoretical levels. The findings indicate that the previously held assumption that Eliashberg theory overestimates $T_\text{c}$ is no longer valid when $\mu^*$ is appropriately adjusted to account for the finite Matsubara frequency cutoff. Furthermore, we conclude that the constant density of states (DOS) approximation remains accurate in most cases. By unifying multiple approximation schemes within a single framework, IsoME combines first-principles precision with computational efficiency, enabling seamless integration into high-throughput workflows through its $T_\text{c}$ search mode. This makes IsoME a powerful and reliable tool for advancing superconductivity research.</description>

      <title>Vestigial Order from an Excitonic Mother State in Kagome Superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alongside high-temperature charge order and superconductivity, kagome metals exhibit signatures of time-reversal symmetry breaking and nematicity which appear to depend strongly on external perturbations such as strain and magnetic fields, posing a fundamental challenge for conceptual reconciliation. We develop a theory of vestigial order descending from an excitonic mother state in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$=K,Rb,Cs), which develops around $T_* \approx 40$ K. The application of external fields stabilises a subset of the phase-melted order parameter manifold, referred to as a vestigial state, producing a symmetry-breaking response which depends on the applied probe. Our theory reproduces the observations of piezomagnetism, electric magnetic chiral anisotropy, absence of Kerr rotation, unusual elastoresistance response, and superconducting diode effect. Our proposed excitonic mother state accounts for probe-dependent symmetry breaking patterns without fine-tuning, and predicts additional signatures accessible through optical spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Kondo-like behavior in a mixed valent oxypnictide $\mathrm{La_{3}Cu_{4}P_{4}O_{2}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have synthesized and characterized the physical properties of a layered, mixed valent oxypnictide $\mathrm{La_{3}Cu_{4}P_{4}O_{2}}$ via magnetization, electrical resistivity, and specific heat measurements. Although $\mathrm{La_{3}Cu_{4}P_{4}O_{2}}$ does not exhibit superconductivity down to T = 0.5 K, it demonstrates an intriguing resistivity minimum observed at $\mathrm{T_{min}}$ = 13.7 K. Disappearance of the resistivity minimum under an applied magnetic field of $\mathrm{\mu_{0}H}$ = 9 T together with the negative magnetoresistance at low and positive at high temperatures are observed, which are typical for both Kondo-like spin-dependent scattering and 3D weak localization. We argue that the Kondo scattering is a more plausible explanation due to the low-temperature deviation from a Curie-Weiss law observed in the magnetic susceptibility, consistent with the presence of magnetic interactions between paramagnetic $\mathrm{Cu^{2+}}$ ions and Kondo screening of these $\mathrm{Cu^{2+}}$ moments. We supplemented the experimental characterization with a detailed description of chemical bonding, employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations and crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) analysis for $\mathrm{La_{3}Cu_{4}P_{4}O_{2}}$ and isostructural $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2}}$, which is a superconductor with $\mathrm{T_c = 2.2}$ K. Based on the calculations performed, we present the difference between $\mathrm{La_{3}Cu_{4}P_{4}O_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2}}$ in the character of electronic states at the Fermi level. This discrepancy impacts structural stability and may cause a lack of superconductivity in $\mathrm{La_{3}Cu_{4}P_{4}O_{2}}$ down to T = 0.5 K.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum gas microscopy with atoms in optical lattices provides remarkable insights into the real space properties of many-body systems, but does not directly reveal the nature of their fundamental excitation spectrum. Here, we demonstrate that radio-frequency spectroscopy can reveal the quasi-particle nature of doped quantum many-body systems, crucial for our understanding of, e.g., high-temperature superconductors. In particular, we showcase how the existence and energy of magnetic polaron quasi-particles in doped Fermi-Hubbard systems may be probed, revealed by hallmark peaks in the spectroscopic spectrum. In combination with fundamental dualities of the Fermi-Hubbard model, we describe how these findings may be tested using several experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Compact Superconducting Kinetic Inductance Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers with On-chip rf Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing systems and fundamental physics experiments using superconducting technologies frequently require signal amplification chains operating near the quantum limit of added noise. Both Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPAs) and traveling wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) have been used as first-stage amplifiers to enable readout chains operating within a few quanta or less of the quantum limit. These devices are also presently entering the commercial industry. However, nearly all demonstrations and existing products require bulky external microwave components for interconnection and application of requisite biases. These components -- cabling interconnects, bias tees, directional couplers, and diplexers -- increase the overall amplifier footprint, installation complexity, and reduce already limited available cryogenic volumes. Additionally, these components introduce loss and reflections which impact the measurement efficiency and readout system noise performance; thus making it more difficult to operate near the quantum limit.
  Here we present the design and validation of microfabricated bias tees and directional couplers for operating three-wave mixing kinetic inductance TWPAs (KITs). We report the performance of KITs integrated with the microfabricated rf components. Using these devices we demonstrate reduction in the amplifier installation footprint by a factor of nearly five and elimination of all external, lossy microwave components previously required to operate a KIT. Our device displays a 2.8 GHz 3 dB bandwidth with a median true gain of 17.5 dB and median system noise of 3.4 quanta. These efforts represent the first full integration of all rf components mandatory for TWPA operation on-chip. Our results mark significant progress towards the miniaturization and simplification of parametric amplifier setups and will aid in their more widespread applicability.</description>

      <title>Batch Discovery of New Metal Superhydrides via Chemical Template Theory and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metal superhydrides, known for their high hydrogen content and polyhedral hydrogen cages, are promising candidates for high-temperature superconductivity. Recent research has emphasized "chemical pre-compression," enabling hydrogen metallization at lower pressures and facilitating the discovery of superconductors with near-room temperature transitions. Despite extensive studies on binary metal superhydrides, there remains a vast, unexplored chemical space, particularly regarding non-integer hydrogen-to-metal ratios. By integrating the "chemical template effect" with machine learning algorithms, we developed a specialized structure discovery workflow that significantly enhances the efficiency of predicting stable superhydrides. Our method led to the identification of 13 new structural prototypes and 31 stable metal superhydrides, representing a 25% increase in discoveries. The 3D hydrogen clathrates in these compounds are strongly correlated with high superconducting transition temperatures, and our approach achieves a remarkable 70% increase. Most of these structures contain over 50 atoms per primitive cell, with the I4/m M10H84 prototype having the largest unit cell, containing 94 atoms. Additionally, 19 of the newly identified superhydrides exhibit superconducting transition temperatures (Tc) exceeding 100 K, highlighting the potential for higher Tc materials within the 3D hydrogen clathrate structures. The method also shows good potential to search for ternary superhydrides on a large scale.</description>

      <title>Three-band extension for the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By analogy with the Ginzburg-Landau theory of multi-band superconductors with inner (interband) Josephson couplings we formulate the three-band Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model with weak Josephson couplings between strongly asymmetrical condensates of scalar (Higgs) fields. Unlike usual single-band model, we found three Higgs bosons corresponding to three generations of particles, moreover the heaviest of them corresponds to the already discovered H-boson and decays into fermions of only the third generation through Yukawa interaction. The other two decay into fermions of the first and second generations accordingly, but they are difficult to observe due to very poor conditions for production. We found two sterile ultra-light Leggett bosons, the Bose condensates of which form the dark halos of galaxies and their clusters (i.e so called "dark matter"). The masses of the Leggett bosons are determined by the coefficient of the interband coupling and can be arbitrarily small ($\sim 10^{-20}\mathrm{eV}$) due to non-perturbativeness of the interband coupling. Since propagation of Leggett bosons is not accompanied by current, these bosons are not absorbed by gauge fields unlike the common-mode Goldstone bosons. Three coupled condensates of the scalar fields are related to the existence of three generations of leptons, where each generation interacts with the corresponding condensate getting mass. The interflavour mixing between the generations of active neutrinos and sterile right-handed neutrinos in the three-band system causes the existence of mass states of neutrino without interaction with the Higgs condensates.</description>

Abstract: This comment critically examines the claims made in arXiv papers arXiv:2501.17230 and arXiv:2502.00103, which argue that a multiplicity of polar optical phonons can generate a long-range attractive interaction via a generalized Frohlich coupling. I identify a fundamental flaw in their derivation, showing that their result relies on an unphysical assumption--specifically, neglecting the intermode Coulomb interactions between different polar optical phonons. By restoring these missing interactions I show the screened Coulomb interaction is always repulsive in the static limit.</description>

      <title>Local analysis of a single impurity on a graphene Josephson Junction</title>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the local effects of a single short-range impurity on the electron system of a short ballistic graphene Josephson Junction. Within the Dirac-Bogoliubov-De Gennes approach, we systematically analyze the local density states, whose subgap energy dependence enables us to distinguish between elastic and inelastic scattering processes and identify the magnetic nature of the impurity. Furthermore, we observe that the spatial dependence of the local density of states is a sensitive probe of the microscopic processes resulting in subgap impurity-induced bound states. The Fourier analysis evidences the wavevectors related to the momenta of the high transmissive channels in ballistic graphene.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing between topological Majorana and trivial zero modes via transport and shot noise study in an altermagnet heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the transport and shot noise properties of a one-dimensional semiconducting nanowire with Rashba spin-orbit coupling~(SOC) placed in closed proximity to a bulk $s$-wave superconductor and an altermagnet with $d$-wave symmetry. Such heterostructure with vanishing net magnetization manifests itself as an alternative route to anchor Majorana zero modes~(MZMs) characterized by appropriate topological index~(winding number $W$). Interestingly, this system also hosts accidental zero modes~(AZMs) emerged with vanishing topological index indicating their non-topological nature. Furthermore, by incorporating three terminal setup, we explore the transport and shot noise signatures of these zero modes. At zero temperature, we obtain zero bias peak (ZBP) in differential conductance to be quantized with value $|W|\times 2 e^{2}/h$ for MZMs. On the other hand, AZMs exhibit non-quantized value at zero bias. Moreover, zero temperature shot noise manifests negative~(positive) value for MZMs~(AZMs) within the bulk gap. At finite temperature, shot noise exhibits negative value~(negative to positive transition) concerning MZMs~(AZMs). Thus, the obtained signatures clearly distinguish between the MZMs and non-topological AZMs. We extend our analysis by switching on the next to nearest neighbor hopping amplitude and SOC. Our conclusion remains unaffected for this case as well. Hence, our work paves the way to differentiate between emergent MZMs and AZMs in a semiconductor/ superconductor/ altermagnet heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Phase transition on superfluid vortices in Higgs-Confinement crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to distinguish states of matter by identifying spontaneous symmetry breaking on extended objects, such as vortices, even in the absence of a bulk phase transition. As a specific example, we investigate the phase transition on superfluid vortices in the Higgs-confinement crossover using a $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{gauge} \times \mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{global}$ model. This model exhibits superfluidity of $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{global}$ symmetry and allows for a crossover between the Higgs and confinement regimes by varying the gauge coupling constant from weak to strong. We demonstrate that, on vortices, spontaneous breaking of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flavor symmetry occurs in the weak coupling (Higgs) regime, while it does not in the strong coupling (confinement) regime. We also confirm that those regimes are separated by a second-order phase transition through Monte Carlo simulations, whose universality class corresponds to the two-dimensional Ising model.</description>
